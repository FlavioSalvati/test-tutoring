The statement should be well-written, tailored to the course being applied for, and demonstrate a passion for the subject while highlighting academic accomplishments, skills, and experience. Following this, applicants must apply through UCAS by the mid-October deadline, which is a few weeks earlier than most other universities.Students may also need to sit for one or more admissions tests, such as the TSA, LNAT, STEP, MAT, PAT, TMUA, NSAA, ENGAA, HAT, or ELAT, depending on the course they are applying for. These tests are intended to assess academic potential and aptitude for the course, and usually take place in October or November, apart rom the STEP which takes place in June.If candidates meet the academic requirements, they will be invited to attend at least two interviews, which usually take place in December. The interviews will be subject-specific and will include questions related to the course selected, as well as general questions about interests and experiences.

Following this, applicants must apply through UCAS by the mid-October deadline, which is a few weeks earlier than most other universities.Students may also need to sit for one or more admissions tests, such as the TSA, LNAT, STEP, MAT, PAT, TMUA, NSAA, ENGAA, HAT, or ELAT, depending on the course they are applying for. These tests are intended to assess academic potential and aptitude for the course, and usually take place in October or November, apart rom the STEP which takes place in June.If candidates meet the academic requirements, they will be invited to attend at least two interviews, which usually take place in December. The interviews will be subject-specific and will include questions related to the course selected, as well as general questions about interests and experiences.
