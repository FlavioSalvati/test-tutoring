## Understanding the Admissions Process

### Starting with Registration

The admissions process for King's College School begins with registration, a crucial first step for candidates desiring a seat in this prestigious institution. It's recommended for parents to register their sons towards the end of Year 5 or at the beginning of Year 6. The final deadline for registration, notably for the 11+ entry in 2024, is set for 30th October 2023. During registration, an online application form needs to be filled, wherein parents can also share insights about their child's interests and achievements. It's essential to upload the student's end-of-year 5 school report as part of this process.

### Eligibility Criteria

King’s primarily accepts applications from British or Irish citizens, or those who can validate their dependent status on legal UK residents for the duration of their study at King's. It's noteworthy that the school doesn't sponsor pupils under the Child Student Visa Scheme. However, in adherence with the Equality Act 2010, the school's Admissions Policy ensures a non-discriminatory approach, welcoming applications regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, disability, or any special educational need.

### 11+ Scholarships and Bursaries

### Entrance Examinations

Sample papers for English and Mathematics are made available on the school's website starting September, aiding students in their preparation.

Those not advancing to this phase receive a communication as well, ensuring transparency in the process. Interviews are designed to be a two-way process, where the experienced staff of King’s gauge the potential of the student, and the student gets a feel of the school's environment.

### Offer and Induction

By mid-February, the school extends its offers to the selected candidates. Decisions, whether affirmative or negative, are communicated to all. Once an offer is accepted, a deposit of £2,000 secures the student's spot.
