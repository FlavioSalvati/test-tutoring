# Oxbridge interview questions

There are lots of myths and misconceptions about interviews at Oxford and Cambridge - candidates asked to throw bricks out of windows, being left in ornate rooms for hours, met with stony-eyed, intimidating professors. The reality, thankfully, is much less daunting. Interviews are a chance for tutors to simulate what’s called a “tutorial” at Oxford and a “supervision” at Cambridge- small (often 1:1) teaching sessions with professors. The interview is a chance for candidates to demonstrate passion and thinking. They won’t be expected to recite prepared, articulate, decisive answers but to demonstrate incisive, independent analysis - an ability to respond to new material and to think innovatively on the spot. We have compiled a list of subject specific questions for both Oxford and Cambridge to help students as they prepare.
