title: Safeguarding Children Policy
---

## Introduction

1.1 Beyond Tutors Limited is a for-profit organisation run by:  
Beyond Tutors Limited  
1.2 Beyond Tutors Limited is based in Cambridge.  
1.3 Beyond Tutors Limited is managed by a management team (the Team). One of the management team has particular responsibility for safeguarding children.  
1.4 The Team has adopted this Safeguarding Children Policy and expects every adult working or helping at Beyond Tutors Limited to support it and comply with it. Consequently, this policy shall apply to all staff, managers, trustees, directors, volunteers, students or anyone working on behalf of Beyond Tutors Limited.

## Purpose of the Policy


2.1 Beyond Tutors Limited (“we”/“us”/“our” etc) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal data collected in the course of our business. We are a service provider based in Cambridge.

2.2 This policy is intended to protect children and young people who receive any service from us, including those who are the children of adults who may receive services from us.  
2.3 As an organisation we believe that no child or young person should experience abuse or harm and are committed to the protection of children and young people and this policy is intended to provide guidance and overarching principles to those who represent us as volunteers or staff, to guide our approach to child protection and safeguarding. 

## The risks to children


Nearly every child grows up in a safe and happy environment and it is important not to exaggerate or overestimate the dangers. Nevertheless, there are situations where children need protection including:

1.  Exploitation
2.  Grooming
3.  Physical and emotional abuse and neglect
4.  Inappropriate supervision by staff or volunteers
5.  Bullying, cyber bullying, acts of violence and aggression within our schools and campuses
6.  Victimisation
7.  Self-harm
8.  Unsafe environments and activities
9.  Crime
10.  Sexual abuse

## Universality of Protection

We recognise that:  
  

1.  the welfare of the child is paramount
2.  all children regardless of race, gender, religious belief, disability, age, sexual orientation or identity have a right to equal protection from harm
3.  some children are more vulnerable to harm as a result of their circumstances, prior experiences, communication needs or level of dependency
4.  working with children, young people, their parents and/or guardians, carers or other agencies is essential to protecting their wellbeing

## Safeguarding of children at events/activities


There are three kinds of events/activities:  
  
5.1 Those open to adults and children of all ages,  
5.1 Those for children accompanied by a ‘parent’,  
5.3 Those for unaccompanied children, which are sometimes run alongside other events/activities.  
5.4 At events and activities open to all ages, children under 16 must be accompanied throughout by an adult over the age of 18 who not only brings the child but also takes the child home again afterwards. Young people aged 16 or 17 may attend unaccompanied if they bring the written consent and mobile telephone number of one of their parents.  
5.5 At events and activities for children accompanied by a ‘parent’, children under 16 must be supervised throughout the event by an adult over the age of 18 who not only brings the child to the event but also takes the child home again afterwards. If a lone adult brings more than one child, then the children will have to stay together, so that the one adult can supervise them. Young people aged 16 or 17 may attend unaccompanied if they bring the written consent and mobile telephone number of one of their parents.  
5.6 At events and activities for unaccompanied children, children under the age of 16 must be enrolled by a responsible adult before being left with the event leader. The enrolment must record the child’s name, age and address and the names and addresses of the child’s parents, plus the parents’ mobile telephone numbers. Young people aged 16 or 17 may attend unaccompanied if they bring the written consent and mobile telephone number of one of their parents.  
5.7 Both event and activities are to be defined broadly to include any occasions where Beyond Tutors Limited will be providing a service. 

## Disclosure and barring


6.1 Beyond Tutors Limited offers the following activities for children:

1.  Tuition
2.  Mentoring
3.  Homeschooling
4.  Advisory

6.2 Some of our activities may therefore require adult participants or adult leaders to undergo DBS and/or police checks under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. The required level of checking (if any) will broadly reflect the degree and frequency of unsupervised access given to other people’s children.  
6.3 The Team will take very seriously any allegation of impropriety on the part of any member of Beyond Tutors Limited. A member of Beyond Tutors Limited who discovers anything amiss should get in touch immediately with the following: **Mr James Mitchell**  
6.4 The Team will review the allegation and the likely risk to children and, if appropriate, will consider banning the member from future events or revoking his or her membership or both, but only in full accordance with the rules and procedures of Beyond Tutors Limited. 

## Health and safety aspects of safeguarding children


7.1 Before starting any event for unaccompanied children, the Team will carry out a risk assessment and then take steps to minimise all risks to health and safety. Parents and children will be made aware of any particular risks and of the steps to be taken to minimise those risks. The Team will keep a record of all risk assessments.  
7.2 Sufficient adults must be present at any event for unaccompanied children to enable one adult to deal with any emergency while another adult supervises the children not directly affected by the emergency. 

## Policy on the prevention of bullying


We will not tolerate the bullying of children either by adults or by other children. If any incident of child-on-child bullying should arise at a Beyond Tutors Limited event, those involved will be separated immediately and the parents of the children involved will be asked to deal with the matter. The Team will review all incidents of child-on-child bullying and assess the likely future risk to children. If appropriate, the Team will consider banning a child from future events, but only in full accordance with the rules and procedures of Beyond Tutors Limited. Allegations of adults bullying children will be dealt with under paragraph 6.3 above. 

## Photographing chidren


No photos will be taken or published of any child attending an event or activity unless prior written permission is sought from a person with parental responsibility. If any person has any concerns regarding any person taking photos at an event or activity, that person should contact Beyond Tutors Limited immediately. 

## Managing behaviour, discipline and acceptable restraint


10.1 Adults supervising children at Beyond Tutors Limited events must never use any form of corporal punishment. If physical restraint is absolutely necessary to prevent injury to any person or to prevent serious damage to property, then the minimum necessary restraint may be used — but for that purpose only.  
10.2 Unacceptable behaviour at Beyond Tutors Limited events for unaccompanied children will generally be stopped by separating the children from each other and from the group. The miscreants will be suitably supervised and will be returned as soon as possible to the care of their parents.  
10.3 Beyond Tutors Limited may apply a further disciplinary sanction; namely the banning of the child from one or more future events over the following 18 months. Any such sanction would be determined and applied by the following officer: Mr Neil Ridley.  
10.4 A parent who is aggrieved by this ban may appeal to Beyond Tutors Limited who will hear the views of all relevant persons. The decision of Beyond Tutors Limited is then final.
