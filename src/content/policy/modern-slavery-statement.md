title: Modern Slavery Statement
---

## Introduction

Beyond Tutors Limited is committed to combatting slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains, and we make this statement to assist with compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This statement relates to the financial year ending 31/10/2022. As our business has a turnover of less than £36 million, we do not have a legal obligation to produce a modern slavery statement. However:  
  

1.  We agree that exploitation within all supply chains ending in the UK is a blight on our society, and we are committed to playing our part in eliminating exploitation;
2.  We understand that customers with obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 cannot comply with those duties without our cooperation.
3.  We confirm that within our own business, no relevant offence relating to slavery or human tracking has been committed.
4.  We have made enquiries of businesses that supply directly to us and we are confident that no relevant offence is committed in that business.
5.  Insofar as it was reasonably practicable, we have examined our supply chains and confirm that we found no evidence of slavery or human trafficking.
