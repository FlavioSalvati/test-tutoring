## Initial Registration

The path to joining The Perse School in Year 7 or Year 9 commences with registration. During this stage, parents are required to upload the photo page of their child's passport and a concise description, not exceeding 500 words, detailing their hobbies and interests. Additionally, the most recent school report of the prospective student should also be uploaded. The registration process is accompanied by an online card payment for the registration fee, amounting to £175. It's essential to note that the form cannot be saved midway and must be completed in one go. Any special educational needs or disabilities should be declared during registration to ensure that the necessary adjustments can be made during the admissions process.

## International Students

The Perse School primarily functions as a day school and does not provide boarding facilities. Consequently, applications from international students are only considered if they would be residing with a parent or legal guardian within the Cambridge vicinity. Before enrolling, parents must confirm that their child possesses the correct immigration status to both reside and study in the UK. The school explicitly states that they do not sponsor students under the Child Student Visa Scheme.

## Admissions Assessment

Assessments for all pupils who have registered with The Perse School are conducted in the academic year preceding their potential entry. Importantly, no remote or overseas testing is permitted, making it mandatory for candidates to be present in person for the evaluation. These entrance assessments are holistic and involve a blend of tests, a group activity, and an informal interview with a Perse educator, where students discuss their passions and interests. A student's enthusiasm for the school's extra-curricular activities and their alignment with the institution's values play a pivotal role in the selection procedure. For those aiming for entry in September 2024, the entrance assessments are scheduled for Saturday, 13 January 2024.
