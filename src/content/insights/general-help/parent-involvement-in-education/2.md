As an Oxbridge Admissions Mentor, I understand that parents play a crucial role in their child's educational journey. Effective communication between parents and tutors can significantly enhance the tutoring experience and ensure that students achieve their academic goals. Here are some essential questions that parents should consider asking during a tutoring session. These questions are designed to foster a collaborative relationship with the tutor and to ensure that they are well-informed about their child's progress and the tutoring process.

### Questions About the Tutoring Process

1. **What is your tutoring approach?**
   - Parents should ask the tutor about their methodology and philosophy regarding tutoring. Understanding how the tutor plans to engage with the student can help parents align their expectations and see if the tutor's style matches their child's learning needs.

2. **How do you assess my child's progress?**
   - Inquiry into how the tutor measures improvement is crucial. Whether through regular quizzes, feedback sessions, or informal assessments, knowing the evaluation methods will help parents stay informed about their child’s academic development.

### Questions About Communication and Feedback

   - Tutors often have valuable insights into how parents can reinforce learning outside of sessions. Asking for specific strategies or resources can empower parents to contribute positively to their child’s education.

8. **What feedback can you give me about my child's engagement in the sessions?**
   - Understanding how actively involved the child is during tutoring can give parents insights into their child’s motivation and areas where they may need additional encouragement.

### Questions About Challenges and Support

10. **How do you handle learning difficulties or behavioral challenges?**
    - It’s essential to understand the tutor's strategies for addressing various learning difficulties or behavioral issues. This can provide reassurance to parents that their child is in capable hands.

11. **What should I do if my child is struggling?**

    - Knowing how the tutor organizes each session (e.g., time spent on different topics, types of activities) can help parents understand what their child experiences during tutoring.

13. **What can we expect from the tutoring sessions in the short and long term?**
