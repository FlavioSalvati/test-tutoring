title: "How did Albert Einstein flunk math and still end up so smart?"
summary: "Albert Einstein excelled in math and science throughout school, earning a PhD. The myth of him failing math is false. He received his teaching diploma and worked as a patent clerk, a technical role that helped him develop relativity. Einstein's success was due to his genius, passion, and education."

## How did Albert Einstein flunk math and still end up so smart?

### Introduction to the Myth

The notion that Albert Einstein flunked math is a pervasive myth. In reality, Einstein did not struggle with mathematics; rather, he excelled in his studies. This misconception has been perpetuated over the years, often used by students to rationalize their own academic difficulties.

### Academic Performance

According to the biography written by Albrecht Folsing, Albert Einstein was an all-around good student. He received exceptional grades in both math and science throughout his academic career. Notably, he earned his PhD from the University of Zurich, which further underscores his proficiency and understanding of mathematics.

There is no record of Einstein ever receiving low marks in math. In fact, he completed his teaching diploma from Zurich Polytechnic in 1900 and achieved his PhD in 1905. His doctoral dissertation focused on molecular dimensions, demonstrating his advanced mathematical capability.

### The Patent Clerk Position

Another version of the myth suggests that Einstein developed his groundbreaking theories while working as a lowly patent clerk, implying he was unqualified for a teaching position. While it is true that Einstein worked in this capacity from 1900 to 1908, it is crucial to understand the nature of his job. 

As a patent clerk, Einstein evaluated patents for the latest inventions, which required a deep understanding of cutting-edge science. His specific focus on electromagnetic inventions meant that he was grappling with complex issues related to signals, light, and time—exactly the scientific questions he would later address in his theories of relativity.

### The Recipe for Success

Einstein’s success can be attributed to a rare combination of factors: innate genius, curiosity, a passion for physics, and a solid educational background. The myth that he struggled academically is not only misleading but also underestimates the importance of education in his achievements.

In summary, the idea that Albert Einstein flunked math is a myth that has persisted perhaps because it provides a convenient excuse for students facing academic challenges. However, the truth is that Einstein's educational journey was marked by excellence, laying the groundwork for his revolutionary contributions to physics.
