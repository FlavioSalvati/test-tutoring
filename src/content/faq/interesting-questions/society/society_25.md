## Why do most international phone calls and data links go through satellites?

### Introduction

The question of whether most international phone calls and data links go through satellites or other means can be misleading. While satellites play an essential role in global telecommunications, the reality is that the majority of these communications rely on a different technology: undersea cables.

### The Role of Submarine Cables

Transoceanic submarine cables have been in use since 1858, when they were first introduced to transmit telegraph signals. Today, they comprise a vast network that underpins international telecommunications. Detailed maps of these cables can be found at websites like www.submarinecablemap.com.

Currently, approximately $99\%$ of international telecommunications traffic is carried through these undersea cables, while satellite links account for merely $1\%$. The significant preference for submarine cables is due to their ability to handle much larger volumes of data and provide more reliable connections.

### Evolution of Undersea Cables

The evolution of submarine cables has progressed through several key stages:

1. **Telegraph Cables**: The initial cables were simple metal wires designed to carry telegraph signals.
2. **Telephone Cables**: Later developments included cables capable of transmitting telephone calls.
3. **Optical Fiber Cables**: Since the 1980s, optical fiber cables have been laid across oceans. These cables transmit light signals, which are faster and have a much higher data-carrying capacity compared to metal-based signals.

### The Role of Satellites

Despite the predominance of submarine cables, satellites still play a crucial role in global telecommunications. They are particularly valuable in remote regions where landlines and undersea cables are not available. In such areas, satellites provide essential connectivity for phone calls and data transmission.

### Conclusion

In summary, while satellites are an important component of global telecommunications infrastructure, they account for a small fraction of international phone calls and data links. The overwhelming majority of this traffic is handled by submarine cables, which offer superior capacity and reliability. As technology continues to evolve, the reliance on these undersea networks is likely to remain dominant in the field of international communications.
