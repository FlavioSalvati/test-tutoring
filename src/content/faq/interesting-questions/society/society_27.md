## Why do scientists write so well?

### An Overview

The perception that scientists write exceptionally well is a common misconception. Based on personal experiences as a peer reviewer and supervisor, it's evident that many scientific manuscripts contain numerous grammatical errors, poor spelling, and formatting issues. This leads to a generalization that, on average, scientists do not excel in writing. However, there are several factors that may contribute to the appearance of well-constructed scientific writings, despite the underlying reality.

### The Reality of Scientific Writing

From my experience, the quality of scientific writing can often be underwhelming. As a peer reviewer of physics journal articles and a supervisor for student dissertations, I have frequently encountered manuscripts where the science is robust, but the language used to present it is subpar. It is not uncommon for my evaluations to highlight that, while the scientific content of a paper may be commendable, the language requires significant corrections before it can be deemed acceptable for publication. 

This observation, however, is a generalization. Some scientists are indeed skilled writers, while others struggle with the language. It may be that scientists are so engrossed in the scientific concepts they are eager to present that they inadvertently neglect the quality of their writing. After all, the primary goal of a scientific paper is to convey information effectively. If the language is lacking, it hampers the communication of even the most groundbreaking discoveries.

### Why Do Scientists Appear to Write Well?

Despite the issues highlighted, there are two main factors that can create the impression that scientists are proficient writers: peer review and the use of technical terminology.

#### Peer Review Process

The peer review process serves as a critical mechanism for maintaining the integrity of scientific literature. This process involves several stages of scrutiny to ensure that only high-quality research is published. 

1. **Initial Review by Colleagues**: Scientists typically share their drafts with collaborators or colleagues for preliminary feedback. This helps identify any misrepresentations or scientific inaccuracies before submission.

2. **Journal Review**: Once submitted to a journal, the manuscript undergoes a further review by anonymous experts in the field. These reviewers evaluate both the scientific rigor and the clarity of the writing. The feedback received often leads to substantial improvements in both content and language.

Through these layers of review, a manuscript is refined and polished, resulting in a final product that is significantly better than what the original author might have produced alone. Consequently, by the time an article reaches publication, it has usually benefitted from multiple perspectives that enhance its clarity and correctness.

#### Use of Technical Terminology

Another factor that contributes to the perceived quality of scientific writing is the appropriate use of technical terms. 

- Science is replete with specific words and acronyms that have precise definitions and are associated with complex concepts. This specialized language allows scientists to communicate intricate ideas succinctly and effectively. 

For example, instead of writing, 

$$
\text{"the laser used that effect that happens when electromagnetic waves hit the interface between two materials and excite a quantized collective oscillation of electric charge on the surface that becomes self-sustaining through self-interacting electromagnetic fields,"}
$$ 

one can simply say, 

$$
\text{"the laser used surface plasmons."}
$$ 

This concise language allows those familiar with the field to grasp complex information quickly. A scientist who has diligently studied their subject will naturally use these technical terms correctly, giving their writing an appearance of sophistication, even if they are not exceptional writers.

### Common Writing Mistakes Among Scientists

Despite their expertise in their respective fields, scientists often make common mistakes in their writing. Here are several issues to be aware of:

1. **Mixing up "than" and "then"**: Use "than" for comparisons (e.g., "the final mass was greater than the original mass"), and "then" for sequential actions (e.g., "if the solution has not converged, then perform another iteration").

2. **Mixing up "loose" and "lose"**: "Loose" describes something that is not tight, while "lose" refers to the act of forfeiting.

3. **Mixing up "farther" and "further"**: Use "farther" for physical distances and "further" for metaphorical distances.

4. **Double spacing**: Avoid placing double spaces between words.

5. **Inappropriate superlatives**: Scientific results should speak for themselves; avoid phrases like "These results are revolutionary!"

6. **Run-on sentences**: Different ideas should be expressed in separate sentences.

7. **Quotation marks for emphasis**: Use italics instead of quotation marks to emphasize a word.

8. **Using "it's" for possessive**: The correct possessive form is "its," while "it's" means "it is."

9. **Capitalization errors**: Proper names should be capitalized, even in scientific contexts, except for units, particles, and elements (e.g., "Fourier transform," "Gaussian surface," "Coulomb's law," "20 watts," "boson").

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while the writing skills of scientists may not always be exceptional, the combination of rigorous peer review and the effective use of technical terminology often leads to the perception of high-quality scientific writing. Understanding these dynamics can help clarify why scientists may appear to write well, despite the challenges they face in articulating their groundbreaking ideas.
