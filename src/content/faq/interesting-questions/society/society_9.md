## I Watched a Science Documentary and Then Came Up with My Own Theory. Where Can I Get It Published?

### Understanding the Terminology

First and foremost, it is crucial to clarify the terminology used in the scientific community. In science, a "theory" is defined as a set of mathematical equations that have been verified through experimental evidence. In contrast, the term "theory" is often used in everyday language to refer to a mere guess or speculation. Therefore, what you have likely developed after watching a science documentary is not a theory, but rather a hypothesis.

To elaborate, a **hypothesis** in scientific terms is a proposition that includes a set of mathematical equations that have not yet been tested. An authentic scientific hypothesis must include a mathematical equation that links physical properties. For instance, the statement "dogs are prettier than cats" lacks the necessary scientific rigor, as it does not encompass measurable physical properties, nor does it contain an equation. 

A proper hypothesis could be expressed mathematically, such as:

$$ w_{dog, ave} = w_{cat, ave} + 10 $$

This hypothesis indicates that the average weight of dogs is ten pounds heavier than that of cats. It is essential to note that even a valid hypothesis can be overly general and may not be particularly insightful.

### The Importance of Mathematical Formulation

Without a mathematical equation that correlates measurable properties, what you have might just be a collection of science-sounding phrases that lack actual scientific substance. For example, phrases like "the flux capacitor fluctuates mnemonically" or "graviton beams stimulate Heisenberg compensation" may be entertaining in a science fiction context, but they do not hold scientific merit.

To illustrate this point, consider how complex scientific theories are often simplified in documentaries. For instance, Einstein's theory of gravity, which can be encapsulated in a complex equation, is often described in layman's terms as "mass warps space." However, this simplification does not convey the actual mathematical theory, which is essential for a genuine scientific understanding.

### Where to Publish Your Hypothesis

Now, let's address the question of where to publish your scientific ideas. If you find yourself asking, "where can I publish?" it may indicate that your idea is not yet fully developed or robust enough for publication. Scientific ideas should extend the current body of knowledge, and to do so, one must have a comprehensive understanding of existing theories. 

For example, you cannot propose a new theory of gravity that surpasses Einstein's work without first mastering his equations and principles. Understanding the current knowledge in a field usually requires reading recent academic publications. Consequently, if you reach a stage where your hypothesis is well-formed, you will also have a clear sense of where to publish.

### Steps Toward Publication

This discussion is not meant to deter aspiring scientists but rather to encourage a more structured approach. If you believe your idea has merit, the following steps can guide you:

1. **Formulate Your Hypothesis**: Identify all physically observable properties involved in your idea (mass, speed, volume, etc.) and express these in mathematical form.

2. **Research Existing Literature**: Explore recent academic journals to check if your hypothesis has been previously considered or disproven. Local university libraries can be excellent resources for accessing these journals.

3. **Consult Textbooks**: Review college-level textbooks to ensure your idea is logically sound and adheres to established scientific principles, such as the conservation of mass-energy.

4. **Seek Feedback**: If you make progress, reach out to authors who have published similar work for their insights and feedback on your hypothesis.

5. **Consider Graduate Studies**: For a more thorough and successful path to publication, consider pursuing graduate studies in science. Graduate programs typically offer mentorship from research advisors who can guide you through the publishing process.

By following these steps, you can navigate the transition from a nascent idea to a potentially publishable scientific work. Good luck on your journey into the world of scientific inquiry!
