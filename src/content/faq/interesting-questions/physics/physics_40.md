title: "How do you make a one-photon-thick beam of light?"
summary: "A "one-photon-thick" beam of light is impossible. Photons behave like waves and cannot be lined up like particles. Wave diffraction limits beam width, making smaller wavelengths narrower. Even a beam with 1 photon/second spreads out like a conventional light beam."

## How do you make a one-photon-thick beam of light?

### Understanding the Concept of Photons

There is no such thing as a one-photon-thick beam of light. Photons are not solid little balls that can be lined up in a perfectly straight beam that is one photon wide. Instead, photons are quantum objects. This means that they exhibit properties of both waves and particles simultaneously. 

### The Wave Nature of Photons

When traveling through free space, photons predominantly behave like waves. Waves can take on a variety of beam widths, and they cannot be infinitely narrow since they are, by definition, extended objects. As you attempt to narrow the beam width of a wave, it tends to spread out as it travels due to a phenomenon known as diffraction. This principle applies not only to light waves but also to water waves and sound waves.

#### Diffraction and Wavelength

The degree to which a light beam diffracts and diverges is dependent on the wavelength of the light. Specifically, light beams with larger wavelengths diverge more strongly than those with smaller wavelengths, all else being equal. Therefore, smaller-wavelength beams can be made much narrower than larger-wavelength beams. 

The concept of the narrowness of a light beam is ultimately limited by wave diffraction, which is a function of wavelength, rather than by a physical width of photon particles. To achieve the narrowest beam of light possible, one should utilize the smallest wavelength available and focus the beam, rather than attempting to line up photons.

### The Nature of Photons as Bosons

Moreover, photons are categorized as bosons, which means that many photons can overlap in the same quantum state. This allows millions of photons to coexist at the same location in space, all traveling in the same direction and sharing identical properties such as polarization and frequency. 

In this context, the idea of a "one-photon-thick" beam of light becomes even more nonsensical. Coherent beams, such as laser beams and radar beams, consist of numerous photons, all in the same state. The number of photons in a light beam is more indicative of the beam's brightness than its width. 

### Brightness and Photon Emission

It is reasonable to discuss a beam with a brightness of 1 photon per second. This description means that a sensor receives one photon of energy from the light beam each second, which may be perceived as a very faint light source, often encountered in astronomical observations. 

Furthermore, it is possible to construct a light source that emits only one photon of light every second. However, as soon as this single photon travels into free space, it will spread out into a wave that possesses a non-zero width, behaving similarly to a coherent beam containing trillions of photons.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the notion of a one-photon-thick beam of light might initially appear intriguing, it fundamentally contradicts the wave nature of photons and the principles of quantum mechanics. The behavior of light is governed by its wave properties, and any attempt to create a beam of such limited dimension would ultimately result in a spreading wave, consistent with the behavior of light in general.
