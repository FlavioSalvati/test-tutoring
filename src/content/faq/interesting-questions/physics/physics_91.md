summary: "Common batteries push a tiny electrical current through air, but it's so weak it's usually ignored. Air isn't a perfect insulator, and even at low voltages, a small current flows due to background ionization.  Lightning, however, involves a much stronger current and relies on a different process, called arc discharge, where air becomes highly conductive."

## Why Does Lightning Push Electricity Through Air, but Common Batteries Do Not?

### Introduction

The fascinating phenomenon of lightning and the function of common batteries provide an intriguing contrast when it comes to the flow of electricity through air. While common low-voltage batteries can indeed push a small electrical current through the air, the scale and mechanisms involved are vastly different from those associated with lightning.

### The Nature of Air as an Insulator

Air is generally considered an insulator at low voltages, but this characterization is an oversimplification. At low voltages, air acts as a good insulator, yet it is not a perfect one. In fact, even common batteries can lead to a small electrical current leaking through the air, albeit at a negligible level. The complexity of air as an electrical medium is often overlooked; it does not conform to Ohm's Law in the same way that many other materials do.

### Ohm's Law and Electrical Resistance

At the heart of understanding electrical currents is Ohm's Law, expressed mathematically as:

$$
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

where:
- $ I $ is the electrical current,
- $ V $ is the voltage applied, and
- $ R $ is the resistance of the material.

Naively applying this equation to air leads to the misconception that it possesses infinite resistance since, at low voltages, it seems to carry little to no current. However, air is classified as a non-ohmic material, meaning that it does not exhibit a linear relationship between voltage and current.

### Types of Electrical Currents in Air

The behavior of electrical currents in air can be categorized into three main types, each defined by different mechanisms of ionization:

#### 1. Dark Discharge

Dark discharge occurs at low voltages before reaching air's first breakdown point. In this regime, the current is invisible and relies on background radiation or thermal collisions to free electrons from air molecules. The freed electrons then move under the influence of the electric field, forming a current. This type of current is created by common batteries sitting in air and is about a trillion times weaker than lightning.

#### 2. Glow Discharge

Once the first breakdown point of air is reached, we enter the glow discharge phase. Here, the electrical current becomes self-sustaining as the energy from the ions generated by freed electrons is sufficient to knock additional electrons free. This self-sustaining process is what powers devices like neon signs and fluorescent bulbs.

#### 3. Arc Discharge

The most dramatic and powerful form of electrical current in air is arc discharge, which occurs after reaching the second breakdown point. This is the phenomenon observed in lightning. In this case, the cathode heats up enough to eject electrons directly into the air, leading to a rapid avalanche of ionization and a huge electrical current. The process becomes a feedback loop, where the heat generated by the current causes even more current to flow until the voltage source is depleted.

### Conclusion

In summary, while common low-voltage batteries can indeed push a minuscule electrical current through air, the currents produced are weak and dependent on background ionization. In contrast, lightning represents a complex and powerful arc discharge that can sustain high currents due to the mechanisms of ionization occurring at much higher voltages. Understanding these differences illustrates the nuanced behavior of electricity in air and the various states of electrical conduction.
