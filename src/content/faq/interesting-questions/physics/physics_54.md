summary: "Nothing can travel faster than light because it's a fundamental limit of the universe.  As you approach the speed of light, space and time warp, making faster speeds impossible.  While non-local shortcuts like wormholes could make things appear to travel faster than light, nothing can locally exceed this speed."

## Is the reason that nothing can go faster than light because we have not tried hard enough?

No, the reason that nothing can go faster than light is not due to a lack of effort or experimentation. The universal speed limit, which we commonly refer to as the speed of light, is a fundamental aspect of how the universe operates. This concept can be difficult to visualize, especially if one is not well-versed in the principles of physics and relativity.

### Understanding the Nature of Space and Time

As we approach the speed of light, the equations at the core of Einstein's theories of relativity reveal some astonishing phenomena. Specifically, two key effects occur:

1. **Spatial Dimension Contraction**: As an object moves closer to the speed of light, its spatial dimension in the forward direction shrinks. This means that the distance it can traverse in the direction of travel becomes negligible.

2. **Time Dilation**: Simultaneously, the clock of the object moving at high speeds runs slower when viewed by an external observer. This means that time itself is not a constant, but rather is affected by the velocity of the observer.

In essence, space and time are not fixed backdrops; they can warp and bend under different conditions. 

### The Implications of Approaching Light Speed

When you analyze the mathematics of relativity, it becomes clear that as you near the speed of light, both your spatial dimension in the forward direction shrinks to zero and your clock essentially stops. A reference frame with these characteristics—a width of zero and no progression in time—does not exist in any meaningful way. Thus, nothing can exceed the speed of light because space and time cease to function beyond this limit. 

The concept of "speed" requires a measurable distance traveled over a certain period of time, and if both of these dimensions become undefined as one approaches the speed of light, then the very idea of speed becomes physically meaningless. To illustrate this, one might liken the phrase "faster than light" to saying "darker than black"; it simply does not hold any physical significance.

### The Weight of Evidence Supporting Relativity

One might argue that perhaps Einstein’s theories of relativity could be incorrect. However, the overwhelming body of evidence supporting these theories suggests that, if they are inaccurate, it is only in a negligible way that does not alter the fundamental principles we have discussed.

### Local versus Non-Local Speeds

It is important to note that the restriction of nothing traveling faster than light is not as constricting as it might appear. A more nuanced interpretation of this principle is that "nothing can locally travel faster than light." This means that while we cannot exceed the speed of light in a local sense, there are scenarios where effective speeds can exceed this limit when considering non-local scales.

For instance, if wormholes were to exist, one could theoretically use one to take a shortcut from Earth to the North Star. In this case, you would reach the North Star before a beam of light that traveled the standard route. However, this scenario does not involve locally exceeding the speed of light. If another beam of light also used the wormhole, it would still be impossible to outrun it. 

Additionally, there are distant celestial bodies that are receding from each other at speeds exceeding that of light. This phenomenon is permissible because it pertains to non-local speeds rather than local ones.

### Conclusion

In summary, the assertion that nothing can exceed the speed of light is not merely a result of insufficient attempts. It is a profound attribute of the universe, deeply embedded in the fabric of space and time as described by the principles of relativity.
