title: "How can it be so hard to drag rubber across smooth glass if friction is caused by surface roughness?"
summary: "Friction isn't just about surface roughness. It's mainly caused by weak electromagnetic forces between molecules, like Van der Waals forces. This explains why smooth surfaces can still experience high friction, even without rough bumps."

## Understanding Friction: The Case of Rubber on Smooth Glass

### The Nature of Friction

Friction is often perceived to be primarily a result of surface roughness; however, this is a misconception. According to the research presented in "Sliding Friction" by Bo N. J. Persson, friction arises fundamentally from weak electromagnetic forces between molecules. These can include interactions such as hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces. 

When two electrically neutral, non-polar atoms come sufficiently close together, they can induce electric dipole moments in one another. This results in an attractive force between the surfaces in contact, making it difficult to slide one object across the other.

### The Role of Surface Roughness

While surface roughness does play a role in friction, it is not the primary factor. In fact, smooth surfaces can exhibit high friction coefficients due to the significant electromagnetic interactions occurring at the molecular level. When surfaces are nanoscopically smooth, they can maintain a larger area of contact, which increases the potential for these weak electromagnetic forces to manifest.

In contrast, if the surfaces are very rough, the actual contact area may be reduced, leading to a decrease in the effective friction. However, when the roughness reaches an extreme level, it can complicate the interaction dynamics and may lead to different frictional outcomes.

### Energy Loss During Sliding

When two objects slide against each other, the motion can generate vibrations (known as phonons) in the materials involved. This energy dissipation contributes to the slowing of the sliding motion and, consequently, adds to the perception of friction. The energy lost to these vibrations means that even smooth surfaces can feel sticky or hard to drag against one another.

### Practical Example: Rubber on Glass

Consider the scenario of dragging rubber across smooth glass. Despite the glass being smooth, the strong electromagnetic attractions between the molecules of rubber and glass can lead to significant friction. The rubber, being a more complex material with various chemical structures, can create a strong interaction with the glass surface.

Moreover, the absence of lubrication, such as water or oil, means there is little to inhibit these electromagnetic interactions. When water is introduced, it acts as a lubricant that disrupts the bonding between the two materials, reducing friction and making it easier to slide rubber across the glass.

### Reducing Friction: A Twofold Approach

To reduce friction effectively, it is essential to address both surface roughness and the nature of the surfaces involved. This can be achieved by:

1. **Smoothing the Surface**: Decreasing surface roughness can reduce the contact area and, consequently, the frictional forces at play.
2. **Applying Lubricants**: Introducing substances such as oil or graphite can interfere with the chemical bonding, thus minimizing frictional forces.

By understanding these principles, we can see why dragging rubber across smooth glass can be surprisingly difficult, despite the smoothness of the surfaces involved. The interplay of electromagnetic forces, surface characteristics, and energy dissipation through vibrations culminates in a complex frictional behavior that defies simple explanations.
