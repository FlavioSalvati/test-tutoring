summary: "Color wasn't invented by humans; it's a physical property of light. Humans perceive color differently, but colors exist objectively with specific wavelengths. While human vision is limited, machines can accurately measure and describe the spectrum of any color."

## Why Was Color Invented by Humans?

### Introduction

Color, as a concept, is often misunderstood. Many might think that color was invented by humans, but in reality, color is a fundamental physical property of light that exists independent of human perception. This article aims to clarify the nature of color, its scientific basis, and how humans perceive and interpret it.

### The Nature of Color

Color is fundamentally tied to light. A standard helium-neon laser emits red light with a specific wavelength of $632.8$ nanometers. This wavelength is a physical property that does not change based on human observation. While a person might describe this red light in various ways—sharp, dull, vibrant, or even as an entirely different color if they are color blind—their perception does not alter the fact that the light emitted is consistently $632.8$ nm red.

### Human Perception vs. Physical Reality

Interestingly, it is possible for someone who is blind to measure the color of the helium-neon laser light using a machine. This blind individual may not have a conceptual understanding of what red looks like, yet they can still accurately measure the color as $632.8$ nm red. This demonstrates that color exists independently of human perception. 

Furthermore, just as humans cannot visualize infrared light, which exists beyond the visible spectrum, other intelligent beings, even those without sight, could measure and describe colors using tools. An infrared camera, for instance, allows humans to interpret infrared light as visible colors, but it does so by translating the information into a format that can be perceived.

### Types of Colors

Color can be classified into two main categories: **pure spectral colors** and **mixed colors**. 

1. **Pure Spectral Colors**: These consist of light waves with a single wavelength. For example, when white light is passed through a prism, it disperses into a spectrum of colors ranging from red to violet, each corresponding to specific wavelengths.

2. **Mixed Colors**: These are combinations of spectral colors. The exact mixture determines the resulting color. For instance, combining $10$ Watts of $700$ nm red light with $5$ Watts of $530$ nm green light and $5$ Watts of $470$ nm blue light produces a mixed color that exists independently of human naming conventions. Whether we label this color "pink", "fuchsia", or something entirely different does not change its physical properties.

### The Limitations of Human Vision

Human vision is inherently limited due to the presence of only three types of color receptors: red, green, and blue. This limitation leads to a phenomenon known as **metamerism**, where different wavelengths can produce the same color perception. For instance, the combination of red and green light appears identical to human eyes as pure yellow light, despite them being scientifically different.

In practical terms, this means that human sight is not an accurate detector of mixed colors. To truly understand a mixed color, it is essential to analyze the spectral power distribution, which details the power and wavelength of each spectral component in the mix.

### Conclusion

In summary, color was not invented by humans; it is a physical property of light that exists independently of human perception. While our understanding and interpretation of color are inherently subjective and limited, scientifically, colors are defined by their wavelengths and spectral properties. As such, the true nature of color can be measured and described accurately using scientific tools, transcending the subjective experience that we, as humans, associate with it.
