summary: "Light from a distant star spreads out and weakens, but gaps don't form between photons as they travel. While photons act like particles when detected, causing gaps in reception time and location, they act like waves while traveling through space, so no gaps exist."

## As Light from a Star Spreads Out and Weakens, Do Gaps Form Between the Photons?

The question of whether gaps form between photons as light from a star spreads out is intriguing and can be approached from different perspectives in physics. 

### Understanding Photons and Light

Light is composed of fundamental particles called photons, which exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, a phenomenon central to quantum mechanics. When we consider light traveling through space, it behaves primarily as a wave. This means that when light spreads out, it maintains its continuity without forming gaps in the physical space between photons.

### The Particle Perspective: Gaps in Reception

When observing light as a collection of particles, we can perceive that dimmer light corresponds to photons being more spread out. However, it's crucial to understand that these photons are not physically separated by gaps as they travel through space. Instead, the gaps appear during the detection process when photons are received by sensitive instruments.

For instance, a photon counter detects light one photon at a time. It does not receive light continuously; rather, it registers discrete energy bundles, separated by intervals of time. For brighter light, these intervals are shorter, while for dimmer light, such as from a distant star, the gaps are larger. In mathematical terms, if we denote the intensity of light as $I$, the average time between photon receptions $\Delta t$ can be inversely related to the intensity:

$$
\Delta t \propto \frac{1}{I}
$$

Thus, as the intensity decreases, the time intervals between detected photons increase, leading to larger gaps in time.

### The Wave Perspective: No Gaps in Propagation

From the wave perspective, light spreads out smoothly as it travels through space. When light propagates as a continuous wave, it does not develop gaps. The wave's amplitude may diminish with distance, resulting in weaker light, but the wave remains cohesive throughout its journey. This is particularly evident when light travels through free space without interruptions.

To illustrate, when a continuous beam of light is emitted, its wave oscillations are evenly distributed. The mathematical representation of a wave could be expressed as a function of time and space, such as:

$$
E(x, t) = E_0 \sin(kx - \omega t)
$$

where $E_0$ is the wave amplitude, $k$ is the wave number, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. As the light spreads, $E_0$ decreases, but the wave function does not introduce spatial gaps.

### Conclusion: Gaps Form upon Detection, Not During Travel

In summary, whether we consider light as particles or waves, the behavior changes based on the context. As light travels through space, it acts like a wave, and no gaps form. However, when light is detected, it behaves like particles, leading to identifiable gaps in the reception times and positions of the photons. Therefore, while light from a distant star does spread out and weaken, it does not create gaps in the space between photons as they travel. Instead, these gaps are a feature of the detection process itself.
