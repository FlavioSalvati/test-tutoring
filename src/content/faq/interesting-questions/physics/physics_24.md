title: "How bad would a person's injuries be if an elevator's cables snapped at the 100th floor so that the elevator fell to the bottom?"
summary: "Elevator cables rarely snap, and even if they did, automatic brakes would prevent a freefall.  These brakes are activated by excess speed, ensuring a safe, slow stop.  You'd likely only feel a slight jolt.  Complete brake failure is extremely rare and requires significant damage."

## How Bad Would a Person's Injuries Be If an Elevator's Cables Snapped at the 100th Floor?

### Introduction to Elevator Safety Mechanisms

Elevators are designed with multiple safety features to prevent catastrophic failures, such as falling from great heights. One of the most significant innovations in elevator safety is the automatic braking system, which was first introduced by Elisha Otis in 1852. The design of this system ensures that elevators do not plummet to the ground in the event of a cable failure.

### The Mechanics of Elevator Braking

In the unlikely scenario where an elevator's cables were to snap, it is essential to understand that elevators are equipped with passive, automatic brakes. These brakes are mechanical devices that engage when the elevator begins to fall faster than a designated speed. Importantly, they do not require any external power, remote control, or human intervention to function. This means that even in the event of a power outage or mechanical failure, the brakes would still engage. 

Thus, if all cables were to snap, the elevator would only fall a few feet before the brakes activate, preventing any significant drop. This minimal fall would be so slight that a person inside the elevator would likely not even perceive it as a fall; they might simply think that the elevator had experienced a minor malfunction, such as a jammed door or a hiccup in the motor. 

### What If the Brakes Also Failed?

One might ponder the consequences if not only the cables snapped but also the brakes failed. In such a scenario, the elevator would indeed fall all the way to the ground. However, for the brakes to fail completely, they would need to be physically damagedâ€”an event that would require a significant external force, such as a collision with an airplane. In this case, the danger posed by the elevator's fall would be the least of your worries, as the entire situation would indicate a catastrophic incident.

### Conclusion on Potential Injuries

To summarize, if an elevator were to experience a cable snap under normal conditions, the automatic braking system would prevent any significant fall, resulting in negligible injury risk to passengers. In the highly improbable event of both cable and brake failure, while the elevator would fall from the 100th floor, the injuries sustained would be severe, potentially life-threatening. However, it is crucial to note that such scenarios are exceedingly rare due to the multiple safety features designed to protect passengers.

Therefore, the likelihood of experiencing severe injuries from an elevator falling from the 100th floor is extremely low, as modern elevators are built with numerous safeguards to prevent such occurrences.
