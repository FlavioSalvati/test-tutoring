## Could electronic devices charge themselves without being plugged into an electricity source?

### Introduction

Yes, electronic devices can charge their batteries through various methods without being plugged into a source of electricity. What all these methods have in common is that they absorb energy in some other form—such as heat, light, vibrations, or radio waves—from the external environment and then convert this energy into electrochemical energy that is stored in the device's batteries. 

While these methods are scientifically sound and have already been successfully demonstrated, the energy captured from the outside environment is often not sufficient for practical use. Intense research is currently underway to enhance energy capture efficiency, and breakthroughs are beginning to be achieved in this area. Many phones now offer wireless charging capabilities. Below, we will explore the main types of energy that a device can utilize to charge itself without being plugged in.

### Solar Energy

The oldest energy capture method used on electronic devices is solar energy capture using solar cells. Small calculators that use solar cells for power have been around for decades. 

Solar cells (photovoltaics) absorb ordinary light and convert it directly to electricity using layers of semiconductors. While photovoltaics are well understood and commercially established, there are several drawbacks to using them for recharging handheld electronic devices. 

1. **Efficiency**: The light-to-electricity conversion process in photovoltaics is inefficient.
2. **Energy Source**: For typical lighting levels, light does not contain a large amount of energy. For traditional solar cells to provide reasonable output power, they need to be:
   - Large in size,
   - Positioned in direct sunlight for an extended period,
   - Oriented towards the sun.

None of these conditions are particularly practical for devices like cell phones, which we often carry in our pockets.

### Vibrational/Kinetic Energy

Whenever an object moves or vibrates, it possesses kinetic energy. If the object's motion is stopped in a certain way, this kinetic energy can be converted into electricity instead of being wasted as heat. 

Hybrid cars utilize this principle to regenerate electricity whenever the brakes are applied. The kinetic energy of the car, moving forward, is converted into electrical energy through a generator on the wheels, instead of being lost as waste heat in the brake pads.

For handheld devices, the most significant kinetic energy available comes from the regular bumps and jostles experienced while carrying the device. Ongoing research aims to make kinetic energy capture practical and efficient. For instance, researchers Zhong Lin Wang and Jinhui Song demonstrated the conversion of vibrational energy to electrical energy using piezoelectric nanowire arrays. 

Piezoelectric crystals have the unique property of producing a small amount of electricity when squeezed. Although the energy captured through the piezoelectric effect is typically too small to power a device, recent advances in nanoscale structures are enhancing their efficiency.

### Heat Energy

Ambient heat in the environment can also be captured and converted into electricity. The basic concept involves funneling the random thermal motion of ions or electrons into more ordered motion, which constitutes an electrical current. This funneling is often achieved by layering various materials with differing thermal and electrical properties.

For example, researchers Guoan Tai, Zihan Xu, and Jinsong Liu have demonstrated the conversion of heat to electricity using the ion layer that forms between silicon and a copper(II) chloride solution.

### Radio Waves and Electromagnetic Induction

All electromagnetic waves carry energy. Typically, the radio waves that surround us are strong enough to carry signals (such as cell phone signals) but are too weak to provide substantial power to a device. More intense radio waves can be beamed wirelessly at significant power levels to a device, a concept pioneered by Nikola Tesla in the 1890s. 

In such a scenario, ambient radio waves from natural sources (rocks, trees, stars, etc.) are not strong enough to provide power; instead, a dedicated power transmitter is needed to generate intense radio waves. This presents a drawback, as the device to be charged must be within proximity to the transmitter for efficient energy capture. However, this limitation may not be severe, as wireless signal transmitters like WIFI routers and cell phone towers are becoming increasingly common, potentially enabling infrastructure for wireless power transmission.

Radio wave and inductive charging methods are already employed in various commercial products, such as Google's Nexus 4 phone and Nokia's Lumia 920 phone.

### Conclusion

In summary, while electronic devices can indeed charge themselves without being plugged into an electricity source through methods such as solar energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, and radio waves, the practicality and efficiency of these methods are still subjects of ongoing research. As technology advances, we may see even more effective solutions for self-charging devices in the future.
