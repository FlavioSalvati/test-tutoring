## Why is the Speed of Light a Random Finite Number?

### The Nature of the Speed of Light

The speed of light in vacuum, denoted as $c$, is a universal speed limit, meaning that nothing can ever travel faster than this speed. The commonly accepted value of the speed of light is $299,792,458$ meters per second. However, this value may seem arbitrary or random. Why is that?

### Dependence on Measurement Units

The first point to understand is that the speed of light has the value of exactly $299,792,458$ m/s only when using meters to measure distance and seconds to measure time, according to the post-1983 definition of the meter. If we were to measure in different units, such as miles and hours, the speed of light would be approximately $670,616,629$ mph or about $186,282$ mi/s.

This highlights an essential fact: the numerical value that describes the speed of light is dependent on the units chosen for measurement. There is nothing inherently special about the numbers themselves; they are meaningful only within the context of the defined unit system. For instance, if we define a unit called the "opti-oddimeter" equivalent to $23,060,958 \frac{4}{13}$ meters, we could state that the speed of light is $13$ opti-oddimeters per second. This flexibility in unit definitions illustrates how the value of the speed of light can appear random based on the measurement system used.

### The Artifact of Non-Ideal Unit Systems

The seemingly random numeric value of the speed of light is an artifact of the non-ideal unit systems we use. Meters, miles, seconds, and hours were defined long before we understood the nature of light, so it is unsurprising that these values appear arbitrary when expressed in those units.

### Natural Units: A More Intuitive Approach

Can we define a unit system that aligns more closely with the fundamental nature of light? Indeed, physicists have established the natural units of particle physics, where the speed of light is defined to be exactly $1$. In this context, the speed of light becomes a more intuitive and straightforward concept: it represents the largest possible speed, akin to $100\%$. 

For example, an object traveling at $0.20$ in natural units is moving at $20\%$ the speed of light. This perspective eliminates the randomness associated with the conventional measurement of $c$.

### Practicality of Natural Units

If natural units are so beneficial, why aren't they used in everyday life? The answer lies in historical inertia and practicality. People are accustomed to existing units, and transitioning to new systems would require significant changes across various domains—road signs, packaging, and scientific measurements would all need to be revised, incurring substantial costs.

Moreover, natural units are impractical for everyday use. It is far simpler to convey speeds like $75$ mph or $120$ km/h than to express them in a format like $0.0000002502$ natural units. Scientists often use exponential notation to manage these numbers, but such expressions can be unwieldy for the general public.

### The Universal Speed Limit Explained

The existence of a universal speed limit at the speed of light stems from the fundamental nature of space and time. As an object's speed approaches $c$, time dilation occurs—time appears to slow down for the moving object—and length contraction takes place, shrinking the object's spatial dimension in the direction of motion.

When an object's speed nears the speed of light, its time dimension approaches a complete stop, while its spatial dimension shrinks toward zero. Consequently, a valid reference frame cannot travel at the speed of light, as this would lead to nonsensical conditions where space and time cease to exist.

### Beyond the Speed of Light

The notion of speeds beyond the speed of light is fundamentally flawed. Speed, defined as distance traversed in space per unit time, becomes meaningless if space and time do not exist. Thus, there is no concept of "beyond the speed of light"—it's akin to saying "colder than absolute zero" or "bigger than infinity."

### Writing Down Faster-than-Light Speeds

Interestingly, while we may write down a numerical value greater than the speed of light, this is merely a consequence of how we define speed. Traditional speed, which can be expressed as a finite number, has limitations that rapidity—a more natural definition of speed—does not. In rapidity, the universal speed limit is represented as infinity, allowing for a conceptual understanding that does not impose arbitrary constraints.

### Conclusion

In summary, the speed of light's value appears random due to our reliance on non-ideal unit systems that were established prior to our understanding of light's nature. The natural units approach eliminates this randomness, presenting a clearer picture of the speed of light as a fundamental limit of the universe. The finite nature of the universal speed limit arises from our traditional definitions of speed, whereas rapidity offers a more intuitive framework, illustrating the profound connection between speed, space, and time.
