## Do Flames Contain Plasma?

### Introduction

The question of whether flames contain plasma is intriguing and requires a nuanced understanding of both flame behavior and the definition of plasma. The answer varies depending on the temperature and the specific conditions of the flame in question.

### Defining Plasma

To address this question, we must first clarify what we mean by "plasma." A textbook definition of plasma is an ionized gas, where "ionized gas" refers to a state in which some electrons have been completely removed from the atoms. This results in freely-moving negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions. An ion is defined as an atom with an unequal number of electrons and protons.

However, simply having a few ions and electrons does not qualify a gas as a plasma. There is a threshold of ionization that must be met before the gas exhibits the collective behavior characteristic of plasmas. 

### Characteristics of Plasma

A plasma is distinguished by its ability to reflect low-frequency electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, and shield electric fields due to the collective movement of its charged particles. The collective behavior occurs because there are enough free electrons and ions that they can interact over longer ranges. The effectiveness of this shielding is quantified by the Debye length, which is the distance an external electric field can penetrate into a cloud of charged particles. 

The stricter definition of plasma states that it is an ionized gas with sufficient ionization such that the Debye length is significantly smaller than the width of the gas cloud.

### Ionization in Flames

In the context of flames, ionization occurs due to high temperatures that enable air atoms to collide with enough energy to knock electrons loose. Therefore, the degree of ionization—and thus whether a flame can be considered a plasma—depends on the flame's temperature.

- **Low-temperature flames**, such as those from a common wax candle, burn at a maximum temperature of around $1,500$ degrees Celsius. This temperature is insufficient for significant ionization, so a candle flame does not contain plasma.
- The visible colors in a candle flame (red, orange, yellow) arise from incompletely burned fuel particles known as soot, which emit light as they glow.

Conversely, **high-temperature flames**, such as those produced by burning acetylene, can reach temperatures of up to $3,100$ degrees Celsius. At this temperature, the associated Debye length can be as small as $0.01$ millimeters, indicating that such flames can indeed be classified as plasmas, provided the flame dimensions exceed the Debye length.

### Everyday Flames

Flames from common sources—like campfires, propane stoves, and cigarette lighters—have temperatures that generally lie between the extremes of candle flames and high-temperature flames. Consequently, these flames may or may not contain plasma, depending on their specific thermal conditions.

### Conclusion

In summary, whether a flame contains plasma depends on its temperature and the degree of ionization achieved. While many everyday flames do not reach the necessary conditions to be classified as plasmas, certain high-temperature flames do exhibit plasma characteristics. Understanding these distinctions is key to answering the question regarding flames and their potential to contain plasma.
