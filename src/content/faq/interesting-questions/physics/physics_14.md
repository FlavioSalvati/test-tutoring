title: "Can you make a sunset in a cup of milk?"
summary: "Create a sunset in a cup of milk by diluting milk until light shines through it as red or orange. This uses Rayleigh scattering, the same physics that causes blue skies and red sunsets.  See the blue sky effect by looking at the side of the cup."

## Can You Make a Sunset in a Cup of Milk?

### Introduction
Yes, you can create a sunset in a cup of milk! The vibrant orange and red hues observed during sunset can be replicated in your cup by understanding the underlying physics. Remarkably, the same principles that govern the colors in the sky during sunset also apply to the light scattering in a cup of milk. This phenomenon allows you to witness a miniature sunset, all without the actual sun. Let's delve into the physics and the steps needed to achieve this captivating effect.

### Understanding the Physics
The captivating colors in both the sky and your cup of milk stem from two types of light scattering: **geometric scattering** and **Rayleigh scattering**.

#### Geometric Scattering
When light encounters an object that is significantly larger than its wavelength, it scatters in a manner akin to a marble bouncing off a surface. This is known as geometric scattering. For instance, red light has a wavelength of approximately $630 \text{ nm}$, while an apple has a diameter of about $8 \text{ cm}$ (or $80,000 \text{ nm}$), which is considerably larger than the wavelength of red light. Thus, red light reflects off an apple geometrically, giving the apple its color.

In geometric scattering, the colors of light reflect at the same angle, leading to two primary effects:
1. The object retains a consistent color from different viewing angles.
2. The object's color is influenced by which colors are absorbed.

For example, a healthy maple leaf absorbs red, orange, yellow, blue, and violet light, reflecting only green light, which is why we see it as green from all angles.

#### Rayleigh Scattering
In contrast, Rayleigh scattering occurs when light interacts with particles much smaller than its wavelength (typically smaller than $100 \text{ nm}$). In this case, light scatters in all directions, and the scattered color depends on the light's wavelength rather than the object's geometry. As a result, blue and violet light scatters more than red light, creating a blue sky.

### The Role of Milk
Milk consists of tiny protein-coated oil blobs suspended in water. These blobs are small enough to generate Rayleigh scattering, allowing milk to display similar color effects as the sky. However, regular milk is so concentrated that light undergoes multiple scattering events, resulting in an overall white appearance. To observe the sunset colors, you need to dilute the milk sufficiently to allow light to scatter just once.

### How to Create a Sunset in a Cup
To create your very own sunset in a cup of milk, follow these simple steps:

1. **Prepare Your Materials**: Use a clear glass cup with a smooth surface, water, and milk.
2. **Fill the Cup**: Start by filling the cup almost to the top with water.
3. **Add Milk**: Gradually add milk to the cup, one drop at a time. After each drop, mix the contents thoroughly.
4. **Observe the Light**: Look through the cup at a bright, white light bulb. Continue adding drops of milk until the light bulb appears red or orange when viewed through the cup.
5. **Enhance the Effect**: For the best results, perform this experiment at night with all other lights off, except for the light bulb youâ€™re observing through the cup.

#### Observe the Daytime Sky
To see the blue color reminiscent of a daytime sky, position yourself so that you are viewing the side of the cup relative to the light bulb. This perspective will allow you to witness the blue hues resulting from the scattering of light.

### Conclusion
In summary, creating a sunset in a cup of milk is not only a fascinating experiment but also a beautiful illustration of the principles of light scattering. By diluting the milk and shining a light through it, you can replicate the stunning colors of a sunset and even the clear blue of a daytime sky. So, grab a cup of milk and conduct your own experiment to witness the magic of physics in action!
