## Why Does Air Friction Affect a Car's Gas Mileage?

Air friction, often referred to as drag, plays a complex role in a car's gas mileage. Understanding this phenomenon requires distinguishing between two key concepts: air friction and air turbulence.

### The Nature of Air Friction vs. Air Turbulence

Air friction is the resistance encountered when air flows over a surface. It arises from the air molecules rubbing against the surface of the car, creating a force that opposes the car's motion. However, this frictional force is relatively minor compared to the effects of air turbulence.

Air turbulence occurs when a vehicle moves through the air, causing it to stir up and create pressure differences. This stirring generates vortices and billows, which result in energy loss from the vehicle. This effect, known as wake drag, pressure drag, or form drag, significantly contributes to the reduction in fuel efficiency. In essence, while air friction is present, it is the turbulence caused by the car's movement that plays a more critical role in affecting gas mileage.

### The Impact of Design on Gas Mileage

If air friction were the primary factor in gas mileage, automakers would likely resort to applying oil to their vehicles to enhance efficiency. However, the real strategy in improving fuel economy lies in the design of the car itself. Automakers focus on creating aerodynamic shapes that minimize the turbulence around the vehicle. A streamlined design reduces the wake drag, allowing the car to move more efficiently through the air.

### The Role of Drag Coefficients

According to the textbook *Fuel Economy in Road Vehicles Powered By Spark Ignition Engines*, edited by John C. Hilliard and George S. Springer, cars are typically designed with a drag coefficient that accounts for both pressure forces and frictional stresses. For a typical vehicle with a boxy shape, the friction drag contributes approximately $0.02$ to the overall drag coefficient, which represents only about $5\%$ of the total drag coefficient. This demonstrates that while air friction does play a role, it is overshadowed by the impact of pressure drag due to turbulence.

### Conclusion

In summary, while air friction does affect a car's gas mileage, it is the air turbulence that plays a much more significant role. The design of vehicles aims to minimize the creation of turbulence, thereby reducing the energy lost to wake drag. By focusing on aerodynamic shapes rather than merely reducing friction, automakers can enhance fuel efficiency and improve gas mileage.
