summary: "Schrödinger's Cat is a thought experiment, not a real experiment. It was created to illustrate the absurdity of the idea that quantum particles only collapse into a single state when observed. The experiment shows that quantum state collapse is not driven by conscious observers but by any interaction. It highlights the "measurement problem" in quantum physics: why does a measurement collapse a quantum object from a superposition of states to a single definite state?"

## What did Schrodinger's Cat experiment prove?

### Introduction
"Schrodinger's Cat" is often discussed in the context of quantum mechanics, but it is crucial to clarify that it was not a real experiment and did not scientifically prove anything. Instead, it serves as a thought experiment devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger to illustrate the misinterpretations surrounding quantum theory. This explanation delves into the essence of the thought experiment and its implications in quantum mechanics.

### The Thought Experiment
In Schrödinger's imaginary scenario, a cat is placed in a sealed box along with a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter, and a vial of poison. The mechanism operates as follows:
- If the radioactive substance decays, the Geiger counter triggers the release of poison, resulting in the cat's death.
- If the substance does not decay, the cat remains alive.

According to quantum mechanics, the radioactive atom exists in a superposition of states—both "decayed" and "not decayed"—until it is observed. Since there is no conscious observer in the box, Schrödinger posited that the cat would simultaneously be both dead and alive, leading to an absurd conclusion that contradicts our understanding of reality.

### Purpose of the Thought Experiment
The purpose of Schrödinger's Cat was to highlight the absurdity of the interpretation that a quantum state only collapses to a definite outcome upon observation by a conscious being. Schrödinger's critique was aimed at those who suggested that the act of observation is what determines the state of a quantum system. 

### The Misinterpretation of Quantum Mechanics
The implications of this thought experiment led some scientists and popularizers to erroneously conclude that consciousness plays a role in determining physical reality. However, Schrödinger intended his thought experiment to demonstrate that such interpretations could lead to nonsensical outcomes, such as a cat being both alive and dead.

### Einstein's Response
Albert Einstein recognized the problems with the observer-driven interpretation of quantum mechanics and acknowledged Schrödinger's clever illustration. He famously remarked on the absurdity of the cat's state, questioning whether the state of the cat is only established when a physicist investigates the situation at a specific time. 

### The Reality of Quantum State Collapse
In practical terms, interactions in quantum mechanics determine state collapse. As soon as the radioactive atom interacts with the Geiger counter, it collapses from its superposition into one definite state:
- The Geiger counter either triggers, indicating the cat is dead.
- Or it does not trigger, indicating the cat is alive.

Both scenarios cannot occur simultaneously.

### The Measurement Problem
Despite the clarity provided by Schrödinger's thought experiment, a significant question remains unresolved: why does measurement cause a quantum object in a superposition to collapse into a single state? This conundrum is known as the "measurement problem" in quantum physics. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics accurately predicts this collapse, yet the underlying reasons remain a philosophical debate rather than a failure of the theory itself.

### Conclusion
In summary, Schrödinger's Cat does not prove anything about quantum mechanics; rather, it serves as a critique of an interpretation that suggests conscious observers affect reality. The thought experiment underscores that quantum state collapse is not solely dependent on observation by a conscious entity. Misinterpretations of Schrödinger's Cat continue to proliferate in popular science discussions, often leading to unfounded claims about reality and consciousness. Thus, while Schrödinger's Cat is a fascinating illustrative tool, it should not be misconstrued as evidence of the absurdities it was designed to critique.
