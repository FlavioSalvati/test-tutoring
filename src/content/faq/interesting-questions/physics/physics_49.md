title: "If I hammered and flattened a penny enough, could I cover the entire earth with it?"
summary: "Can you cover the entire Earth with a flattened penny? No, the Earth's surface is too large, and a penny's atoms spread out wouldn't bond to form a solid material. Even if you broke down the atoms, they'd be too far apart. To cover the Earth, you'd need billions of pennies!"

## If I Hammered and Flattened a Penny Enough, Could I Cover the Entire Earth with It?

### Introduction
The intriguing question of whether a hammered penny could cover the entire Earth leads us into an exploration of physics and atomic structure. The straightforward answer is **no**. If we spread out the atoms from a single penny over the Earth, they would be too far apart to form a solid material. Let's delve into the details and calculations that support this conclusion.

### Penny Composition and Atomic Count
A modern United States penny has a mass of $2.500$ grams. The composition of the penny is approximately $97.50\%$ zinc and $2.50\%$ copper. Thus, the amounts of each metal in the penny are:

- Zinc: 
$$ 
\text{Mass of zinc} = 2.500 \, g \times 0.975 = 2.4375 \, g 
$$
- Copper: 
$$ 
\text{Mass of copper} = 2.500 \, g \times 0.025 = 0.0625 \, g 
$$

Using the molar masses of zinc ($65.380 \, g/mol$) and copper ($63.546 \, g/mol$), we can calculate the number of moles of each metal:

- Moles of zinc:
$$ 
\text{Moles of zinc} = \frac{2.4375 \, g}{65.380 \, g/mol} \approx 0.037282 \, \text{mol} 
$$
- Moles of copper:
$$ 
\text{Moles of copper} = \frac{0.0625 \, g}{63.546 \, g/mol} \approx 0.00098354 \, \text{mol} 
$$

From Avogadro's number ($6.0221 \times 10^{23}$ atoms/mol), we find the total number of atoms in a penny:

- Zinc atoms:
$$ 
\text{Zinc atoms} = 0.037282 \, \text{mol} \times 6.0221 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.2452 \times 10^{22} \, \text{atoms} 
$$
- Copper atoms:
$$ 
\text{Copper atoms} = 0.00098354 \, \text{mol} \times 6.0221 \times 10^{23} \approx 5.9230 \times 10^{20} \, \text{atoms} 
$$

Thus, the total number of atoms in a penny is:
$$ 
\text{Total atoms} = 2.2452 \times 10^{22} + 5.9230 \times 10^{20} \approx 2.3044 \times 10^{22} \, \text{atoms} 
$$

### Earth's Surface Area
The surface area of the Earth is approximately:
$$ 
\text{Surface area of Earth} = 510,072,000 \, \text{km}^2 = 5.10072 \times 10^{32} \, \text{nm}^2 
$$

### Distribution of Atoms
If we were to spread the atoms of the penny uniformly across the Earth's surface, we would calculate how much area each atom would occupy:

$$ 
\text{Area per atom} = \frac{\text{Surface area of Earth}}{\text{Total atoms}} = \frac{5.10072 \times 10^{32} \, \text{nm}^2}{2.3044 \times 10^{22}} \approx 2.21347 \times 10^{10} \, \text{nm}^2 
$$

This translates to approximately $0.0000343$ square inches per atom. Though this appears small, it’s significant when considering atomic dimensions.

### Atomic Arrangement
For the purpose of our scenario, we will assume the penny's atoms are predominantly zinc. When arranged in a hexagonal grid, the distance between nearest neighbors can be calculated. Each zinc atom requires a distance of $0.26649 \, nm$ to bond effectively. In a hexagonal arrangement, this implies that the distance between the nearest zinc atoms would be:

$$ 
\text{Distance} = 1.0746 \times \sqrt{2.21347 \times 10^{10} \, \text{nm}^2} \approx 159,870 \, nm 
$$

This distance of approximately $0.16 \, mm$ is vastly greater than the bonding distance required for stable zinc atoms.

### Conclusion
Since the atoms from our flattened penny would be nearly $600,000$ times too far apart to maintain stable bonds, it follows that we cannot form a solid piece of material. Instead, we would have a very dilute gas of zinc atoms spread across the Earth. 

To summarize, if you could hammer a penny until it is a single atom thick, it would only cover approximately $1417 \, m^2$, which is about a quarter of a football field. To cover the entire Earth’s surface with one-atom-thick pennies, you would require at least $360$ billion pennies. Hence, it is evident that despite the fascinating nature of the thought experiment, the sheer scale of the Earth and the limited number of atoms in a penny make this endeavor impossible.
