title: "Why don't I feel the miles of air above me that are crushing me down?"
summary: "Air pressure doesn't crush you because it acts on all sides of your body, creating a balancing force. Your internal pressure also counteracts external air pressure. While a column of air weighs tons, its force is distributed evenly, so you don't feel it."

## Why Don't I Feel the Miles of Air Above Me That Are Crushing Me Down?

### Understanding Air Pressure

The question of why we don't feel the immense weight of the air above us can be understood through the principles of physics, particularly the behavior of fluids. Air is a fluid, and as such, it exerts pressure in all directions. This pressure is a result of the weight of air molecules being pulled down by gravity. When you consider a one-hundred kilometer column of air above you, it's easy to imagine that this weight would crush us under its force. However, the reality is more nuanced.

### The Balance of Forces

When you stand outside, the air pressure around you is approximately equal to the internal pressure within your body. This internal pressure, which is primarily due to the fluids and gases inside your body, pushes outward against your skin. In essence, the forces exerted by the air pressure outside your body and the pressure inside your body cancel each other out. This balance means that you do not feel any net force pushing you inwards or downwards.

To illustrate this, consider the following:

1. **Mass of Air Above You**: If you were to draw a one-meter by one-meter square on the ground, the air directly above that area has a total mass of about $10,000 \, \text{kg}$. Under the influence of Earth's gravity, this mass exerts a force of approximately $20,000 \, \text{lbs}$, equivalent to the weight of an empty school bus.

2. **Pressure on Your Body**: Now, if we look at a smaller area, such as a one-inch by one-inch square on your shoulder, the air above that square has a mass of about $7 \, \text{kg}$, resulting in a downward force of around $15 \, \text{lbs}$—comparable to a large bowling ball.

3. **Uniform Distribution**: Importantly, this force of $15 \, \text{lbs}$ is felt uniformly across your body. Every square inch of your body experiences the same pressure from the atmosphere.

### The Fluid Nature of Air

The reason we do not feel this force as crushing pressure is largely due to air's fluid characteristics. Air flows and exerts pressure in all directions. For instance, if you hold out your hand with the palm facing up, while the air exerts a downward force of $10$ bowling balls on your palm, it simultaneously exerts an equal upward force on the back of your hand. As a result, the net force on your hand is zero. 

Thus, even though the air pushes down on you with hundreds of pounds of force, it also pushes up on you with an equal force. This dynamic is why you do not feel crushed by the weight of the atmosphere.

### What Happens in a Vacuum?

If you were to create a vacuum around your hand—by using a strong vacuum machine that removes air from the back of your hand—you would no longer experience that canceling force. In this case, the air pressure on the palm of your hand would not be countered by a force from the back, leading to a sensation of being pulled down. This principle explains why suction cups work; they rely on the pressure difference created by removing air from one side of the cup, allowing the weight of the atmosphere to hold the cup firmly against a surface.

### Internal Body Pressure

Moreover, our body has its own internal pressure, maintained by fluids within our cells. This pressure helps to counteract external forces. Even if there were a slight imbalance between internal and external pressures, our tissues are generally strong enough to handle these forces without harm. 

In extreme cases, such as exposure to the vacuum of space, the lack of external air pressure could lead to harmful effects, but it would not cause a person to explode. The skin and muscles are usually resilient enough to withstand the difference in pressure for a limited time.

### Conclusion

In summary, the reason you do not feel the crushing weight of the air above you is due to the balance of air pressure acting on your body. The forces exerted by the atmosphere are countered by the internal pressure within you, resulting in no net force that could crush you. The fluid dynamics of air allow it to push in all directions, creating a stable environment where we can exist without feeling the immense weight of the atmosphere.
