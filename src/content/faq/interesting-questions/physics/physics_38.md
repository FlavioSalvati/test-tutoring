title: "How do tractor beams work?"
summary: "Tractor beams use solenoidal light beams to create a spiral shape that pulls objects towards the source.  Unlike traditional light, which pushes objects, solenoidal beams gain momentum when they interact with an object, pulling it in.  This technology is currently limited to microscopic objects, but research is ongoing to develop beams powerful enough to tow larger objects."

## How do tractor beams work?

Tractor beams, often found in science fiction, have recently transitioned from fantasy to reality in the realm of microscopic manipulation. Understanding how these beams function requires a grasp of the principles of light and momentum.

### The Basics of Light and Momentum

At first glance, one might assume that shooting light at an object would push it away, in accordance with the law of conservation of momentum. When light strikes an object, it imparts momentum, which tends to repel the object from the light source. However, tractor beams operate on a more nuanced principle.

Imagine if we could engineer a scenario where, upon striking the object, light gains forward momentum instead of losing it. According to the conservation of momentum, if the light gains momentum in a forward direction, the object would then lose momentum, potentially moving toward the light source.

### Creating a Tractor Beam

To achieve this effect, we need to manipulate the way light interacts with the object. The key lies in creating a special light shape that allows for this forward momentum gain. The most effective method identified thus far involves using **solenoidal light beams**. 

#### What are Solenoidal Light Beams?

A solenoidal shape can be visualized as a wire wrapped in circles to form a helix, creating a hollow cylinder. In the case of tractor beams, there are no physical wires; instead, the light itself is shaped into this hollow, spiraling form. When light is structured in this way, it can interact with microscopic objects—such as glass spheres—in a manner that effectively "pulls" them toward the light source.

### Experimental Verification

Research conducted by San-Hyuk Lee of UC Berkeley and his collaborators has experimentally verified that solenoidal light beams can indeed attract microscopic objects. This phenomenon can be likened to a screw: the spiral-shaped light beam acts like a screw that twists the object up the beam, drawing it closer to the source of light.

### Limitations and Future Prospects

Currently, the application of tractor beams has primarily been successful with microscopic objects due to the limited momentum carried by light. To tow larger objects, significantly stronger light beams would be required—so strong, in fact, that they might cause damage to the objects being manipulated. Consequently, ongoing research is focused on overcoming these challenges to expand the potential of tractor beams in practical applications.

### Conclusion

In summary, tractor beams function by creatively applying the principles of light and momentum. By using solenoidal light beams to alter the typical interaction between light and objects, we can achieve a pulling effect that defies our initial expectations. As research progresses, we may one day witness the application of tractor beams on a grander scale, transforming science fiction into science fact.
