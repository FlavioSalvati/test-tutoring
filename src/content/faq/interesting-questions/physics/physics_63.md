title: "What is the speed of dark?"
summary: "Darkness travels at the speed of light because it's the absence of light. When light is blocked, the lack of light, or darkness, appears to move at the speed of light. This means if the sun disappeared, we wouldn't see it for 8 minutes and 19 seconds, the time it takes light from the sun to reach Earth."

## What is the Speed of Dark?

### Understanding Darkness

The concept of darkness is often misunderstood. Darkness, unlike light, does not exist as an independent entity; it is fundamentally defined as the absence of light. To put it simply, when we talk about darkness, we are referring to a state where light is blocked or no longer present. 

### The Speed of Light and Darkness

When considering the speed of darkness, one can draw a fascinating conclusion: darkness travels at the speed of light. This might sound paradoxical, but it is rooted in how we perceive light and darkness. 

Imagine you are in outer space, far removed from any light sources, and you have a light bulb on your spaceship. When you turn on the light bulb, it emits light that radiates outward in all directions at the speed of light, denoted as $c$. If you momentarily turn off the light bulb and then turn it back on, there is a critical point to note: while the light spreads out again at the speed of light, there exists a region of darkness that forms in between the two spheres of light.

### The Illusion of Darkness

The darkness that appears in the interval when the light is turned off is not created; it is merely the absence of light. As the light from the bulb travels outward, the last bit of light emitted before you turned off the bulb will continue to move at the speed of light. Consequently, the boundary of darkness, which exists right after the last light reaches a certain point, must also travel at the speed of light. Therefore, we can conclude that darkness travels at the speed of light, or $c$.

### A Real-World Example

Consider the sun disappearing. The light from the sun takes approximately 8 minutes and 19 seconds to reach Earth. If the sun were to suddenly vanish, the last light emitted by the sun would still reach Earth after that same time frame of 8 minutes and 19 seconds. Consequently, the darkness that follows would also take 8 minutes and 19 seconds to reach us. Thus, we would not perceive the sunâ€™s disappearance until that period has elapsed.

### Conclusion

In summary, while darkness does not possess a speed in the traditional sense, it can be understood to "travel" at the speed of light due to the nature of light and its absence. This intriguing relationship helps to illuminate our understanding of the universe, where light and darkness coexist in a delicate balance.
