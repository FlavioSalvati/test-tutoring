title: "How do you focus regular light to make it a laser beam?"
summary: "A laser beam is not just focused light, but coherent light. Coherent light has waves that are in phase, have the same wavelength, direction, and polarization. This is achieved through stimulated emission, where an electron is excited and emits a photon that is coherent with the original photon. This process repeats, creating a coherent beam. Focusing regular light doesn't create coherence, only concentrates its energy."

## How Do You Focus Regular Light to Make It a Laser Beam?

### Introduction
A common misconception is that a laser beam is merely a focused form of regular light. However, this is not the case. A laser beam is characterized by its coherence, which is fundamentally different from the incoherence of regular light. This article will delve into the nature of laser light, coherence, and why focusing regular light does not yield a laser beam.

### The Nature of Laser Light
At its core, a laser beam is the result of **stimulated emission**, a process that generates coherent light. The term "laser" itself is an acronym for "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation." To understand how laser beams differ from regular light, we must first define coherence.

#### What is Coherence?
Coherence refers to the alignment of the wave components of light. A visualization of a light beam can be imagined as a collection of sine waves propagating through space. For a light beam to be coherent, several criteria must be satisfied:

1. **Temporal Coherence**
   - The waves must have approximately the same wavelength. For instance, if one wave has peaks spaced by $600$ nanometers and another by $830$ nanometers, their peaks cannot be aligned. Ideally, a completely monochromatic wave (same wavelength) would ensure perfect alignment of peaks. However, achieving this ideal is physically impossible, as it would require an infinitely long beam. Nonetheless, lasers can produce light that is very close to monochromatic, which is a key reason for their utility in applications like spectroscopy.

2. **Spectral Coherence**
   - The waves must be in phase. If two waves are $180^{\circ}$ out of phase, their peaks will not align. Therefore, for a coherent beam, the various wave components must have the same stable phase. This stability is crucial for measuring phase shifts when light interacts with materials, as seen in ellipsometry.

3. **Spatial Coherence**
   - The waves must be traveling in the same direction. For example, if one wave travels north and another north-east, their peaks will not align. While the common simplification states that all rays of light in a coherent beam are parallel, this is misleading. Instead, the wave components at a given point in space must be parallel, although they may diverge over distance due to diffraction.

4. **Polarization Coherence**
   - The waves must have the same polarization. If one wave oscillates vertically while another oscillates horizontally, their peaks cannot align. This coherence in polarization allows us to extract information about materials based on how they alter the polarization of light, exemplified in polarimetry.

### Why Focusing Regular Light Does Not Create a Laser Beam
Regular light sources, such as incandescent bulbs or fire, emit incoherent light. This incoherent light comprises waves of varying frequencies, phases, directions, and polarizations. Focusing this incoherent light using a lens, for instance, does not change its fundamental properties; it merely concentrates the energy into a smaller area. 

Thus, focusing regular light does not create coherence because it fails to align the waves in terms of wavelength, phase, direction, or polarization. 

### The Role of Stimulated Emission in Lasers
Stimulated emission is the mechanism through which lasers achieve their coherence. In this process, an electron in an excited state is prompted by an incoming photon to drop to a lower energy state, emitting a second photon in the process. Crucially, the newly emitted photon is coherent with the incoming photon. This chain reaction allows for a build-up of coherent light as more photons are produced, each matching the properties of the original.

### Conclusion
In summary, a laser beam is not simply a focused beam of light; it is a product of stimulated emission that results in coherent light. The coherence of laser light is defined by specific criteria: temporal, spectral, spatial, and polarization coherence. Regular light, being incoherent, cannot be transformed into a laser beam merely by focusing. The unique properties of laser light make it incredibly useful across a wide range of applications, from medical treatments to telecommunications.
