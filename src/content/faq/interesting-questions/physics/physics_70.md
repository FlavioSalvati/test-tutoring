title: "What makes the light waves in laser light parallel?"
summary: "Laser light isn't perfectly parallel due to diffraction, where waves bend around corners. While laser light is more parallel than regular light, a beam's width affects its divergence, with narrower beams spreading out faster. Only an infinitely wide beam would have perfectly parallel waves."

## What Makes the Light Waves in Laser Light Parallel?

### Overview of Laser Light and Its Characteristics

Laser light is often perceived as being more parallel than light from traditional sources, but it's essential to clarify that all laser beams diverge to some extent. This divergence is a fundamental property of light waves, and no beam can be perfectly parallel unless it is infinitely wide. 

### The Nature of Light Waves

As noted in Orazio Svelto's "Principles of Lasers," even a perfectly spatially coherent beam will spread out due to a phenomenon known as diffraction. Diffraction is a wave effect that occurs in all types of waves, including sound, water, radio, and light. It describes how waves bend around obstacles and spread out as they travel. 

When you shine a beam of light through a small aperture, the light will spread out, illustrating the concept of diffraction. If a beam of light were to maintain perfectly parallel rays, it would not spread out at all. However, since every beam of light has a finite width, we can conceptualize it as emanating from a point source, leading to some degree of divergence.

### Understanding Divergence

The divergence of a beam refers to the extent to which the rays are spreading out. The rate at which they spread depends on the wavelength of the light and the width of the beam. A narrower beam of laser light will diverge more quickly compared to a wider beam. The only instance in which a beam does not spread out is when it is infinitely wide, which is described mathematically as a plane wave.

You can observe this divergence practically by shining a laser beam onto a wall and noting how the spot becomes larger as you move the laser further away from the wall.

### The Unique Properties of Laser Light

It is crucial to understand that a laser beam does not consist of multiple rays or waves. Instead, it can be considered a singular wave, with different parts of the wave propagating in various directions. This behavior is akin to the ripples created when a rock is thrown into a pond. 

Photons, the fundamental particles of light, have the remarkable ability to occupy the same wave state, which allows for the coherence observed in laser light. The key difference between laser light and light from a conventional bulb lies not in parallelism but in the nature of their wave composition. Laser light is characterized by many photons sharing the same wave state, while the light from a regular bulb is a mixture of multiple, randomly oriented waves.

### Conclusion

In summary, while laser light can be more parallel than light from traditional sources, it is not completely parallel due to the inherent properties of light waves and diffraction. The uniqueness of laser light arises from the coherence of its photons, which allows it to maintain a more uniform wave state compared to the more chaotic light produced by standard bulbs. Understanding these concepts helps clarify the nature of laser light and its behavior in various applications.
