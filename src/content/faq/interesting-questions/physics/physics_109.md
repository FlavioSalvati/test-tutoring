title: "Why were electrons chosen to be negatively charged? Wouldn't it make more sense to call electrons positively charged because when they move they make electricity?"
summary: "Electrons were labeled negative by Benjamin Franklin based on experiments, not because they create electricity. "Electricity" encompasses all electric charge effects, not just moving charges. While electrons are charge carriers in metals, other materials like semiconductors and biological systems use different charge carriers, making a label change confusing."

## Why Were Electrons Chosen to Be Negatively Charged?

### Understanding Charge Convention

The designation of electrons as negatively charged is rooted in historical convention rather than an intrinsic property. When Benjamin Franklin conducted his experiments in the 18th century, he was exploring the nature of electric charge without the benefit of modern understanding of atomic structure. He established a system of labeling charges based on his observations and intuitions. Franklin arbitrarily assigned the terms "positive" and "negative" to the two types of charge he identified, ultimately designating electrons as negative.

### The Nature of Electricity

It is essential to clarify what we mean by "electricity." The term encompasses all phenomena related to electric charges, not just the movement of charges. For instance, "static electricity" refers to stationary electric charges, which can lead to sparks or discharges when they do move. Thus, using "electricity" to describe the movement of electrons in a conductor is a simplification. Generally, when we refer to electricity in this context, we are talking about "electric current," which is defined as the flow of electric charge.

### The Role of Charge Carriers

Electric current is not merely the sum of moving charges. It includes the net movement of these charges and the propagation of electric field disturbances associated with them. This distinction is significant because while electrons indeed have a prominent role in many conductive materials, they are not the sole charge carriers in all situations. 

For example:

- In biological systems, the charge carriers are predominantly ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which are positively charged.
- In the ionosphere, electric currents are carried by both electrons and various ionized gases, including oxygen, hydrogen, and helium.
- In a gas discharge sign, both ions and electrons contribute to the electrical current.
- Even in lightning, the charge carriers are a combination of ionized air molecules and electrons.
- In semiconductors, which are crucial for modern electronics, charge carriers include both electrons and "holes," which can be thought of as positively charged vacancies.

If we were to redefine electrons as positively charged, it would necessitate a reclassification of nearly all other charge carriers as negative. This change would lead to confusion rather than clarity, as it would complicate the existing understanding of electrical systems.

### Conclusion

The decision to label electrons as negatively charged is a historical artifact stemming from Benjamin Franklin's early experiments. Although it may seem more intuitive to classify them as positively charged because their movement generates electric currents, such a reclassification would create unnecessary complexity. In essence, the negative designation of electrons serves as a consistent framework within the broader context of electric charges, facilitating communication and understanding in the field of physics.
