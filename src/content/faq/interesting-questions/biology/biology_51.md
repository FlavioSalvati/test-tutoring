## Why Don't Our Eyeballs Fill Up with Water When We Swim?

### The Structure of the Eye

When we consider why our eyes do not fill up with water while swimming, it is essential to understand the intricate anatomy of the human eye. The eye consists of several critical components that work together to protect its internal structure and maintain its functionality.

1. **Cornea**: The front surface of the eye is covered by a strong, transparent layer known as the cornea. This structure allows light to enter the eye while acting as a barrier to external elements, including water.
   
2. **Lens**: Behind the cornea lies the lens, which is also made of transparent material. The lens, along with the cornea, plays a vital role in focusing light onto the retina.

3. **Aqueous Humor**: The space between the cornea and the lens is filled with a gel-like fluid called the aqueous humor. This fluid is essential for maintaining the eye's pressure and providing nutrients to the cornea and lens through diffusion, as these tissues lack blood vessels.

### Watertight Barrier

These layers—the cornea, lens, and aqueous humor—form a watertight barrier that effectively seals off the inner part of the eye from the outside environment. This is crucial not only for keeping water out while swimming but also for protecting the eye from dust and microorganisms that could potentially cause infection or damage.

### Optical Functionality

Moreover, this arrangement of structures is not merely for protection. The cornea and lens together function as an optical system that focuses light onto the retina at the back of the eyeball. Without these transparent layers, the world would appear as a non-distinct blur. 

### The Role of Vitreous Humor

Additionally, the inner cavity of the eye is not entirely empty; it is filled with another gel-like substance called the vitreous humor. This fluid helps maintain the shape of the eyeball, similar to how water fills a balloon to keep it inflated. The presence of the vitreous humor means that even if there were an opening to the outside, the eye would not fill with water since it is already occupied by this gel.

### Conclusion

In summary, the combination of the protective layers (cornea and lens), the gel-like fluids (aqueous humor and vitreous humor), and the structural integrity they provide ensures that our eyeballs do not fill with water when we swim. This sophisticated design not only protects our vision but also maintains the proper functioning of the eye, allowing us to enjoy the beauty of the world around us.
