title: "Why are red, yellow, and blue the primary colors in painting but computer screens use red, green, and blue?"
summary: "Computer screens use red, green, and blue as primary colors because these colors match the human eye's light-sensing cells, creating the most effective additive color system.  Painting uses cyan, magenta, and yellow, which are the opposites of red, green, and blue, creating the most effective subtractive color system.  This is why the red, yellow, and blue system taught in elementary school is less effective."

## Why Are Red, Yellow, and Blue the Primary Colors in Painting but Computer Screens Use Red, Green, and Blue?

### Understanding Color Systems

The distinction between the primary colors used in painting and those used in computer screens lies in the fundamental differences between **additive** and **subtractive** color systems.

#### Additive Color Systems

Additive color systems are based on the principle of mixing colored light. In these systems, colors are created by combining different wavelengths of light. The primary colors for additive systems are:

- **Red**
- **Green**
- **Blue**

These colors correspond to the types of cone cells in the human eye, which are sensitive to these specific wavelengths. When the light from these three colors is mixed together in varying intensities, a wide range of colors can be produced. This is the basis for how computer screens work. Each pixel on a screen contains tiny light sources that emit red, green, and blue light, and by adding these colors in different proportions, the screen can display a vast array of colors.

#### Subtractive Color Systems

In contrast, subtractive color systems work by absorbing certain wavelengths of light and reflecting others. The primary colors for subtractive systems are:

- **Cyan**
- **Magenta**
- **Yellow**

These colors are the opposites of the primary colors used in additive systems. When light hits a pigment, certain wavelengths are absorbed (subtracted) while others are reflected. For example, yellow absorbs blue light, and magenta absorbs green light, allowing only specific colors to be seen. This principle is utilized in inks, paints, and other materials where color is produced by mixing pigments.

### The Misconception of Red, Yellow, and Blue

The red-yellow-blue (RYB) color system often taught in elementary art classes is a simplified version that does not accurately represent the most effective color mixing systems. This system is an oversimplification and has historical roots. In practice, the red-yellow-blue model is less effective for color mixing than the cyan-magenta-yellow (CMY) system, which itself is more aligned with the science of color perception.

#### Why RYB Is Used in Education

The use of red, yellow, and blue as primary colors in educational contexts stems from a few key factors:

1. **Simplicity**: Teaching children about color mixing is more straightforward with just three colors.
2. **Perceptual Similarity**: Colors like cyan and blue or magenta and red can appear similar to a young child's eye, making it easier to use familiar terms.
3. **Historical Tradition**: The RYB system was historically accepted before modern understandings of vision and color theory were developed.

### Conclusion

In summary, the primary colors of light in additive systems are red, green, and blue (RGB), which align with human vision and are effective for digital displays like computer screens. In contrast, the primary colors of subtractive systems are cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY), which are more effective for mixing pigments in painting. The red-yellow-blue system, though commonly taught, is an outdated and less effective model that persists primarily for educational simplicity. 

Thus, the choice of primary colors depends significantly on whether the context involves light (additive) or pigments (subtractive).
