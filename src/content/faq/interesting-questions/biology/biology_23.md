title: "How much water can a camel store in its hump?"
summary: "Camels don't store water in their humps, but fat for energy. Their humps are positioned to stay cool in hot climates. They can drink large amounts of water quickly, up to 53 gallons in 3 minutes."

## How much water can a camel store in its hump?

### Introduction

A common misconception about camels is that they store water in their humps. This notion likely arises from their remarkable adaptability to hot and arid environments. However, the reality is quite different and fascinating.

### The Function of the Camel's Hump

Camels do not store water in their humps. Instead, their humps are designed to store energy-rich fat deposits. Many animals, including humans, use body fat as a means of energy storage. What makes camels unique is that they store this fat in a hump located on their backs rather than around their bellies or limbs. 

This adaptation serves a very specific purpose: maintaining a cooler body temperature. Fat acts as an insulator, and if it were distributed around the body, it would trap heat, forcing the camel to expend energy to cool down. By concentrating the fat in a hump, camels can stay as cool as possible while still having an energy reserve. 

To illustrate, consider a tourist from northern Siberia who arrives in the Sahara Desert wearing a heavy coat stuffed with snacks. Upon arrival, he instinctively removes the coat and slings it over his shoulder, preferring to carry the snacks without the extra heat.

### Water Consumption and Misunderstanding

Camels have several adaptations to cope with the harsh conditions of their environment. One notable ability is their capacity to go extended periods without drinking water. Furthermore, when they do drink, they can consume large quantities very rapidly. A typical camel can drink up to $200$ liters (or $53$ gallons) of water in just $3$ minutes. 

This impressive water intake may lead to the misconception that camels store water in their humps. However, the truth is that any water consumed is absorbed into the camel's digestive and circulatory systems, rather than being stored in the hump.

### Conclusion

In summary, while camels are often associated with the ability to endure long stretches without water, they do not store water in their humps. Instead, their humps serve as reservoirs for fat, which helps them maintain energy levels and regulate body temperature in extreme conditions. Understanding these adaptations helps clarify the unique biology of this remarkable desert creature.
