title: "Are gender traits completely a result of societal expectations?"
summary: "Gender traits are largely determined by biological processes, not just societal expectations.  Testosterone, present in males, influences brain development and leads to differences in behavior and thought processes. Even individuals with male genes but insensitivity to testosterone develop female traits, demonstrating the biological basis of gender."

## Are Gender Traits Completely a Result of Societal Expectations?

### The Biological Basis of Gender Traits

No, gender traits in humans are not solely a product of societal expectations; rather, they are largely determined by biophysical processes. There's a prevalent notion among certain political factions that gender traits are entirely learned and thus arbitrary. However, this perspective conflicts with scientific evidence. 

Research indicates that boys tend to gravitate towards toys like cars, while girls are more inclined to play with dolls. This behavior is not merely a result of parental influence or societal norms; instead, it is deeply rooted in biological and neurological factors. The differentiation of gender traits begins in the womb, influenced primarily by hormones, particularly testosterone.

### The Role of Chromosomes and Hormones

Humans possess different sex chromosomes: males typically have XY chromosomes, while females have XX chromosomes. During the early stages of fetal development, these sex chromosomes play a crucial role in sexual differentiation. The presence of testosterone is the key factor that differentiates a male from a female during this development. 

- **Without testosterone**: The fetus develops into a female.
- **With testosterone**: The fetus develops into a male, leading to the formation of male reproductive organs and secondary sex characteristics. 

Testosterone also impacts the developing brain, resulting in observable differences between the average male and female brain structure. For instance, male brains tend to be larger, although this does not imply a difference in intelligence. Notably, testosterone influences the brain's development, leading to a pattern of neural connections that can affect behavior; for example, females tend to develop more interconnections, which may enhance their multitasking abilities.

### Understanding Androgen Insensitivity

A fascinating case arises in the study of individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). These individuals possess XY chromosomes (male genes) but do not respond to testosterone in a typical manner. Consequently, their brains develop along female lines, resulting in traits and preferences that align with those of females, such as a preference for dolls over cars. 

This phenomenon provides compelling evidence that gender traits are influenced significantly by the response of fetal brain cells to testosterone. Most individuals with AIS are unaware of their genetic makeup until medical intervention reveals it, as their experiences and identities align with those of females. 

### The Influence of Environment and Biology

Dr. J. Imperato-McGinley, a prominent figure in endocrinology, emphasizes the critical role of androgens in shaping gender identity. His research demonstrates that exposure to testosterone in utero and during critical developmental periods has a profound impact on male gender identity—often more so than societal or cultural influences. 

For example, studies of individuals with 5α-reductase-2 deficiency reveal that when rearing conditions conflict with biological sex, the biological sex often prevails, particularly if male puberty is allowed to occur. This suggests that biological factors, particularly hormonal changes, are fundamental in determining gender identity.

### Conclusion

In summary, while societal expectations certainly play a role in shaping gender behavior and identity, the evidence strongly supports the idea that biological and hormonal processes are fundamental determinants of gender traits. Thus, gender traits cannot be fully attributed to societal influences alone, but rather are the result of a complex interplay between biology and environmental factors.
