title: "How can we unlock the 90% of our brain that we never use?"
summary: "The idea that we only use 10% of our brain is a myth.  Healthy humans utilize their entire brain, and each part plays a vital role. This myth was perpetuated to sell books on unlocking hidden potential, but the best way to protect your brain is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle."

## How can we unlock the 90% of our brain that we never use?

### Understanding the Myth

The idea that we only use 10% of our brain has been widely circulated, leading many to believe that there is a vast reservoir of untapped potential within our minds. However, this notion is not only misleading but also incorrect. As neurobiologist Dr. Eric Chudler explains, every part of the brain has a specific function and is essential for healthy human operation.

### The Role of Each Brain Region

Brain maps, which can be found in modern anatomy textbooks, illustrate that different regions of the brain are responsible for various tasks. If there were sections of the brain that were entirely unused, it would be reasonable to assume that individuals could sustain damage to those areas without experiencing any adverse effects. However, decades of medical evidence show that damage to any part of the brain can lead to significant impairments or loss of function. For instance, if $90\%$ of the brain were truly unused, then $90\%$ of brain tumors would not pose a problem. The absurdity of such a statement illustrates the fallacy of the 10% myth.

### Brain Functionality in Action

Furthermore, if we consider the claim that humans only utilize $10\%$ of their brain at any one moment, this too is incorrect. The brain operates as a highly interconnected network rather than a collection of independent modules that can be selectively activated or deactivated. Cognitive functions emerge from complex interactions among various brain regions. 

Physiologically, if $90\%$ of the brain went entirely unused, one would expect to see significant degeneration in those areas, similar to how muscles weaken when not exercised. However, brain scans of healthy individuals reveal that all areas of the brain are intact and functioning.

### The Origin of the Myth

The misconception that a large portion of our brain remains dormant has largely been propagated by authors and self-help gurus aiming to sell books on mystical methods for unlocking hidden potential. These claims lack scientific backing and mislead individuals about the true nature of brain functionality.

### Protecting Your Brain

The greater threats to brain health are conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and tumors. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes:

- Eating a balanced diet
- Engaging in regular physical activity
- Ensuring adequate rest and sleep

### Conclusion

If you truly wish to utilize your brain to its fullest potential, it is far more beneficial to focus on maintaining your overall health rather than seeking dubious methods to "unlock" hidden capacities. The key to a thriving mind lies not in uncovering unused sections of the brain, but in nurturing and protecting the intricate network that already exists. So, instead of searching for the next brain-boosting gimmick, consider putting down those books and going for a run!
