summary: "Domesticated chickens lay many unfertilized eggs due to selective breeding by humans, not natural evolution. Humans choose chickens that lay more eggs, leading to increased egg production over generations. While unfertilized eggs are wasteful, this system worked well in the wild, where mating was common."

## Why did evolution create a chicken that lays so many unfertilized eggs when that is so wasteful?

### Introduction to Chicken Egg Production

The question of why chickens lay many unfertilized eggs often leads to misunderstandings about the role of natural evolution versus human influence in the development of domesticated chickens. It is crucial to clarify that the prolific egg-laying behavior seen in modern chickens is a product of selective breeding by humans rather than a direct result of natural evolutionary processes.

### The Role of Human Engineering

Chickens that lay numerous unfertilized eggs have been created through hundreds of years of what is known as **selective breeding**, a process sometimes referred to as "human-caused evolution." In this context, the principles of evolution—namely survival of the fittest and inheritance of genetic traits—still apply. However, instead of natural environmental pressures determining which traits are advantageous, humans have taken on this role.

During selective breeding, humans choose individuals that exhibit desirable traits to serve as parents for the next generation. Over several generations, these selected individuals develop increasingly pronounced traits, such as high egg production. It is important to note that the desired traits arise not from a conscious effort by the chickens, but through random genetic mutations, most of which are either undesirable or irrelevant. The few mutations that result in desirable traits are the ones that are consistently selected for breeding.

### The Misconception of "Unnatural" Foods

Some individuals may use terms like "unnatural," "unhealthy," and "toxic" when discussing genetically modified foods. However, it is essential to understand that all agricultural products have undergone genetic alteration through selective breeding over thousands of years. For example, farmers have long selected seeds from the juiciest apples or the hens that lay the most eggs as the progenitors for future crops or flocks. This practice of genetic bioengineering through selective breeding has resulted in domesticated chickens laying significantly more eggs per year than their wild ancestors.

### Why Do Chickens Lay Unfertilized Eggs?

The question of why chickens lay unfertilized eggs can be addressed by examining the developmental process of the egg. The egg is primarily developed before fertilization occurs, and a hen cannot predict whether an egg will be fertilized. Therefore, it is necessary for the hen to produce the egg in anticipation of potential fertilization. 

In natural settings, this reproductive strategy works effectively, as mating among fowls is quite common, leading to a high rate of fertilized eggs. This reproductive behavior is an evolutionary adaptation that ensures the continuation of the species, even if it may appear wasteful in the context of domesticated chickens that are often kept in environments where fertilization is less likely to occur.

### Conclusion

In summary, the prolific egg-laying observed in modern chickens is not an outcome of evolution in the traditional sense but rather a result of human-directed selective breeding. By emphasizing certain desirable traits, such as high egg production, humans have shaped the reproductive strategies of domesticated chickens. Furthermore, the laying of unfertilized eggs is a natural part of the reproductive cycle that has evolved to maximize the chances of successful fertilization in a wild environment.
