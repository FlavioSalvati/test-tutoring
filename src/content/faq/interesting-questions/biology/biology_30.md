## What is it about a full moon that makes people do crazy things and commit crimes?

### Introduction

The idea that a full moon influences human behavior, leading to increased instances of craziness or crime, is a long-standing myth. This belief has been perpetuated through folklore, literature, and popular culture, but what does science actually say about the connection between a full moon and human actions?

### The Myth of the Full Moon's Influence

According to research, including findings published by the National Geographic News, there are no statistically significant records that correlate the full moon with spikes in criminal activity or increases in hospital admissions. This misconception may have roots in ancient mythology, notably the tales of werewolves—humans who supposedly transform into wolves during the full moon. 

This myth likely evolved from another false belief: that wolves howl at the full moon, a notion that can be traced back to the mythologies of Greek and Roman cultures. In reality, wolves howl for a variety of reasons unrelated to the lunar cycle.

### The Science of Tides and Gravity

The moon's gravitational pull is indeed strong enough to influence the Earth's tides, which are significant due to the vast volume of the oceans. However, this gravitational effect diminishes considerably when we consider smaller entities like humans. 

To illustrate this, consider the gravitational force exerted by the moon. While it can create noticeable changes in the tides—an effect that can be quantified in terms of force and mass—it is negligible when applied to the human body. For instance, if we take the mass of the Earth as $M_E \approx 5.97 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg}$ and the mass of a human being, say $M_H \approx 70 \text{ kg}$, the moon's gravitational force on an individual is vastly smaller than its effect on the oceans.

In mathematical terms, the force of gravity can be expressed using Newton's law of gravitation:

$$ 
F = G \frac{M_1 M_2}{r^2} 
$$

where:
- $F$ is the gravitational force,
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}$),
- $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of the two objects (the moon and the person, for example), and
- $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two objects.

Given the small mass of a human compared to the moon and the distance involved, the resultant gravitational force is so minuscule that it has no meaningful impact on behavior or psychological states.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the image of a full moon may evoke thoughts of madness and mischief, scientific evidence does not support any claims of its influence on human behavior. The phenomena of tides are significant due to the massive scale of the oceans, but the effect of the moon's gravity on humans is negligible. Thus, the idea that a full moon drives people to commit crimes or act irrationally is more a product of myth and culture than a reflection of reality.
