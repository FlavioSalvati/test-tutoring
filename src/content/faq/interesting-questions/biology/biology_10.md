title: "Does the human body contain minerals?"
summary: "The human body doesn't contain many minerals, as most of the molecules aren't crystalline solids. However, dietary elements are essential and some minerals like hydroxyapatite in bones are exceptions.  You can get these elements from non-mineral sources, but bone health requires calcium and phosphorus from food."

## Does the Human Body Contain Minerals?

### Introduction to Minerals and Elements

The human body does not contain minerals in the strict scientific sense. A mineral is defined as a naturally-occurring inorganic crystalline solid with a unique chemical formula. In contrast, the majority of the atoms and molecules that compose a healthy human body are neither crystalline nor solid, especially outside of bones and teeth. Thus, most of the substances that make up our bodies do not adhere to the definition of a mineral.

### The Confusion of Terminology

Misunderstandings often arise because health professionals, nutritionists, and biologists frequently misuse the term "mineral" when referring to human nutrition. In this context, they are typically referring to "dietary elements." The correct scientific terminology would be to use "trace element" instead of "trace mineral" when discussing rare atoms essential for the human body. 

To clarify this distinction:
- A **chemical element** refers to a substance that contains only one type of atom. 
- While some elements can form minerals, it is not a requirement. For instance, hydrogen ($H$) is an element but not a mineral because it lacks a crystalline structure. Conversely, quartz ($SiO_2$) is a mineral but not an element as it comprises multiple types of atoms.

### Examples to Illustrate the Differences

1. **Elements that are not minerals**:
   - Helium ($He$)
   - Oxygen ($O$)
   - Fluorine ($F$)
   - Mercury ($Hg$)
   - Sodium vapor ($Na$) in lamps
   - Molten iron ($Fe$)
   - Amorphous carbon ($C$)
   - Any isolated atom can be classified as an element.

2. **Minerals that are not elements**:
   - Table salt ($NaCl$)
   - Quartz ($SiO_2$)
   - Calcite ($CaCO_3$)
   - Hematite ($Fe_2O_3$)
   - Ice ($H_2O$)

3. **Materials that are both minerals and elements (native element minerals)**:
   - Gold ($Au$)
   - Copper ($Cu$)
   - Silver ($Ag$)
   - Iron ($Fe$)
   - Diamond ($C$)

### Dietary Elements and Their Role in the Body

When we consume table salt ($NaCl$), we intake sodium and chlorine atoms bound in a solid crystal structure, which classifies it as a mineral. However, once the salt dissolves in saliva, the sodium and chlorine ions separate, and we are left with elemental ions in solution. Thus, while we can ingest minerals, they do not remain minerals once consumed.

Moreover, it is important to note that dietary elements can also be obtained from non-mineral sources. For example, milk is not a mineral, yet it provides dietary sodium. In reality, we derive most of our dietary elements from non-mineral foods, with table salt being one of the few minerals we regularly consume.

### The Exception: Bone Minerals

One notable exception to the general rule is the mineral found in bones and teeth. The mineral primarily present in our bones is hydroxyapatite, which has the chemical formula:

$$
\text{Ca}_5(\text{PO}_4)_3(\text{OH})
$$

This substance qualifies as a genuine mineral because it is an inorganic crystalline solid with a specific chemical formula. Our bodies synthesize bone mineral internally, meaning we do not need to consume hydroxyapatite crystals directly. However, we must obtain adequate calcium, phosphorus, oxygen, and hydrogen from our diet to support the formation of bone mineral. Typically, we have abundant access to hydrogen and oxygen through water and air, but sufficient calcium and phosphorus must be ingested from food sources.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the human body does not contain minerals in the traditional sense, it does require various dietary elements to function properly. The confusion surrounding the terminology often leads to misconceptions, but understanding the distinction between minerals and elements is crucial for clarity in discussions about human nutrition and health.
