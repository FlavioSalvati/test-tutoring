summary: "Humans haven't evolved to be taller in the last 300 years.  The increase in average height is attributed to improved nutrition and health, not biological evolution, which takes much longer.  While some countries have seen a noticeable height gain, the overall change has been small, with variations in individual height far exceeding the average change over time."

## Why have humans evolved to be taller over the last three hundred years?

### Introduction

The question of whether humans have evolved to be taller over the past three hundred years is intriguing but can be misleading. While it is true that the average height of individuals in various countries has increased during this time, attributing this change to evolutionary processes is not accurate. Let’s delve deeper into the factors that contribute to changes in human height.

### Evolution and Height

It is essential to understand that evolution operates over much longer time scales than just a few hundred years. The human lifespan is approximately $100$ years, meaning that significant evolutionary changes require thousands to millions of years. Therefore, the increase in average height observed over the last few centuries is not a result of biological evolution. Instead, the changes in height are more likely linked to improvements in nutrition and overall health.

### Historical Context

To illustrate this point, let’s examine the historical data regarding height changes in the United States. According to the book *Height, Health, and History*, the average adult male height in the U.S. has not followed a consistent trend over the last three hundred years. 

- **1710 to 1830**: Average height remained around $173 \, \text{cm}$.
- **1830 to 1890**: Average height dropped to $169 \, \text{cm}$.
- **1890 to 1930**: Average height increased again to $176 \, \text{cm}$.

Interestingly, the current average height of adult American men is still $176 \, \text{cm}$. This indicates that the changes in height have not been smooth or continuous; instead, they reflect various social and economic factors.

### Nutritional and Health Improvements

The most plausible explanation for the increase in height is the improvement in nutrition and health standards. As western civilizations transitioned into modernity, advancements in technology and agriculture led to a more reliable supply of nutritious food. The correlation between improved health and height is significant; a person’s genetic potential for height can only be realized with adequate nutrition and health conditions.

### Comparison with European Countries

In contrast to the U.S., European nations have seen a more consistent increase in average height. For example, countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway have experienced a rise in average male height from about $167 \, \text{cm}$ in $1870$ to approximately $181 \, \text{cm}$ today. Similarly, Italy and France have seen increases from about $164 \, \text{cm}$ to $176 \, \text{cm}$ over the same period. This reveals that while the average height has indeed increased in these regions, the overall gain is still modest—approximately $13 \, \text{cm}$, which is about the width of two tennis balls.

### Relative Changes in Height

One key takeaway from the height data is that the variation in height among individuals at any given time is significantly greater than the change in average height over centuries. For instance, in a reasonably sized sample of adult males, the height variation might span $20$ to $30 \, \text{cm}$. In contrast, the average height change in the U.S. over the last three hundred years is only about $3 \, \text{cm}$. 

This means that if you were to travel back to the $1700$s, the differences in height you would observe among individuals would be more pronounced than the small increase in average height.

### Conclusion

In summary, the increase in average height over the past few hundred years cannot be attributed to evolutionary changes. Instead, it is primarily linked to improvements in nutrition and health, which have varied by region and time. While there has been a general trend of increasing height in both the U.S. and several European countries, the overall changes have been relatively small, and individual height variation remains considerably larger than these average changes. Thus, humans have not evolved to be taller in the traditional sense but have benefited from better living conditions and health standards over time.
