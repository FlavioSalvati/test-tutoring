title: "Do Kirlian photographs show the soul of an organism?"
summary: "Kirlian photography does not capture the soul of an organism. It shows the light emitted by electrified air surrounding an object, a phenomenon called corona discharge. This mundane effect is similar to neon signs and lightning, and is influenced by the object's conductivity and shape, not its "soul.""

## Do Kirlian photographs show the soul of an organism?

### Introduction

Kirlian photography has often been associated with mystical interpretations, particularly the notion that it reveals the soul or aura of an organism. However, a closer examination of the underlying physics reveals a more straightforward explanation.

### The Nature of Kirlian Photography

Kirlian photographs are produced when an object is subjected to an electrical charge. This process creates light emissions from the electrified air surrounding the object. The light patterns captured in these photographs have been misinterpreted by some as representations of an organism's soul, aura, or metaphysical energy field. In reality, the phenomenon is rooted in fundamental physics.

### Understanding the Process

When an electric charge travels through air, it can detach electrons from air molecules and energize them. As these electrons recombine with the molecules, they emit energy in the form of light. For lower to medium levels of electricity, this process is known as **gas discharge**, which is the same principle that operates in devices like neon signs and fluorescent bulbs. In contrast, higher levels of electricity lead to a more violent phenomenon called **arcing**, seen in lightning, spark plugs, and arc welders.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Gas Discharge**: This occurs at lower electrical currents and is responsible for the glowing effect in various illumination devices.
2. **Arcing**: This is a more intense electrical discharge that produces bright flashes of light.

### The Role of Corona Discharge

In open air, the gas discharge manifests as **corona discharge**. When an object is charged, the electric charge leaks into the surrounding air, causing it to become electrified and glow. The brightness and pattern of this glow depend on:
- The **electrical conductivity** of the object
- The **shape** of the object
- The **composition and state** of the surrounding air

This means that the light patterns do not reflect the biological or emotional state of the object but are purely electrical phenomena.

### Misinterpretations and Experiments

One famous experiment involving Kirlian photography is the "torn leaf" experiment. In this test, a leaf is electrified while resting on a glass plate, and its corona discharge is photographed. When the tip of the leaf is removed and the leaf is electrified again, the resulting photograph shows the outline of the entire leaf, including the missing tip. This has led some to incorrectly conclude that the soul of the leaf tip remains present.

However, this interpretation has been debunked. The apparent glow at the location of the missing tip is due to moisture residue left on the glass plate. When the plate is cleaned or a new plate is used, the glow corresponding to the missing tip disappears, demonstrating that the initial result was a misinterpretation rather than evidence of a soul.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Kirlian photographs do not show the soul of an organism. Instead, they capture the light emitted from the electrical interaction between an object and the surrounding air. This phenomenon is fundamentally rooted in physics and does not imply any metaphysical qualities or vitality. The patterns observed are influenced by the object's properties and the electrical discharge process, making Kirlian photography a fascinating yet scientifically explicable effect.
