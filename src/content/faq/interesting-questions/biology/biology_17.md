summary: "You can't "turn on" more brain parts to get smarter.  Intelligence isn't about using more brain power, it's about learning and applying skills in areas you value.  The key to getting smarter is choosing a field you care about and dedicating time to learn and practice within that field."

## How do I turn on more parts of my brain and get smarter?

### Introduction

The question of how to "turn on" more parts of the brain to increase intelligence is commonly asked, but it's important to clarify that this notion is fundamentally flawed. The brain does not function like a traditional computer, and increased activation of brain regions does not equate to enhanced intelligence or mental capability.

### Understanding Brain Function

When discussing brain activation, one extreme example is a seizure, where a person experiences a dramatic decrease in mental functioning. During a seizure, individuals are unable to perform basic tasks such as talking, walking, or solving mathematical problems. This illustrates that "turning on more of the brain" does not improve cognitive function or make someone smarter.

The brain consists of a complex network of neurons and feedback loops, where thoughts, memories, and calculations emerge from the interactions of multiple neurons. Importantly, an idea is not localized to a single neuron; instead, it is represented by the pattern of connections and the pathways through which neural signals travel in a cascading and non-linear manner.

### Brain vs. Computer

The analogy that the brain operates like a computer is misleading. Computers are deterministic, linear, and rely on localized processing, which makes them excellent for precise calculations and tasks like displaying images or editing text. However, this approach is inadequate for tasks that require creativity, pattern recognition, or the evaluation of complex information.

In contrast, the brain is non-deterministic, asynchronous, non-linear, and operates through delocalized processing. This allows the brain to excel at generating creative ideas, recognizing intricate patterns, and learning new skills. Unlike a computer, which can simply be made "smarter" by adding more processors or RAM, the brain's complexity means that activating additional neurons does not enhance intelligence.

### Defining "Smart"

When considering how to become smarter, it is essential to define what "smart" means. Your brain is continuously processing information, whether actively studying or casually engaging in leisure activities. For example, choosing to watch cartoons instead of doing math homework might make you more adept at recalling cartoon theme songs, but this does not diminish your brain's capability to learn.

Ultimately, "smart" is about utilizing your brain to acquire knowledge and skills that are meaningful to you. The fields of mathematics, science, language, and history are culturally associated with intelligence because they contain knowledge and skills applicable to various real-world tasks. However, one can also be considered "smart" in areas that may not be conventionally productive or employable, such as gaming or entertainment.

### Practical Steps to Improve Intelligence

To genuinely enhance your intelligence, focus on areas that matter to you and invest time in learning and practicing those skills. For instance:

- If you wish to improve in mathematics, practice solving problems repeatedly and ensure you understand the underlying principles.
- If you are interested in playing a musical instrument like the violin, commit to daily practice.

There is no shortcut to mastering a subject; hard work and dedication are essential.

### Effective Learning Strategies

Certain approaches to learning can be more effective than others, particularly given the brain's aptitude for recognizing patterns. Here are some strategies:

1. **Learn the Rules First**: Rather than memorizing isolated facts, start by understanding the foundational rules of a subject.
   
2. **Connect Information**: Organize new knowledge into patterns using these rules. For example, instead of memorizing a list of 5000 words to learn to read, mastering a few dozen phonics rules is more efficient.

3. **Contextual Learning**: When studying history, instead of simply memorizing battle names and dates, learn about the broader contextâ€”such as key figures, technology, and strategies involved. 

4. **Use Visual Aids**: Create maps, charts, timelines, and biographies to visualize connections, as the brain is optimized for pattern recognition.

### Conclusion

In summary, enhancing intelligence is less about "turning on" more of the brain and more about strategically engaging with information and skills relevant to your interests. By focusing on meaningful learning and employing effective strategies, you can make significant strides in your understanding and capabilities in your chosen fields.
