title: "How did doctors create my belly button?"
summary: "Your belly button isn't a scar from a doctor cutting your umbilical cord.  It forms naturally after birth as your body closes the point where the cord attached. The doctor cuts the cord a bit away from your body to allow for proper belly button formation."

## How did doctors create my belly button?

### Introduction

The question of how doctors create a belly button often leads to misunderstandings about the role of the umbilical cord and the natural processes that occur after birth. In reality, doctors do not create your belly button; rather, it is a result of your body's natural healing process following the cutting of the umbilical cord.

### The Role of the Umbilical Cord

During your time in your mother's womb, the umbilical cord served a crucial role in your development. It connected your body to the placenta, which is a pancake-shaped mass of blood vessels that attaches to the wall of the mother's uterus. The umbilical cord had two ends: one attached to your navel and the other to the placenta. Food and oxygen from your motherâ€™s blood were exchanged at the placenta and then transported through your umbilical cord to nourish your body.

### The Process After Birth

Once you were born, you no longer needed the umbilical cord for nourishment. Instead, you began to receive food and oxygen through your mouth. At this point, your body naturally started to close up the point where the umbilical cord had been attached. The process is as follows:

1. **Cutting the Umbilical Cord**: When your umbilical cord was cut by the doctor or midwife, it was typically cut several millimeters away from the end of the cord, leaving a small piece still attached to your belly. This remaining piece is known as the stump.
   
2. **Natural Healing**: Over the course of a few days to weeks, your body naturally closed off the area where the umbilical cord was attached. The stump eventually dried up and fell off, similar to how a scab would fall off a healing wound.

### The Timeline of Healing

According to the Mayo Clinic Guide to Your Baby's First Year, the remaining cord stump will typically dry up and fall off within one to three weeks after birth. To ensure proper healing, it is important to keep the area clean and dry. Here are some recommendations for care during this period:

- **Sponge Baths**: It is advisable to give sponge baths rather than full baths until the stump falls off and the area heals.
- **Air Exposure**: Exposing the stump to air helps with the drying process, which can hasten separation.
- **Diaper Care**: To prevent irritation, it is recommended to fold the baby's diaper below the stump, allowing air circulation.

### Conclusion

In summary, your belly button is not a creation of doctors but rather a natural result of your body's healing process after the umbilical cord was cut. The way your body forms a belly button is a fascinating example of natural biology, emphasizing the remarkable ability of the human body to heal and adapt.
