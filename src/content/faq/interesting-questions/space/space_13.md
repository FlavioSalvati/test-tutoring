summary: "Black holes have gravity like stars, allowing objects to safely orbit them.  While objects close enough will fall in, our galaxy orbits its central black hole safely.  Learn how black holes work and why we're not getting sucked in."

## How can there be anything left in the universe? Don't black holes suck everything in?

### Understanding Black Holes and Their Gravity

The question of whether anything can remain in the universe given the presence of black holes is a fascinating one. Contrary to popular belief, black holes do not indiscriminately "suck" everything in. Instead, their gravitational influence operates similarly to that of stars. 

Black holes possess gravity in the same way that stars do, which allows objects to orbit them safely, much like planets orbit our Sun. For instance, if we consider a black hole as having a mass $M$, the gravitational force it exerts on an object at a distance $r$ can be described by Newton's law of gravitation:

$$
F = \frac{G M m}{r^2}
$$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $m$ is the mass of the object being influenced by the black hole's gravity. This means that as long as an object is at a safe distance from the black hole, it can maintain a stable orbit.

### The Nature of Black Holes

One of the critical distinctions between a black hole and a typical star is the size of their event horizonâ€”the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape. A black hole has a small enough radius such that light cannot escape once it crosses this boundary. However, this does not mean that everything in the universe is at risk of being consumed by a black hole. 

Take our galaxy, for example. At its center lies a supermassive black hole, yet we are not in any danger of being "sucked in." Our entire galaxy, including our solar system, orbits around this central black hole. According to Fulvio Melia's book "The Galactic Supermassive Black Hole," the dynamics of the galaxy are fundamentally stable, as we are sufficiently far from the gravitational pull of the black hole.

### The Fate of Objects Near Black Holes

It is indeed true that if an object ventures too close to a black hole, it can fall in, akin to how an Earth satellite might crash into the ocean after losing altitude due to friction over time. This process is not unique to black holes; it is a result of gravitational dynamics present throughout the universe.

In summary, while black holes can exert a powerful gravitational influence, they do not indiscriminately consume everything in their vicinity. As long as objects maintain a safe distance, they can exist in stable orbits, allowing for the continued presence of various celestial bodies and phenomena in the universe.
