summary: "Meteorites are cold when they hit Earth despite burning up in the atmosphere. Heat from air friction only affects the surface, not the interior, which has been frozen in space for eons."

## What Makes Meteorites So Hot That You Can't Touch Them?

Meteorites, the remnants of celestial bodies that have traveled through space, often intrigue many with their dramatic falls and the temperatures associated with them. However, the reality may surprise you: meteorites are generally cold when they reach the Earth. 

### The Journey Through the Atmosphere

When a meteorite enters the Earth's atmosphere, it experiences a rapid descent that generates significant friction with the air. This interaction produces a substantial amount of heat, enough to vaporize the outer surface of the meteorite. However, this heating effect primarily affects only the outer layer due to the limited time available for heat transfer. As Harry Y. McSween states in his book "Meteorites and their Parent Planets," the heat generated during this atmospheric entry does not penetrate deeply into the meteorite.

### Heat Transfer Limitations

The key reason meteorites remain cold internally lies in the physics of heat conduction. The rate at which heat travels through materials such as stone or iron is relatively slow. To illustrate, consider the time it takes for heat to diffuse through a material; this process is governed by the thermal conductivity of the substance. For instance, if we denote the thermal conductivity of a typical meteorite material as $k$, the time required for significant heat to reach the interior can often exceed the $1$ minute it takes for the meteorite to travel through the atmosphere.

Consequently, while the surface may be warm or even hot upon landing, the interior remains much cooler. Reports have indicated that some meteorites, like the Colby meteorite from Wisconsin and the Dharmasala meteorite from India, have even been observed with frost on their surfaces shortly after falling, despite landing on warm summer days.

### Conclusion

In summary, meteorites can appear hot due to the vaporization of their outer layers during atmospheric entry, but the interior remains cold. The combination of their cold origins in space and the limited time for heat conduction ensures that you can safely examine their outer surfaces without the risk of burns. Thus, while they may seem intimidatingly hot, the reality is quite the opposite.
