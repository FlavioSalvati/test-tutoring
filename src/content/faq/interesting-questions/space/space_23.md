title: "How does looking at distant galaxies allow us to look back in time?"
summary: "Looking at distant galaxies allows us to see them as they were millions of years ago because the light from these galaxies takes millions of years to reach us.  This is similar to looking at an old photograph of a person, the image is a representation of how they looked in the past. While we are not literally looking back in time, we can infer what the galaxy looked like by analyzing the light that has traveled across vast distances."

### The Nature of Light and Time

When we observe the light from distant galaxies, we are not literally peering into the past; rather, we are interpreting the present-time pattern of light that has traveled vast distances across the universe. Each beam of light emitted by a galaxy carries information about that galaxy's appearance at the moment the light was created. For instance, when we look at the galaxy NGC 5010, located $140$ million light-years away, we are seeing what it looked like $140$ million years ago. This is because the light from NGC 5010 has been traveling through the vacuum of space for $140$ million years before reaching us on Earth.

### Understanding the Analogy of Photographs

To illustrate this concept, consider the analogy of a photograph. When you take a picture of your daughter as a baby and print it, that photograph captures a specific moment in time. If you look at this photo ten years later, you are figuratively "looking back in time" to see what she looked like as a baby. However, you are not truly accessing the past; instead, you are examining a present-time pattern of light reflected from the inks in the photograph. 

For this analogy to hold, certain assumptions must be met:

1. The camera accurately captured the pattern of light and transformed it into a pattern of information.
2. The printer faithfully transferred this pattern of information onto the printed photo.
3. The photo has remained unchanged since it was printed.

If any of these assumptions are violated—such as if a bit of acid creates a white dot on the photo—you would misinterpret the image as showing an event that never occurred.

### The Journey of Light from Distant Galaxies

Similarly, when telescopes observe distant galaxies, they are receiving light that has traveled undisturbed through space. This is possible for two key reasons:

1. The immense distances involved mean that light from these galaxies takes millions of years to reach us.
2. The universe is predominantly empty, allowing light to travel vast distances without being obstructed.

However, it is important to note that as light travels through an expanding universe, it undergoes a phenomenon known as redshift. This occurs because the wavelength of the light is stretched due to the expansion of space, causing the light to shift towards longer wavelengths and appear redder. Thus, the present-time light we receive from distant galaxies does not perfectly match the light emitted when the galaxy was observed millions of years ago; it is redshifted.

### Correcting for Redshift

Fortunately, scientists have developed methods to understand and correct for this redshift, allowing us to adjust the light pattern back to its original state. By accounting for the expansion of the universe and the redshift effect, we can obtain a more accurate representation of the distant galaxy as it appeared when it emitted the light we are now observing.

### Conclusion

In summary, while we are not literally looking back in time when we observe distant galaxies, the light we see allows us to infer what these galaxies looked like millions of years ago. By understanding the nature of light and the effects of cosmic expansion, we can effectively interpret the present-time patterns of light as windows into the past.
