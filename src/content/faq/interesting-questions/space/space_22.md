title: "How does astrology work?"
summary: "Astrology claims star alignment influences personality and life events. This is scientifically false.  While celestial bodies affect weather, they don't impact individuals based on birth dates.  Horoscopes may make people feel better through the placebo effect.  Stick to scientifically proven methods for positive change."

## How does astrology work?

Astrology is a fascinating topic that often sparks debate among skeptics and believers alike. To understand how it "works," we must first clarify our definitions and break the question down into two parts.

### The Dual Nature of Astrology

Hardened scientists assert that astrology does not work, while believers maintain that it does. The truth is nuanced and depends on what we mean by "work." Astrology is the belief that the alignment of stars and planets affects an individualâ€™s mood, personality, and environment based on their birth date. Astrologers provide personalized horoscopes that predict personal events, describe personalities, and offer advice according to the positions of astronomical bodies.

A survey by the National Science Foundation revealed that 41% of respondents consider astrology to be "very scientific" or "sort of scientific." To analyze the original question effectively, we can rephrase it into two specific inquiries:

1. Does the position of astronomical bodies affect a person's life?
2. Can horoscopes make people feel better?

### Does the Position of Astronomical Bodies Affect a Person's Life?

The answer to this question is a resounding no. While it is true that the position and orientation of the sun relative to Earth causes seasons, the effects of astronomical bodies on our lives extend only to basic weather patterns. For instance, solar flares can disrupt satellites and cause blackouts, and the moon influences ocean tides. However, these phenomena fall within the realm of meteorological effects, not astrological ones.

Astrology claims that the positions of celestial bodies influence individuals' lives in ways beyond basic weather, depending on their birth date. Scientific studies have debunked this notion. For example, Peter Hartmann and collaborators analyzed over $4000$ individuals and found no correlation between birth date and personality or intelligence. In another notable experiment, Shawn Carlson had $28$ astrologers make predictions, which were then tested for accuracy. His findings, published in *Nature*, revealed that the astrologers performed no better than random chance.

To grasp why astrology does not hold scientific validity, we must consider the fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Any influence an object has on a person must occur through these forces. For example:

- Strong acids burn skin due to electromagnetic interactions.
- A falling rock crushes you because of gravitational attraction.
- Nuclear forces can vaporize objects at extremely close distances.

However, these forces diminish with distance. The gravitational pull of a distant star, such as Polaris, is weaker than that of a nearby gnat. Similarly, the light from a star like Sirius is dimmer than that from a firefly in close proximity. Therefore, if celestial bodies genuinely affected humans, the impact of smaller, closer objects would be even more significant. Furthermore, the alignment of planets never actually occurs in a literal sense, which further undermines the claims of astrology.

### Can Horoscopes Make People Feel Better?

Yes, horoscopes can indeed make people feel better, but this effect is unrelated to the accuracy of the horoscopes themselves. The phenomenon responsible for this improvement is known as the placebo effect. This effect occurs when a person's belief in a method, regardless of its efficacy, leads to a perceived or actual improvement in their condition.

For instance, if ten patients are given sugar pills but are told they are receiving a powerful new drug, they may experience health improvements over time, even though the pills contain only water. This means that when evaluating a new drug, it must be shown to perform better than a placebo. 

The placebo effect is particularly relevant to astrology. Many individuals believe in astrology and experience positive feelings when they read their horoscopes and adhere to their advice. However, it is the belief in astrology, not the astrology itself, that contributes to these feelings of well-being. Various pseudo-scientific treatments, from crystal healing to homeopathy, also leverage the placebo effect. While belief in an ineffective treatment can provide some relief, engaging in scientifically proven methods is a more reliable approach. For example, instead of consulting a horoscope, one could consider going for a walk. Exercise is scientifically validated to benefit both physical and mental health, while also benefiting from the belief in its positive effects.

### Conclusion

In summary, while astrology as a system of belief can provide psychological comfort through the placebo effect, it does not hold up to scientific scrutiny regarding the influence of celestial bodies on individual lives. Understanding these distinctions allows for a more nuanced appreciation of astrology's role in society, separating belief from scientific fact.
