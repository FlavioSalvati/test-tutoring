summary: "Everything in our galaxy orbits the center of mass, not just the supermassive black hole. The black hole is only a tiny fraction of the galaxy's total mass, and its removal wouldn't significantly affect galactic orbits."

## Why Does Everything in Our Galaxy Orbit the Supermassive Black Hole at the Center?

### Understanding Galactic Orbits

The idea that everything in our galaxy orbits the supermassive black hole at the center is a common misconception. In reality, all objects in our galaxy orbit the center of mass of the entire galaxy, which includes not only the black hole but also a vast array of other mass components such as stars, gas, planets, and dark matter. The supermassive black hole, while significant, constitutes only about one millionth of the total mass of the galaxy.

To grasp this concept more clearly, we need to appreciate the role of mass and gravity in determining orbits. The gravitational force that governs the motion of objects is proportional to their mass. Hence, the combined mass of the galaxy dictates the orbits of all its constituent parts.

### The Center of Mass

When we refer to the "center of mass," we are often talking about a point in space where the total mass of a system can be considered to be concentrated. In the case of our galaxy, this point, often termed the "barycenter," is influenced by the mass distribution of all the stars, gas, dark matter, and yes, the central black hole.

If we were to hypothetically remove the supermassive black hole from our galaxy, the orbits of nearly all objects would remain largely unchanged except for those few stars that are in close proximity to the black hole. This is because the gravitational influence of the rest of the galaxy would still dominate.

### An Analogy for Clarity

To illustrate this concept, consider the analogy of three girls forming a circle and linking their hands at the center. As they run around the circle, they feel an outward centrifugal force due to their motion. However, their interconnected arms provide an inward pull, allowing them to maintain their circular formation. 

In this analogy:
- The girls represent the various objects in the galaxy.
- Their linked arms symbolize the gravitational forces that bind them together.
- The gold ring on one girl's finger, positioned at the center, is akin to the black hole.

If the girl were to remove her ring, the motion of the girls would not change significantly, just as the orbits of most stars in the galaxy would remain stable even if the black hole were to vanish.

### The Nature of Orbital Mechanics

In broader terms, it is important to recognize that small bodies do not simply orbit larger bodies in isolation. Instead, both large and small bodies orbit their combined center of mass. This principle is articulated in the textbook "Orbital Mechanics" by Tom Logsdon, which states that when both bodies have appreciable mass, they will orbit around their common barycenter rather than one body orbiting the other.

A practical example of this can be seen when a majorette tosses a baton into the air. The baton does not rotate about its heavier end; instead, it rotates around its center of mass, illustrating that all objects interact through their collective masses.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy is a fascinating object, it is not the sole anchor of gravitational influence. The orbits of stars and other celestial bodies are determined by the total mass of the galaxy as a whole, with the center of mass dictating their paths through space. Understanding this fundamental principle enhances our comprehension of the dynamic and interconnected nature of galactic structures.
