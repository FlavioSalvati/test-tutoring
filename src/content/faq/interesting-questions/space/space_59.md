title: "Why doesn't the earth fall down?"
summary: "The Earth is constantly falling towards the sun due to its gravity, but it never hits because of its sideways momentum. This causes the Earth to orbit the sun, creating seasons. All objects in the universe are constantly falling, but we don't feel it because the distances are so vast."

## Why Doesn't the Earth Fall Down?

### The Nature of Earth's Motion

The earth does fall down. In fact, the earth is constantly falling down. This phenomenon is crucial for maintaining the earth's position within our solar system, preventing it from drifting away due to its own momentum. The force responsible for this is gravity, which is a centrally attractive force. Objects in a gravitational field, such as planets and stars, are always drawn towards the source of gravity due to their mass. The earth, along with everything on it, is perpetually falling towards the sun because of the sun's immense gravitational pull. This is not merely a metaphor; the earth is literally falling towards the sun.

### Why Don't We Hit the Sun?

You may wonder why we don't collide with the sun and burn up. The answer lies in the concept of sideways momentum. The earth possesses significant sideways momentum, which allows it to continually fall towards the sun while simultaneously missing it. Scientists refer to this phenomenon with terms like "stable orbit" or "closed trajectory," but at its core, it simply means "falling and missing." In fact, all gravitational orbits can be understood as cases of falling and missing.

For instance, astronauts aboard the International Space Station are not in a no-gravity environment. They exist within the gravitational influence of both the earth and the sun. More accurately, they are in a state of free fall, constantly falling towards the earth yet missing it due to their orbital speed.

### Newton's Cannonball Thought Experiment

To illustrate the nature of orbits, consider Newton's cannonball thought experiment. Imagine a cannon positioned on the earth's surface that fires a cannonball straight forward. As the cannonball moves, it is pulled down by the earth's gravity. If fired with a certain speed, the cannonball will eventually hit the ground. However, if the cannonball is fired with a higher speed, it will travel farther before hitting the earth. 

If the cannonball is launched fast enough, it will continue to fall towards the earth but will never actually strike it. This occurs because the earth curves away at a greater rate than the cannonball falls towards it. Consequently, the cannonball will enter into a continuous orbit around the earth. This is precisely how satellites maintain their orbits: they are given enough sideways speed to miss the earth while in free fall.

### The Consequences of Falling

If the earth were not falling around the sun, it would fly off into space due to its inertia. The trajectory of the earth around the sun, coupled with its axial tilt, is responsible for the changing seasons. All planets in our solar system are engaged in a similar falling motion around the sun, possessing enough speed to avoid collision.

You may ask why no objects fall directly into the sun. Early on, there were such objects, but they have long since burned up and merged with the sun. Our solar system is old, and any rocks or dust clouds lacking sufficient speed to escape the sun's gravity have perished in its fiery embrace.

### The Universal Nature of Falling

All objects in the universe are perpetually falling. For example, when you jump, you fall back to the earth. You, the earth, and the sun are in constant free fall around the sun, while you, the earth, and the sun are also falling around the center of our galaxy. 

But why don’t we perceive this continuous falling motion? The sun is so distant that our trajectory around it appears almost as a straight line at a constant speed. Interestingly, we cannot feel movement at a constant speed in a straight line. Similarly, the distance to the galactic center makes our orbital motion appear nearly linear on human scales, even though it is fundamentally curved.

In conclusion, the earth does not “fall down” in the conventional sense; rather, it is in a continuous state of free fall towards the sun, maintaining a stable orbit due to its sideways momentum. This interplay of gravitational forces and motion defines our dynamic existence within the cosmos.
