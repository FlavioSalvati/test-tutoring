title: "Does everything get smashed to bits when two galaxies collide?"
summary: "Galaxies colliding don't cause stars or planets to smash. The vast distances between celestial bodies make collisions extremely unlikely. Gravity, however, deforms the galaxies and alters the positions of stars, resulting in a slow, long process lasting millions of years."

## Does Everything Get Smashed to Bits When Two Galaxies Collide?

### Introduction

When we think of galaxies colliding, it's easy to envision a dramatic and chaotic event where countless stars and planets collide, exploding into a myriad of pieces. However, the reality of galaxy collisions is far less destructive than it might seem.

### The Nature of Galaxy Collisions

No, when two galaxies collide, the stars, planets, dwarf planets, and moons from one galaxy do not crash into any astronomical bodies from the other galaxy. In fact, no astronomical bodies get smashed to bits during a galaxy collision. When astronomers refer to two galaxies colliding, they mean that the galaxies are moving toward each other and progressively occupying the same region of space. Throughout the entire collision, zero astronomical bodies from one galaxy collide with those from the other galaxy.

### Vast Distances Between Astronomical Bodies

A crucial factor to understand is the vast amounts of empty space within galaxies. The term "empty" here refers to regions devoid of stars, planets, dwarf planets, and moons, although outer space is never completely devoid of matter, as it contains light, neutrinos, and vacuum fluctuations. The distances between neighboring astronomical bodies are so immense that it is exceedingly unlikely for them to collide during a galaxy collision. 

In this context, "astronomical body" is defined as a star, planet, dwarf planet, or moon, excluding smaller bodies such as asteroids and comets, which are generally too small to cause significant damage to larger bodies.

### Estimating the Probability of Collision

To illustrate this point, let's make a rough estimate. Assuming our galaxy is representative of the average galaxy, and that every star has a solar system similar to ours, we can calculate the number of astronomical bodies in the Milky Way. 

Our solar system contains:
- 1 star
- 8 planets
- 5 dwarf planets
- 293 moons

This totals to $307$ astronomical bodies, which we can round up to $400$ for simplicity. Given that there are approximately $100$ billion to $400$ billion stars in our galaxy, we can conservatively estimate that there are $400$ billion stars. Thus, the total number of astronomical bodies in our galaxy is approximately 

$$ 
\text{Total bodies} = 400 \text{ billion stars} \times \frac{400}{1} \approx 160 \text{ trillion bodies}.
$$

Estimating the volume of our galaxy to be about $17$ trillion cubic light-years, we find that, on average, each astronomical body has about 

$$ 
\frac{17 \text{ trillion cubic light-years}}{160 \text{ trillion bodies}} \approx 0.106 \text{ cubic light-years}
$$ 

of empty space all to itself. This volume corresponds to a cube with an edge length of approximately $0.474$ light-years. 

To further illustrate, if we convert this volume into units where the volume of the Sun is one unit, we find that each astronomical body has a region of space equivalent to the volume of about 

$$ 
6.4 \times 10^{19} \text{ Suns}.
$$ 

This enormous volume indicates that for an astronomical body from one galaxy to collide with another from a different galaxy, both must find each other within this vast region of empty space. The probability of such an event occurring is effectively zero.

### A Thought Experiment: Tennis Balls on Earth

Imagine shrinking the universe so that the Sun becomes the volume of a tennis ball. The amount of empty space surrounding each astronomical body would be, on average, equal to the volume of the air covering the entire Earth's surface from sea level up to $19$ meters high. If only two tennis balls existed on the entire Earth's surface, randomly placed, the chances of them colliding when thrown would be exceedingly small.

### The Dynamics of Galaxy Collisions

Even when two galaxies are near the end of the collision process and almost entirely occupy the same space, the average distance between an astronomical body from one galaxy and the nearest body from the other galaxy is still significant. Detailed mathematical analysis shows that, on average, this distance is about 

$$ 
0.3 \text{ light-years},
$$ 

which is equivalent to the distance spanned by $2$ million Suns lined up in a single-file row with their surfaces touching. Hence, at any moment, each astronomical body from one galaxy is approximately $2$ million sun-diameters away from the nearest body in the other galaxy.

### Effects of Gravitational Forces

While direct collisions between astronomical bodies are unlikely, the gravitational fields of the galaxies do interact. The gravitational field from each astronomical body extends far beyond its surface, and the total gravitational field inside a galaxy affects all of its astronomical bodies. As two galaxies collide, their gravitational fields will influence each other's structures, deforming their shapes and altering the relative locations of their stars and other bodies.

### Conclusion

In summary, while galaxy collisions lead to significant changes in the arrangements of stars and other bodies due to gravitational interactions, the chances of astronomical bodies colliding and being smashed to bits are negligible. The vast distances between objects in galaxies mean that these cosmic events are more about gravitational dynamics than violent collisions, unfolding over millions to hundreds of millions of years in a process that appears almost frozen in time to human observers.
