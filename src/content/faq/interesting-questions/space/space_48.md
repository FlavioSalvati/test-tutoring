## Where is the edge of the universe?

By: Christopher S. Baird, author of *The Top 50 Science Questions with Surprising Answers* and Associate Professor of Physics at West Texas A&M University.

### The Infinite Universe

As far as we can tell, there is no edge to the universe. Space spreads out infinitely in all directions. Furthermore, galaxies fill all of the space throughout the entire infinite universe. This conclusion is reached by logically combining two observations.

#### Observation One: Uniformity and Flatness

First, the part of the universe that we can see is uniform and flat on the cosmic scale. The uniformity of the universe means that galaxy groups are spread out more or less evenly on the cosmic scale. The flatness of the universe means that the geometry of spacetime is not curved or warped on this scale. This indicates that the universe does not wrap around and connect to itself like the surface of a sphere, which would lead to a finite universe.

The flatness of the universe is actually a result of its uniformity. Concentrated collections of mass, such as moons, planets, stars, and galaxies, cause spacetime to be curved. However, these objects are so small compared to the cosmic scale that the spacetime warping they cause is negligible. If you average over all of the moons, planets, stars, and galaxies in the universe to get a large-scale expression for the mass distribution, you find it to be constant.

#### Observation Two: Non-Special Corner

The second observation is that our corner of the universe is not special or different. Since the part of the universe that we can see is flat and uniform, and since our corner is not special, all parts of the universe must also be flat and uniform. The only way for the universe to be flat and uniform everywhere is for it to be infinite and have no edge. This conclusion, while difficult for our human minds to grasp, is the most logical one given scientific observations.

If you flew a spaceship in a straight line through space forever, you would never reach a wall, a boundary, an edge, or even a region without galaxy groups.

### The Big Bang and the Nature of Expansion

One may wonder how the universe can have no edge if it was created in the Big Bang. If the universe started as finite in size, shouldn't it still be finite? The answer is that the universe did not start out as finite. The Big Bang was not like a bomb on a table exploding and expanding to fill a room with debris; it happened everywhere in the universe at once. This is why the remnants of the Big Bang, such as cosmic microwave background radiation, exist everywhere in space.

The explosive expansion of the universe was not a case of a physical object expanding into space but rather of space itself expanding. The universe began as an infinitely large object and has grown into an even larger infinitely large object. While it is challenging for humans to understand infinity, it is a valid mathematical and scientific concept. It is reasonable for an entity of infinite size to increase in size.

### The Observable Universe

It is important to note that humans can only see part of the entire universe, which we refer to as the "observable universe." Since light travels at a finite speed, it takes time for light to reach us from various points in the universe. Many points are so far away that light from them has not yet had enough time to reach Earth. Thus, these locations are fundamentally outside our sphere of observation, or outside of our observable universe.

Every location in the universe has its own sphere of observation beyond which it cannot see. While our observable universe is not infinite, it does have an edge. This edge does not signify a wall of energy or a chasm; rather, it marks the boundary between locations we can currently see and those we cannot. 

### The Expansion of the Universe

As time progresses, more points in space have had light time to reach us, meaning our observable universe is constantly increasing in size. However, the universe itself is still expanding. Although the current expansion is not as rapid as during the Big Bang, it remains significant. All galaxy groups are continually moving farther away from each other.

Some galaxies are receding from Earth at speeds faster than light due to this expansion. While special relativity prevents two local objects from traveling faster than light relative to each other, it does not restrict distant objects from receding from each other at such speeds. Therefore, light from these galaxies will never reach us, regardless of how long we wait, meaning they will always remain outside our observable universe.

Despite the limitations of our observational abilities, the universe itself has no edge. The edge of the observable universe cannot keep pace with the expansion of the universe, leading to many galaxies being eternally beyond our sight. 

In conclusion, while our observable universe has an edge, the universe as a whole is infinite and possesses no edge.
