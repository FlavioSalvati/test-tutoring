title: "What keeps the North Star stuck at exactly North?"
summary: "The North Star, Polaris, appears fixed in the north due to Earth's rotation. Its position near the axis of rotation makes it appear stationary, though it actually has a small arc. Earth's axis shifts over time, causing the North Star to change every few thousand years."

## What Keeps the North Star Stuck at Exactly North?

### Understanding Polaris

The North Star, commonly known as Polaris, is often thought to be a single star; however, it is actually a multiple star system consisting of five distinct stars. Among these, three stars are relatively close to one another and orbit around each other, while the other two are situated at a great distance. These distant stars appear aligned with Polaris from our vantage point on Earth due to a random line of sight, but if we were to observe from another galaxy, they would not seem to be part of the same system.

### The Illusion of Movement

One might wonder why Polaris appears to remain fixed in the night sky when, in reality, all stars have their own movements. The stars do not change their positions over the course of a single day; their movement occurs over millions of years. The apparent motion of stars across the sky every night is primarily due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis, which completes one full rotation approximately every 24 hours. 

To illustrate this concept, consider how a basketball spins on a finger. The points on the basketball that are far from the axis of rotation (the sides) move swiftly, while the point that is at the axis (where the finger touches) hardly moves at all. This analogy helps explain why a person standing exactly at the North Pole does not experience significant movement over the course of a day. In essence, the closer a point on Earth is to its axis of rotation—an imaginary line extending through the North and South geographic poles—the less it moves.

### Polaris and Earth's Rotation Axis

Polaris's proximity to Earth's axis of rotation is what makes it a reliable marker for true north. However, it's important to note that Polaris is not perfectly aligned with the Earth's rotation axis; it is actually situated at a viewing angle of approximately $0.736$ degrees away from exact north. Although this angle is minuscule, it means that Polaris does indeed trace a small arc across the sky every night. This arc is so slight that it is imperceptible to the naked eye.

Additionally, the Earth's rotation axis is not completely fixed. Due to the Earth’s shape—bulging at the equator—the gravitational effects exerted by the Sun create a non-symmetrical force that causes a slow, gradual twist on the Earth's rotation axis. This phenomenon, known as precession, means that Polaris will not always be our North Star. In about $3000$ years, the star Gamma Cephei will come to occupy a position much closer to the Earth's rotation axis, thereby becoming the new North Star.

### Conclusion

In summary, what keeps the North Star, or Polaris, appearing "stuck" at north is its relative position close to the Earth's axis of rotation. While it does move slightly in the sky due to its angle and the Earth's precession, the motion is so minimal that it gives the impression of being fixed. This unique positioning, combined with the fact that the stars themselves do not significantly change position over short time frames, allows Polaris to serve as a dependable guide for navigation in the northern hemisphere.
