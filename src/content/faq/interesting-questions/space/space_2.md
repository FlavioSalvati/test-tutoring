title: "Can a star turn into a planet?"
summary: "A brown dwarf, a star too small to fuse regular hydrogen, can turn into a planet. It initially glows due to fusing heavy hydrogen, but quickly runs out and cools, becoming a dark, planet-like object. Despite being at the center of a solar system, it acts like a planet, creating a dark, cold system."

## Can a Star Turn Into a Planet?

### Introduction

Yes, a star can turn into a planet, but this transformation takes place under specific conditions and primarily involves a unique type of celestial body known as a brown dwarf. Understanding this process requires a look at the characteristics that distinguish brown dwarfs from both stars and planets.

### What is a Brown Dwarf?

A brown dwarf is an intriguing object with characteristics that straddle the line between stars and planets. Its mass is:

- Greater than the largest regular planets, specifically above $13$ times the mass of Jupiter.
- Less than the smallest conventional stars, specifically below $80$ times the mass of Jupiter.

### The Nature of Brown Dwarfs

Some scientists argue that brown dwarfs should not be classified as true stars because they lack sufficient mass to ignite the nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen. However, they also do not fit the criteria for planets, as they typically occupy the central position in a solar system, much like stars. 

Instead, brown dwarfs can ignite the nuclear fusion of heavy hydrogen, also known as deuterium. This process releases significant amounts of light and heat, causing a young brown dwarf to glow similarly to a regular star. Notably, despite their name, a glowing brown dwarf does not appear brown; it typically exhibits a magenta or reddish-orange hue.

### Life Cycle of a Brown Dwarf

The life cycle of a brown dwarf is fascinating:

1. **Early Life**: Initially, a brown dwarf shines due to deuterium fusion, emitting light and heat.
2. **Consumption of Heavy Hydrogen**: The brown dwarf quickly consumes its limited supply of heavy hydrogen because it is much rarer than regular hydrogen.
3. **Transition to Planet-like Behavior**: Once the heavy hydrogen is depleted, the brown dwarf ceases to emit light and heat, cooling and dimming steadily. At this stage, it begins to resemble a planet such as Jupiter.

### The Final Stage

Even though a typical brown dwarf remains at the center of a solar system, it spends the remainder of its life behaving like a planet. The result is an unusual solar system where a collection of planets orbits a large central "planet" (the brown dwarf), with no conventional star present. Such a system would be characterized by cold and dark conditions. Itâ€™s worth noting that some brown dwarfs do orbit regular stars.

### Observations and Statistics

As of 2018, over $3000$ different brown dwarfs have been identified through telescopic observations. The difficulty in detecting brown dwarfs does not imply that they are rare; instead, they are often dark and thus resemble planets for most of their existence. Recent statistical analyses suggest that there may be approximately as many brown dwarfs in our galaxy as there are regular stars.

### Conclusion

In summary, while a star can transform into a planet-like object through the lifecycle of a brown dwarf, this transformation is a complex interplay of mass, nuclear fusion, and the unique characteristics of these intriguing celestial bodies.
