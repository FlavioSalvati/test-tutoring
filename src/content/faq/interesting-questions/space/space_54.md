title: "Why do the spikes that shoot out of stars form perfect crosses?"
summary: "Diffraction spikes seen in star images are not part of the star, but imaging artifacts caused by telescope support rods. These rods, called struts or vanes, create a cross-shaped pattern that deflects light, resulting in the characteristic spikes. Telescopes without support rods, such as lens-based telescopes, produce images without these spikes."

## Why do the spikes that shoot out of stars form perfect crosses?

### Introduction to Diffraction Spikes

The striking crossed spikes observed in images of stars are not actual components of the stars themselves; rather, they are artifacts created by the telescope's design. These phenomena, known as **diffraction spikes**, arise due to the way light interacts with the physical structure of the telescope.

### The Role of the Telescope Structure

In many telescopes, a large primary mirror is utilized to gather and focus incoming light. This light is directed towards a secondary mirror or sensor, which is suspended above the primary mirror. The purpose of the secondary mirror is to redirect the light out of the telescope, allowing it to be viewed or processed. Alternatively, sensors can convert the incoming light into an electrical signal for digital imaging.

To maintain the position of the secondary mirror or sensor, support rods—also referred to as struts or vanes—are required. These rods obstruct some of the incoming light, leading to a phenomenon known as **diffraction**. When light passes close to these rods, it gets slightly deflected, resulting in a shift of light in the final image. For bright point sources of light, such as stars, this shifted light manifests as radial spikes.

### The Symmetry of Support Rods

The diffractive effect produced by the support rods is closely tied to their arrangement. When these rods are configured in a symmetrical cross pattern, the resulting diffraction spikes in the star's image will also take on this cross shape. This configuration of support rods is often referred to as a **spider**. 

According to Jeffrey R. Charles in "Practical Astrophotography", when a spider utilizes two straight vanes oriented at right angles to each other, it generates two intersecting diffraction lines, culminating in a total of four spikes that exhibit the same perpendicular orientation. For instance, a **three-vane spider** configured 120 degrees apart produces an interesting visual effect of three diffraction lines, resulting in six spikes overall.

### The Impact of Aperture Shape

Notably, diffraction does not only occur at the support rods. It also occurs at the edge of the telescope’s aperture—the opening that allows light to enter. Most telescopes feature circular apertures, which tend to create **diffraction rings** (known as an Airy pattern) rather than spikes. These rings are often faint and contribute to a slight blurring of the image. However, with sensitive equipment and longer exposure times, these diffraction rings can be observed.

When the aperture takes on a non-circular shape, such as polygonal configurations found in some camera diaphragms (e.g., pentagons or hexagons), both rings and spikes may emerge from the aperture itself. In this case, the diffraction spikes observed in images captured by lens-based cameras stem from the shape of the aperture rather than support rods.

### Conclusion

In summary, the perfect cross-shaped diffraction spikes seen in images of stars are a result of the symmetrical arrangement of support rods within the telescope. While these optical artifacts contribute to the aesthetic appeal of astronomical images, they are fundamentally a byproduct of the diffraction of light around the physical components of the telescope. Understanding the interplay of diffraction and telescope design is crucial for interpreting the images captured by these powerful instruments.
