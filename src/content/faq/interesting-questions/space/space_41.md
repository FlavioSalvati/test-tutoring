summary: "Space ships can't bank like airplanes because there's no air to redirect their momentum. They must use engines to turn, resulting in a slow, arching movement. Banking turns are a Hollywood trope, not reality."

## What Kind of Space Ships Can Make Banking Turns?

### Introduction

The question of whether space ships can perform banking turns is an intriguing one, often influenced by our experiences with aviation and the portrayal of space battles in popular media. However, the fundamental physics governing motion in space starkly contrasts with those of flight through the Earth's atmosphere.

### The Nature of Banking Turns

In aviation, a banking turn occurs when an airplane tilts its wings to one side, allowing it to deflect off a cushion of air. This deflection redirects the plane's momentum, enabling it to change direction gracefully. The physics behind this can be expressed simply: when an airplane banks, it generates a lift vector that has a horizontal component, allowing it to turn while maintaining altitude.

In the atmosphere, the presence of air is crucial. The air provides resistance and support, which means that an airplane can even make a turn with its engines off, simply by banking and relying on aerodynamic forces.

### The Reality of Space Travel

In contrast, space is a vacuum, with essentially no air. This lack of air means that space ships cannot utilize the same aerodynamic principles as airplanes. Thus, the conclusion is clear: 

- **No kind of space ship can make banking turns in space.**

When a space ship needs to change direction, it must follow a different procedure. Specifically, it must:

1. **Reorient itself**: This is accomplished by firing thrusters at a sideways angle.
2. **Activate its main engines**: Once reoriented, the ship fires its engines in the new desired direction.

Even after executing these maneuvers, a space ship retains its original momentum in the direction it was initially traveling due to the conservation of momentum. As a result, the turn is not sharp or banked; rather, it manifests as a slow, arching motion.

### Momentum and Direction

To illustrate this with a simple mathematical concept, consider the momentum of a space ship described by the formula:

$$
\text{Momentum} (p) = m v
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the space ship and $v$ is its velocity. When a space ship changes direction, the momentum in the original direction must be countered to achieve a complete turn. This means that if a ship is traveling in a direction characterized by a vector $\vec{v}$, it must fire thrusters in the opposite direction to alter its trajectory effectively.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, the dynamics of space travel dictate that banking turns are impossible for space ships. The portrayal of dogfights and rapid maneuvers in space, as often depicted in Hollywood films, is a distortion of the actual principles of physics. In reality, all space maneuvers are dictated by the laws of motion and the absence of atmospheric forces, making high-speed turns a graceful but slow affair. 

Thus, the bottom line remains: **banking turns are not possible in space.**
