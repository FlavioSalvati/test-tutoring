summary: "Spacecraft in the solar system are starkly lit by sunlight, with one side in bright light and the other in shadow.  Outside of a solar system, spacecraft are completely dark except for their own internal lights.  Ambient light like we see on Earth is absent in space."

## What Would Space Ships Actually Look Like in Space?

### Understanding Space Illumination

When we consider what spaceships look like in the vastness of space, it is crucial to understand the nature of illumination in that environment. Spacecraft operating within our solar system, such as the Apollo 13 Service Module, are predominantly illuminated by direct sunlight. This contrasts sharply with the conditions on Earth, where we benefit from ambient light due to our atmosphere scattering sunlight in all directions.

In space, the absence of an atmosphere means there is no sky to scatter light. Consequently, a spacecraft will exhibit stark lighting conditions: one side will be brightly lit by the sun, while the opposite side will be enveloped in deep shadow. This phenomenon is similar to the appearance of a crescent moon, where one side is illuminated and the other is dark.

### The Effects of Distance from Stars

The scenario changes dramatically for spacecraft that venture outside of any solar system, particularly those situated far from any stars. In such cases, these vehicles would be enveloped in near-total darkness, aside from the light generated by their own internal systems. This darkness resembles the conditions of a vehicle on Earth at night, far removed from streetlights and without the presence of the moon.

### Common Misconceptions in Media

It is important to note that many portrayals of spaceships in movies and television shows depict them as being illuminated by ambient light. This representation is misleading and does not accurately reflect the realities of space. The lighting conditions are far more extreme, with bright and dark sides defined by their orientation to the nearest light source.

### Influence of Proximity to Planets

Moreover, a spacecraft in close proximity to a planet, such as the International Space Station (ISS), may experience different lighting effects. If the ISS is positioned over the daytime side of a planet, it will receive ambient light reflecting off that planetâ€™s surface, slightly altering the stark contrast of light and shadow typically observed in deep space.

In summary, the appearance of spaceships in space is characterized by extreme contrasts in lighting, dictated by their orientation to the sun or nearby celestial bodies. Understanding these conditions provides a more accurate visualization of what these vehicles would look like as they traverse the cosmic vastness.
