## Galaxies Look Stationary, So Why Do Scientists Say That They Rotate?

### Understanding Galaxy Rotation

Galaxies, while appearing stationary to the naked eye, are indeed in a constant state of rotation. This rotational motion is crucial to their structure, giving them a flattened round shape that resembles the way spinning pizza dough becomes round and flat. The tangential speed at which different parts of a galaxy move is astounding; for example, our entire solar system travels at an impressive speed of about 500,000 miles per hour as it participates in the galaxy's rotation.

### The Illusion of Stationarity

Despite this high speed, galaxies can appear frozen in place. The reason for this is the immense scale of galaxies themselves. An object moving at high speed across a vast distance can seem to be moving very slowly from a considerable distance. This phenomenon is not merely a psychological effect; it is a reflection of the actual speed in relation to the total distance traveled.

#### A Relatable Example

To illustrate this concept, consider a sports car traveling at 200 miles per hour. This speed is quite fast when comparing it to everyday human experiences. If you were to drive a few blocks, an observer would note your speed as remarkably rapid. However, if your journey were to span the entire United States, from New York City to San Francisco, you would still be driving at 200 miles per hour, but it would take you approximately 15 hours to complete the trip. 

From the perspective of an observer situated far away, such as an astronaut on the International Space Station, your speed would seem minimal. In fact, it could appear as if you are not moving at all. To put this into perspective in terms of percentage, when traveling across the country, your speed would be about 7 percent of the overall journey per hour. Conversely, for the short trip to the city block, you would have a speed of about 500 percent of the journey per hour.

### Applying the Concept to Galaxies

This same principle applies to galaxies. The distance our solar system must travel to complete one full orbit around the center of the Milky Way is approximately $9 \times 10^{17}$ miles. Even though we are moving at a staggering speed of 500,000 miles per hour, it will take about 200 million Earth years to finish one orbit. 

When we express this speed in terms of the journey around the galaxy, our solar system travels at an infinitesimally small rate of $0.0000000000005\%$ of the journey per hour. To a distant alien astronomer observing our galaxy, the rotation would appear so slow that it might seem as if the galaxy is not rotating at all. This same phenomenon applies to the observation of other galaxies as well.

### Conclusion

In summary, while galaxies are indeed rotating at incredible speeds, their vast sizes create an illusion of stillness from our perspective on Earth. This fascinating interplay between speed, distance, and perception is a key aspect of understanding the dynamics of galaxies in our universe.
