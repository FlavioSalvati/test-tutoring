title: "I know anything from a plant is safe to eat, but anything from a lab can be dangerous. How can I tell if something came from a plant or a lab?"
summary: "Don't assume "natural" means "safe." Many plants are toxic, and herbal supplements lack the safety regulations of lab-made medicines.  "Natural" doesn't equal "healthy," and man-made dangers often pale in comparison to natural ones."

## Understanding the Safety of What We Consume: Plants vs. Labs

### The Misconception of "Natural" Safety

The belief that all plant-derived substances are safe to eat while lab-created items are inherently dangerous is a simplification that can lead to serious health risks. In reality, many plants contain toxic compounds that can be harmful or even fatal. For instance, the autumn crocus, despite its beauty, is deadly when ingested. Symptoms of its toxicity mimic those of arsenic poisoning, and unfortunately, there is no known antidote.

### Toxic Plants and Their Risks

It's crucial to recognize that not everything from a plant is safe. Some dangerous substances are indeed naturally occurring. Consider the following examples:

- **Cyanide**: A potent poison that is naturally found in certain plants.
- **Poisonous Plants**: Species like poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac should never be consumed as they can cause severe health issues.
- **Mind-Altering Drugs**: Substances such as marijuana, tobacco, and cocaine are derived from plants and carry their own risks.
- **Toxic Mushrooms**: According to "Clinical Toxicology" by Marsha Ford, there are 84 varieties of mushrooms that are toxic.
- **Kidney Beans**: These legumes can be toxic if undercooked; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that they must be soaked for at least $5$ hours and boiled for at least $10$ minutes to deactivate the toxin.

Other plants like wisteria, foxglove, and hydrangea can also be harmful if ingested. Even licorice, when consumed in excess, can lead to dangerously high blood pressure. Furthermore, herbal teas, such as those made from poppy seeds, have resulted in fatalities due to the presence of lethal levels of narcotics.

### The Regulation of Herbal Supplements

While it may seem that consuming a pill made from a plant is a safe alternative, this isn't necessarily the case. Most herbal supplements lack the rigorous regulation that governs prescription medications. As noted by Dr. Anna Licata in her review study, "Herbal Hepatotoxicity: a hidden epidemic," herbal products are often marketed as food, sidestepping essential drug regulations. This poses significant risks, as the herbs used for their medicinal properties can have harmful effects and lead to adverse interactions with prescription drugs.

In stark contrast, prescription medications undergo extensive testing and regulation, which includes:

1. Rigorous research and testing phases.
2. Drug approval processes.
3. Oversight by licensed healthcare professionals.
4. Distribution through certified pharmacies.

Herbal pills do not have these safeguards, making them potentially more dangerous than laboratory-made medicines.

### The Complexity of "Natural" Foods

Even the notion of "natural" is complicated in our modern world. For example, the seeds for tomatoes available in stores have been developed through centuries of human intervention, including cross-breeding and genetic engineering. To consume truly natural foods, one would have to seek out completely untouched ecosystems, an impractical and likely unsafe endeavor.

### The Broader Perspective on Risks

The misconception that "natural" equates to safety and "man-made" equates to danger extends beyond consumables. For example, while some may view cell phones and microwaves as hazardous due to their artificial origins, it is essential to note that natural sources of danger—like the sun's radiation and asbestos—can pose significant health risks.

In fact, even water can be dangerous in excessive quantities, leading to a condition known as dilutional hyponatremia.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the idea that anything from a plant is safe while anything from a lab is dangerous is a simplistic and misleading viewpoint. A healthy skepticism and thorough research into the safety of both natural and synthetic substances are vital. Whether a substance is derived from a plant or a laboratory, understanding its properties and potential risks is crucial for making informed decisions about consumption.
