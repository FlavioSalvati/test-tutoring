summary: "Dark-skinned people do get sunburns, although they may be less noticeable. Melanin protects against UV damage, but doesn't block it completely. Even dark skin needs sunscreen to prevent sunburn and skin cancer."

## Why don't dark-skinned people get sunburns?

### Introduction

The notion that dark-skinned individuals are immune to sunburn is a misconception. While it is true that higher levels of skin pigment, primarily melanin, provide some protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation, it is essential to understand that this protection is not absolute. 

### The Role of Melanin

Melanin is the pigment produced by skin cells known as melanocytes. Its primary function is to absorb and dissipate UV radiation, which helps to shield the skin from the damaging effects of sunlight. However, the presence of melanin does not mean complete protection. 

Research indicates that while individuals with darker skin have a lower incidence of sunburn and skin cancer, they are not entirely immune. For instance, a 2010 study by the CDC revealed that **13%** of black women and **9%** of black men reported experiencing at least one sunburn in the previous year. In comparison, **38%** of Hispanic women and **32%** of Hispanic men also reported sunburns during the same period. The average sunburn occurrence across all ethnicities and genders was approximately **50.1%**.

### Sunburns and Skin Damage

When dark-skinned individuals do experience sunburn, the effects may not be as visually apparent as they are in lighter-skinned individuals. However, this does not mean that the underlying damage is absent. Dark-skinned individuals can still suffer from symptoms such as skin tightness, pain, sensitivity, heat, and peeling, similar to their lighter-skinned counterparts.

### Skin Cancer Risk

Alongside sunburns, dark-skinned individuals are also at risk for skin cancer due to sun exposure. Although the rates of skin cancer among dark-skinned people are significantly lower than those in light-skinned populations, they are not zero. According to another CDC study, approximately **1 in every 100,000** black individuals is diagnosed with skin melanomas annually, while about **4 in every 100,000** Hispanic individuals face the same diagnosis.

To put this in perspective, dark-skinned individuals have a higher likelihood of developing skin cancer from sun exposure than winning the lottery. But unlike lottery odds, there are effective measures to reduce the risk of skin damage. 

### The Importance of Sunscreen

One of the most effective ways for dark-skinned individuals to protect their skin from UV damage is through the use of sunscreen. Research has shown that sunscreen provides protective benefits to dark skin just as effectively as it does for light skin. 

The mortality rate from skin cancer highlights the importance of protection: approximately **1 in every 200,000** black individuals die from skin cancer each year, compared to **2 in every 200,000** Hispanic individuals, and **6 in every 200,000** white individuals. 

### Conclusion

In summary, while dark-skinned individuals have a natural advantage due to higher melanin levels, they are not completely shielded from sunburn or skin cancer. It is crucial for everyone, regardless of skin tone, to take preventative measures, such as using sunscreen, to protect against the harmful effects of UV radiation.
