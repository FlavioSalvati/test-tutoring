## Why Does Mainstream Medicine Only Treat Patients with Drugs?

### An Overview of Mainstream Medicine

Mainstream medicine does not solely rely on drugs to treat patients; it encompasses a wide array of techniques that have been validated by credible evidence to effectively promote and protect human health. This comprehensive approach includes:

- **Surgery**
- **Physical therapy**
- **Exercise**
- **Balanced nutrition**
- **Adequate sleep**
- **Preventative care**
- **Counseling**
- **Lifestyle changes**

The core objective of mainstream medicine is to prevent illness, treat acute conditions, and promote overall health through both drug and non-drug measures.

### Real-World Examples of Treatment

When faced with various medical issues, mainstream doctors employ diverse methods rather than just prescribing drugs:

1. **Fractures**: If you break your arm, a competent doctor will set the bone and apply a cast for immobilization. Although painkillers or antibiotics may be provided, these drugs do not heal the broken bone; rather, the body naturally heals itself when properly supported.

2. **Cuts**: For a deep cut in the leg, a doctor will stitch or medically glue the skin back together, emphasizing the importance of aiding the body's natural healing mechanisms.

3. **Joint Pain**: In cases of bursitis, doctors teach specific exercises to assist in recovery.

4. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: If a patient has a vitamin deficiency due to poor nutrition, the doctor will guide them toward a balanced diet.

5. **Allergies**: For someone allergic to peanuts, the doctor will provide avoidance strategies rather than medication alone.

6. **Sleep Disorders**: In instances of sleep apnea, a doctor may suggest using a breathing machine at night.

7. **Mental Health**: For postpartum depression, the initial recommendation may often be professional counseling.

8. **Caffeine Overuse**: When headaches result from excessive caffeine, a doctor will help devise a reduction plan.

### Preventative Care and Health Promotion

Mainstream medicine also emphasizes preventative care. Doctors advise patients on various lifestyle changes, including:

- Quitting smoking
- Increasing exercise
- Getting screened for diseases
- Avoiding drug abuse
- Staying current with vaccinations
- Limiting alcohol consumption
- Practicing safe sexual behavior

### Misconceptions About Drug Use in Medicine

The belief that medical doctors exclusively use drugs can be attributed to two main factors:

1. **A Small Number of Doctors**: Some physicians may overlook non-drug options due to time constraints or assumptions about patient knowledge. However, these instances are exceptions and not representative of the broader practice of mainstream medicine.

2. **Non-Evidence-Based Providers**: Certain healthcare providers misrepresent mainstream medicine to promote their own services, suggesting that traditional medical practitioners focus solely on drugs. This misleading narrative has led many to incorrectly view vital health practices, such as nutrition and exercise, as outside the realm of mainstream medicine.

### The Role of Drugs in Treatment

It is essential to note that the use of prescribed drugs is not inherently negative. For specific medical situations, such as acute blood-sugar episodes in diabetics or severe allergic reactions, drugs can be the most effective treatment option. In such cases, prioritizing drug therapy over non-drug methods is not only appropriate but necessary for patient safety.

In summary, mainstream medicine employs a diverse array of treatment options, integrating both drugs and non-drug measures based on credible evidence to optimize patient health and recovery.
