title: "Is mental illness really an illness?"
summary: "Mental illnesses are real, caused by physical brain abnormalities. They are not character flaws or choices. Depression, a common mental illness, involves neurotransmitter imbalances and can cause more than sadness.  Medication and therapy can provide relief, but unhelpful comments can worsen symptoms.  Mental illness is common and everyone should learn about it and offer support."

## Is Mental Illness Really an Illness?

### Introduction

Yes, mental illnesses really are physical illnesses. Mental illnesses arise from biochemical and physical abnormalities in the brain brought on by various factors including genetic disorders, chronic medical conditions, infectious diseases such as COVID-19, traumatic brain injury, drug abuse, trauma, and more. It is crucial to understand that mental illnesses are not the result of moral shortcomings, character flaws, personality weaknesses, or poor choices.

### The Biological Basis of Mental Illness

Mental illnesses are linked to abnormal neurotransmitter functioning in the brain. Key neurotransmitters involved include serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, GABA, and cortisol. People experiencing a mental illness did not choose their condition any more than individuals choose to have appendicitis or cystic fibrosis. Furthermore, relief from a mental illness cannot be achieved simply by choosing to be happy, much like one cannot will away cancer or heart disease.

### Clinical Depression: A Case Study

One of the most common types of mental illness is clinical depression (i.e., major depressive disorder). Approximately one out of every twelve U.S. adults is currently experiencing a clinical depression episode or has had one in the last year. Clinical depression outwardly resembles a healthy person having a bad day; however, the causes, suffering, and prognosis are distinctly different.

#### Distinction Between Clinical Depression and Normal Sadness

Individuals experiencing normal sadness can often cheer themselves up by engaging in uplifting activities. If someone views clinical depression and normal sadness as the same, they might incorrectly assume that those with depression just need to try harder to feel better. This perspective is not only incorrect but also deeply unfair. For instance, telling someone with clinical depression to “snap out of it” is akin to suggesting that a person with diabetes can cure their condition through positive thinking.

### The Reality of Clinical Depression

People suffering from clinical depression cannot cheer themselves up through enjoyable activities. The biochemical and physical abnormalities in their brains prevent them from experiencing joy or relief from sadness. This incapacity can exacerbate their feelings of despair, leading to a cycle where they avoid activities that might typically bring joy. 

#### Why Are People with Depression Sad Even with a Great Life?

It is a common misconception that individuals with clinical depression should be able to rationalize their sadness, especially when they have a seemingly good life. The truth is that clinical depression often induces prolonged sadness and hopelessness without any apparent reason. For those suffering, the emotional pain is real and feels justified, making it impossible to simply will themselves to feel better.

### Beyond Sadness: The Effects of Clinical Depression

Clinical depression is more than just sadness; it can lead to memory loss, concentration issues, sleep disturbances, physical pain, and fatigue. These symptoms are direct physical manifestations of the illness itself and not merely by-products of poor choices or attitudes. 

### Treatment and Relief

Fortunately, clinical depression can often be effectively treated with medications that target neurotransmitter abnormalities, along with therapies designed to rewire the brain. The National Institute of Mental Health found that around 70% of people who underwent a sequenced treatment approach for clinical depression achieved full remission or significant relief through targeted medications and therapy.

### Common Misconceptions about Mental Illness

#### Are People with Mental Illness Weak?

No, individuals with mental illness are not weak. In fact, facing the challenges of mental illness often requires immense strength. Seeking help and adhering to treatment regimens demonstrates courage and resilience. 

#### Are People with Mental Illness Crazy or Dangerous?

The majority of individuals with mental illnesses do not exhibit dangerous or erratic behaviors. Most people with mental illness lead normal lives and strive to manage their conditions. Stigmas often lead individuals to conceal their struggles, making it appear as though mental illness is less common than it is.

### Conclusion

In summary, mental illnesses are indeed illnesses characterized by complex biological, psychological, and emotional factors. Understanding this reality is essential for fostering empathy, support, and effective treatment for those affected. For every ten friends or relatives, it is likely that two are experiencing or have recently experienced a mental illness, highlighting the need for greater awareness and open dialogue around mental health issues.
