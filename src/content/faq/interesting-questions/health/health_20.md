## How often should hydrogen peroxide be used to treat wounds?

### Introduction

Hydrogen peroxide is a common household antiseptic that many people consider using for treating wounds. However, the evidence from scientific research suggests that it should actually never be used for this purpose due to its detrimental effects on healing.

### The Harmful Effects of Hydrogen Peroxide

Hydrogen peroxide is a highly reactive chemical agent that can kill some bacteria, but its use on wounds is counterproductive. The primary reason for this is that while it can eliminate harmful bacteria, it also causes significant damage to the healthy cells that are crucial for wound healing. This has been recognized by mainstream science for nearly a century.

Historical context underscores this point. During World War I, medical practitioners often used antiseptics, including hydrogen peroxide, on soldiers' wounds. Unfortunately, this practice resulted in alarmingly high infection-related death rates. Biologist Alexander Fleming, noted for his discovery of Penicillin, found that wounds treated with antiseptics had higher death rates and slower healing times compared to those that were left untreated. This discovery was pivotal in changing the understanding of wound care.

### The Evolution of Wound Treatment

Following the findings of Fleming and others, there was a deliberate search for treatments that could effectively combat infectious bacteria without causing harm to healthy cells. This quest culminated in the discovery of Penicillin, a substance that selectively kills bacteria without damaging the body's own cells. The advent of antibiotics marked a significant breakthrough in modern medicine, allowing for effective treatment of both surface wounds and internal bacterial infections.

### Recommendations for Treating Minor Wounds

For minor wounds, it is crucial to avoid the use of antiseptics like hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, or iodine. Instead, the recommended approach is as follows:

1. **Control Bleeding**: Press the wound gently until the bleeding stops.
2. **Rinse with Water**: Clean the wound gently with water to remove any debris.
3. **Apply Antibiotic Ointment**: Use a thin layer of antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin or Polysporin to help maintain moisture at the wound's surface. Although these ointments do not accelerate healing, they can prevent infection and support the bodyâ€™s natural healing process.
4. **Cover the Wound**: Bandage the area to keep out dirt and further contaminants.

According to the Mayo Clinic, "After you clean the wound, apply a thin layer of an antibiotic cream or ointment such as Neosporin or Polysporin to help keep the surface moist." Similarly, the A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia advises the application of antibacterial ointment along with a clean, non-sticking bandage.

### Conclusion

In summary, hydrogen peroxide should **never** be used to treat wounds due to its potential to do more harm than good. Instead, proper wound care involves cleaning, applying antibiotic ointment, and covering the wound to promote healing and prevent infection. For serious wounds, professional medical assistance should always be sought.
