## Why Do Cold Temperatures Give You a Cold?

### Understanding the Relationship Between Cold Temperatures and Illness

Cold temperatures do not directly cause infections, but they certainly have an effect on our health. The common cold is primarily caused by infectious agents such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, with rhinoviruses being the usual culprits, as discussed by Ronald Eccles in his book "Common Cold". 

### Mechanisms of Infection 

To become ill with a cold, an infectious agent must first enter your body and then overpower your immune system. While cold temperatures themselves do not lead to sickness, their impact on our physiological state can exacerbate the likelihood of infection. 

### Effects of Cold on the Immune System

Research by Dr. E. G. Mourtzoukou highlights that cold temperatures have significant effects on infection rates, as detailed in the journal article titled “Exposure to cold and respiratory tract infections.” Here are several key points regarding how cold temperatures influence our health:

1. **Respiratory Function**: Inhaling cold air can impair the performance of your respiratory tract. This underperformance can reduce the body's ability to effectively clear out pathogens.
   
2. **Energy Allocation**: When exposed to cold, your body must divert more energy towards maintaining its core temperature. This diversion leaves less energy available for your immune system to fight off germs. 

3. **Immune Response**: Prolonged exposure to cold can lead to a response from your body that signals the immune system to downgrade its activity. If you have already been exposed to an infection, this reduction in immune function can allow the pathogens to flourish, leading to the onset of illness. 

### Conclusion

In summary, while cold temperatures do not directly cause the common cold, they can create conditions that allow infections to take hold more easily. Therefore, if you begin to feel sick, it is wise to avoid prolonged exposure to cold weather. Always remember: Don’t roll around in the snow without proper clothing if you start to feel unwell, and limit your time outdoors in very cold weather, especially if your respiratory system feels irritated. 

### Bottom Line

The relationship between cold temperatures and illness is complex and multifaceted. Cold weather may not be the root cause of your cold, but it certainly can contribute to a higher risk of falling ill.
