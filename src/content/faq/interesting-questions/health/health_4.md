title: "Do humans give off radiation?"
summary: "Humans emit infrared radiation, a type of thermal radiation given off by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero. This radiation is non-ionizing and harmless, and clothes can block it. While humans may emit trace amounts of other radiation from naturally occurring minerals, these are negligible."

## Do Humans Give Off Radiation?

### Yes, Humans Emit Radiation

Indeed, humans do give off radiation, predominantly in the form of infrared radiation. This type of radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and has a frequency that is lower than that of visible light. However, it is essential to note that this emission is not exclusive to humans; all objects with a non-zero temperature will radiate thermal energy.

### Understanding Thermal Radiation

Thermal radiation encompasses all forms of electromagnetic waves emitted by an object due to its temperature. This includes not only infrared radiation but also radio waves and visible light. The term "thermal radiation" is often confused with infrared radiation because, at comfortable temperatures for humans, most of the emitted thermal radiation occurs in the infrared range.

As the temperature of an object increases, the peak of its thermal radiation shifts to higher frequencies. For instance, the sun, being much hotter than the human body, primarily emits radiation in the visible light and near-infrared spectrum.

### Factors Affecting Radiation Emission

It is important to recognize that the amount of radiation emitted by humans can vary based on several factors. Different individuals emit varying amounts of thermal radiation at different times, primarily indicating differences in skin temperature rather than other characteristics such as body fat, height, or emotional state. For example, thermal imaging captured using infrared cameras reveals the temperature of a person's skin, but it is not capable of diagnosing any underlying medical conditions.

Clothing also plays a significant role in the emission of infrared radiation. A person without a shirt will radiate more heat than one who is clothed due to the insulating properties of fabric.

### Safety of Infrared Radiation

Infrared radiation is classified as non-ionizing radiation, which means it does not possess enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms or molecules, and therefore cannot cause cancer. This is a critical distinction, as we are constantly surrounded by infrared radiation emitted not only by our own bodies but also by various objects in our environment, such as rocks, trees, and furniture.

### Additional Forms of Radiation

While humans primarily emit thermal radiation, they may also release small amounts of other types of radiation due to the ingestion of trace amounts of naturally occurring radioactive materials. For example, foods like Brazil nuts and bananas contain higher concentrations of radioactive elements. However, the levels of radiation from these sources are typically too minuscule to have any noticeable impact on health.

Additionally, during medical procedures that involve radioactive contrast agents, individuals may emit higher levels of radiation for a limited time until the radioactive substances decay. Nevertheless, these levels remain insignificant in terms of everyday health risk.

### Conclusion

In summary, humans do emit radiation, primarily in the form of infrared thermal radiation. This process is a natural result of having a temperature above absolute zero and is influenced by various factors, including clothing and individual body temperature. Infrared radiation is non-ionizing and, thus, poses no cancer risk, while trace exposure to other types of radiation from certain foods or medical procedures is generally negligible.
