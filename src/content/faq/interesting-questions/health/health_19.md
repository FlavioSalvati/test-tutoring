summary: "You're actually exposed to less radiation with your hand in a turned-off microwave than in open air. Microwaves emitted by the oven are non-ionizing, meaning they can't cause cancer. The oven's metal walls block external radiation, so you're safer inside!"

## How much extra radiation am I exposed to if I stick my hand in the microwave right after it turns off?

### Understanding Microwave Radiation

When considering the exposure to radiation from a microwave oven, it's important to understand the nature of microwaves themselves. Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to visible light, but with longer wavelengths. They fall within the frequency range of gigahertz (GHz), which is used in various technologies such as radars, cell phones, and Wi-Fi routers.

### Non-Ionizing Radiation

One of the key points to note is that microwaves are classified as non-ionizing radiation. This means they lack the energy per photon necessary to ionize atoms or break chemical bonds, which are the processes that can lead to cancer and radiation sickness. In fact, the energy per photon of microwaves is significantly lower than that of visible light from a candle or the infrared thermal radiation emitted by your own body.

### Proper Functioning of Microwave Ovens

A properly functioning microwave oven is designed with safety features that prevent it from operating when the door is open. The moment the door is opened, the microwave turns off, and any microwaves that were emitted inside the oven are absorbed almost instantaneously, within microseconds. Therefore, by the time you insert your hand into the microwave after it has turned off, there are no microwaves present to expose you to any additional radiation.

### Comparing Radiation Exposure

Interestingly, because of the metal walls of the microwave oven, which act as a barrier to both keep microwaves contained and block external radiation, your hand inside a non-operating microwave actually receives less radiation than it would in open air. This shielding effect is significant because it minimizes any external radiation from sources such as the sun or cosmic radiation.

### Conclusion

In summary, if you were to stick your hand in a microwave oven immediately after it turns off, you would not be exposed to any extra radiation. In fact, you would be exposed to less radiation than if your hand were in the open air. The radiation levels involved are so low that there is no cause for concern regarding health risks. Thus, the answer is clear: sticking your hand in a microwave right after it turns off does not increase your radiation exposure.
