title: "How does trash in the ocean disappear?"
summary: "Ocean trash doesn't disappear. Biodegradable materials decompose, but plastic, glass, and metal persist. Ocean currents concentrate this debris into patches, like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  Sunlight and ocean motion break down trash into smaller bits, harming marine life and potentially reaching humans through the food chain."

## How does trash in the ocean disappear?

### Overview of Ocean Trash

Much of the trash in the ocean does not actually disappear, leading to significant environmental issues. The ability of materials to degrade varies greatly: biodegradable items such as paper, cardboard, and food waste tend to disintegrate quickly, being consumed by microorganisms present in the ocean. Conversely, materials such as plastic, glass, and metal exhibit much more durability and do not degrade as readily.

### Behavior of Different Materials

- **Biodegradable Materials**: 
  These materials, including paper and food waste, rapidly break down in oceanic environments.
  
- **Non-biodegradable Materials**: 
  Items made from plastic, glass, and metal resist decomposition:
  - **Glass and Metal**: These materials are typically heavy enough to sink to the ocean floor, out of sight.
  - **Plastic**: Most plastic items float on the ocean's surface.

### Ocean Currents and Garbage Patches

Over time, ocean currents play a significant role in the fate of floating trash. They can wash debris ashore or concentrate it into large patches known as oceanic garbage patches. The largest of these is the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch," located in the northern Pacific Ocean, stretching from Japan to California. This patch has two central areas of high trash density: one between Japan and Hawaii, and another between Hawaii and California.

### Formation of Garbage Patches

The formation of garbage patches is a consequence of the ocean's circulating currents, which gather floating debris:
- **Gyres**: These large regions of circulating ocean currents, influenced by the Earth's rotation, create gyres that act like giant, slow-moving whirlpools.
- **Coriolis Force**: The rotation of the Earth generates a force known as the Coriolis force, which influences the movement of ocean currents. In the Northern Hemisphere, the currents move in a clockwise direction, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they move counter-clockwise.

The pressure differentials within these gyres result in a tendency for floating debris to be pushed toward the center, where it accumulates. Unfortunately, this accumulation is not harmless; it poses a threat to marine life and can even affect humans through the food chain.

### Breakdown of Trash

While the trash does not disappear completely, various environmental factors contribute to its gradual breakdown:
- **Ocean Motion**: The churning of ocean waters, along with temperature fluctuations and the high-energy components of sunlight, contribute to the fragmentation of non-biodegradable materials.
- **Size of Debris**: Over time, larger pieces of trash break down into smaller bits, typically ranging in size from microscopic specks to the size of marbles. These fragments often create a thin layer dispersed across the ocean's surface. Some pieces may also be pushed below the surface due to the dynamic movement of water.

In addition to these small bits, larger objects such as sneakers, toothbrushes, and bags may continue to float, as they have yet to degrade significantly.

### Conclusion

In summary, while certain types of trash in the ocean do break down into smaller particles, much of it remains, particularly non-biodegradable materials. The complex interactions of ocean currents, environmental conditions, and the properties of the materials contribute to the persistent issue of oceanic trash, culminating in harmful garbage patches. Addressing this challenge requires a concerted effort to manage waste and protect marine ecosystems.
