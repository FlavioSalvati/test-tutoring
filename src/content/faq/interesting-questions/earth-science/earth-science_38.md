title: "Why is the sky blue?"
summary: "The sky appears blue due to a combination of Rayleigh scattering, the sun's thermal spectrum, atmospheric attenuation, and how our eyes perceive color. While Rayleigh scattering favors violet, the sun emits more blue than violet, and atmospheric absorption removes violet light, making the sky appear blue, not violet."

## Why is the sky blue?

### Introduction
The question of why the sky is blue is often answered simply by referencing Rayleigh scattering, but the full explanation involves a combination of factors. In this discussion, we will explore four key components that contribute to our perception of a blue sky:

1. Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere
2. The incident sunlight spectrum as a thermal distribution
3. Bulk attenuation by the atmosphere
4. The non-linear perception of colors by human eyes and brain

### Rayleigh Scattering in the Atmosphere
Rayleigh scattering occurs when light interacts with particles that are much smaller than its wavelength. In the atmosphere, the primary scatterers are nitrogen ($N_2$) and oxygen ($O_2$) molecules. The intensity of the scattered light, according to physical derivations, is proportional to the fourth power of the frequency of the light, expressed mathematically as:

$$
I \propto f^4
$$

where $I$ is the intensity of the scattered light and $f$ is the frequency. This means that if one color has double the frequency of another, it will be $16$ times brighter after scattering. Since blue and violet light have higher frequencies compared to red and orange, they scatter more strongly. However, if only Rayleigh scattering were at play, the sky would appear violet, not blue.

### The Incident Sunlight Spectrum
Sunlight does not consist of an equal mix of all colors, contrary to popular belief. Instead, it has a thermal (black-body) distribution, with a peak that corresponds to the sun's surface temperature of approximately $5800$ Kelvin. This thermal distribution results in a mixture of colors where red-orange dominates, and blue is present in greater amounts than violet. This disparity helps to explain why we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet.

### Bulk Attenuation by the Atmosphere
As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it undergoes bulk attenuation, meaning it becomes weaker due to scattering. This effect is more pronounced for higher-frequency colors. Consequently, blue and violet light are removed from the sunlight’s forward traveling beam more quickly than lower-frequency colors. During sunset, for instance, the sunlight travels through a greater thickness of atmosphere, causing it to scatter out most of the blue and violet light, leaving predominantly red and orange hues. Therefore, while Rayleigh scattering contributes to the blue sky, bulk attenuation plays a significant role in our overall perception of color.

### Human Perception of Color
Finally, the way our eyes and brain perceive color is non-linear. Human eyes possess three types of color receptors—red, green, and blue. These receptors are sensitive to different wavelengths and overlap in their responses. For example, even if a blue spot and a violet spot are measured to be equally bright, our eyes tend to perceive the blue as brighter. The brain processes the signals from these receptors in a way that combines them to produce our experience of color. Consequently, the spectrum of colors from the sky is mixed by our brains to yield the blue that we see.

### Conclusion
In summary, the blue appearance of the sky is a complex interplay of physical processes and human perception. Rayleigh scattering, the thermal distribution of sunlight, bulk attenuation, and the non-linear processing of color by our eyes all contribute to this phenomenon. Each factor is essential in understanding why, ultimately, we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet or any other color.
