title: "What would happen if you fell into a hole that went through the center of the earth?"
summary: "Falling through a hole to the Earth's center is impossible due to extreme heat and pressure. Even with a protective suit, you'd reach terminal velocity, then oscillate around the center like a yo-yo before stopping. A vacuum would result in a much faster journey, reaching the other side of the Earth."

## What Would Happen If You Fell Into a Hole That Went Through the Center of the Earth?

### Introduction
Imagine a hypothetical scenario where you could dig a perfectly straight hole through the Earth, extending all the way to the center and out the other side. This thought experiment, while fantastical, allows us to explore the effects of gravity, pressure, and temperature as one descends into the Earth. 

### Initial Descent
As you begin your fall into this tunnel, several immediate factors come into play. 

1. **Temperature Increase**: 
   - After falling approximately $1.1 \, \text{km}$ (or $0.02\%$ of the way to Earth's center), the temperature rises to around $320 \, \text{K}$. This extreme heat would likely result in heat stroke.
   - Continuing deeper, at about $2.7 \, \text{km}$ (or $0.04\%$ of the way), the temperature reaches $400 \, \text{K}$, causing bodily fluids to boil away.

2. **Increased Pressure**: 
   - At a depth of $25.3 \, \text{km}$ (or $0.4\%$ of the way), the pressure becomes approximately $20 \, \text{atm}$. This pressure arises from the air above you and would crush any remaining bodily structure.

3. **Incineration**: 
   - By the time you reach $200 \, \text{km}$ depth (or $3\%$ of the way), the temperature escalates to about $1200 \, \text{K}$, incinerating any remains into dust.

After this, your remains would continue to fall for an additional $6200 \, \text{km}$ (or $97\%$ of the way) to the Earth's center, facing toxic chemicals and ionizing radiation along the way. 

### Theoretical Protective Suit
Now, let's consider a scenario where you wear a futuristic suit that protects you from all adverse effects of heat, pressure, toxic gases, and radiation. 

1. **Acceleration and Speed**: 
   - You would accelerate due to gravity, reaching a maximum speed of approximately $200 \, \text{km/h}$ (or $120 \, \text{mph}$) after about $10$ seconds of free fall, having fallen $0.5 \, \text{km}$ (or $0.008\%$ of the way to the center).
   - As you continue to fall, gravity weakens because more of the Earth's mass is above you, resulting in a decrease in your acceleration. The increasing air pressure also contributes to a reduction in your speed.

2. **Reaching the Center**: 
   - After about a week of falling, you would reach the center of the Earth. At this point, the gravitational force is effectively zero, as the mass of the Earth pulls equally in all directions.
   - You would find yourself moving through an extremely dense air medium, akin to moving through soup. Your momentum would cause you to overshoot the center and begin to ascend back towards the other side of the Earth.

### Oscillation and Stopping
This oscillatory motion resembles that of a yo-yo or a swing. You would continue to overshoot the center due to your momentum, only to fall back again. Eventually, due to the dense air, you would lose momentum and stop floating at the center of the Earth.

### Evacuated Tunnel Scenario
If the tunnel were completely evacuated of air:

1. **Acceleration Without Air Resistance**: 
   - In this case, you would accelerate rapidly and could potentially reach speeds in the tens of thousands of kilometers per hour. The journey to the Earth's center would take only minutes or hours instead of weeks.
   
2. **Emerging on the Other Side**: 
   - As you passed the center, you would be decelerated by Earth's gravity, coming to a stop just as you emerge from the hole on the opposite side of the Earth. This outcome aligns with the principles of energy conservation: starting from rest on one side would mean you end at rest on the other, assuming no energy losses.

### Conclusion
Through this exploration of falling into a hole through the Earth, we see that the physical realities of temperature, pressure, and gravity would create insurmountable challenges for any living being. The scenario illustrates the fascinating interplay of fundamental physics, highlighting why such a journey remains firmly in the realm of theoretical exploration.
