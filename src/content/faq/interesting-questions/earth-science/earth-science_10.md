Water in aquifers moves slowly, taking years to flow back to the surface. Wells are dug deep enough to reach below the water table, the boundary between saturated and unsaturated ground."

## How do wells get their water from underground rivers?

### Introduction

The common misconception that wells draw water from underground rivers is not entirely accurate. In fact, most wells extract water from aquifers, which are layers of rock and soil that contain water flowing through their small pores. This article will explore how wells function, the nature of underground water, and the concept of aquifers.

### Understanding Aquifers

Aquifers are not large subterranean rivers; instead, they consist of water that seeps slowly through the tiny spaces within rocks, between rocks, and among loose materials such as sand and gravel. This process of groundwater movement is gradual, with water sometimes taking years to centuries to reach the surface. For instance, a typical flow rate for water in aquifers is about $10$ feet per year. Consequently, even if a region experiences a few weeks without rain, the wells do not run dry immediately.

### The Movement of Water

New water, sourced from rainfall or melting snow, infiltrates the ground through the pores and cracks in the rocks and soil. Some of this water adheres to the soil and rock particles close to the surface, while the rest continues to percolate downwards. The layer of ground just beneath the surface is a blend of rock, soil, water, and air bubbles. As gravity pulls the water deeper, it fills all available pores and cracks, which in turn forces the air bubbles upwards. At this point, the ground becomes saturated with water.

The boundary that separates the unsaturated ground from the saturated ground is known as the water table. The precise location of this water table depends on several factors, including the amount of new water available, the rate at which water is flowing away, and the permeability of the ground.

### The Mechanics of Wells

When a hole is dug into the ground above the water table, most of the water at that depth is retained by the soil and rock, resulting in little water draining into the hole. However, if the hole is dug deep enough to reach below the water table, gravity pulls the water from the saturated ground into the empty space at the bottom of the hole. In this scenario, the hole will fill with water that seeps in through the openings in the rocks but will only rise to the level of the water table. For the water in the hole to rise above the water table, it would need to flow upwards, which contradicts the direction of gravitational pull.

A "well" is essentially a hole that has been dug deep enough to penetrate below the water table, allowing it to fill with water. Historically, wells utilized simple buckets on ropes to extract water, while modern wells employ pumps that draw the water upwards. These pumps can be powered manually, by windmills, or by electric motors. When drilling a new well, it is not necessary to locate an underground river; one simply needs to dig deep enough to reach below the water table.

### Confined Aquifers and Flowing Artesian Wells

An intriguing phenomenon occurs when a layer of impermeable rock lies above a water-filled permeable rock layer, particularly if the impermeable rock is sloped downward. In this situation, the water in the lower level becomes trapped by the impermeable upper layer, resulting in a confined aquifer. As water flows downward with no outlet, pressure begins to build. If a hole is drilled deep enough to reach this confined aquifer, the pressure can be sufficient to push the water upward, resulting in a well that does not require a pump to bring water to the surface. Such a well is referred to as a flowing artesian well.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the idea of wells drawing water from underground rivers is an engaging image, the reality is that wells primarily source their water from aquifers. Understanding the structure and dynamics of aquifers, the water table, and the mechanisms of well function is crucial to grasping how we access groundwater resources.
