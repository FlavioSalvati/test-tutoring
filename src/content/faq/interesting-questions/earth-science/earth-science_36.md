title: "Why don't the gases in the atmosphere separate out according to mass?"
summary: "Earth's atmosphere doesn't fully separate by gas mass due to mixing, chemical reactions, and molecular diffusion. While gravity pulls heavier gases down, constant air movement in the lower atmosphere prevents separation.  In the upper atmosphere, diffusion and reactions contribute to a partial separation."

## Why Don't the Gases in the Atmosphere Separate Out According to Mass?

### Understanding Atmospheric Composition and Behavior

The gases present in Earth's atmosphere do exhibit a tendency to separate based on their molecular mass. This phenomenon is observable in various layers of the atmosphere, where different gases can be found at varying altitudes. For instance, heavier gases like molecular nitrogen ($N_2$), molecular oxygen ($O_2$), and argon ($Ar$) are primarily concentrated in the lower to middle atmosphere, while lighter gases such as helium ($He$) and hydrogen ($H_2$) are more abundant in the upper atmosphere. However, the overall separation is not absolute due to several factors that influence gas behavior.

### The Role of Atmospheric Layers

The atmosphere is structured in layers:

1. **Troposphere**: Extending from the ground to about $15 \, km$, this layer contains most of Earth's weather phenomena and is characterized by a continuous mixing of gases. Despite the presence of different gases, the proportions of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon remain relatively constant due to aggressive mixing.

2. **Stratosphere**: Ranging from $15 \, km$ to $50 \, km$, this layer contains the ozone layer and is where gas mixing persists but to a lesser degree than in the troposphere.

3. **Mesosphere**: Extending from $50 \, km$ to $90 \, km$, this layer also exhibits a mix of gases similar to the lower layers.

4. **Thermosphere**: This layer, from $90 \, km$ to $800 \, km$, exhibits weaker mixing and allows for partial separation of gases according to mass.

5. **Exosphere**: Extending from $800 \, km$ to about $190,000 \, km$, this outermost layer experiences negligible mixing, resulting in more distinct separation of gases.

### Mechanisms Preventing Full Separation

The incomplete separation of gases in the atmosphere can be attributed to three main mechanisms:

1. **Aggressive Mixing**: 
   - In the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, the bulk motion of air caused by various factors such as Earth's rotation, thermal convection, and the daily cycle of sunlight leads to significant mixing of gases. This is similar to shaking a bottle filled with sand, water, and oil; the contents remain blended rather than settling into layers. Thus, the continual stirring prevents separation by mass.

2. **Chemical Reactions**:
   - The composition of atmospheric gases is not static. Various reactions occur that can create or transform molecules. For example, ozone ($O_3$) is formed in the stratosphere when ultraviolet light splits $O_2$ molecules into individual oxygen atoms, which then react to form ozone. These reactions can lead to concentrations of certain gases at different altitudes that do not correspond to their molecular mass.

3. **Molecular Diffusion**:
   - At higher altitudes, particularly above $100 \, km$, molecular diffusion becomes the dominant mechanism. Gases expand to fill their containers, and as molecules move and collide, they spread out. This random motion allows some lighter molecules to rise higher than they would under the influence of gravity alone. Consequently, even in the thermosphere and exosphere, some level of mixing occurs, preventing full separation.

### Conclusion

In summary, while gases in the atmosphere do separate partially according to their molecular mass due to gravitational effects, complete separation is hindered by aggressive mixing in the lower layers, ongoing chemical reactions, and molecular diffusion in the upper layers. The collective interplay of these mechanisms results in a dynamic and complex atmospheric composition that does not conform strictly to the expectations set by molecular mass alone.
