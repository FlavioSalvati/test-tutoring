title: "Is a quadruple rainbow possible?"
summary: "Yes, quadruple rainbows are possible, though extremely rare. They occur when direct sunlight and sunlight reflected by a large surface, like a lake, create two sets of primary and secondary rainbows. While a third-order rainbow is difficult to see, a lake reflecting sunlight acts like a second sun, creating a visible quadruple rainbow."

## Is a Quadruple Rainbow Possible?

### Overview

Yes, although very rare, it is indeed possible for a human to see four natural rainbows simultaneously in the sky. To understand this phenomenon, we must first delve into how rainbows are formed.

### How Rainbows Form

A rainbow occurs when white sunlight scatters off raindrops in the air. The process can be broken down into a few key steps:

1. **Refraction**: When sunlight enters a raindrop, it bends (or refracts) due to the different speeds of light in air and water.
2. **Reflection**: The light reflects off the inner surface of the raindrop.
3. **Exiting**: The light refracts again as it exits the raindrop.

The result is a display of colors, which are seen at different angles. The primary rainbow (the most vivid) forms when sunlight reflects once off the inner back surface of the raindrop. 

### Secondary and Higher-Order Rainbows

In addition to the primary rainbow, light can reflect multiple times within the raindrop:

- **Secondary Rainbow**: This arises when light reflects twice inside the raindrop. It has a larger radius than the primary rainbow and the color order is reversed. The secondary rainbow is typically much fainter than the primary due to the loss of light with each reflection.
  
- **Higher-Order Rainbows**: It is theoretically possible to have third-order and fourth-order rainbows, which occur from three and four reflections, respectively. However, these higher-order rainbows are exceedingly faint and are almost never visible to the naked eye. 

### Observing Quadruple Rainbows

So, how can one see four rainbows at once? 

1. **Direct Sunlight**:
   - **Primary Rainbow**: From direct sunlight with one reflection.
   - **Secondary Rainbow**: From direct sunlight with two reflections.

2. **Reflected Sunlight**: When sunlight reflects off a large, flat surface, like a lake:
   - **Reflection Primary Rainbow**: This arises from sunlight reflecting off the lake with one reflection.
   - **Reflection Secondary Rainbow**: This arises from sunlight reflecting off the lake with two reflections.

This phenomenon results in four rainbows:
- Primary and Secondary from direct sunlight.
- Primary and Secondary from sunlight reflected off the lake.

### Theoretical Possibilities

In principle, one could even see six rainbows if there are two different reflecting surfaces (e.g., a glacier and a lake), creating the effect of three suns. However, such occurrences remain exceedingly rare.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the occurrence of a quadruple rainbow is unusual, it is indeed possible under the right atmospheric conditions and reflective surfaces. The four rainbows consist of two sets formed from both direct sunlight and sunlight reflected off a surface, showcasing the fascinating interplay of light, angle, and medium.
