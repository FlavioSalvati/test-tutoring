summary: "Clouds aren't filled with water, they're mostly air! Tiny water droplets or ice crystals, suspended by air resistance, make up a cloud. These droplets are so small, they reflect light, making clouds appear visually striking despite being mostly air."

## How Does a Cloud Fill Up with Water?

### Understanding the Nature of Clouds

Strictly speaking, a cloud does not fill up with water. First of all, a cloud is not a sponge made out of some other material which soaks up water. The water in a cloud is the cloud. More accurately, a cloud consists of very small liquid water drops or ice crystals suspended in air. The water drops and ice crystals that make up a cloud are floating not because they are soaked up by some sponge-like material that is holding them in place. Rather, the water drops and ice crystals that make up a cloud float because they are so small that the air resistance balances out gravity.

To be more precise, the water drops and ice crystals that make up a cloud do not actually float motionless in the sky. Instead, they are constantly falling very slowly under the influence of gravity and are occasionally lofted upwards by an updraft of wind. This falling and updrafting motion of the drops/crystals that make up a cloud is so slow, and clouds are so big and far away, that it is hard for a casual human observer on the ground to notice this motion. 

As stated in the book "Cloud Physics" by Louis J. Battan, "A droplet of 10-micron radius falls at a speed of $1 \text{ cm/sec}$ [or $0.02 \text{ mph}$], while droplets of $50 \text{ micron}$ radius fall at a speed of $26 \text{ cm/sec}$ [or $0.6 \text{ mph}$]." When the drops of liquid water or ice that make up a cloud increase in size through collisions and coalescence, they can get so big that the air resistance can no longer counter gravity (when $r > 0.1 \text{ mm}$). Such droplets fall down as rain.

### The Composition of Clouds

Secondly, clouds are not full of water; they are mostly full of air. When we say a bucket is filled with water, we mean that just about every available space in the bucket contains water. In a cloud, every available space definitely does not contain water. The water making up a cloud falls down as rain long before it coalesces enough to fill the entire volume of a cloud. Amazingly, only one billionth of the volume of a cloud consists of water. This means that for every one cubic nanometer of a cloud containing water, there are about a billion cubic nanometers in the cloud that contain just air. 

The book "Color and Light in Nature" by David K. Lynch and William Charles Livingston states, "Despite their impressive visibility, clouds are tenuous beings. A cumulus may have $1000$ droplets per cubic centimeter, but these drops are minute and comparatively widely spaced. Water makes up less than one billionth ($10^{-9}$) of the cloud's apparent volume and contributes only about one millionth of a gram per cubic centimeter to its density." 

### Why Are Clouds Visually Striking?

How can clouds be so visually striking when they are mostly invisible air? The key is that light reflects off the surface of objects. The more surface area, the more that light gets reflected. It is the same reason that pure solid ice is mostly clear but snow (which is just ice in small complex shapes) is bright white. While a cloud does not contain a lot of water in terms of total volume, the water it does contain is divided among trillions of small droplets, leading to many reflecting surfaces.

For example, assume for simplicity that a cloud consists of water droplets that are all the same size with radius $r$ and are distributed uniformly. Suppose the total volume of the cloud is fixed at $V_{\text{cloud}}$ and the total volume of the water in this cloud is fixed at $V_{w}$. Since the volume of a single spherical drop of water is given by:

$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3,
$$

the number of drops $n$ in the cloud times this drop volume gives us the total water volume in the cloud:

$$
V_{w} = n \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3.
$$

Similarly, the surface area of one sphere is:

$$
A = 4 \pi r^2,
$$

so the total droplet surface area in the whole cloud is:

$$
A_{\text{total}} = n \cdot 4 \pi r^2.
$$

Solving the volume equation for $n$ and substituting the result into the area equation, we find:

$$
A_{\text{total}} = \frac{3V_{w}}{r}.
$$

Since the total water volume is fixed, this equation tells us that as the radius of each drop goes down, the total droplet surface area goes up. For small cloud droplet sizes, the total cloud droplet surface area jumps up to very high values. Since the amount of light reflected by an object depends strongly on its surface area, the large total cloud droplet surface area allows a cloud to be bright despite being mostly air.

### Conclusion

In summary, clouds do not fill up with water in the traditional sense; rather, they are composed of a small amount of water suspended in a vast volume of air. The fascinating interplay between the size of water droplets, their distribution, and the resulting surface area plays a critical role in how we perceive clouds visually, despite their seemingly low water content.
