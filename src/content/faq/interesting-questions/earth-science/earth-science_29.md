## Why did so many people believe the world is flat when it is obviously a sphere?

### Understanding the Shape of the Earth

The earth is not a perfect sphere; rather, it is classified as an **oblate spheroid**. This means that it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the equatorial diameter of the earth is approximately $43 \text{ km}$ larger than that at the poles. This bulging at the equator is a result of the **centrifugal force** generated by the earth's spinning motion. 

To visualize this, consider how spinning pizza dough flattens as it rotates. This centrifugal force is not merely a theoretical concept; it is a real phenomenon experienced in a non-inertial frame of reference. However, it's worth noting that the earth's surface is not a perfectly smooth oblate spheroid due to geographical features such as mountains, oceans, hills, and canyons. Nevertheless, these deviations from the ideal shape account for only about $0.001\%$ of the earth's radius, making the oblate spheroid model a very good approximation.

### The Myth of a Flat Earth

It is important to clarify that the belief in a flat earth is largely a myth. Historian **Jeffrey Burton Russell** argues that virtually nobody truly believed the earth was flat throughout history. In fact, as far back as the ancient Greeks, the understanding that the earth is round was well established. For example, around $240 \text{ BC}$, the mathematician **Eratosthenes** calculated the earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy using shadows and basic geometry, all without leaving Egypt.

Moreover, the famous explorer **Christopher Columbus** did not embark on his historic voyage to demonstrate that the earth was round. Instead, he sought a faster route to the Indies by sailing west, fully aware that a spherical earth allowed for alternate routes. The widespread narrative that people once believed in a flat earth was largely popularized by authors such as Draper and Dickson, who exaggerated the supposed conflict between religion and science to create a more dramatic historical narrative.

### Conclusion

In summary, the belief in a flat earth is more of a cultural myth than a historical reality. The scientific understanding of the earth's shape has progressed significantly since ancient times, and while it is technically an oblate spheroid, the notion that people once widely believed in a flat earth oversimplifies the historical context and the intellectual achievements of earlier civilizations.
