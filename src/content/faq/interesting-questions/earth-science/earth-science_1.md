title: "Can it rain fish?"
summary: "Yes, fish can fall from the sky!  Tornadoes over water (waterspouts) suck up fish and deposit them miles away, often encased in ice.  This rare phenomenon, known as "raining fish," occurs about 40 times a year."

## Can It Rain Fish?

### Introduction
Yes, it can indeed rain fish, although such occurrences are quite rare. The phenomenon of fish falling from the sky is not due to the condensation of water vapor, as one might think with typical rainfall. Instead, these fish have a different origin: they were once swimming in bodies of water before being lifted into the atmosphere.

### The Mechanism Behind Fish Rain
The primary cause of fish raining down is associated with tornadoes. When tornadoes pass over lakes or oceans, they can form what are known as waterspouts. These waterspouts have the ability to suck up not only water but also any aquatic life present, including fish. 

1. **Waterspouts and Tornadoes**: As the tornado's vortex forms, it creates a powerful upward draft that pulls creatures from the water's surface. Once inside the tornado, the fish and other marine life are transported into the clouds.

2. **Fall from the Sky**: Eventually, the wind speed decreases, causing the fish to fall back to the ground, potentially miles away from where they originated. This process can lead to a surprising and unusual spectacle.

### Frequency and Types of Creatures
According to Bill Evans' meteorology book titled *It's Raining Fish and Spiders*, it has been reported that creatures fall from the sky approximately $40$ times a year. While fish and frogs are the most commonly reported, other creatures such as snakes, worms, crabs, and even squid and alligators have also been known to rain down.

### The Dangers of Falling Wildlife
Interestingly, during the ascent into the clouds, these creatures can become encased in ice or hail. This can pose significant dangers, as falling blocks of ice containing wildlife may smash through car windshields or pose risks to pedestrians. Therefore, if one witnesses wildlife falling from the sky, it is advisable to seek shelter indoors immediately.

### Conclusion
In summary, while it may sound fantastical, it is indeed possible for fish to rain from the sky due to the powerful forces of tornadoes and waterspouts. This unusual meteorological event showcases the extraordinary interactions between weather systems and aquatic life, reminding us of the wonders and occasional peculiarities of our natural world.
