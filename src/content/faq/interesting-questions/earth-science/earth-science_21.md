## What Makes Rain Drops Tear Shaped?

### Understanding the Shape of Raindrops

The common misconception that raindrops are tear-shaped is a result of their behavior when they interact with surfaces, rather than their actual shape during free fall. In reality, raindrops, particularly when they are larger, are predominantly spherical in shape. As noted by James E. McDonald in his article "The Shape and Aerodynamics of Large Raindrops," raindrops can even take on unusual shapes, such as flattened spheres or "hamburger" shapes, when they reach significant sizes.

### The Role of Air Resistance

When raindrops fall through the air, one might assume that the air resistance would elongate them into a teardrop shape, leading to a tail. However, this is not the case. The air flowing around the drop exerts a force that primarily flattens the front of the drop, rather than pulling it back and creating a tail. This phenomenon can be understood through the dynamics of fluid flow and the effects of drag.

1. **Small Raindrops:** For smaller raindrops, the effect of air resistance is minimal, allowing them to remain nearly spherical. The balance of forces acting on the drop results in a stable, rounded shape.
  
2. **Larger Raindrops:** As raindrops grow larger, the shape can change to a certain extent, but they do not develop the elongated tear shape that many might expect. Instead, they may appear more flattened due to the same air resistance that affects their falling motion.

### The Misconception of Tear Shapes

The tear-shaped appearance that many associate with raindrops often occurs when the drops are streaking down a surface, like a window or skin. In this context, friction plays a crucial role. The surface creates enough friction to drag some of the water back, forming a tail that resembles the shape of a tear. Thus, while raindrops are falling through the air, they are not tear-shaped; they only appear that way due to their interaction with surfaces that create friction.

### Conclusion

In summary, raindrops are predominantly spherical while falling through the air due to the balance of forces acting upon them. The tear shape that is often imagined arises from the interaction with surfaces that induce friction, which is not a factor in the open air. Understanding these dynamics clarifies why raindrops appear tear-shaped under certain conditions but are fundamentally round in free fall.
