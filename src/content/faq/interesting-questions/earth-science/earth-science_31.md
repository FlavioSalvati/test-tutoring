## Why does a magnetic compass point to the Geographic North Pole?

### Understanding the Difference Between Magnetic and Geographic Poles

A magnetic compass does not actually point to the geographic North Pole. Instead, it points toward the earth's magnetic poles, which differ from the geographic poles. This distinction is crucial for understanding how compasses function.

The magnetic pole that is located near the geographic North Pole is referred to as the south magnetic pole. This might sound counterintuitive, but it aligns with the fundamental principle of magnetism: opposites attract. In the context of a compass, the north end of the magnet is attracted to the south magnetic pole, which is situated close to the geographic North Pole.

### The Nature of Earth's Magnetic Field

The behavior of magnetic field lines is essential for understanding the compass's functionality. Outside of a permanent magnet, magnetic field lines always flow from the north magnetic pole to the south magnetic pole. Consequently, the magnetic field lines of the earth run from the southern geographic hemisphere toward the northern geographic hemisphere.

To visualize this, consider the Earth as a spinning object, where the geographic North and South Poles represent the points where the earth's rotation axis intersects the surface. Imagine holding a tennis ball between your thumb and forefinger and pushing on the side to make it spin. The points where your thumb and finger make contact correspond to the geographic North and South Poles of the tennis ball's rotation.

### The Motion of the Earth and Magnetic Poles

It's important to note that a person standing on the equator experiences the highest speed due to the Earth's rotation, while someone at either of the geographic poles remains stationary regarding this rotation. 

The magnetic poles, on the other hand, are defined by the central regions where magnetic field lines begin and terminate. The geographic and magnetic poles do not align perfectly because they are the result of different physical phenomena. Specifically, Earth's magnetic field is generated by circulating currents of liquid iron in the outer core.

### Current Position of the Magnetic Poles

Moreover, the magnetic poles are not fixed; they are in constant motion relative to the geographic poles. Presently, the magnetic south pole is located approximately ten degrees away from the geographic North Pole, in the Arctic Ocean north of Alaska. This means that the north end of a compass currently points roughly toward Alaska rather than directly toward geographic north.

In summary, while a magnetic compass may seem to point toward the Geographic North Pole, it is actually directed toward the south magnetic pole, which is located nearby. This distinction is vital for navigation and understanding Earth's magnetic characteristics.
