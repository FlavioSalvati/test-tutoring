title: "What is the difference between a chemical process and a physical process in chemistry?"
summary: "There is no fundamental difference between chemical and physical processes in chemistry. All processes involving atom interactions are chemical, including phase changes. Even dissolving salt in water is a chemical reaction.  The term "physical process" is too broad to be useful, as all observable processes are physical."

## What is the difference between a chemical process and a physical process in chemistry?

### Introduction

The distinction between chemical processes and physical processes in chemistry is often considered a fundamental one, but this perspective can be misleading. In reality, the difference is more a matter of pedagogical convenience than a true scientific boundary. 

### Defining Chemical and Physical Processes

Some educators define a **chemical process** as any process that involves a chemical reaction, whereas all other processes are categorized as **physical processes**. For example:

- **Chemical processes** might include burning fuels or rusting metal.
- **Physical processes** might encompass dissolving salt in water or freezing water into ice.

However, this distinction is somewhat arbitrary and does not truly reflect the underlying reality of atomic interactions that govern all such processes.

### The Chemical Nature of Dissolving and Phase Changes

Take the example of dissolving salt in water. This process involves:

1. Two distinct reactants: salt and water.
2. The binding of atoms in new configurations, resulting in the formation of a new substance: saltwater. 

In this case, heat is exchanged with the environment, which is a hallmark of chemical reactions. Despite its simplicity, dissolving salt is indeed a chemical process.

Even changes in phase, such as the transition from liquid water to solid ice, are fundamentally chemical. When water freezes, the molecules undergo a transformation:

- Starting configuration in liquid form changes as they bond in a solid state.
- Energy is released during this bond formation process.

While the basic chemical equation for freezing water, $H_2O \rightarrow H_2O$, may seem uninformative, a more detailed representation, $H_2O(\text{liquid}) - \text{heat} \rightarrow H_2O(\text{solid})$, highlights the critical bond formation that takes place.

### Everyday Experiences and Chemical Interactions

Many everyday activities, such as kicking a football, singing, or even writing, are fundamentally chemical processes, as they involve interactions at the atomic level. In fact, the only processes that are not chemical in nature are gravitational processes and those involving nuclear or subatomic particles.

### The Vague Concept of Physical Processes

The term "physical process" is ambiguous and often unhelpful. All observable phenomena in the universe are inherently physical, encompassing not just chemical processes but also biological, geological, and astronomical events. 

As noted in the book "Misconceptions in Chemistry" by Hans-Dieter Barke, traditional educational practices tend to separate chemical reactions from physical processes, often leading to confusion. For instance, when sodium hydroxide dissolves in water, it releases heat and creates a conductive solution, which is an exothermic reaction that signifies a transformation of matter. This example demonstrates why the separation into "chemical" and "physical" processes is not only arbitrary but also misleading.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the distinction between chemical and physical processes is not as clear-cut as it may appear. All processes that involve atomic interactions are inherently chemical, while the term "physical process" may not adequately reflect the complexity of these interactions. By recognizing this, we can avoid fostering misconceptions in education and gain a deeper understanding of chemistry as a whole.
