title: "Why don't metals burn?"
summary: "Metals do burn, but it's not easy.  They need high temperatures and lots of oxygen.  Solid metal objects don't burn easily because they have a high ignition temperature, are good thermal conductors, and oxygen can't easily reach the metal atoms.  To get them to burn, grind the metal into powder and mix it with an oxidizer."

## Why Don't Metals Burn?

### Introduction

The question of why metals don’t seem to burn in everyday situations is a fascinating one that blends chemistry and physics. While it might appear at first glance that metals are non-combustible, the reality is that metals can and do burn under the right conditions. This article will explore the complexities behind metal combustion and the factors that influence their flammability.

### Do Metals Burn?

Indeed, metals can burn, and they often release a significant amount of heat when they do. A prime example of this is thermite, which is a mixture used to weld train rails together. In thermite, aluminum serves as the fuel. When it burns, the aluminum atoms bond with oxygen atoms in the air to form aluminum oxide, releasing a considerable amount of heat and light in the process. 

Moreover, hand-held sparklers utilize metals like aluminum, magnesium, or iron as their fuel source. The flames produced by these metals differ markedly from those of organic materials such as wood, as metal flames tend to burn hotter, quicker, and more completely. Fireworks commonly contain metal fuels, and old flash tubes used in photography were essentially burning magnesium encased in glass. Even the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters employed aluminum as fuel. Some metals, like sodium, burn so readily that they are not used in everyday objects. Any boy scout who has used steel wool to start a fire can attest to the fact that metals can indeed burn.

### Why Don't Everyday Metals Burn?

Despite the fact that metals can burn, many solid metal objects do not catch fire under normal conditions. There are three primary factors that contribute to this phenomenon:

#### 1. Accessibility of Oxygen

The first factor is that solid chunks of metal often have limited access to oxygen molecules. For a metal to burn, each metal atom must come into close proximity with an oxygen atom to react. In solid metal objects, like spoons or pots, the majority of the metal atoms are deeply embedded and lack direct access to oxygen. 

In contrast, organic materials such as wood can easily vaporize and release fuel particles into the air, where they can readily encounter oxygen atoms. This vaporization is crucial because it allows organic fuels to ignite more easily. Solid metals, however, are tightly bound together, making it challenging to vaporize them. Additionally, unlike organic materials, raw metals do not contain their own oxygen, which makes them even less likely to ignite in everyday circumstances.

To facilitate combustion in metals, one can grind them into a fine powder. In industrial and commercial applications, metals are often utilized in powdered form. However, even powdered metals often require more than just the oxygen present in ambient air for efficient burning. Since air is predominantly nitrogen (which does not support combustion), it is more effective to mix powdered metals with solid compounds that contain loosely bound oxygen atoms. For instance, thermite consists of aluminum powder mixed with iron oxide, providing a more stable source of oxygen for the reaction.

#### 2. High Ignition Temperature

The second reason metals do not easily burn in everyday situations is that they generally have a higher ignition temperature. The atoms in metals are tightly bound, which means it requires a significant amount of energy to break their bonds and allow them to react with oxygen, even when oxygen is readily available. Common flames—such as those from candles or kitchen stoves—often do not reach the required temperatures to ignite most metals, even if they are in powdered form. 

To ignite metals effectively, a chemical reaction that generates higher temperatures is often needed. For example, magnesium strips can be used to ignite thermite due to their ability to reach higher combustion temperatures.

#### 3. Thermal Conductivity

Lastly, metals are excellent thermal conductors. This means that if a certain area of a metal object begins to heat up, the heat will quickly dissipate throughout the metal, preventing localized areas from reaching the ignition temperature necessary for combustion. Even when using a high-temperature heat source, such as a flame torch, it remains challenging to ignite a solid piece of metal because the heat conducts away rapidly.

### Conclusion

In summary, the limited accessibility of oxygen to the majority of atoms in solid metal, the high ignition temperatures required to initiate combustion, and the excellent thermal conductivity of metals all contribute to their apparent inability to burn in everyday situations. To effectively ignite metals, one must grind them into a powder, mix them with an oxidizer, contain them to prevent heat loss, and apply a high-temperature ignition source. Understanding these principles provides insight into the fascinating world of metal combustion and its applications in various industries.
