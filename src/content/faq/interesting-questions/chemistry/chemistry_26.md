summary: "Pencils don't contain lead, they contain graphite, a form of carbon.  The name "lead" stuck because people mistook it for lead in the 1600s.  Graphite's layered structure makes it easy to write with and a good lubricant."

## Why is Lead Used in Pencils Even Though Lead is Poisonous?

### Introduction

One common misconception is that the "lead" in pencils is actually lead, the toxic metal. However, this is not the case. The core of a pencil is made of a material known as graphite, which is a form of solid carbon. This misunderstanding has historical roots, and the name "pencil lead" has simply persisted over time.

### Historical Context

The use of graphite in pencils dates back to the 1600s, when the first users discovered the substance while mining in the hills. This material was found to be an excellent writing tool, although its chemical nature was not understood at the time. During this period, graphite was erroneously thought to be a type of lead due to its similar writing properties and darker appearance. This led to the term "black lead," which was eventually shortened to just "lead."

In 1779, the German chemist K. W. Scheele correctly identified the substance in pencils as pure carbon. A decade later, A. G. Werner proposed the term "graphite," derived from the Greek word "graphein," meaning "to write." This established a clearer distinction between the toxic metal lead and the harmless material used in pencils.

### The Composition of Graphite

Carbon, the sixth element in the periodic table, is well known for its versatility in forming various compounds. It is fundamental to both fuels and biological molecules. Graphite is one of the pure forms of carbon, and its structure is quite unique. 

In graphite, carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal lattice, forming sheets that are one atom thick. Each carbon atom in these sheets bonds strongly to three neighboring carbon atoms, creating a robust internal structure. However, the sheets themselves are held together by weak forces, allowing them to slide past one another easily. This characteristic gives graphite its slippery feel and makes it particularly effective for writing, as the carbon sheets can easily fragment and transfer onto paper.

### Conclusion

In summary, the term "pencil lead" is a historical misnomer. Pencils are made of graphite, a form of carbon, and have never contained the toxic metal lead. The properties of graphite, including its unique sheet structure, make it an ideal writing material. Understanding this distinction not only clarifies the composition of pencils but also highlights the fascinating history of how materials are named and classified in the field of chemistry.
