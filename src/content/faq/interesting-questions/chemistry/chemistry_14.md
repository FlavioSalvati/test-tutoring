## What Made the Hole in the Ozone Go Away?

### Introduction to the Ozone Hole

The phenomenon known as the "hole in the ozone" over Antarctica has garnered significant attention due to its implications for environmental health and human safety. While it is important to note that the hole still exists, it is no longer the severe threat it once posed. According to a NASA press release from October 2012, the appearance and disappearance of the ozone hole each year is influenced by a complex interplay of seasonal weather patterns.

### The Role of Ozone

Ozone, a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms, plays a critical role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Without this protective layer, increased UV radiation could lead to a higher incidence of skin cancer and other health issues. 

### Historical Context of Ozone Depletion

During the 1980s and 1990s, research revealed that the ozone layer was being significantly depleted. One of the major contributors to this depletion was man-made chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), commonly found in aerosol cans and refrigerants. The deleterious effects of CFCs on the ozone layer prompted urgent action.

### Regulatory Measures

In response to the growing evidence of ozone depletion, the United States implemented a ban on the use of CFCs in aerosol cans as early as 1978. This regulatory action was not isolated; other countries followed suit, enacting similar bans on CFCs. These measures were part of a broader international effort to mitigate ozone layer damage.

### Current Status of the Ozone Hole

As a result of these concerted legal and regulatory efforts, the ozone hole has ceased its expansion and is gradually showing signs of recovery, moving slowly back toward its state as it was in the 1980s. While the hole in the ozone is described more accurately as a region of partial depletion rather than a complete absence of ozone, the progress made is significant.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the hole in the ozone over Antarctica is still present, it is no longer the alarming threat it once was due to the global response to CFC usage. The combination of awareness, research, and international cooperation has led to a positive trend in the healing of the ozone layer, demonstrating the effectiveness of regulatory measures in addressing environmental challenges.
