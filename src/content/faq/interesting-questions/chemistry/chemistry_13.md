## What Kind of Crystal Are Crystal Drinking Glasses Made Out Of?

### Understanding the Terminology

The term "crystal" in "crystal drinking glasses" can be quite misleading. Contrary to what one might assume, these glasses are not made from actual crystal. Instead, they are a type of glass that has undergone specific modifications to enhance its visual appeal. This naming convention stems from a historical tradition that has perpetuated confusion regarding the material's true nature.

### The Nature of Glass and Crystal

To clarify, a crystal is defined as a material with its molecules arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. This includes various substances such as metals, ceramics, salts, ice, sugar, and rocks. In contrast, glass is characterized by its unordered molecular structure. Therefore, by definition, glass cannot be classified as a crystal. This distinction makes the term "crystal glass" an oxymoron.

### Composition of "Crystal" Glass

So, what exactly constitutes "crystal" glass? Traditionally, this type of glass was simply regular glass with calcium replaced by lead oxide. This substitution leads to what is more accurately termed "lead glass." The introduction of lead into the glass composition significantly raises its index of refraction, which is a measure of how much a material bends light. 

Materials with a higher index of refraction not only bend light more but also exhibit a sparkling quality. For instance, diamond possesses one of the highest indices of refraction, which is why it sparkles so brilliantly. By adding lead, glass can mimic this sparkling effect, which is why lead glass became associated with the term "crystal."

### Modern Alternatives

With the growing awareness of the toxicity of lead, modern "crystal" glasses often substitute lead with safer alternatives such as barium or zinc. This shift allows for the same aesthetic appeal while ensuring that the glass is safer for human use. Not only does this make the glasses visually appealing, but it also allows artisans to create intricate designs without the complications associated with lead.

### Conclusion

In summary, "crystal drinking glasses" are not made from real crystal but rather from modified glass, traditionally known as lead glass, which enhances light refraction to achieve a sparkling appearance. Today, safer substitutes like barium or zinc are typically used in place of lead to ensure both beauty and safety.
