title: "Why are crystals rare?"
summary: "Crystals are incredibly common, found in everyday objects like metal utensils, ice, salt, and even your phone screen. The 'pretty crystals' we associate with the term are rare due to erosion breaking them down and mixed compositions hindering their growth. So, while beautiful crystals are scarce, the building blocks of crystals are everywhere."

## Why are Crystals Rare?

### Introduction to Crystals

Crystals are, in fact, quite common in our everyday lives. To illustrate, items like your metal knife, forks, spoons, and even the ice in your drink are all forms of crystals. Interestingly, the term "crystal" often conjures images of beautiful gemstones, yet this is a misunderstanding of what constitutes a crystal in scientific terms. 

### The Nature of Crystals

In scientific language, a "crystal" refers to a material that exhibits an ordered spatial arrangement of its molecules. For example, the molecules in a salt crystal align themselves in straight columns and rows. Almost all solids, including metals, ceramics, salts, and semiconductors, form crystals in their solid state. Conversely, substances like glass have a random molecular distribution. Organic materials, such as wood and cotton, possess complex biological structures and do not exhibit the simple, repeating patterns typical of crystals. However, simpler organic molecules, like sugar, can indeed form crystals when they are concentrated and solidified.

### The Misconception of Rarity

The confusion arises from the cultural association of the word "crystal" with aesthetically pleasing forms. When people refer to "crystals," they often mean "pretty crystals." For instance, both large quartz crystals used in jewelry and ordinary sand are made of silicon dioxide crystals. The distinction lies solely in their size and purity; the jewelry-grade quartz is simply larger and purer than the sand. 

This emphasis on beauty has led to the mistaken belief that only attractive crystals are "real" crystals. Telling a friend that the copper wires in a lamp are crystals, just like a diamond, might be met with skepticism because the former lacks visual appeal.

Moreover, the societal fascination with attractive crystals has fueled various myths, including the belief in their healing properties. Research, such as that conducted by psychologist Christopher French, has demonstrated that there is no scientific basis for these claims. In controlled experiments, both believers and non-believers in crystal healing were unable to distinguish between genuine crystals and glass replicas, performing no better than random chance.

### Reasons for the Perceived Rarity of Pretty Crystals

So, if crystals are common, why do beautiful crystals seem rare? The answer lies in two primary factors: erosion and mixed composition.

1. **Erosion**: Natural processes such as wind, rain, and water flow contribute to the breakdown of larger crystals. For instance, a palm-sized amethyst can be eroded into much smaller fragments, resulting in sand, silt, and clay. The prevalence of these smaller particles on Earth's surface is a direct consequence of erosion, leading to a scarcity of large, gem-quality crystals.

2. **Mixed Composition**: During the crystallization process within the Earth, different materials can interfere with one another. When crystals of one mineral form, they may be obstructed by crystals of another material. This mixed composition often results in smaller crystals. For example, solid granite is made up of a mixture of small quartz, mica, and feldspar crystals, which are visible as specks within the granite.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while crystals are ubiquitous in various forms, the beautiful crystals that capture human interest are far less common due to natural processes of erosion and the complexities of mixed mineral compositions. Understanding the scientific definition of crystals can help dispel the myths surrounding their rarity and healing properties, highlighting the fascinating nature of these solid structures.
