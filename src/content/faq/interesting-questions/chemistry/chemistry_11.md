summary: "The ocean appears blue primarily because water itself is blue, absorbing red light and reflecting blue. While the sky's reflection contributes, it's not the main reason for the ocean's color."

## What is it about the ocean that makes it look blue when it reflects the sky?

### The Intrinsic Color of Water

The ocean appears blue primarily due to the intrinsic properties of water itself. While many people might assume that the ocean's blueness is merely a reflection of the sky, this isn't the complete picture. In fact, water has a slight intrinsic blue color, which is most noticeable in large volumes, such as those found in the ocean. 

Research published in the *Journal of Chemical Education* by Charles L. Braun and Sergei N. Smirnov elucidates this phenomenon. They explain that water absorbs red light more effectively due to the vibrational transitions of its molecules. As a result, when light passes through water, the red wavelengths are absorbed, while the blue wavelengths are scattered and reflected back. This selective absorption is what gives large bodies of water, like oceans, their characteristic blue tint.

### Why We Don't Notice the Color in Small Quantities

In everyday situations, such as drinking a glass of water, we typically use too little water for this intrinsic blueness to be perceptible. Consequently, we often perceive water as clear. However, when observed in larger quantities, like in the ocean, the slight blue hue becomes more apparent. 

### The Role of Light and Viewing Angles

Furthermore, the appearance of the ocean's color can vary depending on the conditions of the surface and the viewing angle. If the ocean's surface is calm, and you observe it from a low angle, some of the blue color you see is indeed a reflection of the sky. However, this reflection does not fully account for the ocean's blueness. The intrinsic properties of water still play a significant role, even under varying lighting conditions.

### The Blue Tinge in Snow and Ice

Interestingly, this intrinsic blue color is not limited to liquid water. Large volumes of snow and ice also exhibit a similar blue tinge for the same reasons. This phenomenon is due to the way light interacts with the crystalline structure of ice and the air trapped within it, which also leads to the absorption of red wavelengths.

In summary, while the ocean does reflect the sky and this can enhance its blueness, the intrinsic properties of water—specifically its ability to absorb red light—are the fundamental reasons why we perceive the ocean as blue.
