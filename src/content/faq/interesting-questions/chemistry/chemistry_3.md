title: "Can you light diamond on fire?"
summary: "Diamonds can burn like any other carbon-based material, but require a much higher temperature (900Â°C) due to their strong atomic bonds.  Antoine Lavoisier first proved diamonds are made of carbon by burning them and observing the carbon dioxide produced."

## Can You Light Diamond on Fire?

### Introduction to Diamond and Combustion

Yes, diamond can indeed be set on fire because it is made of carbon. This might seem counterintuitive given diamond's reputation for being a hard and precious material, but fundamentally, it is still a form of carbon. 

### The Process of Carbon Combustion

When we talk about burning, we are typically referring to a process known as combustion. In the case of carbon combustion, carbon atoms break their bonds with one another and with other atoms, which requires energy input. Once these bonds are broken, carbon can form new bonds with oxygen atoms, a process that releases even more energy than was initially consumed to break the bonds. 

This energy released can lead to a chain reaction, whereby additional carbon atoms are freed to react with oxygen, perpetuating the combustion. The products of this combustion are primarily carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and carbon monoxide ($CO$), which are gaseous waste products that disperse into the atmosphere.

### Diamond's Structure and Combustion

Pure diamond consists solely of carbon atoms that are arranged in a dense, strong crystal lattice formation. Because of this robust structure, it requires a significant amount of energy to break apart the carbon atoms in diamond to enable them to bond with oxygen. Consequently, it takes a higher temperature to burn diamond compared to more common carbon sources, such as wood.

- The ignition temperature of wood is approximately $300 \, ^\circ C$.
- In contrast, the ignition temperature of diamond in air is around $900 \, ^\circ C$.

### Practical Implications of Burning Diamond

Although diamond does require a higher temperature to ignite, it is possible to burn diamond through standard carbon combustion methods. For instance, with sufficient patience and the right conditions, you could burn diamond in a regular flame. 

To facilitate this process, additional heat and oxygen can be introduced. A dramatic example of this would be using a blow torch on a diamond and then submerging it in a cup of liquid oxygen, which results in a striking visual display. 

Jewelry makers, particularly jewelers, must be cautious of this phenomenon. When they use flames to mold the metal in diamond rings, they must take care not to inadvertently burn the diamond itself.

### Historical Context

The combustion of diamond was first scientifically recognized by Antoine Lavoisier in the 18th century. He discovered that burning diamond produced carbon dioxide, thus confirming that diamond is indeed a form of carbon. As noted in Robert Foster Davis's book *Diamond Films and Coatings*, Lavoisier's experiments in $1772$ demonstrated that the products of diamond combustion were solely carbon dioxide, leading to a deeper understanding of the substance.

### Conclusion

In summary, while diamonds are known for their durability and beauty, they are not immune to combustion. With the right conditions, they can indeed be set on fire, undergoing carbon combustion similar to other carbon-containing materials. Thus, the answer to the question is a resounding yes: you can light diamond on fire, albeit under specific circumstances.
