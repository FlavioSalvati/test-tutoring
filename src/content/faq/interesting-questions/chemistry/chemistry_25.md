title: "Why is ice slippery?"
summary: "Ice is slippery due to a thin layer of liquid water on its surface, even at low temperatures. This liquid layer forms due to the nature of surface chemical bonds, where water molecules at the surface have fewer bonds and vibrate more. This creates a slippery surface, even without pressure or friction."

## Why is Ice Slippery?

### Introduction

The phenomenon of slippery ice is a fascinating topic that delves into the interplay between solid and liquid states of water. It is a common misconception that the ice itself is inherently slippery. In reality, the slippery nature of ice is primarily due to a thin layer of liquid water that forms on its surface, even at low temperatures.

### The Role of Liquid Water

When you step onto an icy surface, the sensation of slipperiness is not a characteristic of the solid ice itself. Instead, it arises from the presence of a thin layer of liquid water. This liquid layer forms due to the unique properties of surface chemical bonds. The water on a smooth surface is slippery because it has a low viscosity, which means that it can flow easily. In liquid water, there are no permanent intermolecular bonds; instead, the bonds are transient and weak, allowing water molecules to move freely and slide past one another. This property enables the liquid water to fill in any microscopic holes or cracks in the ice that could otherwise cause friction.

### How Does Water Form on Ice?

The question of how this liquid water forms on ice is more complex. Historically, scientists believed that the pressure applied to ice could lower its melting point, thereby creating a slippery layer. In 1886, engineer John Joly suggested that the weight of a person skating on ice could generate enough pressure to melt the ice beneath their skates. However, this theory has been challenged. The melting point of ice cannot be lowered below $-22$ degrees Celsius, regardless of pressure. Yet, ice remains slippery even at temperatures significantly below this threshold.

Additionally, in 1939, researchers Frank P. Bowden and T. P. Hughes proposed that the friction caused by objects sliding over ice generates heat, which could melt the ice. While it is true that friction produces heat, the amount generated is insufficient to melt ice at low temperatures. Furthermore, this explanation fails to account for the slippery layer that forms even when an object is completely motionless.

### Current Understanding of Ice Slipperiness

The precise mechanisms behind the formation of the liquid layer on ice remain an active area of research. Scientists have discovered that ice consistently possesses a thin liquid layer at its surface, even at temperatures well below freezing and without any external pressure or friction. This phenomenon appears to stem from the unique properties of water molecules at the surface. Unlike molecules in the bulk ice, surface molecules have fewer chemical bonds, allowing them to absorb natural vibrations more effectively.

As stated by Robert Rosenberg in a 2005 review article in Physics Today, "The periodic structure breaks down [at the surface] and the molecular layers adopt a more amorphous reconstruction in response to the reduced number of chemical bonds holding the surface molecules in place." The increased vibrational motion of surface molecules, as a function of temperature, contributes to the formation of this slippery liquid layer. The interaction between the vibrational motion of these surface molecules and the molecules in the bulk ice is a critical factor in this process.

### Conclusion

In summary, the slipperiness of ice is primarily due to a thin layer of liquid water that forms on its surface, rather than the ice itself being inherently slippery. While pressure and friction can influence this phenomenon, they are not the dominant factors. The unique behavior of water molecules at the surface of ice plays a crucial role in creating this slippery layer, making ice a captivating subject for ongoing scientific inquiry.
