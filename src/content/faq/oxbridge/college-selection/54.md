When considering which Oxford college is best for Economics students, it’s essential to understand that all colleges at Oxford maintain high academic standards and offer excellent support for their students. However, some colleges have features that may better suit your preferences and needs as an Economics student.

1. **Consider the College’s Reputation in Economics**: While all colleges excel in the subjects they offer, certain colleges may have a stronger reputation or more prominent faculty in Economics. For example, colleges like Balliol, Christ Church, and St. John's are often noted for their strong Economics programs and have produced notable economists.

2. **Facilities and Resources**: Some colleges may have better facilities for Economics students, such as access to libraries, study spaces, and resources like computer labs. Look into what each college offers in terms of support for Economics students, including study groups, seminars, and access to faculty.

3. **Atmosphere and Community**: The college experience encompasses more than just academics. Consider the atmosphere of the college—some may offer a more vibrant social scene or a quieter, more studious environment. Visiting during an Open Day can give you a feel for the college’s culture and help you decide where you might fit best.

4. **Application Strategy**: When applying, you can choose a specific college or apply "open." If you apply open, your application will be assigned to a college that has fewer applications for your course, potentially increasing your chances of admission. This strategy can be beneficial if you are flexible about your college choice.

5. **Interdisciplinary Opportunities**: If you are interested in combining Economics with other fields, look for colleges that emphasize interdisciplinary studies. Some colleges may have stronger ties with departments in Politics, Philosophy, and Management, which can enhance your learning experience.

6. **Student Support and Tutorials**: Each college has its own tutorial system, which is a hallmark of the Oxford educational experience. Inquire about the number of tutorials offered, the faculty involved, and the support systems in place for Economics students.

In summary, while there is no single "best" college for Economics at Oxford, choosing a college that aligns with your academic focus, lifestyle preferences, and support needs is crucial. Make use of opportunities like Open Days, college websites, and discussions with current students to gather insights and make an informed decision. Remember, the quality of education in Economics is consistent across colleges, so focus on choosing a college where you feel you will thrive personally and academically.
