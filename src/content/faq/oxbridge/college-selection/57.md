Choosing the best Oxford college for Geography students involves considering several factors, including academic support, resources, extracurricular opportunities, and the overall atmosphere. While all colleges at Oxford provide the same degree and academic standards, some may have specific strengths or characteristics that cater to the needs of Geography students.

1. **College Reputation and Resources**: Some colleges are known for their strong support in Geography and related fields. For instance, **St. John's College** has a reputation for its vibrant academic community and excellent facilities, which can be beneficial for Geography students. Similarly, **Balliol College** is well-regarded for its supportive environment and has a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary studies, which is valuable in Geography.

2. **Tutorial System**: The tutorial system is a cornerstone of the Oxford experience. Colleges like **Christ Church** and **Merton College** have established Geography tutors who are experts in their fields. Check if the college has faculty members whose research aligns with your interests, as this can enhance your learning experience.

3. **Extracurricular Activities**: Engage in clubs and societies that focus on environmental issues, urban studies, or travel. Colleges like **Keble College** offer a variety of student-led initiatives and societies that can enrich your studies and allow you to apply theoretical knowledge practically. 

4. **Community and Support**: The sense of community is crucial in your university experience. Colleges such as **Worcester College** are known for their friendly atmosphere and supportive peer networks, which can help you settle in and thrive academically and socially.

5. **Facilities**: Look for colleges with good library resources and access to geographical data and research materials. For instance, **Exeter College** has a strong library which can be a significant asset for your studies.

6. **Open Application**: If youâ€™re unsure, consider submitting an Open Application. This allows you to be placed in a college where you might find an unexpected fit. 

7. **Visit During Open Days**: Finally, attending Open Days is invaluable. You get to experience the college atmosphere and speak to current students and tutors. This firsthand experience will help you gauge where you feel most comfortable.

In summary, while no single college can be deemed the "best" for Geography students universally, St. John's, Christ Church, and Balliol are excellent choices based on their resources and supportive environments. Ultimately, choose a college that aligns with your personal values and academic aspirations, as this will be vital for your success at Oxford.
