Choosing the best Oxford college for Engineering Science students can be subjective and depends on personal preferences. However, there are a few colleges that are particularly popular among engineering students and may offer advantages worth considering.

1. **St. John's College**: Known for its vibrant academic community and excellent facilities, St. John's has a strong reputation for engineering. The college provides a supportive environment and has a number of engineering fellows who can offer guidance and mentorship throughout your studies. The college's location is also convenient, being near the engineering department.

2. **Magdalen College**: This college is renowned for its beautiful grounds and rich history. It offers a fantastic social atmosphere and has a strong focus on academic excellence. Magdalen has a good number of engineering students and provides an engaging community where you can collaborate and network with peers.

3. **University College (Univ)**: Univ is one of the oldest colleges and has a diverse student body. It has a reputation for being friendly and inclusive. The college supports students through various academic initiatives, and many engineering students have reported a positive experience regarding resources and access to tutors.

4. **Wadham College**: Wadham is recognized for its progressive culture and strong support for students. The college has modern facilities and a welcoming environment, which can be beneficial for engineering students seeking a collaborative atmosphere.

5. **Open Application**: If youâ€™re unsure which college to choose or if you want to increase your chances of acceptance, consider making an open application. This means your application will be assigned to a college with fewer applicants for the Engineering Science course, which could improve your chances of being accepted.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Facilities and Resources**: Look for colleges that have good engineering facilities, study spaces, and access to labs. This can greatly enhance your learning experience.
- **Social Environment**: Think about what kind of social atmosphere you want. Some colleges have more vibrant social scenes, while others may be quieter and more focused on academics.
- **Financial Support**: All colleges offer similar financial support packages, but it can be worth checking if any specific college has additional resources or scholarships that might be beneficial.

In conclusion, while there is no single "best" college for Engineering Science at Oxford, St. John's, Magdalen, University College, and Wadham are excellent choices based on academic support, community, and facilities. Ultimately, choose a college that aligns with your personal values and preferences, as this will help you thrive during your studies.
