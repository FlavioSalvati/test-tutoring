Choosing the best college for Physics at Oxford can be quite subjective, as each college has its unique strengths and characteristics. However, some colleges are particularly renowned for their Physics programs due to their resources, faculty expertise, and student support systems.

**Key Considerations for Selecting a College:**

1. **Reputation and Resources:** Colleges like Magdalen, Balliol, and St John's are often cited for their strong Physics departments. They have well-established resources, including access to laboratories and research opportunities.

2. **Tutorial System:** The tutorial system at Oxford means that your college will significantly impact your learning experience. Look for colleges that have experienced tutors in Physics, as they can provide personalized guidance and support.

3. **Student Community:** The social environment can greatly enhance your experience. Some colleges may have vibrant student societies focused on Physics and related fields, fostering collaboration and networking.

4. **Location and Facilities:** Proximity to the Department of Physics and access to facilities such as libraries and study spaces can also be important. Colleges closer to these amenities can offer convenience.

5. **Extracurricular Opportunities:** Consider colleges that provide strong extracurricular programs, such as research projects, guest lectures, and workshops in Physics.

**Recommended Colleges:**

- **Magdalen College:** Known for its academic excellence and strong support for science students.
- **St John's College:** Offers a rich history of academic achievement and strong Physics faculty.
- **Balliol College:** Renowned for its academic rigour and supportive community.

Ultimately, the "strongest" Physics program may depend on personal fit. I recommend visiting colleges, if possible, and speaking with current students to gauge where you feel most comfortable and supported in your academic journey.
