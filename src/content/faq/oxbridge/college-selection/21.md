Choosing the best college at Oxford for studying Medicine depends on various factors, including location, facilities, and the college's specific strengths. Here are key considerations and recommendations:

1. **Colleges with Strong Medical Programs**: 
   - **Keble College** and **Worcester College** are popular choices among medical students because of their supportive communities and excellent facilities. 
   - **St. John's College** also has a good reputation, particularly for its resources and strong emphasis on academic excellence.

2. **Location**: 
   - The proximity of the college to the Medical School can be an important factor. **Balliol College** and **Trinity College** are centrally located, making it easier to access lecture halls and clinical placements quickly.

3. **Facilities and Resources**:
   - Look for colleges that offer good study spaces, libraries, and accommodation. For instance, **Magdalen College** is known for its beautiful grounds and quiet study areas, which can be ideal for focused study.

4. **Community and Support**:
   - The sense of community can significantly impact your experience. Colleges like **Christ Church** and **Merton College** are known for their welcoming atmospheres and active student communities, which can provide a valuable support network during your studies.

5. **Student Life**:
   - Consider what extracurricular activities and societies the college offers. Engaging in sports, music, or volunteering can enrich your university experience. Colleges such as **Hertford College** are known for their vibrant student life and diverse societies.

6. **Interviews and Shortlisting**:
   - Regardless of the college you choose, remember that all colleges assess your application based on the same academic criteria. The interview process is crucial, and it's important to prepare thoroughly, as interviews at Oxford are designed to challenge your critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

7. **Personal Preferences**:
   - Ultimately, the best college for you will align with your personal preferences and values. If possible, visit the colleges or attend open days to get a feel for each one.

In summary, while there isn't a definitive "best" college for Medicine at Oxford, Keble, St. John's, and Worcester are strong contenders due to their resources and community support. Prioritize what matters most to you, whether it's location, facilities, or community, and make your choice accordingly. Remember that the college you attend will not change the quality of education you receive, as all colleges provide access to the same high standard of teaching and resources.
