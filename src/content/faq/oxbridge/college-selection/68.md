Choosing the best Cambridge college for English Literature students depends on a variety of factors, including academic strengths, community, and individual preferences. While each college at Cambridge has its unique offerings, Jesus College stands out for several reasons.

### Academic Environment
Jesus College has a robust English Literature department with a diverse range of research interests among its Fellows. This allows for a rich academic experience where students can engage with different literary theories and practices. The college encourages students to explore literature beyond the standard syllabus, promoting independent thought and critical engagement, which are essential for any aspiring English student.

### Supportive Community
The college's vibrant creative scene, including literary magazines, workshops, and societies, provides ample opportunities for students to develop their literary and creative skills. This supportive environment fosters collaboration and encourages students to share their work, which can be invaluable in building confidence and honing one's craft. 

### Interview and Selection Process
The application process at Jesus College, which includes submitting two essays and undergoing an interview with subject specialists, is designed to assess not just knowledge but intellectual potential and passion for literature. This approach allows students who may not have had formal training in certain areas of literature to shine based on their enthusiasm and independent reading. 

### Facilities and Resources
Students at Jesus College benefit from an expansive campus that includes a boathouse, sporting fields, and access to historic buildings like the College Chapel, dating back to the 12th century. Such an inspiring environment can enhance the student experience significantly.

### Career Prospects
Graduates from Jesus College often find themselves in diverse fields such as writing, journalism, law, and the arts. The skills gained during an English Literature program—critical thinking, effective communication, and creativity—are highly valued across various industries. 

### Conclusion
While Jesus College is an excellent choice, it's essential for students to consider what they want from their Cambridge experience. Other colleges may also offer strong English Literature programs, so visiting colleges, speaking to current students, and assessing the overall atmosphere can be beneficial. Ultimately, the best college will align with your academic interests and personal preferences. Consider what environment will help you thrive and find a place that resonates with your literary passions.
