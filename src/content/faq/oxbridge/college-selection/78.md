When considering the best Cambridge college for Geography students, St Catharine's College stands out as an exceptional choice. This college consistently ranks among the top three in Geography exam results, which is a strong indicator of its academic excellence in this field. 

St Catharine's boasts a dedicated team of Geography Fellows, including Professor Ron Martin, Dr. Ian Willis, and Dr. Ivan Scales, who cover various specializations such as economic and socio-political geography, glaciology and hydrology, and environment and development geography. This diverse expertise offers students a well-rounded understanding of the discipline and allows them to explore various interests within Geography.

Additionally, the presence of Dr. Alison Banwell, a Junior Research Fellow focused on climate change and its impacts on ice sheets, provides students with insights into one of the most pressing global issues today. Engaging with faculty who are leading research in their areas of expertise can significantly enhance the learning experience for students.

The supportive environment at St Catharine's is another reason to consider this college. The lively community fosters interaction among students and staff, creating a collaborative atmosphere that is conducive to learning. The specialized supervision teaching ensures that students receive tailored guidance, which is vital for their academic development. 

Moreover, St Catharine's College is equipped with excellent resources, including a well-stocked library that supports research and study needs. The availability of travel grants for fieldwork is particularly beneficial for Geography students, as fieldwork is an essential component of the discipline, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world contexts.

In terms of admissions, St Catharine's typically admits eight to ten undergraduate Geography students each year, ensuring an intimate and focused educational environment. The college’s requirements of A*AA at A Level (or equivalent) are competitive but achievable for passionate and dedicated students. There’s no preferred pattern of A Levels, allowing candidates from diverse academic backgrounds—whether in sciences, mathematics, humanities, or social sciences—to apply.

Finally, the admissions process includes two interviews, providing candidates the opportunity to showcase their knowledge and passion for Geography. Preparation for the subject interview, particularly by engaging with the pre-read article, is crucial and demonstrates your ability to discuss and analyze geographical issues critically.

In conclusion, St Catharine's College offers an ideal blend of academic rigor, expert faculty, supportive community, and excellent resources, making it the best choice for Geography students at Cambridge.
