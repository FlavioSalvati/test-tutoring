Yes, you can apply to both Oxford and Cambridge, but there are important considerations and rules that you should keep in mind. 

1. **Single Application:** You must submit your applications through UCAS, but you are only allowed to apply to one of the two universities in your UCAS application. This means you can choose either Oxford or Cambridge as your first choice, but not both simultaneously on the same UCAS form.

2. **Separate Applications:** If you wish to apply to both, you must submit one application for Oxford and another for Cambridge, but they must be submitted in a way that adheres to the UCAS guidelines. This typically involves applying to one of them through the regular UCAS process and then following the specific requirements for the other.

3. **Timing:** Keep in mind the application deadlines. Both universities have the same deadline of 15 October at 6pm (UK time) for applications, so you must be prepared to submit your UCAS application well ahead of time. This applies whether you are applying to Oxford or Cambridge first.

4. **Supplementary Forms:** If you decide to apply to Cambridge, you will need to complete the Supplementary Application Questionnaire (SAQ) and possibly the Cambridge Online Preliminary Application (COPA) for certain courses. Make sure you are aware of these additional requirements to avoid any last-minute issues.

5. **Interviews:** Be prepared for the interview processes at both universities. Interviews are a crucial part of the selection process for both Oxford and Cambridge, where they assess your academic potential and how you think critically about your subject. 

6. **Personal Statement:** Your personal statement should be tailored to reflect your interest in the university to which you are applying. If you apply to both, ensure that you highlight why you are suited to each institution in the respective applications.

7. **Admissions Tests:** Remember that both universities have different admissions tests for various courses. Familiarize yourself with the specific tests required for the courses you are interested in and prepare accordingly.

In summary, while you can express interest in both universities, you have to be strategic about your application. It is advisable to thoroughly research each university and tailor your applications to their specific requirements and ethos. Make sure to manage your time effectively and stay organized throughout the process to maximize your chances of success. Good luck!
