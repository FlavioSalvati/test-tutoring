Choosing the best Cambridge College for Biological Sciences students can depend on several factors, including the College's facilities, support, atmosphere, and the specific interests you may have within the field. While all Colleges at Cambridge offer the same lectures and exams, here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Research Opportunities**: Look for Colleges that have strong links with Biological Sciences research groups. Colleges like Christ’s, Trinity, and St. John’s are known for their robust connections with the Biological Sciences department, providing access to research projects and labs.

2. **Facilities**: Ensure that the College has good lab facilities and resources. Some Colleges may have better access to state-of-the-art equipment or dedicated study spaces for Biological Sciences students. Check the College websites for information on their facilities.

3. **Support and Community**: The atmosphere can greatly influence your university experience. Some Colleges have a strong sense of community and excellent tutorial support. For example, Colleges like Pembroke and Downing are often noted for their supportive environments where students can thrive academically.

4. **Social Environment**: Consider the social scene and the activities offered by the College. Some Colleges are more vibrant and active, which can provide a good work-life balance. If you enjoy extracurricular activities, look for Colleges that offer a variety of societies and clubs related to Biological Sciences or general interests.

5. **Open vs. Specific Application**: If you are unsure about which College to apply to, consider applying 'open'. This way, you can be assigned to a College that matches your profile and needs. However, if you have a strong preference for a specific atmosphere or facilities, applying to a College like Trinity or St. John’s could be beneficial.

6. **Gender-Specific Colleges**: If you are a female student, you might consider Murray Edwards or Newnham, as they create unique environments for women in science. They have strong support networks and can foster a sense of belonging and empowerment.

7. **Alumni Networks**: Some Colleges have notable alumni in the field of Biological Sciences. This can provide networking opportunities that may benefit you in your future career. Research the alumni of the Colleges you are considering.

In conclusion, while there is no definitive "best" College for Biological Sciences students, considering the factors above can help you choose a College that aligns with your academic and personal preferences. Exploring College profiles and speaking to current students can provide further insight into what you can expect. Good luck with your application!
