Oxford University has specific requirements for Indian students that you must meet. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know:

#### 1.1. **Educational Qualifications**

For students from India, the most common qualifications recognized by Oxford are:

- **CISCE (ISC)**: An overall grade of at least 90% is required, with 95% or above in four subjects (including any that are relevant to your chosen course) and at least 85% in the fifth subject.

#### 1.2. **Specific Course Requirements**

Different courses have different requirements. It's crucial to check the **[Oxford University website](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/for-international-students/international-qualifications)** for detailed information on the subjects needed for your desired course. For example, if you are applying for a science-based program, you would typically need to have taken Physics, Chemistry, and Maths during your +2 education.

### 2. **Application Process**

Depending on your chosen course, you may be required to take an admissions test. For instance, courses like Mathematics, Law, and certain science courses require specific tests.

If you have any special circumstances that have impacted your education or qualifications, it’s essential to communicate this in your application. Oxford does consider exceptional circumstances when assessing applications.
