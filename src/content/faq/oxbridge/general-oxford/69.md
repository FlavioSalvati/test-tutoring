Submit your application through the [University of Oxford's graduate application portal](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/apply).

#### Step 2: Supporting Documents
You will need to gather and submit several supporting documents:

- **Transcripts:** Provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. If transcripts are not in English, include certified translations.
- **Research Statement:** This is a critical component of your application. Focus on your interest in astrophysics, your previous experience, and your commitment to the field. Highlight specific research areas you wish to explore.
- **References:** Obtain three academic references. Ideally, these should come from professors who are familiar with your academic capabilities and research potential.
- **Proposed Project:** Indicate your preferred research area or specific projects you are interested in. Research potential supervisors' work to align your interests with theirs.

#### Step 3: Deadlines
The application deadline for entry in the 2025-26 academic year is **12:00 midday UK time on 3 January 2025**. Ensure you submit your application well ahead of the deadline to avoid last-minute issues.

#### Step 4: Shortlisting and Selection
After submitting your application, it will be assessed based on academic qualifications, research statement, references, and, if applicable, admissions test scores. Shortlisted candidates will be invited for an interview, typically held in February and March.

#### Step 5: Interviews
The interview process usually involves two staff members and may be conducted in person, via video link, or over the phone. Be prepared to discuss your research interests and potential projects in-depth.

#### Step 6: Offers
If you receive an offer, it will specify any academic conditions you must meet, such as achieving a certain grade in your current degree, and include deadlines for any required actions.

### 4. Funding Opportunities

Funding can be a significant concern for international students. Here are some options available to you:
