### Oxford University Admissions Requirements and Fees

As a prospective student considering applying to Oxford University, it is essential to understand the admissions requirements and associated fees for both undergraduate and graduate programs. This guidance will help you navigate the application process effectively.

#### Undergraduate Admissions

1. **Qualifications:**
   - **A-levels:** Most successful candidates possess A-levels, with offers typically ranging from A*A*A to AAA depending on the specific course. It is vital to check the individual course requirements since they may vary.
     - Practical components in science A-levels must be passed, and subjects like General Studies and Critical Thinking are not accepted.
     - Although AS-levels can be listed as separate qualifications, offers are generally based on three A-levels completed in Year 13.
     - If you complete A-levels early, be aware that offers may still depend on Year 13 grades.
   - **Other UK Qualifications:** The university accepts equivalent qualifications:
     - **International Baccalaureate (IB):** A total score of 38-40 points (depending on the course) with higher-level subjects scoring 6s and 7s.
     - **Scottish Highers:** AAAAB or AAAAA, with two or more Advanced Highers.
     - **Pre-U:** D2, D2, D3 or D3, D3, D3.
     - **Advanced Skills Challenge Certificate (ASCC):** Not typically the basis for offers but can complement A-levels.
   - **International Qualifications:** Qualifications from outside the UK are acceptable if they align with course requirements. Non-native English speakers must meet specific English language requirements.
   - **Vocational Qualifications:** Certain vocational qualifications equivalent to A-levels are accepted, but they may need to be supplemented with academic qualifications for a competitive edge.
   - **Foundation Degrees and Access Courses:** These can be considered in lieu of A-levels, especially if they cover the required content.
   - **Mature Students:** Assessment is case-by-case for qualifications that are no longer available or have changed grading systems. Senior Status may be available to progress into the second year of study.
   - **Transfer Students:** Generally, Oxford does not accept transfer students, except in exceptional circumstances.
   - **Professional Qualifications:** These can be considered, especially if they show recent academic study.

2. **Admissions Tests:**
   - Many courses require specific admissions tests. For example:
     - **Mathematics Admissions Test (MAT):** Required for Mathematics and related courses. It lasts 2 hours and 30 minutes, is computer-based, and covers AS-level and some A-level topics.
     - **Physics Admissions Test (PAT):** Required for various engineering and physics courses. It is a 2-hour, multiple-choice test.
     - **Law National Admissions Test (LNAT):** Required for Law courses, with a fee and specific structure. Other tests exist for subjects like Philosophy and Modern Languages.
   - Test scores are considered alongside other application materials, and no specific score guarantees an interview.

3. **Personal Statement and Reference:**
   - The personal statement should reflect your academic interests and motivations for choosing Oxford. It should demonstrate your suitability for the course.
   - References should come from teachers who can comment on your academic abilities.
   - If there are extenuating circumstances affecting your GCSE performance, these should be mentioned in your personal statement or reference.

4. **Interviews:**
   - Shortlisted candidates will be invited for interviews, which are crucial for assessing your academic interests and critical thinking skills.

5. **Application Fees:**
   - The application fee is £75 for taught courses and £20 for research courses.
   - Waivers are available for those who cannot afford the fees.
   - Payment must be made in GBP (£) via credit or debit card at the time of application.

2. **Admissions Tests:**
   - Some graduate programs may require admissions tests like the GRE for specific courses or the GMAT for business-related courses. Always check the course page for exact requirements.

   - For research courses (like DPhils), a well-prepared research proposal demonstrating your interests and potential is often required.

4. **Application Fees:**
   - Application fees for graduate programs mirror the undergraduate fees: £75 for taught courses and £20 for research courses, with waivers available under certain circumstances.
