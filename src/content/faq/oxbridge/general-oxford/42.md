When considering admission to Oxford University, it's important to understand that the admissions process is multifaceted and not solely based on percentages or grades from 10th (GCSE) and 12th class (A-levels or equivalent). While your performance in these examinations is significant, it is evaluated in the context of your overall application, which includes factors such as your personal statement, references, admissions tests, and interviews.

### Understanding the Grading System

1. **GCSE (10th Class) Grades:**
   - Generally, Oxford looks for strong GCSE results; however, there is no specific percentage or grade threshold that guarantees admission. 
   - Most competitive applicants typically have at least 5 GCSEs at grade 7 (equivalent to an A grade) or above. 
   - Contextual factors are considered, such as your school’s performance and any extenuating circumstances that may have affected your grades.

2. **A-Level (12th Class) Grades:**
   - For A-levels, Oxford usually requires offers that range from A*A*A to AAA, depending on the course you are applying to. 
   - Therefore, achieving high grades is crucial—typically, you would need to be at the A or A* level in your subjects. 
   - Each course has specific requirements, so it’s essential to check the course pages for detailed information.

### Percentages to Consider

While there is no fixed percentage, a rough guide for performance might be as follows:

- **GCSEs:**
  - Aim for around 70-80% across your subjects, translating to mostly A grades.
  
- **A-Levels:**
  - For A-levels, you would ideally want to achieve around 85-90% or higher, as this would generally correspond to A* and A grades.

### Additional Components of the Application

1. **Personal Statement:**
   - This is your opportunity to showcase your passion for the subject, your academic journey, and relevant experiences. An engaging and thoughtful personal statement can significantly enhance your application.

2. **References:**
   - Strong references from teachers who can vouch for your academic abilities and potential are crucial. They should highlight your strengths and any unique contributions you bring to your studies.

3. **Admissions Tests:**
   - Many courses at Oxford require you to take an admissions test. Performing well in these tests can help to bolster your application and demonstrate your subject knowledge and readiness for university-level study.

4. **Interviews:**
   - The interview process is critical and can be a decisive factor in the admissions decision. It assesses not just your knowledge, but also your ability to think critically and engage with complex ideas.

5. **Written Work:**
   - Some courses may require you to submit a piece of written work, which can be an additional opportunity to show your analytical and writing skills.

### Contextual Considerations

- **Contextual Admissions:**
  - Oxford has contextual admissions policies that consider applicants from less advantaged backgrounds. If your school has a lower academic profile, Oxford may take that into account when evaluating your application.

- **Extenuating Circumstances:**
  - If you have faced difficulties that impacted your performance, it is important to communicate this in your personal statement or through your reference.

### Conclusion

To summarize, while there are no strict percentages required for 10th and 12th class grades to gain admission to Oxford University, aiming for high grades (around 70-80% in GCSEs and 85-90% in A-levels) will put you in a competitive position. However, remember that success in gaining admission hinges on a combination of academic performance, personal statement quality, reference strength, performance in admissions tests, and interview results.

   - Understand the specific requirements for the course you are interested in. Look for the subject-specific A-levels or equivalent qualifications needed.

   - Focus on achieving high grades in your current studies. Consider additional study resources or tutoring if necessary.

3. **Work on Your Personal Statement:**
