Certainly! As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I can provide you with an extensive overview of the specific funding options available for science students at the University of Cambridge. The University is committed to providing various financial support mechanisms to ensure that talented individuals can pursue their studies without being hindered by financial constraints. Below, I will detail the funding opportunities available for both undergraduate and postgraduate science students.

### Funding Options for Undergraduate Science Students

**1. Cambridge Bursary Scheme:**
The Cambridge Bursary Scheme is designed to support undergraduate students from lower-income backgrounds. The amount you receive is determined based on your household income. 
- **Care Leavers:** Students who are care leavers can receive up to £8,350 per year.
- **General Students:** Other undergraduate students may be eligible for up to £3,500 per year.

This bursary is automatically considered when you apply, so you don’t need to submit a separate application.

**2. Faculty and Department Funding:**
Many faculties and departments at Cambridge may offer various grants, prizes, and funds to recognize academic achievements or support specific research initiatives. It is essential for students to check their respective faculty or department websites for any available funding opportunities. For science students, this could include funding for research projects, summer internships, or academic competitions.

**3. College Funding:**
Each college at Cambridge has its own funding options, including scholarships, grants, and awards specifically for their students. Colleges may provide financial support to help cover living costs, travel expenses, or other educational materials. It is advisable to contact your chosen college directly for detailed information about the specific opportunities they offer.

**4. Financial Support for Student Parents:**
Cambridge provides financial support for student parents through two specific schemes aimed at helping with registered childcare expenses. This is particularly relevant for science students who may have additional responsibilities while pursuing their studies.

### Funding Options for Postgraduate Science Students

The University of Cambridge offers a broad range of funding options for postgraduate students, particularly those studying in the sciences. Here are some key funding opportunities:

**1. General Funding Information:**
In the 2025-26 academic year, the University expects to offer over 1,000 full or partial graduate scholarships. Scholarships are primarily awarded based on academic excellence and potential, covering course fees and/or living costs. Most scholarships do not require a separate application and are considered based on your graduate application.

**2. Specific University Scholarships:**
Cambridge provides various scholarships specifically tailored for postgraduate science students. Some notable examples include:

- **Black Leaders in Cancer PhD Scholarship Programme:** This scholarship offers a fully funded four-year DPhil studentship for students from Black heritage backgrounds pursuing studies in cancer-related fields.
- **Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds:** This program provides 2-3 year DPhil fellowships for research in biomedicine.
- **Ellison Scholarships:** These scholarships offer full funding for DPhil (PhD) study at the University of Cambridge.
- **Google Europe Scholarship for Students with Disabilities:** This scholarship supports candidates with disabilities enrolled in computer science or related fields.

**3. Research Council Funding:**
The UK Research Councils provide financial support across various subject areas. For science students, funding from these councils may include:

- **BBSRC (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council):** Supports research in biosciences and provides studentships through specific partnerships.
- **EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council):** Funds research and training in engineering and physical sciences, with automatic consideration for studentship funding.
- **MRC (Medical Research Council):** Offers funding for medical science research and provides studentships through partnerships with universities.

**4. Studentships:**
Studentships are often funded by organizations, including Research Councils, academic departments, and external bodies. These typically offer full or fees-only financial support for specific projects or areas of study. If you are applying for a DPhil or PhD program, inquire about available studentships that align with your research interests.

**5. External Funding Sources:**
There are numerous external funding opportunities available to science students, including:

- **Alternative Guide to Postgraduate Funding:** A database of funding opportunities from charities and voluntary organizations.
- **European Funding Guide:** A resource for scholarships and grants available to European students.
- **The Grants Register 2024:** Information on various scholarships, fellowships, and research grants available for students.
- **UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA):** Provides guidance on searching for funding opportunities.

### Additional Specific Funding Opportunities for Science Students

Several specific scholarships and funding programs are tailored to science students at Cambridge:

- **Oxford-Radcliffe Graduate Scholarships:** Up to 13 full scholarships are available for candidates applying for full-time courses in specific areas, including Earth Sciences, Bioscience, and Theoretical Physics.
- **John Oldacre Foundation Scholarship:** Supports applicants pursuing a DPhil in Biology, particularly in plant sciences.
- **Oxford-DeepMind Graduate Scholarships (Computer Science):** Available for full-time DPhil courses related to computer science.
- **Oxford-Mary Frances Wagley Graduate Scholarship:** Open to students pursuing a DPhil in natural science subjects.

### Important Considerations

**1. Application Deadlines:**
Most scholarships have application deadlines in December or January for the upcoming academic year. It is crucial to keep track of these deadlines to ensure you submit your applications on time.

**2. Eligibility Criteria:**
Eligibility criteria can vary widely among scholarships, including factors such as nationality, residency status, course of study, and academic achievement. Always review the specific requirements for each funding option you are interested in.
