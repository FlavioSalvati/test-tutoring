As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I’ll provide you with a comprehensive overview of the financial support available for international students at Cambridge University. Given that you might be considering applying to this esteemed institution, understanding the funding options is crucial for your planning process. 

### General Financial Requirements

Before diving into the various options, let’s first understand the financial requirements that international students must meet:

1. **Proof of Funding**: All international students are required to show evidence of sufficient funds to cover their tuition fees, living expenses, and any additional costs associated with their studies for the entire duration of their course. This is a critical step in the admissions process, as the University needs assurance that you can support yourself financially during your time in Cambridge.

2. **Restrictions on Working**: It’s important to note that there are restrictions on working while studying at Cambridge. This means you should not depend on part-time work to fund your studies or living expenses, which adds an additional layer of complexity to your financial planning.

3. **Dependants**: If you plan to bring family members with you, you will need to provide additional financial evidence to cover their costs as well.

### Financial Support Options for International Students

Cambridge offers several financial support options for international students, including scholarships, grants, and other funding opportunities. Here are the main categories of support available:

#### 1. Scholarships and Awards

**Cambridge Trust**: 
- The Cambridge Trust provides mostly partial-cost awards for overseas students accepted into a Cambridge College. 
- To apply, you must first receive a place at a College. After that, your College will inform you about available Trust awards and guide you through the application process.
- Note that all Trust awards are means-tested, meaning your eligibility will depend on your financial situation.
- You can browse country-specific scholarships on the Trust's website, which can help you identify potential funding sources.

**College Awards**: 
- Some individual Colleges at Cambridge offer partial financial support to international students. It's advisable to contact the admissions office of your chosen College to inquire about these options.

**Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust Awards**: 
- These awards provide limited financial assistance to international undergraduates, which can help alleviate some of the costs associated with studying at Cambridge.

**Country-Specific Scholarships**: 
- Various organizations and institutions in your home country may offer scholarships specifically for students studying abroad. It is worth exploring these options to see if you qualify for any additional financial support.

**Prince Philip Scholarship**: 
- This particular scholarship is available for permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region applying for their first degree at Cambridge. It provides cash awards and means-tested support for tuition and living costs, but applications must be submitted alongside your Cambridge application.

#### 2. International Disabled Students' Fund (IDS Fund)

This fund is available for offer holders and students classified as international students for fees purposes. It offers financial support to meet the costs of academic-related disability support. Detailed information about eligibility and application procedures can be found on the Disability Resource Centre website.

#### 3. Other Sources of Financial Support

In addition to scholarships and awards, there are other avenues to explore for financial support:

- **University and College Bursaries and Grants**: While these are less common than scholarships, they may be available based on personal circumstances such as being from a low-income household or experiencing disadvantage. Bursaries and grants may provide one-off payments or assistance with specific costs, such as travel or settling-in expenses.

- **Private Grants**: Various companies and non-governmental organizations offer financial assistance options to help students complete their higher education. However, always ensure you thoroughly read the loan agreement before signing, as these loans often come with specific repayment terms and interest rates. Some companies may even require you to work for them post-graduation.

- **Performance-Based Scholarships**: If you possess exceptional abilities in areas like sports, music, or performing arts, you may qualify for performance-based scholarships. While these may not cover tuition fees entirely, they can significantly contribute towards living costs and skill development.

- **Subject-Specific Scholarships**: These scholarships are typically offered by specific university departments and are often funded by external organizations or in memory of former professors. Eligibility for these awards usually hinges on your interest, skills, and experience related to that specific subject. They may also help cover equipment or research costs.

### Important Notes

While several financial support options exist, it is crucial to understand that there are no guarantees with these funding opportunities. International students should be proactive in their financial planning and consider alternative financing methods in case their desired funding options are not available.

### Tips for Finding Funding

To maximize your chances of securing financial support, consider the following strategies:

1. **University and College Websites**: Regularly check the websites of your chosen institutions for updated information on available scholarships, bursaries, and grants.

2. **External Scholarship Databases**: Utilize online databases like:
   - **Scholarship Positions**: Provides information on international scholarships and study abroad opportunities.
   - **The Scholarship Hub**: Offers a guide to UK scholarships and features a search engine for scholarships, grants, and bursaries.
   - **Turn2us**: A grants search and benefits calculator that highlights funding opportunities based on individual profiles.

3. **UKCISA Website**: The UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) provides general advice and resources on searching for funding and understanding the financial landscape for international students.

4. **Country-Specific Organizations**: Reach out to organizations in your home country that may offer scholarships for students studying abroad. These local resources can often provide valuable support.
