As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, it’s crucial to have a clear understanding of the eligibility criteria for scholarships at Cambridge University. Scholarships can significantly ease the financial burden of studying at one of the world’s top universities. Below, I will outline the general eligibility criteria that apply to most scholarships, followed by specific information regarding various scholarship programs available at Cambridge.

### General Eligibility Criteria

1. **Excellent Academic Record:**
   - Applicants are expected to have an excellent academic background. Specifically, a first-class honors degree or an equivalent qualification is typically required. For example, a GPA of 3.7 or higher is often seen as a benchmark.
   - If an applicant has a moderate performance in their first degree, outstanding achievement at the Master’s level can compensate for it. This means that if you excel in your postgraduate studies, it can help bolster your scholarship application.
   - High academic achievement can be demonstrated through various means. This may include individual marks, university prizes, your position in your cohort, or publications, if applicable.

2. **Future Academic Potential and Aptitude:**
   - Applicants must show potential for future academic success, particularly in research. This can be demonstrated through strong references and a well-crafted research proposal.

4. **English Language Proficiency:**
   - Applicants must meet the University’s English language proficiency requirements. This is crucial, as being proficient in English is necessary for academic success.
