Before you begin your application, ensure you meet the eligibility requirements:

- If you are a postgraduate student seeking funding for travel before June, you need to demonstrate exceptional circumstances.
- Applications cannot be retrospective; you cannot apply for funding after the travel has already taken place.
- You can only receive one travel grant per academic year.
- Typically, postgraduate students on full funding are ineligible for these grants.
- If your project involves multiple members, each individual must submit a separate application.

### Step 2: Choose the Right Grant
