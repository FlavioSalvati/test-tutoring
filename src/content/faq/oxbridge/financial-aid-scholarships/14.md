Applying for a postgraduate scholarship at the University of Cambridge requires careful planning and attention to detail. As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I will guide you through the process step-by-step, ensuring you understand each component necessary for a successful application. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the application process effectively.

### 1. Start Early

The first step in applying for a postgraduate scholarship at Cambridge is to **start early**. Ideally, you should begin your search for funding opportunities **at least a year before your course begins**. Some courses start in January or April, which means you may need to plan up to **18 months in advance**. Early planning will give you ample time to research various scholarships, understand their requirements, and prepare your application materials.

### 2. Research Funding Opportunities

#### a. **University Funding**

Cambridge offers a variety of funding options, including scholarships managed by the **Cambridge Trust** and other University departments. Begin by exploring the **Postgraduate Funding Search** on the University’s website. This online database lists most funding opportunities available to postgraduate students. 

#### b. **External Funding**

In addition to university-specific funding, consider looking for **external scholarships**. These can include government funding, private foundations, and international scholarships that may be relevant to your field of study or nationality. Investigate websites dedicated to external funding and the **Accessibility and Disability Resource Centre** if applicable.

### 3. Understand the Deadlines

Each scholarship has its own deadlines, which may differ from the deadlines for your course application. It’s crucial to check the **Course Directory** for the relevant funding deadlines related to your chosen program. Make a note of these dates and create a timeline to ensure you don’t miss any critical deadlines. 

### 4. Complete Your Application

#### a. **Submit a Complete Application**

When applying for a scholarship, ensure that your application is complete. This includes:

- **Application Form:** Fill out the graduate application form accurately through the **Applicant Portal**.
- **References:** Obtain references from credible sources who can vouch for your academic and professional capabilities. Ensure they know your goals and can discuss your qualifications.

The application must be submitted by **23:59 GMT** on the relevant funding deadline. 

#### b. **Apply for Funding**

During your application in the **Applicant Portal**, make sure to tick the box indicating that you wish to apply for funding. This step is crucial as it alerts the admissions team to consider you for funding opportunities. 

#### c. **Specify Preferred Funds**

While it is not mandatory, specifying which Cambridge Trust funds you feel particularly eligible for can be beneficial. This allows the selection committee to assess your application in light of specific funding criteria.

### 5. Additional Application Forms

Some scholarships may require additional fields or a separate application form. It’s essential to read the guidelines for each scholarship carefully to ensure you complete all necessary components of the application. Pay attention to any specific requirements or documents requested by the scholarship body.

### 6. Investigate College and Department Funding

In addition to university-wide scholarships, many colleges and departments at Cambridge offer their own funding opportunities. Review the **college and department websites** to find out about these additional funding sources. Some may have separate applications or additional criteria.

### 7. Transfer to the Funding College

If you receive funding from a specific college, you will need to transfer to that college to accept the funding. Be prepared for this possibility and understand the implications it may have on your studies and research opportunities.

### 8. Prepare for Interviews or Selection Processes

Some scholarships may require an interview or additional selection process. If selected for an interview, prepare thoroughly by:

- **Researching the scholarship** and its goals.
- **Practicing common interview questions** related to your research, motivations, and future plans.
- **Being ready to discuss your academic achievements** and how the scholarship will help you achieve your goals.

### 9. Follow Up on Your Application

After submitting your application, keep track of it. Some funding bodies may not provide individual feedback to unsuccessful applicants due to the volume of applications they receive. However, don’t hesitate to reach out to the relevant funding body if you have questions or need clarification about your application status.

### 10. Check for Updates

The **Postgraduate Funding Search** is a live database, meaning that funding bodies may update their information if circumstances change. Regularly check the database for any new opportunities or changes to existing scholarships.

### 11. Additional Tips

- **Seek Guidance:** If you have questions about the application process or need assistance, consider reaching out to the admissions office or the funding body. They can provide valuable insights and clarify any uncertainties.
- **Tailor Your Application:** When applying for specific scholarships, tailor your personal statement and application materials to reflect the values and goals of the scholarship. Highlight how your research aligns with the scholarship's objectives.
- **Financial Planning:** Understand the total cost of your program, including tuition fees and living expenses. Having a clear financial plan can help you identify which scholarships will best support your studies.

### Conclusion

Applying for a postgraduate scholarship at the University of Cambridge is a structured process that requires early preparation, thorough research, and careful attention to deadlines. By following the steps outlined above, you can enhance your chances of securing funding for your postgraduate studies. Remember to begin your search early, complete your applications meticulously, and explore both university and external funding opportunities. Good luck with your application!
