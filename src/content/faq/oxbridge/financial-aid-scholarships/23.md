Absolutely, there are numerous funding options specifically tailored for science students at the University of Oxford. Understanding these funding opportunities can significantly ease the financial burden associated with pursuing a degree in sciences at one of the world's leading universities. Below, I'll outline the various funding options available, categorized into undergraduate and graduate levels, along with eligibility criteria, application procedures, and additional advice for maximizing your chances of securing funding.

### Funding Options for Undergraduate Science Students

1. **Non-repayable Bursaries and Scholarships:**
   - **Crankstart Scholarship:** This scholarship is targeted at UK residents who are pursuing their first undergraduate degree and come from households with an annual income of £32,500 or less. It offers a non-repayable bursary of up to £6,090 per year, which can significantly help with study and living costs. In addition, recipients gain access to funded internships and volunteering opportunities, as well as social events.
   - **Oxford Bursary:** Designed for UK or Republic of Ireland students from lower-income households, this bursary is available for students who are not eligible for a Crankstart Scholarship. The amount awarded varies based on household income and can assist with essential costs.
   - **Oxford Travel Supplement:** If you live more than 80 miles from Oxford, you may qualify for this supplement. It provides £220 for students living between 80 and 150 miles away and £550 for those residing more than 150 miles from the university.
   - **Student Support Bursary:** This bursary is intended to help UK students facing financial difficulties during their studies. It can cover various exceptional costs or financial shortfalls.
   - **Care Leaver Bursary:** If you have been in care or lack family support, this bursary offers up to £3,500 annually throughout your course, provided you apply for the full government support available.

### Funding Options for Graduate Science Students

1. **University-administered Scholarships:**
   - The University of Oxford offers over 1,000 graduate scholarships annually. Most of these scholarships are awarded based on academic merit and potential, covering some or all course fees and living costs. Importantly, many scholarships do not require a separate application; eligible students are automatically considered based on their graduate application.
   - Utilize the **Fees, funding and scholarships search** tool on the university’s website to identify scholarships that may require additional applications.

2. **Research Council Studentships:**
   - The seven UK Research Councils provide significant funding for research and studentships across various disciplines, including science. Research studentships typically cover fees and a living stipend for home and international students, although there are often limitations on the number of international students funded.
   - Notably, different councils focus on specific fields:
     - **BBSRC:** Funds bioscience research.
     - **EPSRC:** Supports engineering and physical sciences.
     - **MRC:** Funds medical research.
     - **NERC:** Focuses on environmental sciences.
   - You can gain more specific information about these studentships on your respective department's website.

3. **College Partnership Awards:**
   - These awards, which are fully funded Research Council scholarships, are partially financed by individual colleges. If you receive a Research Council studentship, you may automatically be considered for a College Partnership Award.

4. **Studentships:**
   - Various academic departments, colleges, and external organizations offer funded postgraduate research student awards. These can provide full or partial financial support for a specific research area. Check your department's website for current studentship opportunities and application instructions.
