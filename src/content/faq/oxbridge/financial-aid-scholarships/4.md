Yes, there are specific scholarships for physics students at the University of Cambridge. The availability of scholarships can significantly enhance your experience and ease the financial burden associated with studying at one of the world’s top universities. Below, I will outline the scholarships that are particularly relevant for physics students, including details about eligibility criteria, application processes, and additional insights that may help you in your journey toward securing funding for your studies.

### Scholarships for Physics Students at Cambridge

1. **Cavendish Laboratory Scholarships**
   - **Overview:** The Cavendish Laboratory is a part of the Department of Physics at Cambridge, renowned for its research and innovation. The Cavendish Laboratory Scholarships are specifically aimed at outstanding postgraduate students in the field of physics.
   - **Eligibility:** These scholarships are awarded to the most exceptional applicants who have applied for postgraduate studies in physics. While there is no separate application process for these scholarships, candidates are automatically considered based on their postgraduate admissions application.
   - **Application Process:** To be considered, you need to submit a complete application for postgraduate study in physics through the University of Cambridge's admissions system. Ensure that you highlight your academic achievements, research interests, and any relevant experience in your application to strengthen your candidacy.

2. **Gates Cambridge Scholarships**
