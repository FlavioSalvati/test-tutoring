Yes, international students can obtain financial aid at Cambridge University, but the options are somewhat limited compared to domestic students. It's essential to understand the types of financial support available, the eligibility criteria, and the application procedures. This guide will outline the key avenues for financial aid available to international students at Cambridge, focusing on both undergraduate and postgraduate studies.

### Financial Aid for International Undergraduate Students

1. **Limited Financial Aid**: 
   International undergraduates have access to a variety of financial support options, but these are generally partial and depend on your financial circumstances. The majority of aid requires a means test, meaning your financial need is assessed to determine your eligibility for support.

2. **Types of Aid Available**:
   - **Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust Awards**: These awards are primarily partial scholarships available to overseas students who have been accepted into a Cambridge College. They aim to support students facing financial difficulties.
   - **College Awards**: Individual Cambridge Colleges may have their own funds to assist international students financially. Each college has a unique set of resources, so it's advisable to directly contact the college admissions office for detailed information about available awards.
   - **Country-Specific Scholarships**: Some scholarships are tailored specifically for students from certain countries. You can find a list of these scholarships on the Cambridge Trust website, categorized by the country you are applying from.
   - **International Disabled Students’ Fund (IDS Fund)**: If you are an eligible offer holder or student classified as international for fee purposes and have a disability, you can apply for this fund to help cover disability-related costs.
   - **Prince Philip Scholarship**: This scholarship is available for permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and offers both cash awards and means-tested support for tuition fees and living costs. It’s important to apply for this scholarship simultaneously with your Cambridge application.

3. **Proof of Funds**:
   When applying to Cambridge, you must demonstrate that you can finance your entire course of study. This requirement is crucial, especially since working during your studies is restricted, making it risky to depend on income from part-time jobs. Ensure you have clear documentation of your financial situation, which may include bank statements, scholarship letters, or parental support.

4. **Dependents**:
   If you plan to bring dependents (such as spouses or children) to Cambridge, you must provide evidence of sufficient financial support for their living costs as well. This requirement is particularly important since the cost of living can be significant in Cambridge.

### Cambridge Bursary Scheme

The Cambridge Bursary Scheme offers additional financial support for undergraduate students, which is particularly beneficial for low-income families. 

- **Automatic Consideration**: If you apply for a Student Finance loan, you will automatically be considered for this bursary scheme.
- **Financial Support**: This scheme can provide up to £3,500 per year in non-repayable financial support, with potential for higher amounts if you meet specific criteria. 
- **No Application Process Required**: One of the advantages of this scheme is that you don’t need to go through a separate application process for the bursary or related awards.

### Additional Financial Support Options

International students should explore other avenues for financial support, including:

- **Faculty and Department Funding**: Your academic faculty or department may offer grants, prizes, or funds for outstanding academic performance. Check their official websites for any available opportunities.
- **College Funding**: Each college may also have its own set of grants, scholarships, prizes, and bursaries. Contact your college directly for specific details about what they offer.
- **Student Parent Support**: If you are a student parent, Cambridge has financial support schemes to help cover the cost of OFSTED registered childcare, which can significantly ease the financial burden of studying while raising children.

### Financial Aid for International Postgraduate Students

For postgraduate students, particularly those from outside the UK, there are several prestigious scholarship options available:

1. **Gates Cambridge Scholarships**: 
   These scholarships are highly competitive and provide full funding for outstanding applicants from outside the UK to pursue postgraduate studies in any subject. They cover tuition fees, a maintenance allowance, and discretionary funding. 
   - **Selection Criteria**: Applicants are evaluated based on outstanding intellectual ability, the rationale behind their choice of course, a commitment to improving lives, and demonstrated leadership potential.

2. **Clarendon Scholarships**: 
   Although primarily associated with Oxford University, it’s worth noting that similar scholarships based on academic excellence may be available at Cambridge as well. These scholarships typically cover tuition fees, college fees, and provide a generous living allowance.

3. **Rhodes Scholarship**: 
   While this scholarship is primarily for study at Oxford University, it is an example of the type of funding available for exceptional individuals worldwide. It covers tuition fees, living expenses, and encourages a diverse community of scholars.

### General Information on Financial Considerations

- **Tuition Fees**: For international students, tuition fees at Cambridge are generally high, ranging from £30,000 to £50,000 per year, depending on the course.
- **Living Costs**: In addition to tuition, living costs must also be considered. Cambridge is slightly more affordable than Oxford, with living costs estimated at approximately £1,026 per month (excluding tuition fees). Oxford's costs range from £1,345 to £1,955 per month.
  
### Application Process

The application process for Oxbridge is rigorous and competitive. To enhance your chances of receiving financial aid and being accepted:

1. **Top Academic Grades**: Ensure you achieve outstanding academic grades in your current studies.
2. **Admissions Tests**: Prepare for and perform well on any required admissions tests specific to your course.
3. **Strong Personal Statement**: Write a compelling personal statement that highlights your academic achievements, motivation for studying at Cambridge, and any relevant extracurricular activities.
4. **References**: Secure strong references from teachers or professionals who can vouch for your abilities and character.
5. **Interviews**: Be prepared for the interview process, which is a critical aspect of the selection process at Cambridge. Practice common interview questions and articulate your passion for your chosen field of study.

### Conclusion

In summary, while financial aid opportunities for international students at Cambridge University are limited, several options are available for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. It's crucial to research and reach out to the appropriate sources for funding, including college-specific awards, international scholarships, and general financial support schemes.

Always check the official university and scholarship websites for the most up-to-date information, as funding opportunities and requirements can change. Make sure you present a strong application, not only for your academic program but also for any financial aid you wish to pursue. This approach will maximize your chances of receiving the necessary support to make your studies at Cambridge a reality.
