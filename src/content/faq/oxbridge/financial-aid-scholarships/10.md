Finding financial aid for a computer science degree at the University of Cambridge can seem overwhelming, but with a structured approach, you can navigate through the options available to you. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand how to locate and apply for financial aid effectively.

### 1. **Understand the Types of Financial Aid Available**

Cambridge offers various financial support options tailored to different needs. Familiarize yourself with these types:

#### Automatic Bursaries

The **Cambridge Bursary** is automatically awarded to UK-resident undergraduate students from lower-income households. If your household income is £32,500 or less, you could receive a bursary of up to £3,500 per year to help cover your study and living costs.

#### Crankstart Scholarships

These scholarships are specifically aimed at UK students from lower-income backgrounds studying for their first undergraduate degree. The Crankstart Scholarship can provide up to £6,090 per year, along with additional benefits like funded internships, volunteering opportunities, and social events.

#### Student Finance

If you are from the EU, EEA, or Switzerland and have settled or pre-settled status, you might qualify for "Home fee status" and access to student finance from the UK government. This can also make you eligible for the Oxford Bursary.

#### Travel Supplement

If you live more than 80 miles from Cambridge, you can receive an annual travel supplement of £220. For those living over 150 miles away, this increases to £550, helping to offset travel costs.

#### Student Support Bursary

This non-repayable bursary is available for UK students who are experiencing financial difficulties or need additional support to cover costs.

#### Centrally Administered Scholarships

The university administers a limited number of scholarships for undergraduate students, such as the **Reach Oxford Scholarship**, which is designed for students from low-income countries.

#### College-Specific Scholarships

Each of the 31 colleges at Cambridge offers its own set of scholarships, grants, and bursaries. When applying, check the specific college you are interested in for unique opportunities.

### 2. **Research Financial Aid Options**

#### Cambridge Trust

Start by visiting the **Cambridge Trust** website, which provides a comprehensive list of available scholarships. Familiarize yourself with the eligibility criteria and application processes. 

#### Fees, Funding, and Scholarship Search Tool

Utilize the **Fees, Funding, and Scholarship Search Tool** on the University of Cambridge website. This tool allows you to explore a detailed list of funding options offered by colleges, departments, and faculties, making it easier to identify potential financial aid opportunities.

#### External Scholarships

Look into external scholarships as well. The Cambridge Trust provides information about scholarships offered by organizations such as the British Council Mexico, Charles Wallace Trust, Google, and others. Applying for these could provide additional financial support.

### 3. **Application Process**

#### UCAS Application

All undergraduate applicants must submit their applications through UCAS by the deadline of October 15th (18:00 UK time). Missing this deadline will disqualify you from any funding opportunities through the Cambridge Trust.

#### Conditional Offer of Admission

The Cambridge Trust only considers applications from students who have received a conditional offer of admission from a Cambridge college. Ensure you understand the terms of your offer and meet any conditions set.

#### Separate Scholarship Applications

Some Cambridge Trust scholarships require a separate application beyond the UCAS form. Be aware of these requirements and submit both applications by the relevant deadlines to be considered for these scholarships.

### 4. **Prepare Your Application**

#### Gather Required Documents

Ensure you have all necessary documents ready for your applications, including financial information, proof of eligibility, and any personal statements or references required by specific scholarships.

#### Write a Strong Personal Statement

If a personal statement is required as part of the application, make sure it clearly articulates your financial need and how the scholarship will help you achieve your academic goals. Be honest, concise, and compelling in your writing.

### 5. **Timely Application Submission**

#### Apply Early

The Cambridge Trust's awards period runs from March to July. Aim to submit your applications as early as possible. Early applications can sometimes result in quicker decisions, which is advantageous for planning your finances.

### 6. **Communication and Follow-Up**

Stay proactive in your communication. After submitting your application, keep an eye on your email for any updates or requests for additional information from the Cambridge Trust. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to the financial aid office at the university or the specific college you are applying to.

### 7. **Be Aware of Important Considerations**

- **High Volume of Applications:** Keep in mind that the Cambridge Trust receives a high volume of applications. While successful candidates are notified as early as possible, unsuccessful applicants may not receive notifications due to the sheer number of submissions.
  
- **Financial Hardship:** If you find yourself in financial hardship after your application has been submitted, reach out to your college’s financial support office. They may offer additional resources or guidance.

### Conclusion

Finding financial aid for a computer science degree at Cambridge is a process that requires careful research and timely applications. By understanding the various funding options available, thoroughly researching eligible scholarships, and preparing your applications diligently, you can enhance your chances of receiving financial support.

Make use of the resources provided by the Cambridge Trust and other financial aid tools offered by the university. Be proactive in your approach, stay informed about deadlines, and communicate effectively with the university’s financial aid offices. Good luck!
