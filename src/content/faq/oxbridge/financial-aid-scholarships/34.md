Understanding scholarship application deadlines at the University of Cambridge is essential for prospective students seeking financial support. The deadlines can vary significantly depending on the type of scholarship, the specific course you are applying for, and whether you are an undergraduate or postgraduate student. Below is a detailed overview of the scholarship application deadlines, along with some tips to ensure you stay organized and submit your applications on time.

### Key Deadlines for Scholarship Applications at Cambridge

1. **University Funding Deadlines for Postgraduate Students**:
   - For the **2025/26 academic year**, the deadlines for university funding are course-specific. This means that the deadline for submitting your full application, including references, is **23:59 GMT** on the relevant funding deadline for your chosen program. 
   - You must check the **Course Directory** for the specific deadline pertaining to your course.

2. **Separate Funding Applications**:
   - Some scholarships and funds may require a separate application form. For these, the deadlines may differ from the main course application deadline. 
   - It is crucial to consult the **Postgraduate Funding Search** and the individual funding websites, including those of your College and department, to get accurate information about these separate deadlines.

3. **Cambridge Trust Scholarships**:
   - The Cambridge Trust offers scholarships for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. The application period for these scholarships typically runs from **March to July** of the year preceding your start date. For instance, if you are applying for scholarships for a course starting in October, you will need to ensure all necessary applications are submitted by the end of July.
   - Note that you must have a conditional offer of admission before your application for funding can be considered. This means if you miss the **UCAS application deadline** of **15 October 2024** for undergraduate study, you will likely miss the funding deadline as well.

4. **Gates Cambridge Scholarships**:
   - Gates Cambridge Scholarships cover the full cost of studying at Cambridge for outstanding international applicants. The deadlines for these scholarships align with the course application dates. Therefore, it is crucial to submit your course application by the stipulated deadlines to be eligible for this funding.

5. **Undergraduate Bursaries**:
   - For undergraduate students, the Cambridge Bursary and related awards are automatically considered when you apply for a Student Finance loan. This means there is no separate application process; however, your eligibility is based on household income.

6. **College-Specific Funding**:
   - Each College at Cambridge may have its funding opportunities with distinct deadlines. Most Colleges will list their funding opportunities on their websites, and many require you to select them as a preference in your application to be eligible for their funding. 
   - Some Colleges might still consider you even if you didn’t select them, but checking individual College websites for their funding information is advisable.

### Tips to Stay Organized with Scholarship Applications

1. **Create a Timeline**:
   - Develop a timeline that includes all relevant deadlines for your course and funding applications. Use a calendar or project management tool to keep track of different deadlines and ensure you allocate sufficient time for each step of the application process.

2. **Check Eligibility Criteria**:
   - Each scholarship will have specific eligibility criteria. Ensure you thoroughly read through these before applying, as this can save you time and effort. If you are unsure about your eligibility, reach out to the funding bodies or your prospective College for clarification.

3. **Prepare Your Application Early**:
   - Start preparing your application materials well in advance. This includes your statement of purpose, references, and any additional documents specific to the scholarship application. The earlier you begin, the less stressful the process will be.

4. **Seek Feedback**:
   - Before submitting your applications, seek feedback from mentors, teachers, or peers. This can help you refine your application and improve your chances of success.

5. **Follow Up**:
   - After submitting your applications, keep track of which applications you’ve submitted and any responses you receive. If you have not received any communication by the deadlines mentioned, it’s perfectly acceptable to follow up with the relevant departments or funding bodies.

6. **Stay Informed**:
   - Keep yourself updated on any changes to deadlines or funding opportunities. Check the University and College websites regularly, as they may post important updates.

7. **Utilize Resources**:
   - Take advantage of resources provided by the University, including workshops on scholarship applications and financial aid consultations. Many Colleges and departments also have advisers who can assist you in navigating the funding landscape.
