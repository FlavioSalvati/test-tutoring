### By What Criteria, Other Than Grades, Do Oxbridge Decide Whom to Interview?

While academic grades are a crucial factor in the Oxbridge admissions process, other criteria also play a significant role in determining which applicants are invited for an interview. Hereâ€™s a closer look at these additional factors:

### Key Criteria for Interview Selection

1. **Personal Statement**:
   - **Description**: The personal statement is a critical component of the application. It provides insights into your motivations, interests, and suitability for the course. Admissions tutors look for well-written statements that demonstrate your passion for the subject and your ability to reflect on your experiences and aspirations.
   - **Example**: A strong personal statement for a Philosophy course might include thoughtful reflections on philosophical readings and your reasons for pursuing the subject.

2. **Performance in Admissions Tests**:
   - **Description**: Many courses require applicants to take admissions tests that assess subject-specific skills and knowledge. Performance in these tests can influence the decision to invite you for an interview, as they provide an additional measure of your academic abilities.
   - **Example**: For Mathematics, the MAT (Mathematics Admissions Test) results are used to gauge problem-solving skills and mathematical aptitude.

3. **Relevant Extracurricular Activities**:
   - **Description**: Involvement in extracurricular activities that are relevant to your chosen course can strengthen your application. Activities that show commitment, leadership, or practical experience in the subject area are particularly valued.
   - **Example**: For a Medicine application, relevant experience might include volunteering in healthcare settings or participating in medical research projects.

4. **Academic References**:
   - **Description**: References from teachers or mentors can provide additional context about your academic abilities, work ethic, and potential. Strong, supportive references that highlight your achievements and suitability for the course can positively impact the decision to interview you.
   - **Example**: A reference for a Chemistry applicant might emphasize your performance in lab work and your enthusiasm for scientific research.

5. **Evidence of Genuine Interest and Potential**:
   - **Description**: Admissions tutors look for signs of genuine interest in the subject and potential for success in the course. This can be demonstrated through your application, interviews, and any additional assessments or coursework you have submitted.
   - **Example**: For a History application, showing evidence of independent research or historical writing can demonstrate a deep interest in the subject.

6. **Additional Assessments**:
   - **Description**: Some courses require additional assessments or written work as part of the application process. These can provide further insight into your abilities and may influence the decision to invite you for an interview.
   - **Example**: The Cambridge Natural Sciences course requires submission of a written piece or coursework, which is reviewed alongside other application materials.

### How to Enhance Your Application

1. **Craft a Compelling Personal Statement**:
   - **Description**: Ensure your personal statement is well-crafted and effectively communicates your passion and suitability for the course. Highlight relevant experiences, achievements, and your academic interests.
   - **Example**: Discuss specific projects or experiences that have prepared you for the course and align with the academic focus of the program.

2. **Prepare for Admissions Tests**:
   - **Description**: If your chosen course includes an admissions test, prepare thoroughly to achieve the best possible score. Practice past papers, understand the test format, and seek support if needed.
   - **Example**: Use online resources or preparatory courses to familiarize yourself with the test content and format.

3. **Engage in Relevant Activities**:
   - **Description**: Participate in extracurricular activities that are relevant to your course and demonstrate your commitment and skills. Seek opportunities that align with your academic interests and career goals.
   - **Example**: For a course in Environmental Science, involvement in conservation projects or environmental advocacy can strengthen your application.
