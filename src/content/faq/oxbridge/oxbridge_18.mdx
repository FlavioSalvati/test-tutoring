### Criteria for Judging Oxbridge Applicants Beyond Grades

While outstanding academic grades are essential for admission to Oxford and Cambridge, these universities evaluate applicants using a comprehensive set of criteria to ensure they select candidates who are not only academically capable but also well-suited for their rigorous programs. Here are the key additional criteria:

#### 1. **Personal Statement**
   - Applicants must submit a personal statement detailing their academic interests, motivations, and relevant experiences. This statement helps admissions tutors assess the applicant's enthusiasm for their chosen subject and their ability to articulate their thoughts and aspirations.

#### 2. **Interviews**
   - Both Oxford and Cambridge conduct interviews to evaluate an applicant’s thinking process, problem-solving skills, and suitability for their chosen course. Interviews are designed to simulate academic discussions and assess how applicants approach complex problems and think critically.

#### 3. **References**
   - Strong references from teachers or mentors are crucial. These references provide insight into the applicant's academic achievements, character, and potential. They help the admissions team understand the applicant’s performance and potential from the perspective of those who know them well.

#### 4. **Admissions Tests**
   - Many courses require specific admissions tests that assess subject-specific knowledge and skills. For example, Oxford may require the BMAT or the MAT for medical and mathematical sciences respectively. Cambridge might require the TSA or the STEP exam for certain courses. These tests provide an additional measure of the applicant's readiness for the course.

#### 5. **Extracurricular Activities**
   - Relevant extracurricular activities, such as academic clubs, competitions, or work experience, can enhance an application. They demonstrate a well-rounded individual who is engaged in their field of interest beyond the classroom.

#### 6. **Contextual Information**
   - Contextual information about the applicant's background, including their school or personal circumstances, may be considered to provide a fuller picture of their achievements and potential.

In summary, Oxford and Cambridge take a holistic approach to admissions, ensuring that they select students who excel not only in academics but also in personal and intellectual qualities that predict success in their challenging academic environments.
