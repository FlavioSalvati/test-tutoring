When considering dining options at Oxford colleges, it’s essential to understand that each college has its unique offerings, atmosphere, and regulations. This guide provides insights into some of the prominent colleges, namely St Cross College and University College, as well as general dining hall practices throughout the University of Oxford. 

### 1. Dining at St Cross College

St Cross College is well-known for its exceptional food quality, which is a significant draw for students. Here’s a detailed look at what you can expect:

- **Daily Meals:** The catering team at St Cross serves a range of delicious meals in the dining hall, known as Hall. You can enjoy everything from a hearty full English breakfast in the café to a three-course lunch that is both tasty and offers great value for money. 

- **Lunch Schedule:** Lunch is available with two sittings at 12:00 and 13:00. To take advantage of this, you will need to book your spot in advance. Bookings close when the capacity is full or at 14:00 the day before lunch. It’s worth noting that cancellations must be made by 14:00 the day prior to avoid any charges.

- **Summer Break:** The college dining services are not available during the summer break, so be mindful of the last lunch date, which is usually in early August, and when services resume in September.

- **Alumni Lunches:** Alumni can also participate in the college dining experience but are limited to lunch twice per term at a cost of £13.90 per person, requiring at least one day's notice for booking.

- **Common Room Membership:** Members of the college have the privilege of dining five times a week, which is a great way to socialize and enjoy the college atmosphere.

- **Formal Dinners:** Formal Hall takes place on Tuesday nights and is a highlight of the week. Students are encouraged to wear gowns, adding to the traditional Oxford experience. Reservations for Hall close each Friday at 10:00, and members can invite up to three guests.

- **Dietary Needs:** It is crucial to inform the college of any dietary requirements or seating preferences at the time of booking. 

- **Special Events:** The college hosts regular formal dinners and feasts throughout the year, which also require pre-booking. 

- **Café and Bar:** The café operates Monday to Friday from 08:30 to 14:30, offering coffee, breakfast, and lunch options. On Wednesdays to Fridays, a pizza menu is available for a quick meal. The bar is a more informal setting for members to relax with drinks and games, open on Fridays from 20:00 to 23:00.

### 2. Dining at University College

University College, one of the oldest colleges, offers a diverse range of dining options that cater to different tastes and preferences:

- **Self-Service Meals:** The college provides self-service meals for both lunch and dinner, allowing students to choose from a wide daily selection and a rotating weekly menu. This flexibility is appreciated by students who prefer a more casual dining experience.

- **Formal Hall:** Formal Hall dinners occur twice a week, providing a classic dining experience. These meals are served at the table and are a great opportunity to dress up and enjoy a more formal atmosphere.

- **Breakfast Options:** Breakfast is offered every day except Sunday, with options including a cooked breakfast, toast, and cereal. This variety helps students start their day on the right foot.

- **Lunch and Dinner Structure:** The first sitting of dinner is informal, allowing students to serve themselves hot meals and salads. The second sitting, however, is formal and features a three-course meal.

- **Special Events:** University College also puts on special event barbecues, student guest-night dinners, and occasion dinners throughout the year, which can be wonderful social opportunities.

- **Dietary Accommodations:** The college is attentive to dietary needs, catering to vegetarians, vegans, and those with specific allergies.

- **Meal Pricing:** Meals are charged to students' personal accounts on a 'pay as you go' basis, which adds convenience. Typical meal prices in the 2023-24 academic year include:
  - Breakfast: £1.50 – £3.85
