Yes, students can live off-campus at Cambridge, particularly after their first year when they have the option to arrange their own accommodation. However, it's important to understand the regulations, requirements, and considerations related to living off-campus. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what prospective students need to know about living off-campus at Cambridge.

### University Regulations and Residency Requirements

#### Residency Requirements

1. **Mandatory Residency**: 
   - Full-time undergraduate students are required to reside in Cambridge for the duration of their studies, unless they are on an approved year abroad or have special permissions as research students.
   - This residency requirement is in place to facilitate in-person engagement with teaching, assessment, and university resources, which is vital for student success.

2. **Residency Definition**:
   - For undergraduates, residency is defined as living within a 3-mile radius of Great St Mary's Church or in accommodation approved by their College.
   - For postgraduate students, the radius extends to 10 miles, which allows for a wider range of accommodation options.

3. **Living Outside the Precincts**:
   - Students may apply for permission to live outside the defined precincts (3 miles for undergraduates and 10 miles for postgraduates) provided that they can demonstrate that their living situation will not adversely affect their studies and attendance.
   - Approval can be revoked if the Department/Faculty finds that the student’s studies are suffering due to their living arrangements.

4. **Application Process**:
   - Applications for residing outside the precincts can be made through the CamSIS self-service portal, and students should ensure they understand the conditions and responsibilities involved in such arrangements.

### Accommodation Options for Off-Campus Living

1. **University Accommodation Service**:
   - The University offers a comprehensive service to help students find suitable off-campus accommodation. This includes both University-provided accommodation and private student accommodation.
   - University-managed accommodation is typically reserved for students and designed to meet their needs.

2. **Private Rental Market**:
   - There is a diverse private rental market in Cambridge with houses and flats available for rent. Students should be aware that renting off-campus tends to be more expensive than College accommodation, particularly if renting year-round.
   - Students living off-campus still retain access to College facilities, including meals and laundry.

### Benefits of Living Off-Campus

1. **Independence and Flexibility**:
   - Living off-campus allows students to choose their living arrangements more freely, which can lead to a more personalized living environment.

2. **Space and Privacy**:
   - Many students find off-campus housing offers more space and privacy compared to on-campus accommodations, which can be especially appealing for those wanting their own kitchen or bathroom.

3. **Customization of Living Environment**:
   - Students have the opportunity to create a living space that reflects their personal taste and lifestyle, which can enhance their overall experience.

4. **Potential Cost Savings**:
   - While long-term costs may be higher, sharing accommodation with roommates can lead to short-term savings compared to the costs of College accommodation.

### Challenges of Living Off-Campus

1. **Higher Costs**:
   - Students must consider not just rent, but also utilities, furniture, and other living expenses that may add up quickly.

2. **Increased Responsibility**:
   - Living off-campus means that students are responsible for various aspects of daily life, including budgeting, paying bills, and managing household tasks.

3. **Commuting Considerations**:
   - Depending on the location of the off-campus accommodation, students may face longer commutes, which can impact their ability to attend classes and engage in University life.

4. **Social Isolation Risks**:
   - There is a risk of feeling isolated when living off-campus, as students may find it harder to connect with their College community compared to those living in College accommodation.

### Considerations Before Living Off-Campus

1. **Budgeting**:
   - It's crucial for students to create a realistic budget that includes all potential expenses, such as rent, utilities, food, transportation, and leisure activities.

2. **Location**:
   - Students should consider the distance from their College and the University, as well as the availability and convenience of commuting options.

3. **Living Environment**:
   - Assess the type of accommodation desired, amenities needed, and the overall atmosphere of the neighborhood.

4. **Roommate Dynamics**:
   - If sharing accommodation, it’s essential to choose roommates carefully to ensure compatibility regarding lifestyles, habits, and responsibilities.

5. **Safety and Security**:
   - Researching the safety of the neighborhood is vital. Students should consider security features of the accommodation and the general safety of the area.

### Resources and Support for Students Living Off-Campus

1. **University Accommodation Service**:
   - This service provides resources and support for students looking for off-campus housing options, including advice on contracts and tenant rights.

2. **College Support**:
   - Colleges often provide guidance on finding off-campus accommodation and can assist students in understanding their rights and responsibilities as tenants.

3. **Local Housing Agencies**:
   - Various local agencies can offer additional support, including information on rental agreements and housing rights.

4. **Student Unions**:
   - The Cambridge Student Union can provide guidance on living off-campus and address any concerns students may have regarding their accommodation situations.

### Conclusion

In summary, while students at Cambridge can live off-campus, it requires careful consideration of several factors, including university regulations, personal finances, and lifestyle preferences. The benefits of independence and flexibility are significant, but they come with responsibilities that need to be managed effectively. With proper planning, students can create a fulfilling living experience outside of traditional College accommodation. 

Before making a decision, it’s essential for prospective students to weigh the pros and cons, assess their personal circumstances, and utilize the available resources and support systems. With these strategies in mind, living off-campus can be a rewarding aspect of the Cambridge experience.
