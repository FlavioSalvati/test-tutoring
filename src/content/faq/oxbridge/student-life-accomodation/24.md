### Types of Accommodation

1. **Studio Apartments**:
   - Typically range from **£110 to £270 per person per month**. 
   - These are self-contained units that provide privacy and independence, making them a popular choice for many students.

2. **Shared Houses**:
   - Sharing a house with other students can be a more economical option, although rents can still be relatively high compared to other UK cities.
   - While the rent can be lower, it is essential to consider the additional costs of living in a shared environment, such as shared utilities.

### Additional Costs to Consider

1. **Utilities**:
   - Many private accommodations do not include utilities (electricity, gas, water, and internet) in the rent, which can add an extra burden on your budget.
   - The estimated cost for utilities can range from **£110 to £160 per person per month**. This should be factored into your total monthly expenses.

2. **Location**:
   - The location of your accommodation significantly affects the cost. Properties closer to the city center and university campuses are generally more expensive.
   - If you are considering living further from campus, you may find cheaper options, but keep in mind the potential transportation costs.

3. **Size and Amenities**:
   - Larger accommodations with more amenities (like en-suite bathrooms, high-speed internet, gyms) will typically cost more. 
   - It is crucial to assess what amenities are essential for your lifestyle, as this can help you find a balance between comfort and cost.

### Factors Affecting Costs

1. **Duration of Lease**:

2. **Market Demand**:
   - Oxford is a popular university city, which means the demand for accommodation, especially during the start of the academic year, can lead to higher prices.
   - Starting your search early is vital to securing a good deal.

### Tips for Finding Affordable Accommodation

1. **Start Your Search Early**:
   - Begin your accommodation search well in advance of your arrival in Oxford. This will give you a better chance to find suitable options at reasonable prices.

2. **Research Thoroughly**:
   - Use various platforms to compare prices and features. Websites like Rightmove, Zoopla, and student-specific accommodation sites can provide valuable insights into the market.

3. **Consider Location Wisely**:
   - While living close to your university can be convenient, it can also be more expensive. Assess the cost versus convenience of living slightly further away but within easy reach of public transportation.

4. **Arrange Viewings**:
   - Always try to view properties in person. This allows you to assess the condition of the accommodation and ask any questions directly to the landlord or agent.

5. **Compare Prices**:
   - Don’t settle for the first option you find. Compare multiple listings and negotiate where possible. Many landlords are open to discussion, especially if you can offer a longer lease.

6. **Explore Shared Living**:
   - Consider shared houses or apartments, as they often offer lower rent than private studio apartments. This can also foster a sense of community.

7. **Student Discounts**:
   - Utilize student discounts available in various sectors, including supermarkets and local eateries, to help manage your overall budget.
