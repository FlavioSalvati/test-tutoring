Life at Cambridge during university breaks is a unique and enriching experience that offers students the opportunity to pursue various activities, both academic and personal. While the academic year is intense and demanding, breaks provide a necessary respite and a chance to engage in different pursuits. Here’s a comprehensive overview of what life at Cambridge looks like during these breaks, covering aspects such as work experience opportunities, accommodation, financial considerations, and activities students may partake in.

### 1. Work Experience Opportunities

One of the most significant aspects of university breaks is the opportunity for students to gain work experience. Many students choose to utilize this time productively, either through internships, part-time jobs, or volunteering. 

#### Types of Work Experience

- **Internships:** A significant portion of students, about 66%, work during their summer breaks, although not all are involved in formal internship programs with large corporations. Instead, many students leverage personal networks or speculative applications to secure internships. This can be particularly beneficial for students looking to enter competitive fields.

- **Project Work and Research Assistant Positions:** Many courses at Cambridge require students to undertake projects or research, especially for dissertations. Students often find opportunities within their departments to work as research assistants. These positions, while sometimes advertised, are frequently secured through direct contact with faculty members. Engaging in research can be invaluable in refining career choices and enhancing a CV.

- **STEM Programmes:** Several programs specifically cater to STEM students, providing avenues to explore academic or industry research. These experiences can lay a solid foundation for future careers in research or technology.

- **Volunteering:** Engaging in volunteer work is another excellent way for students to gain experience while contributing to the community. Volunteering can be especially beneficial when combined with part-time paid work, allowing students to demonstrate their ability to manage their time effectively.

#### Finding Work Experience

To find work experience opportunities, students can utilize various resources, including:

- **Handshake:** This platform is increasingly popular among students and employers alike, helping students connect with job opportunities across various sectors.
