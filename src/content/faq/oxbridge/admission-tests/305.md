As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I'm glad to provide clarity regarding the English Literature Admissions Test (ELAT) and the available resources for preparation. The question at hand is whether there are specific ELAT prep workshops or courses. 

### ELAT Overview

First, let’s recap what the ELAT is and its significance in the admissions process for English courses at Oxford. The ELAT is a 90-minute computer-based exam that assesses your reading and reasoning abilities rather than your prior knowledge of literature. In this test, you will be asked to write an essay comparing and contrasting two literary extracts related to a common theme, which can range from poetry to prose, drama, or even non-literary sources. 

### Current Status of ELAT Workshops and Courses

It is important to note that as of now, **Oxford University does not offer specific ELAT prep workshops or courses**. This means that if you're looking for structured classes directly organized by the university to help you prepare for the ELAT, you will not find them. 

This absence of formal workshops does not mean you are without support. There are several reputable resources and programs provided by external organizations that can significantly aid in your preparation.

### Available Preparation Resources

1. **Past Papers and Specimen Questions**: 
   - Your primary resource for preparation should be the past papers and specimen questions available on the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing website. These materials give you a clear idea of the exam format and the types of literary extracts you may encounter. 
   - Practicing with these papers will not only help you become familiar with the format but also improve your time management skills during the exam.

2. **Online Practice Tests**:
   - The ELAT website, as well as the Oxford Faculty of English, offers a past paper or equivalent online practice test. Engaging with these materials will enhance your understanding of the exam's expectations.

3. **Tuition Services**:
   - **Keystone Tutors**: They provide specialist tutors who have extensive experience with the ELAT. This could be beneficial if you are looking for personalized support and guidance tailored to your strengths and weaknesses.
   - **UniAdmissions**: They offer various programs, including:
     - **Oxbridge English Premium Programme**: This program features over 150 hours of study material, extensive guidance from knowledgeable tutors, and personalized one-to-one tuition. It also provides help with personal statements and interview preparation.
     - **ELAT Preparation Programme**: This includes over 95 hours of study material, an in-depth syllabus, weekly enrichment seminars, and access to a collection of past papers and answer sheets. 

4. **Study Groups**: 
   - Consider forming study groups with fellow applicants. This can provide a collaborative environment for discussing extracts, sharing insights, and practicing essays together. Peer feedback can be invaluable.

5. **Books and Online Resources**: 
   - There are numerous books aimed at improving literary analysis and essay writing skills. Look for guides specifically focused on literary criticism and essay-writing techniques.
   - Online resources, including blogs, forums, and educational websites, can provide tips and additional exercises to strengthen your writing and analytical skills.

### Focus Areas for Preparation

While there aren’t formal workshops, here are some key areas to focus on during your preparation:

- **Reading Comprehension**: Regularly read a wide range of literary texts. Pay attention to themes, styles, and authorial techniques. This will help you quickly analyze and compare extracts during the exam.
  
- **Essay Writing Skills**: Practice writing essays under timed conditions. Focus on constructing coherent arguments, using textual evidence effectively, and maintaining clarity in your writing.

- **Understanding Themes**: Since extracts will relate to common themes, familiarize yourself with various literary themes and how they manifest across different genres and periods.

- **Critical Thinking**: The ELAT assesses your ability to reason and think critically about texts. Engage with literary criticism and theory to broaden your analytical skills.

- **Feedback**: If possible, seek feedback on your practice essays from teachers, tutors, or peers. Constructive criticism is crucial for improving your writing.

### Conclusion

In summary, while Oxford does not provide ELAT-specific workshops or courses, there are numerous resources available to help you prepare effectively. Utilizing past papers, online tests, and seeking guidance from experienced tutors can significantly enhance your readiness for the exam. 

Focus on improving your reading and writing skills, engage deeply with literary texts, and practice as much as possible. Remember, the ELAT is designed to assess your ability to engage with literature critically, so honing these skills will serve you well not just for the test, but also in your future studies.

Good luck with your preparation, and remember that the key to success in the ELAT lies in your ability to read critically, think analytically, and express your ideas clearly in writing.
