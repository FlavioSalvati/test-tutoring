### 7. Create a Structured Study Plan

Once you have access to a variety of practice papers and resources, it’s crucial to create a structured study plan. Here are some steps to follow:

- **Assess Your Current Level**: Start by taking a diagnostic test (like the online practice test) to assess your current understanding and identify areas for improvement.

- **Set Specific Goals**: Based on your initial assessment, set measurable goals for each study session. For example, aim to complete a certain number of practice questions or essays per week.

- **Mix Practice Types**: Include both multiple-choice questions and essay writing in your preparation. Practicing essays will help you improve your writing style and argumentation skills, which are crucial for Section B.

- **Review and Reflect**: After completing practice papers, spend time reviewing your answers, especially the ones you got wrong. Understand why the correct answer is right and where your reasoning may have failed.

- **Simulate Test Conditions**: Occasionally, take practice tests under timed conditions to simulate the real exam environment. This will help you manage your time effectively during the actual test.
