The ELAT (English Literature Admissions Test) was designed to assess candidates' abilities in critical thinking, close reading, and essay writing, particularly in relation to literary texts. Although the ELAT has been discontinued for the 2024 application cycle, understanding what topics were covered can provide valuable insight into how candidates could prepare for the test and the skills that were deemed essential for success in English literature studies at Oxford. 

### 1. Literary Analysis

At the heart of the ELAT was the requirement for candidates to engage in literary analysis. The test involved comparing and contrasting two literary extracts, and candidates needed to demonstrate the ability to interpret themes, language, structure, and form within the texts. This meant that candidates were expected to cover a variety of literary elements, including:

- **Themes:** Common themes explored in literature, such as love, conflict, identity, and morality. Candidates needed to identify these themes in the extracts and discuss how they were conveyed.
  
- **Characterization:** Understanding how authors construct characters and the roles they play within a narrative. Candidates would analyze character development, motivations, and relationships.

- **Narrative Techniques:** Examining the narrative style and perspective, such as first-person vs. third-person narration, unreliable narrators, and narrative structure.

- **Language and Style:** Attention to the use of language, including diction, imagery, symbolism, and tone. Candidates would need to analyze how language choices contribute to meaning and the overall impact of the text.

### 2. Comparative Analysis

Given that the ELAT required candidates to compare two texts, comparative analysis was a significant aspect. Candidates needed to draw connections and distinctions between the extracts. Topics included:

- **Intertextuality:** Understanding how texts reference or respond to one another, whether through direct quotation, thematic parallels, or contrasting viewpoints.

- **Cultural and Historical Context:** Discussing how the context in which a text was written influences its themes and style. Candidates might have considered the social, political, and historical backdrop of the texts.

- **Form and Genre:** Analyzing how the genre of each extract (poetry, prose, or drama) affects its content and the way meaning is constructed. This includes understanding genre conventions and how authors may subvert them.

### 3. Thematic Connections

The ELAT extracts were linked by a common theme, which could include topics such as:

- **Love and Relationships:** Exploring various aspects of love, including romantic, familial, and platonic relationships.
  
- **Identity and Self:** Investigating themes of personal identity, societal roles, and the search for selfhood.

- **Conflict and Resolution:** Analyzing internal and external conflicts faced by characters and the resolutions or lack thereof.

- **Society and Class:** Understanding how literature reflects social structures, class issues, and cultural norms.

### 4. Close Reading Techniques

Close reading was a critical skill tested in the ELAT. Candidates were required to demonstrate their ability to engage deeply with the text, which includes:

- **Attention to Detail:** Examining specific passages for meaning, including word choice, syntax, and punctuation. Candidates needed to highlight how these details contribute to the overall understanding of the text.

- **Contextual Analysis:** Considering the implications of a text's historical and cultural background when interpreting passages.

- **Thematic Development:** Tracing how themes evolve throughout the texts and how they are articulated through various literary devices.

### 5. Essay Writing Skills

The ELAT was essentially an essay-based test. Therefore, candidates had to demonstrate effective essay writing skills, which encompassed:

- **Thesis Development:** Crafting a clear argument or thesis statement that directly responds to the given extracts and their connections.

- **Structure and Coherence:** Organizing the essay logically, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs with topic sentences, and a conclusion that synthesizes the analysis.

- **Clarity and Precision:** Writing in a clear and precise manner, ensuring that arguments are well-articulated and supported by textual evidence.

- **Critical Engagement:** Demonstrating original thought and critical engagement with the texts, rather than merely summarizing or paraphrasing.

### Conclusion: Preparing for the Future

Although the ELAT has been discontinued, the skills and topics it encompassed remain relevant for aspiring English literature students. Candidates should focus on developing their critical reading and writing abilities, engaging with a wide range of literary texts, and honing their analytical skills in preparation for their studies at institutions like Oxford. 

### Additional Considerations

With the ELAT no longer in place, applicants are encouraged to pay attention to the following:

- **Written Work Submission:** Applicants will still need to submit samples of their written work, which should demonstrate their analytical and writing capabilities.

- **Other Admissions Tests:** If applying for combined courses (e.g., English and History), be sure to check if there are additional admissions tests required for those subjects.

- **Interview Preparation:** The interview process will likely assess similar skills. Candidates should be prepared to discuss their written work and engage in literary discussions.

By focusing on these areas, candidates can effectively prepare for their applications to Oxford and demonstrate their readiness for the challenges of studying English literature.
