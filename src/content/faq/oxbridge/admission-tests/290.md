As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I understand that finding practice materials for the English Literature Admissions Test (ELAT) can be a priority for prospective students. However, since the ELAT is no longer being used for the 2024 application cycle, many resources that were once available may no longer be accessible or relevant. That said, I will guide you through the best strategies to locate ELAT practice papers and additional materials that can still assist in your preparation for English literature studies. Here’s how you can proceed:

### 1. **University of Oxford Resources**
While the ELAT has been discontinued for 2024, it’s wise to check the official University of Oxford website regularly for any updates or archival materials. The Faculty of English historically provided access to past papers and specimen questions on their website. 

- **Visit the Faculty of English Website**: Go to the official Oxford Faculty of English website and navigate to the admissions section. Sometimes, universities maintain an archive of previous materials for reference or educational purposes.

- **Contact Admissions Office**: If you cannot find what you’re looking for, consider reaching out directly to the admissions office via email. They can provide you with guidance on any available resources or direct you to relevant materials.

### 2. **Tutoring Companies**
Many reputable tutoring companies offer resources tailored for Oxbridge applicants, including ELAT practice materials. While the ELAT is now obsolete for your application cycle, some companies may still have materials from previous years that could be beneficial for honing your analytical and writing skills.

- **Research Tutoring Services**: Look for well-reviewed tutoring companies that specialize in Oxbridge admissions. They might provide access to past papers or tailored exercises that mimic the style and structure of the ELAT.

- **Check Online Reviews**: Before engaging with any tutoring service, read reviews or testimonials to ensure the quality and reliability of their materials.

### 3. **Online Educational Platforms**
There are various online platforms that specialize in providing academic resources, including past exam papers and practice questions. Some platforms may still host ELAT-related materials or similar exercises that can be useful for your preparation.

- **Search for Educational Websites**: Websites like JSTOR, Academia.edu, or educational blogs often contain articles or discussions about past exam patterns and literary analysis. You may find sample questions or discussions that can inspire your own practice.

- **Utilize Online Forums**: Engage in online forums or communities dedicated to Oxbridge admissions. Websites like The Student Room or Reddit might have threads where past candidates share resources or insights about their preparation.

### 4. **Literary Analysis Resources**
Even without specific ELAT practice papers, you can enhance your skills through alternative resources focused on literary analysis and essay writing. These resources can help you prepare for future studies in English literature.

- **Literary Anthologies**: Invest in anthologies that compile various literary works across genres. Reading a range of poetry, prose, and drama will aid in developing your analytical skills.

- **Writing Guides**: Consider reading books on essay writing and literary criticism. Guides on how to write comparative essays or analyze texts are invaluable. Works by authors like Janet Emig or Joseph Williams may provide useful structures and techniques.

### 5. **Peer Study Groups**
Sometimes the best preparation comes from collaborative learning. Forming a study group with peers who are also preparing for English literature studies can be incredibly beneficial.

- **Organize Peer Reviews**: Share essays and practice analyses with each other. Providing and receiving feedback can help sharpen your critical thinking and writing skills.

- **Discuss Literary Themes**: Engage in discussions about different literary works or themes that interest you. This will cultivate your ability to articulate insights clearly and persuasively.

### 6. **Library Resources**
Don’t overlook your local or school library. Libraries often have archives of past examination papers and textbooks that can help you develop your skills.

- **Consult Librarians**: Ask librarians for assistance in finding resources on literary analysis, essay writing, or previous exam materials that may not be readily accessible online.

- **Explore Online Catalogs**: Many libraries have online catalogs that allow you to search for specific texts or guides related to literary studies. 

### 7. **Practice Writing Essays**
Even if you can’t find specific ELAT practice papers, you can still engage in practices that mimic the ELAT format.

- **Create Your Own Practice Papers**: Based on your reading, generate your own literary extracts or select passages from works you are studying. Write comparative essays based on these extracts, focusing on structure, language, and style.

- **Timed Writing Exercises**: Simulate exam conditions by timing yourself while writing essays. This will improve your time management skills, which is crucial for any timed assessments you may encounter in the future.

### Conclusion
Although the ELAT is no longer a component of the Oxford admissions process for 2024, the skills it aimed to assess—close reading, analytical writing, and comparative analysis—remain essential. Focusing on developing these skills through a variety of resources will not only prepare you for university-level English studies but will also enhance your overall appreciation and understanding of literature.

In your pursuit of resources, remember to leverage university resources, reputable tutoring services, online educational platforms, and collaborative study methods. By engaging deeply with literature and practicing your writing skills, you will be well-prepared for whatever academic challenges lie ahead.
