Starting your preparation for Oxbridge Admissions Tests (NATs) is critical for your success in the application process. Given the importance of these tests in distinguishing you among thousands of applicants, early preparation can significantly enhance your chances. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand when and how to start your preparation effectively.

### Understanding the Timeline

**1. Familiarize Yourself with the Schedule:**
   - **Application Year Overview:** Generally, the Oxbridge application timeline is structured around the academic year before you start your university studies. 
   - **Registration Period:** The registration for NATs usually opens in August. This is a crucial time to start your preparations as you will need to register for the tests.
   - **Test Dates:** Tests are generally scheduled between August and November, with specific timings depending on your chosen course and the corresponding test. Ensure you keep a calendar handy to track these dates.

### Recommended Start Time for Preparation

**2. Start Early:**
   - **At Least 6-12 Months in Advance:** Ideally, you should begin your preparation 6-12 months before your test date. This timeline allows you to cover the necessary content thoroughly, practice extensively, and build confidence.
   - **Assessment of Current Knowledge:** Assess your current understanding of the subject matter relevant to the NAT. This assessment can direct your study plan and help you identify areas that require more focus.

### Detailed Preparation Timeline

**3. 12 Months Before the Test:**
   - **Research:** Start by researching the specific NAT requirements for your intended course. Different subjects have different tests (e.g., MAT for Mathematics, TSA for Philosophy). 
   - **Gather Resources:** Collect study materials, past papers, and practice tests relevant to your NAT. Look for any books or resources recommended by your school or tutors.

**4. 9-10 Months Before the Test:**
   - **Create a Study Schedule:** Develop a structured study plan that includes regular study sessions and breaks. Incorporate different subjects and types of questions into your routine.
   - **Begin Content Review:** Start revising the core content that will be assessed in the NAT. For example, if you are taking the MAT, focus on mathematics topics like algebra, calculus, and statistics.

**5. 6-8 Months Before the Test:**
   - **Practice with Past Papers:** Begin working through past exam papers and sample questions. This will help you familiarize yourself with the test format and types of questions you are likely to encounter.
   - **Focus on Weak Areas:** Use your practice results to identify and focus on your weak areas. Allocate additional study time to these topics to strengthen your understanding.

**6. 3-5 Months Before the Test:**
   - **Mock Exams:** Start taking timed mock exams. This practice will help you manage your time effectively during the actual test and reduce anxiety.
   - **Seek Feedback:** If possible, get feedback from teachers or tutors on your mock exam performance. They can provide insights into areas that require further improvement.

**7. 1-2 Months Before the Test:**
   - **Intensive Revision:** Focus on intensive revision in the final weeks leading up to the test. Review all topics, especially those where you still feel uncertain.
   - **Stress Management:** Incorporate stress management techniques into your routine, such as mindfulness, exercise, or relaxation techniques, to help maintain your mental health before the test.

**8. 1 Week Before the Test:**
   - **Final Review:** Conduct a final review of key concepts and practice a few light exercises. Avoid cramming at this stage; ensure your mind is fresh.
   - **Logistics Check:** Confirm your test registration details and logistics. Know the location of your test, what you need to bring, and the schedule for the day.
