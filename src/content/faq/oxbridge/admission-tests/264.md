As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I understand the significance of preparing for the National Admissions Test (NAT), which is part of the admissions process for certain courses at Oxford and Cambridge. While the NAT is not the most commonly referenced test (like the MAT or LNAT), it’s essential to find good study guides and resources to help students prepare effectively.

### Understanding the NAT

Before diving into the recommended study guides, it’s important to clarify what the NAT entails. The NAT assesses a candidate's aptitude in the specific subject area they are applying for, focusing on logical reasoning, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. The test format can differ depending on the subject, so it is vital to understand the exact requirements for the course the student is applying to.

### Recommended Study Guides for the NAT

1. **Official Resources:**
   - **University Websites:** Both Oxford and Cambridge have official resources and guidelines for admissions tests. Check their respective admissions pages for sample questions, past papers, and any specific preparatory materials they may recommend.
   - **Test Specifications:** Understanding the test format and types of questions is crucial. Review the specifications provided by the universities to understand the content areas covered.

2. **Subject-Specific Study Guides:**
   - **Subject Textbooks:** Depending on the subject, standard textbooks can provide comprehensive coverage of the material. For example, if a student is preparing for a science-related course, textbooks related to biology, chemistry, or physics can reinforce fundamental concepts.
   - **Revision Guides:** Look for revision guides specific to the subject. For example, for mathematics, books like “The Maths Book” by John McGregor or guides from publishers like CGP can be helpful. Ensure these guides include practice questions that reflect the NAT format.

3. **Practice Papers:**
   - **Past Papers:** Access past NAT papers from the university’s official website. Practicing these papers under timed conditions helps students familiarize themselves with the test format and timing.
   - **Mock Exams:** Consider using resources that offer mock exams based on the NAT. Many online platforms provide practice tests that simulate the real test environment.

4. **Online Resources:**
   - **YouTube Channels:** Various educational YouTube channels provide insights and strategies for passing admissions tests. Channels focused on specific subjects can offer tutorials and problem-solving techniques.
   - **Educational Websites:** Platforms like Khan Academy, Brilliant.org, or specific test prep sites may have relevant material tailored to the content of the NAT.

5. **Study Groups and Forums:**
   - **Peer Study Groups:** Encourage students to form study groups where they can discuss complex topics and share resources. Group study can enhance understanding through collaborative learning.
   - **Online Forums:** Websites like The Student Room or Reddit have dedicated threads for Oxbridge admissions tests. Students can find tips, share resources, and ask questions from peers who have gone through the process.

6. **Critical Thinking and Logic Books:**
   - Since the NAT often assesses critical thinking, consider books that enhance logical reasoning skills. Titles like “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman or “The Art of Thinking Clearly” by Rolf Dobelli may provide useful insights into logical reasoning.

7. **Tutoring and Coaching:**
   - If resources allow, consider enrolling students in specialized tutoring programs focused on admissions tests. Tutors experienced with Oxbridge admissions can provide tailored guidance and practice relevant to the NAT.

### Preparing Strategically

1. **Create a Study Plan:**
   - Encourage students to develop a structured study plan that outlines what topics to cover each week leading up to the test. This helps ensure comprehensive preparation without last-minute cramming.

2. **Focus on Weak Areas:**
   - After practicing with past papers and mock exams, students should identify areas where they struggle and allocate extra time to these topics.

3. **Timed Practice:**
   - Regularly practice under timed conditions to help students manage their time effectively during the actual exam.

4. **Review and Reflect:**
   - After completing practice questions or papers, students should review their answers critically. Understanding why an answer was wrong is just as important as knowing why the correct answer is right.

5. **Stay Informed About Changes:**
   - Keep an eye on any updates from the universities regarding the format or content of the NAT. Admissions processes can evolve, and staying informed ensures that students are preparing for the current expectations.

### Conclusion

Preparing for the NAT requires a comprehensive approach that includes understanding the test format, utilizing available resources, and adopting effective study strategies. By incorporating a mix of official materials, subject-specific guides, and practice resources, students can enhance their readiness for this crucial component of the Oxbridge admissions process.

As they prepare, remind students that consistent effort and a proactive approach to seeking help and resources will significantly improve their chances of success. Encourage them to stay motivated and focused, and remind them that admissions tests are just one part of their application journey. By preparing thoroughly, they will build confidence and improve their overall performance in their Oxbridge applications.
