The English Literature Admissions Test (ELAT) is a critical component for applicants to English and its joint course degrees at Oxford University. Although it is not in use for the 2024 application cycle, understanding its format is essential for prospective students as Oxford has expressed intentions to revise and reintroduce the exam in the future. Here’s a clear breakdown of the ELAT format:

### ELAT Structure

The ELAT consists of a single essay response that students must write in a 90-minute time frame. Here’s a detailed look at its structure:

1. **Number of Passages**: The exam contains six unseen passages. These passages will be selected from various literary forms, including prose, poetry, and drama, and all share a common theme.

2. **Question Requirement**: Candidates are required to choose two passages from the six provided. The question prompts you to compare and contrast these two passages in ways that you find interesting.

3. **Areas of Focus**: When constructing your essay, you should pay particular attention to distinctive features of the passages such as:
   - Structure: How is the text organized? What is the narrative style?
   - Language: What sort of language is used? Are there any notable literary devices (e.g., metaphors, similes)?
   - Style: What is the tone? How does the author’s style contribute to meaning?

### ELAT Evaluation and Scoring

The ELAT is designed to assess candidates on several key skills, and this is reflected in its scoring system:

1. **Maximum Mark**: The ELAT is scored out of a maximum of 60 marks. Each of the two independent examiners will score the essay out of 30. This means there is an opportunity for a collaborative assessment of your essay.

2. **Marking Criteria**: Your essay will be evaluated based on:
   - Close reading and textual analysis: How well do you interpret the passages?
   - Cohesiveness of argument: Is your essay well-structured and coherent?
   - Fluency of writing: How clearly and effectively do you communicate your ideas?

3. **Interview Invitations**: While a score of at least 50 is generally needed to secure an invitation for an interview, this benchmark is not absolute. It serves as a guideline, and other factors like predicted grades and personal statements also influence the final decision.

### Importance of the ELAT Format

Understanding the format of the ELAT is crucial for effective preparation. You should familiarize yourself with how the exam is structured to enhance your analytical and writing skills. Here are some ways to do this:

- **Read Widely**: Engage with a variety of texts across different genres and periods. This will help you develop a robust background in literature, which is invaluable for the exam.

- **Practice Close Reading**: As you read, practice analyzing texts critically. Take notes on themes, character development, and narrative techniques. This habit will sharpen your analytical skills.

- **Essay Writing**: Work on constructing clear and coherent essays. Focus on developing a strong thesis and supporting it with evidence from the texts. 

- **Seek Feedback**: Get constructive criticism from teachers, mentors, or peers on your practice essays. This feedback is invaluable for improving your writing.

- **Time Management**: To simulate exam conditions, practice writing essays within the 90-minute time limit. This will help you develop your ability to manage time effectively during the actual exam.

- **Utilize Past Papers**: Although the ELAT is not in use for the upcoming cycle, practicing with past papers can provide insight into the types of questions that may be asked and the overall structure of the exam.

### Conclusion

The ELAT is a pivotal part of the admissions process for English at Oxford University. Understanding its format allows you to prepare effectively and showcases your potential to excel in literary analysis and critical thinking. By focusing your preparation on the skills required for the ELAT, you can significantly enhance your chances of success when the exam is reintroduced. Remember, the key to excelling in the ELAT lies not just in understanding the format but also in developing your analytical abilities and writing skills through consistent practice and engagement with a wide range of literature.
