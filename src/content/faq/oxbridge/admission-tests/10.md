The Engineering and Science Admissions Test (ESAT) at the University of Cambridge is designed to assess candidates' aptitude in key areas of mathematics and the sciences. The ESAT is structured into two major parts: Mathematics 1, which is compulsory for all candidates, and Part 2, which consists of two additional modules from Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics 2. Each section is composed of multiple-choice questions that evaluate both theoretical understanding and practical problem-solving abilities. Below, I will provide a detailed breakdown of the topics covered in the Cambridge ESAT.

### 1. **Mathematics 1**

Mathematics 1 is a core component of the ESAT and covers a wide range of fundamental topics. This section lasts for 40 minutes and consists of 27 multiple-choice questions. The topics included are:

- **Units:** Candidates need to understand and use standard units for measurement, including compound units and the conversion between related standard and compound units.

- **Number:** This includes basic mathematical rules and functions; topics like decimals, fractions, percentages, indices, standard form, surds, and number sequences are key here.

- **Ratio and Proportion:** Candidates should grasp the relationships between two figures, focusing on direct and inverse proportion and solving problems that involve ratios.
