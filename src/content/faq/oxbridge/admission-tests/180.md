Preparing for the Sixth Term Examination Paper (STEP) requires a strategic approach, and choosing the right resources can significantly impact your performance. Here’s a comprehensive look at the most valuable resources you can utilize for effective STEP exam preparation.

### 1. **Official STEP Resources**

#### a. Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing (CAAT) Website
The CAAT website is the official source of information on the STEP exam. It provides access to:
- **Full Specifications**: Understand the format and structure of the exam including marking schemes and grade boundaries.
- **Past Papers**: A treasure trove of previous years' questions that allow you to familiarize yourself with the exam style and difficulty.
- **Marking Schemes**: Gain insights into how answers are graded, which can help refine your approach to problem-solving.

#### b. Online STEP Support Programme
Offered by the Faculty of Mathematics at Cambridge University, this free resource is tailored to assist students in their STEP preparations:
- **Practice Questions**: Access a variety of questions that mirror the style and complexity of actual STEP problems.
- **Worked Solutions**: Analyze full solutions to deepen your understanding of problem-solving techniques and methodologies.
- **Guidance on Problem-Solving**: Develop your mathematical thinking through expert advice on tackling challenging questions.

### 2. **Past Papers and Solutions**

#### a. STEP Questions Database
Various online platforms provide an extensive collection of past STEP questions paired with worked solutions. These databases are invaluable for:
- **Focused Practice**: Identify specific topics where you need improvement, allowing you to practice targeted questions.
