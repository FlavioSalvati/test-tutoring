To review and improve your performance on the English Literature Admissions Test (ELAT), it’s essential to adopt a systematic and reflective approach. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you assess your current capabilities and make targeted improvements.

### Step 1: Analyze Your Current Performance

1. **Collect Your Past Papers**: Start by gathering all the essays you have written for practice and any past papers you have attempted. This should also include any feedback you have received.

2. **Self-Assessment**: Read through your essays critically. Ask yourself:
   - Did I fully address the prompt?
   - Were my arguments coherent and logically structured?
   - Did I provide sufficient textual evidence?
   - How well did I analyze the language and techniques used in the texts?

3. **Review Feedback**: Look at any feedback from teachers or tutors. Pay special attention to recurring comments, as these often highlight areas that need improvement. 

4. **Score Analysis**: If you've received scores from past papers, analyze the breakdowns. Identify which areas you scored the highest and lowest in (e.g., close reading, argumentation, fluency, etc.).

### Step 2: Focus on Specific Areas for Improvement

1. **Close Reading and Analysis**: 
   - **Practice Techniques**: Engage in more close reading exercises. Take a short passage and write down all literary techniques employed. Consider their effects and how they contribute to the overall meaning.
   - **Literary Devices**: Familiarize yourself with a range of literary devices (e.g., metaphor, simile, enjambment) and practice identifying them in varied texts.

2. **Argumentation Skills**:
   - **Structure Your Essays**: Work on essay structure. Use the “PEEL” (Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link) method to help you clearly articulate your arguments.
   - **Thesis Statements**: Practice crafting strong thesis statements that directly answer the prompt and set the direction for your essay.

3. **Comparison Techniques**:
   - **Comparative Frameworks**: Develop a framework for comparing texts. This could involve creating a chart that outlines key similarities and differences in themes, structure, language, and style.
   - **Practice Pairing Texts**: Regularly practice comparing different texts, focusing on how each text's context shapes its meaning.

4. **Writing Skills**:
   - **Focus on Clarity**: Write essays with clarity in mind. Avoid jargon unless necessary, and make sure your arguments are accessible to someone unfamiliar with the texts.
   - **Vary Your Sentence Structure**: Work on varying your sentence structures to improve the flow and readability of your writing.

5. **Feedback Loop**:
   - **Peer Review**: Engage in peer review sessions with classmates. This not only provides you with different perspectives but also helps you in assessing others’ essays.
   - **Professional Help**: Consider seeking a tutor experienced in ELAT preparation. They can provide tailored feedback and strategies that you may not have considered.

### Step 3: Enhance Your Preparation Strategies

1. **Regular Practice**:
   - **Timed Conditions**: Regularly practice writing essays under timed conditions. This helps build the stamina needed for the actual exam.
   - **Simulate Exam Conditions**: Create a quiet environment to mimic exam conditions to reduce anxiety and improve focus.

2. **Reading Widely**:
   - **Diverse Genres**: Read a wide array of literature, including poetry, modern novels, and plays. Pay attention to different styles and how authors convey their themes.
   - **Critical Essays**: Read literary criticism and analyses to understand different interpretations and critical perspectives on texts.

3. **Join Study Groups**:
   - **Collaborative Learning**: Form or join a study group with fellow ELAT candidates. Discussing texts and sharing insights can deepen your understanding and expose you to different viewpoints.

4. **Utilize Online Resources**:
   - **Webinars and Workshops**: Attend online workshops or webinars focused on ELAT preparation. Many organizations offer resources tailored specifically for Oxford applicants.
   - **Discussion Forums**: Engage in online forums where you can discuss literature and share insights with other aspiring candidates.

### Step 4: Practice Mindfulness and Confidence Building

1. **Practice Mindfulness**:
   - **Relaxation Techniques**: Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation to manage anxiety related to exam preparation.
   - **Positive Visualization**: Visualize yourself successfully analyzing texts and writing coherent essays. This can help build confidence leading up to the exam.

2. **Mock Exams**: 
   - **Conduct Mock Tests**: Schedule regular mock tests to integrate all your skills. After each mock test, review your performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Step 5: Final Review Before the Exam

1. **Review Key Concepts**: In the week leading up to the exam, review key literary concepts, techniques, and terms that might be relevant to the texts.

2. **Rest and Relax**: Ensure you are well-rested before the exam day. Avoid cramming last minute; instead, focus on relaxing and gaining confidence in what you have learned.

3. **Plan for the Exam Day**:
   - **Know the Logistics**: Familiarize yourself with the exam structure and the computer-based format if you haven’t already.
   - **Prepare Materials**: If allowed, ensure you have any necessary materials ready, such as a notepad for jotting down ideas during the exam.

### Conclusion

Improving your performance in the ELAT requires a mix of self-analysis, targeted practice, and a proactive approach to learning. By systematically reviewing your past performance, focusing on specific areas for improvement, enhancing your preparation strategies, and building confidence, you can significantly enhance your chances of success. Remember, the ELAT is an opportunity to showcase your analytical skills and love for literature; approach it with curiosity and confidence, and you will likely excel. Good luck!
