   - Be prepared to explore the implications of your argument.

3. **Real-World Application:**
   These questions assess your ability to apply economic thinking to real-world scenarios, often requiring you to analyze current events or historical examples.

4. **Math-Based Questions:**
   Expect some questions that require you to demonstrate mathematical reasoning or solve a numerical problem. These questions assess your quantitative skills.

   - **Example Questions:**
     - **If a petrol station is equidistant from two towns, where should the next petrol station be built?**
     - **How would you calculate the return on investment for NASA's operations?**

   **Approach:**
   - Practice solving similar problems beforehand.

   - Be comfortable with basic formulas and concepts such as elasticity, marginal cost, and opportunity cost.

5. **Philosophical and Ethical Questions:**
   These questions often delve into the philosophical implications of economic decisions and policies, asking you to consider ethical dimensions.

   - **Example Questions:**
     - **Compare and contrast the Indian and Chinese economies.**
     - **What is the difference between capitalism and communism? Are they really that different?**

   **Approach:**
   - Organise your thoughts in a comparative framework.
   - Highlight key differences and similarities, using data where necessary.
   - Discuss the historical and cultural contexts that influence each system.

### Strategies for Success

1. **Practice Thinking Aloud:**
   During the interview, it’s crucial to articulate your thought process clearly. Practicing this skill will help you communicate effectively with the interviewers. 

2. **Stay Calm and Collected:**
   Interviews can be nerve-wracking. Engage in relaxation techniques before the interview, such as deep breathing or visualization, to calm your nerves.

3. **Engage with the Interviewers:**
   Remember that interviewers are not just looking for the 'right' answers; they want to see how you think. Don't hesitate to ask for clarification if you don’t understand a question.

4. **Be Open to Discussion:**
   Be prepared for your answers to spark further questions. The interview may evolve into a more conversational format. Be flexible and willing to explore different angles.

5. **Stay Informed:**
   Keep abreast of current economic issues and debates. Reading newspapers, economic journals, and relevant literature can provide context and depth to your answers.

6. **Understand Your Limitations:**
   If you encounter a question you can’t answer, it’s better to acknowledge it and discuss what you do know rather than fumbling through.

7. **Balance Your Perspectives:**
   When discussing economic issues, consider multiple viewpoints. This not only demonstrates your critical thinking but also shows that you can appreciate the complexity of economic situations.

### Key Takeaways

- **Diverse Question Types:** Expect a mix of definitions, theoretical discussions, real-world applications, math-based questions, and philosophical inquiries.
- **Articulate Your Thoughts:** Practice verbalizing your reasoning and engage in discussions to refine this skill.
