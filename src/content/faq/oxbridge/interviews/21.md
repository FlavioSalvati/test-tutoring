- **Discussion Focus:** 
   - Expect a deep dive into chemistry topics. The interviews will often center around applying knowledge from your GCSE and A Level studies to new problem-solving scenarios. This could involve graphs, diagrams, or explanations of chemical concepts.

- **Personal Statement:** 
   - Tutors may reference your personal statement during the interview, so be prepared to discuss anything you’ve mentioned, especially any projects or topics that reflect your passion for chemistry.

### Key Tips for Success

#### Embrace the Unexpected

Interviews are designed to challenge your understanding and provoke critical thinking. Be ready for questions that may not align perfectly with your studies. Embrace these challenges as opportunities to showcase your problem-solving skills.

#### Focus on the Process

Mistakes are a natural part of learning. Interviewers are interested in how you approach problems, your reasoning, and your ability to articulate your thought process. If you encounter a difficult question, take your time to think it through and explain your reasoning clearly.
