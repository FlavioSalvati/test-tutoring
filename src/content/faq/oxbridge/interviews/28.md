### What to Expect in a History Interview at Oxford University

Preparing for an Oxford University history interview can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I aim to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what to expect during this critical phase of your application process. A well-prepared candidate will not only feel more at ease but will also have a better chance of impressing the interviewers. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the interview process, content, expectations, and practicalities.

#### Understanding the Interview Process

**1. Invitations:**
Once applications have been reviewed, colleges will extend invitations for interviews. You will receive an email from the college you applied to, typically with at least a week's notice. This will include details such as the date, time, and platform for the interview (currently held on Microsoft Teams).

**2. Reallocation:**
In cases where a college has too many or too few applicants, you may be reallocated to another college. This is done to ensure a balanced number of interviewees across colleges.

**3. Second Interviews:**
It’s common for some candidates to be called for a second interview. This may occur at a different college, and you might receive only a few days' notice. Be prepared for this possibility, as it indicates strong interest in your application.

**4. Joint Schools:**
If you applied for a Joint School (for example, History and Politics), you will have two interviews, one for each side of the course. These interviews may occur on different days.

**5. Format:**
The standard format consists of a 30-minute interview with two tutors. However, some colleges may opt for two shorter interviews (15 minutes each) with different pairs of interviewers. 

#### Content of the Interview

The interview will focus on several key areas:

**1. Your Written Work:**
Expect to discuss your submitted essay or any written work you provided. Interviewers will ask about your arguments, the terms you used, and how you might alter your conclusions based on new historical evidence. This is an opportunity to show your analytical skills and depth of understanding.

**2. Pre-Interview Reading:**
Some colleges may assign a short passage of historical writing for you to read before the interview. You’ll be expected to discuss this passage, demonstrating your ability to engage with historical texts and concepts critically.

**3. Personal Statement:**
Your personal statement will be a key focus area. Be prepared to answer questions about the materials you’ve read, watched, or visited. This can include specific books, documentaries, or even historical sites that have influenced your interest in history.

**4. Wider Context:**
Interviewers will often explore broader historical themes. You might encounter questions such as:
- How does your understanding of history inform your view of your local area?
- Which historical figure would you like to meet, and why?
- What limitations do historians face in understanding the past?

These questions assess your ability to think beyond the specifics of historical facts and reflect on their implications.

#### What Tutors Are Looking For

**1. Analytical Thinking:**
Your ability to think critically is paramount. Tutors want to see how you analyze concepts, weigh evidence, and construct arguments. They are less concerned with your memorization of dates and events than they are with your capacity to engage thoughtfully with historical material.

**2. Flexibility:**
Demonstrating openness to new ideas and perspectives is crucial. Tutors appreciate candidates who can adapt their views when presented with new evidence or arguments.

**3. Motivation and Enthusiasm:**
Your passion for history should shine through in your responses. Tutors are looking for candidates who are genuinely excited about the subject and can articulate why they want to study history at Oxford.

#### Practicalities of the Interview

**1. Online Format:**
Interviews are currently conducted online via Microsoft Teams. Ensure that you have a reliable internet connection, a working computer with a camera and microphone, and familiarity with the platform.

**2. Preparation:**
- Reflect on why you want to study history at Oxford and practice communicating your motivations clearly.
- Familiarize yourself with common interview questions and practice answering them out loud.
- Watch demonstration videos of interviews to understand the format and flow.
- Make sure you have access to any pre-interview reading material and a copy of your personal statement for reference.

**3. Tips for Candidates:**
- **Re-read and Reflect:** Go through your application again to refresh your memory and prepare for questions about it.
- **Think Deeply:** Instead of cramming facts, engage critically with the material you already know.
- **Take Your Time:** Don’t rush your answers. It’s perfectly acceptable to pause and think before responding.
- **Think Out Loud:** Articulate your thought process; this helps interviewers understand your reasoning.
- **Ask for Clarification:** If you don’t understand a question, don’t hesitate to ask the interviewers to rephrase or clarify.
- **Engage in Conversation:** Treat the interview as a discussion rather than an interrogation. Relax and enjoy the experience.
- **Confidence:** Remember that you have already accomplished a great deal by reaching this stage. Trust in your abilities!

#### Example Questions

Here are some example questions that might arise during your interview:

- **Can archaeology ‘prove’ or ‘disprove’ the Bible?**
- **How can we estimate the mass of the atmosphere?**
- **Tell me what this rock looks like.**
- **How many different molecules can be made from six carbon atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms?**
- **Why do you think Dido kills herself in *Aeneid* 4?**
- **How do pirates divide their treasure?**
- **Imagine we had no records about the past at all, except everything to do with sport – how much of the past could we learn?**
- **What can historians not find out about the past?**

These questions highlight the diverse range of topics you may be asked to discuss. Some may appear unrelated to history directly but require you to think critically and creatively.

#### Conclusion

The Oxford history interview is a rigorous yet rewarding experience. By understanding the structure, content, and expectations of the interview, you can prepare effectively and approach it with confidence. Remember, your interview is not merely a test of your historical knowledge; it is an opportunity to showcase your analytical abilities, enthusiasm for the subject, and potential as a scholar.

Your preparation will help you navigate the interview successfully, allowing you to highlight your passion for history and your readiness to contribute to the academic community at Oxford. Good luck!
