Navigating the Cambridge Politics Interview can be both an exciting and daunting experience. As a prospective student for the Human, Social and Political Sciences (HSPS) program, it’s crucial to familiarize yourself with common questions and how to approach them effectively. Below, I will highlight some of the most frequently asked questions during these interviews, providing insights into what the interviewers are looking for and how you can prepare thoughtful, articulate responses that showcase your knowledge, critical thinking, and passion for the subject.

### Common Interview Questions and How to Approach Them

1. **"Why have you chosen to apply to study at Cambridge, rather than another Russell Group university?"**

   When responding to this question, it’s important to reflect on what makes Cambridge unique. The interviewers are looking for insight into your motivations and how they align with the university’s offerings. Highlight the following aspects:
   - **Supervision System:** Cambridge’s one-to-one or small group teaching format is distinct and allows for deep engagement with your subject.
   - **Research Opportunities:** Discuss how Cambridge’s research initiatives and access to leading scholars in politics can enhance your academic experience.
   - **Historical Context:** Mention the rich history and tradition of political thought at Cambridge, and how it inspires you.
   - **Personal Fit:** Align the university’s ethos with your academic and career aspirations. Show that you have thought critically about your choice.

2. **"What are your interests outside of academics?"**

   This question aims to assess you as a holistic individual. Interviewers want to know about your extracurricular activities and how they contribute to your personal development. Consider including:
   - **Clubs and Societies:** Talk about any political, debating, or social justice organizations you are part of. Explain your roles and what you’ve learned.
   - **Volunteer Work:** If you've engaged in community service or activism, share those experiences and how they shaped your understanding of societal issues.
   - **Hobbies:** Mention any interests that might relate to your chosen field, such as writing for a blog about politics or participating in sports that teach teamwork and leadership.

3. **"What’s an interesting thing that’s been happening in the news recently?"**

   This question assesses your engagement with current events and your ability to analyze them critically. Here’s how to prepare:
   - **Choose a Relevant Topic:** Pick a recent political event or issue that resonates with your interests. It could be related to elections, legislation, social movements, or international relations.
   - **Analysis and Insight:** Explain why this event is significant. Analyze its implications and connect it to broader themes in politics, such as power dynamics, public policy, or human rights.
   - **Personal Perspective:** Share your viewpoint and how it relates to your academic interests. This demonstrates that you are not just aware of the news but also capable of critical thought.

4. **"Is there essentially any difference between taxation and the state taking away one of your arms?"**

   This provocative question tests your ability to engage with complex ethical issues. To tackle it:
   - **Define Key Concepts:** Start by distinguishing taxation from the concept of bodily autonomy. Taxation is a financial obligation to support state functions, while taking away arms is a physical violation of rights.
   - **Ethical Implications:** Discuss the moral considerations of consent, utilitarianism, and social contract theory. Explain how taxation is often viewed as a collective agreement for societal benefits, whereas bodily harm is universally condemned.
   - **Expand the Discussion:** Consider different political philosophies and their views on state power and individual rights. This shows depth in your understanding of political theory.

5. **"Can you imagine a place without Politics?"**

   This question invites you to reflect on the omnipresence of political structures. When crafting your response:
   - **Define Politics:** Start by defining what you mean by politics, encompassing governance, power relations, and social organization.
   - **Human Nature:** Argue that politics is inherent in human social interactions, as it involves conflict resolution, resource allocation, and societal norms.
   - **Examples:** Use examples from historical contexts or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate how humans naturally form political structures, even in the absence of formal governments.

6. **"What is federalism? How does it differ from the current British political system?"**

   Here, the interviewers are looking for your understanding of political systems. To respond effectively:
   - **Define Federalism:** Explain that federalism is a system of governance where power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units (e.g., states).
   - **British System:** Contrast this with the unitary system of the UK, where most power is centralized in the Parliament.
   - **Pros and Cons:** Discuss advantages of federalism, such as local governance and representation, and challenges, such as coordination and consistency in policy-making.

7. **"How would you bring a population out of poverty?"**

   This question tests your analytical skills and understanding of socio-economic issues. Approach it by:
   - **Identifying Causes of Poverty:** Discuss systemic issues like lack of education, unemployment, and inequality.
   - **Proposing Solutions:** Suggest multi-faceted approaches, including education, job creation, social safety nets, and community empowerment.
   - **Real-World Examples:** Reference successful poverty alleviation programs or policies from different countries to illustrate your points and show that you are informed about global issues.

8. **"Why is there not a global government?"**

   This question invites you to explore the complexities of governance on a global scale. Consider including:
   - **Sovereignty Issues:** Discuss the significance of national sovereignty and how it limits the formation of a global government.
   - **Cultural and Political Diversity:** Explain how differing ideologies, cultures, and political systems create challenges for global governance.
   - **Historical Context:** Reference historical attempts at global governance, such as the League of Nations or the United Nations, and analyze their successes and failures.

### General Tips for Answering Interview Questions

- **Practice Your Responses:** Engage in mock interviews to refine your answers. This helps you articulate your thoughts more clearly and confidently.
- **Think Aloud:** When answering, verbalize your thought process. This allows interviewers to see your critical thinking skills in action.
- **Stay Informed:** Regularly read news articles, academic journals, and books related to politics and social sciences to stay updated on current events and theories.
- **Be Curious:** Show enthusiasm for the subject. Ask questions back to the interviewers when appropriate, demonstrating your engagement and interest.
- **Stay Calm and Collected:** Interviews can be nerve-wracking, but remember to take deep breaths and maintain composure. Focus on showcasing your knowledge and passion.
