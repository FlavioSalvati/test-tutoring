The question of whether Oxford has a lower admission rate compared to Cambridge because it is rated higher in international rankings is a nuanced one. To answer this, we must first understand the admissions landscape of both universities, their respective rankings, and the factors that contribute to their acceptance rates.

### Understanding Acceptance Rates

As of recent data, the University of Oxford has an average acceptance rate of about 13-15%, while the University of Cambridge has an acceptance rate of approximately 20%. On the surface, this might suggest that Oxford is more selective than Cambridge, and this selectivity could be interpreted as a consequence of its higher international ranking. However, the relationship between ranking and admission rates is not straightforward and requires a deeper analysis.

### Academic Reputation and Rankings

1. **International Rankings**: 
   - Oxford consistently ranks as the top university globally, as seen in the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, where it holds the first position.
   - Cambridge, while also highly regarded, is ranked fifth in the same rankings. 

These rankings are determined by a variety of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty/student ratio, citations per faculty, and international faculty and student ratios. A higher ranking generally reflects a better perceived quality of education and research output, which can enhance a university's attractiveness to prospective students.

### Factors Influencing Admission Rates

While rankings do play a role in attracting applications, several other factors must be considered when looking at admissions rates:

1. **Selectivity**:
   - Oxford's more selective nature could stem from various reasons, including departmental preferences, course popularity, and a larger pool of highly qualified applicants.
   - For instance, courses such as Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) at Oxford are particularly sought after, which increases competition and lowers acceptance rates.

2. **Application Volume**:
   - Oxford may receive a higher number of applications relative to Cambridge. A larger applicant pool generally leads to lower acceptance rates, irrespective of the university's ranking.
   - Both universities attract students from around the world, but Oxfordâ€™s longstanding reputation may lead to a higher volume of applications, further complicating the direct comparison of acceptance rates.

3. **Course Demand**:
   - Some specific courses at Oxford may experience higher demand than their counterparts at Cambridge, leading to a more competitive admissions process for those particular programs. 
   - For example, Oxford's emphasis on humanities and social sciences might draw more applicants in these areas, directly impacting acceptance rates.

4. **Interview and Test Requirements**:
   - Both universities employ rigorous selection processes, including interviews and subject-specific admissions tests. However, the nature of these assessments could vary, influencing the overall selectivity.
   - The specific requirements can also impact applicant performance, with Oxford potentially having more stringent criteria that lead to a lower acceptance rate.

### The Role of Prestige and Attraction

The prestige associated with Oxford may attract applicants who are exceptionally qualified, further intensifying competition. High-achieving students often apply to multiple top-tier universities, including both Oxford and Cambridge. When students perceive Oxford as the pinnacle of higher education, they may apply in greater numbers, thus contributing to the lower acceptance rate.

### Financial Considerations

Financial aid and scholarship opportunities can also impact application rates and acceptance. While both universities offer substantial financial support, the types of scholarships available may attract different demographics of students. For example, Oxford's Rhodes Scholarship is globally recognized, which might influence the diversity and quality of applicants.

### Conclusion

To conclude, while there is an observable trend where Oxford has a lower admission rate than Cambridge, attributing this solely to its higher international ranking would be simplistic. Many intertwined factors, such as selectivity, application volume, course demand, and the nature of the admissions process, contribute to the differences in acceptance rates.

Ultimately, both Oxford and Cambridge provide world-class education and have their unique strengths and weaknesses. The choice between the two should be based on personal preferences, course offerings, and individual career aspirations rather than solely on their acceptance rates or rankings. Each applicant should carefully consider what they want from their university experience, as both institutions can offer exceptional opportunities tailored to different academic interests. 

By focusing on your strengths, preparing thoroughly for the application process, and understanding what each university offers, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your goals and aspirations.
