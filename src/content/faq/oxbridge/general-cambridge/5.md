When applying to prestigious institutions like Oxford and Cambridge, it’s essential to understand that admissions teams are looking for a specific set of qualities that distinguish a truly outstanding applicant from a merely good one. The admissions process is highly competitive, and while meeting the entry requirements is crucial, it’s the additional attributes, experiences, and perspectives that can significantly enhance an applicant's chances of being offered a place. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what makes an applicant really stand out in the admissions process:

### 1. Academic Excellence

**Strong Academic Record:**
A good applicant typically has strong grades in relevant subjects. However, a truly exceptional applicant will not only meet the minimum entry requirements but will often exceed them. This includes achieving top grades in A-levels (or equivalent), as well as excelling in any relevant standardized tests (like the MAT, TSA, or BMAT, depending on the course).

**Depth of Knowledge:**
While good applicants may have a solid understanding of the syllabus, outstanding applicants demonstrate a deeper knowledge of their chosen field. This includes:

- Exploring topics beyond the school curriculum.
- Engaging with academic literature, research papers, and current developments in their field of interest.

**Critical Thinking and Analytical Skills:**
Admissions teams value the ability to think critically and analyze complex information. Exceptional applicants will show evidence of this through:

- Participation in debates or discussions, showcasing their ability to articulate and defend their viewpoints.
- Writing essays or articles that demonstrate their analytical skills.

### 2. Super-Curricular Engagement

**Demonstrating Passion:**
Good applicants may participate in a few relevant activities, but truly outstanding applicants will engage in a variety of super-curricular activities that reflect their passion for their subject. This can include:

- Attending lectures, workshops, or seminars outside of school.
- Participating in relevant competitions (like Olympiads or essay contests).
- Conducting independent research projects or experiments.

**Personal Projects:**
Exceptional candidates often embark on personal projects that display initiative. For example:

- Starting a blog on their subject of interest.
- Creating a podcast or YouTube channel to explore academic topics.
- Volunteering in roles related to their field, such as tutoring or mentoring younger students.

### 3. Unique Perspectives and Experiences

**Diverse Background:**
Outstanding applicants bring unique experiences and perspectives that enrich the university community. This can include:

- Having lived or studied in different countries, which broadens their worldview.
- Involvement in community service or social justice initiatives, reflecting a commitment to making a difference.

**Resilience and Adaptability:**
The ability to overcome challenges is a significant quality. Exceptional applicants often have stories of resilience, such as:

- Balancing demanding academic work with personal responsibilities.
- Overcoming obstacles in their educational journey, which can provide valuable lessons in adaptability and determination.

### 4. Strong Communication Skills

**Articulate Expression:**
While good applicants communicate their ideas clearly, outstanding candidates do so with eloquence and confidence. This is crucial for both the personal statement and the interview. Strategies to enhance communication skills include:

- Participating in public speaking clubs (like Toastmasters or debate clubs).
- Practicing mock interviews with peers or mentors.

**Engaging Writing Style:**
A strong personal statement is not just about content but also about how it is written. Exceptional applicants will:

- Write with clarity and passion, reflecting their genuine interest in the subject.
- Showcase their ability to connect ideas and present arguments cohesively.

### 5. Enthusiasm for the Learning Process

**Curiosity and Inquisitiveness:**
Good applicants may show interest in their subject, but truly outstanding applicants are characterized by a deep curiosity. This can be demonstrated through:

- Asking insightful questions during interviews or in personal statements.
- Pursuing knowledge for its own sake, rather than just for grades or accolades.

**Commitment to Lifelong Learning:**
Exceptional candidates often convey a commitment to their educational journey beyond just formal education. They may:

- Engage with online courses or MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses).
- Subscribe to academic journals or follow relevant podcasts.

### 6. Contribution to the Community

**Collaborative Spirit:**
Engaging with peers and contributing to the community is vital. While good applicants might participate in group activities, outstanding candidates actively seek leadership roles or initiate projects that benefit others. This can include:

- Leading a study group or club.
- Organizing events or community service projects.

**Interdisciplinary Interests:**
Exceptional applicants often have diverse interests that span multiple disciplines, which can indicate a well-rounded intellect. For instance:

- A student applying for a science course might also engage in the arts, showcasing creativity and a broader perspective.
- Demonstrating interest in ethics or philosophy can be particularly appealing in fields like medicine or law.

### 7. Strong References

**Supportive Recommendations:**
Good applicants typically receive positive references, but outstanding applicants have references that provide specific examples of their academic strengths, character, and contributions. This can include:

- Teachers or mentors who can vouch for the applicant's intellectual curiosity, resilience, and impact on their peers.
- References that highlight unique achievements or insights into the applicant’s character.

### 8. Interview Performance

**Preparation and Confidence:**
While good applicants may be prepared for interviews, outstanding candidates demonstrate a level of comfort and confidence that allows them to engage in meaningful dialogue. This includes:

- Practicing common interview questions and developing responses that reflect their unique experiences.
- Being able to think on their feet and respond thoughtfully to challenging questions or problems posed during the interview.

**Engagement and Curiosity:**
Exceptional candidates use the interview as an opportunity to engage with the interviewers, asking insightful questions and showing a genuine interest in the course and university. This demonstrates:

- An understanding of the subject and its relevance.
- A proactive approach to their education.

### Conclusion

In summary, while good applicants meet the basic requirements, outstanding applicants go above and beyond in every aspect of their application. They demonstrate academic excellence, engage in super-curricular activities, bring unique perspectives, communicate effectively, and show a genuine passion for learning and contributing to the community.

To improve your chances of standing out in the admissions process at Oxford or Cambridge, focus on developing these qualities. Engage in meaningful academic pursuits, cultivate your interests, and seek opportunities that challenge you and showcase your skills. Remember, both universities value not just what you have achieved, but also who you are as a person and how you will contribute to their academic community. Embrace the journey of preparation, and you will be well on your way to crafting a compelling application.
