2. **Research Thoroughly:** Each university has its unique offerings and strengths. Research the specific courses you’re interested in and understand the differences in the application process.

3. **Prepare for Tests and Interviews:** Invest time in preparing for the admissions tests and interviews. Familiarize yourself with the formats and practice answering questions that may arise during the interview process.

4. **Be Yourself:** During interviews, it’s important to relax and be genuine. Admissions tutors are looking for students who are passionate about their subjects and can articulate their thoughts clearly.

### Conclusion

In summary, there is no halt to admissions for the September 2024 intake at either Oxford or Cambridge University. Both institutions are currently accepting applications, and prospective students should ensure they meet all deadlines and requirements.
