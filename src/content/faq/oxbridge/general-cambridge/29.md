Getting admitted to elite institutions like Harvard, MIT, and Cambridge is indeed a challenging endeavor, particularly for the 2019-20 application cycle. Let’s break down the factors that contribute to this difficulty and what potential applicants should consider when evaluating their chances of gaining admission.

### Acceptance Rates

The first and most obvious indicator of how difficult it is to gain admission is the acceptance rate:

- **Harvard University:** With an acceptance rate of 3.6%, only about 3 out of every 100 applicants are offered admission. This places Harvard among the most selective universities globally.
  
- **MIT:** The acceptance rate of 4.8% is also extremely low. While it is slightly higher than Harvard’s, it still indicates that only a small fraction of applicants will be admitted.

- **Cambridge University:** Cambridge receives around six applications for every spot available. Although specific acceptance rates vary by course, the overall competition remains fierce.

These numbers highlight that the applicant pool is highly competitive, with many students vying for a limited number of places.

### Academic Requirements

To even be considered for admission, applicants must demonstrate exceptional academic performance. Here are some common academic expectations:

- **Strong GPA:** Most successful applicants possess near-perfect GPAs. For example, students often take advanced coursework, such as Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or honors classes, to showcase their academic rigor.

- **Standardized Testing:** While some schools have moved towards test-optional policies, strong SAT or ACT scores can still enhance an application. For MIT, for instance, strong performances in STEM-related standardized tests are particularly important.

- **Course Rigor:** Admissions committees look favorably upon applicants who have challenged themselves with demanding courses, especially in subjects relevant to their field of interest.

### Personal Insights

Academic achievements alone are not sufficient; applicants must also convey their individuality and character through personal insight questions and essays. Here are some aspects to focus on:

- **Essays:** These are opportunities to share your unique story, values, and motivations. Strong essays can set you apart from other qualified candidates. Harvard, for example, looks for personal insights that reveal the applicant's character.

- **Letters of Recommendation:** Two letters from teachers are typically required, and they should ideally come from those who know you well and can attest to your abilities and character. An optional letter from a counselor or another individual can also help, especially if it adds depth to your application.

### Extracurricular Activities

Admissions committees at these institutions are not only interested in academics but also in what applicants do outside the classroom:

- **Leadership and Initiative:** Participation in clubs, sports, or community service demonstrates leadership skills and a commitment to making a difference.

- **Passion Projects:** Engaging in projects that reflect your interests, such as starting a community initiative or conducting research, can showcase your initiative and dedication.

- **Unique Talents:** If you have any unique skills or talents (like a musical instrument, art, or athletics), including these can enhance your profile.

### Campus Culture and Fit

Understanding the campus culture of each institution is critical. Each university has distinct values and focuses:

- **Harvard:** Known for its broad liberal arts education, it encourages interdisciplinary learning. A diverse student body and strong athletic tradition define its campus culture.

- **MIT:** With an emphasis on STEM, MIT fosters a technology-driven environment. Students are often highly focused on research and innovation, and the campus culture is heavily oriented towards collaboration and problem-solving.

- **Cambridge:** The collegiate system and the tutorial method of teaching create a unique educational experience. The emphasis is on academic ability and potential, with a strong focus on independent study.

### Financial Considerations

Cost can also be a significant factor in the application process:

- **Tuition and Fees:** The estimated annual costs for Harvard and MIT hover around $82,866 and $85,960, respectively. These figures include tuition, housing, and other fees.

- **Financial Aid:** Both Harvard and MIT have robust financial aid programs. Harvard meets 100% of demonstrated financial need, while MIT also ensures that financial barriers do not prevent students from attending. Understanding the financial aid packages is crucial when considering these institutions.

### Conclusion: Is It Really Difficult?

In summary, getting into Harvard, MIT, or Cambridge is undoubtedly difficult due to the competitive nature of the admissions process. The combination of low acceptance rates, high academic standards, the need for compelling personal narratives, and the emphasis on extracurricular involvement creates a challenging landscape for prospective students.

However, while the process is competitive, it is important to remember that each applicant is unique. If you are passionate about your academic interests, have a strong work ethic, and are willing to dedicate the time and effort required to cultivate a compelling application, you can improve your chances of success. 

### Actionable Steps for Applicants

1. **Focus on Academics:** Ensure you maintain a strong GPA and take challenging courses throughout high school.

2. **Prepare for Standardized Tests:** If applicable, aim for high SAT or ACT scores, especially in relevant subjects.

3. **Craft Compelling Essays:** Use your personal insight questions to tell your story. Be authentic and reflective.

4. **Obtain Strong Recommendations:** Choose recommenders who know you well and can speak to your strengths and character.

5. **Engage in Extracurriculars:** Pursue activities that reflect your interests and demonstrate leadership, commitment, and initiative.

6. **Research Each Institution:** Understand the specific values and culture of Harvard, MIT, and Cambridge to tailor your application accordingly.

7. **Plan Financially:** Research financial aid options and prepare necessary documents to apply for aid if needed.

While the road to admission at these prestigious institutions is fraught with challenges, it is also an opportunity to learn more about yourself and what you hope to achieve in your academic and professional life. Good luck!
