It’s important to clarify that Cambridge University does not offer a Master of Arts (MA) in Political Science as a postgraduate qualification. Instead, the university confers the MA degree by right upon holders of the BA degree from Cambridge and certain senior members. For postgraduate studies in Political Science, you should focus on applying for the MPhil (Master of Philosophy) or PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) programs in Political Science offered by the Department of Politics and International Studies (POLIS).

Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to navigate the application process for either the MPhil or PhD programs at Cambridge University:

### 1. Research Your Options
Before applying, thoroughly research both the MPhil and PhD programs in Political Science. Understand the structure, curriculum, faculty, and specific areas of research.

- **PhD in Political Science**: This is a more extensive program focused on original research. You will need to develop a research proposal that outlines your intended study.

### 2. Review Admission Requirements
