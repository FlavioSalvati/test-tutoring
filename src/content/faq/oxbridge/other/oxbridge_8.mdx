### Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) at Oxbridge

Both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge are committed to providing an inclusive environment for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). Here’s how they support SEN students throughout their academic journey:

### Types of Support Available

1. **Tailored Accommodations**:
   - **Definition**: Special accommodations are made to ensure that SEN students can participate fully in their studies and assessments. This might include extra time for exams, adapted examination formats, or specific assistive technologies.
   - **Example**: A student with dyslexia might receive additional time during written exams and access to digital text formats.

2. **Dedicated Support Services**:
   - **Definition**: Both universities have dedicated support teams that work with SEN students to assess their needs and provide personalized support. This includes academic advisors, disability coordinators, and mental health counselors.
   - **Example**: The Oxford Disability Advisory Service and the Cambridge Disability Resource Centre offer guidance and support tailored to individual needs.

3. **Accessibility Resources**:
   - **Definition**: Oxbridge provides various resources to ensure that physical and digital environments are accessible to all students. This includes adaptations in teaching methods, physical spaces, and online learning platforms.
   - **Example**: Accessible campus facilities, such as ramps and elevators, as well as digital resources compatible with screen readers.

### Application Process and Disclosure

1. **Disclosure of SEN**:
   - **Process**: Prospective students are encouraged to disclose any SEN during the application process. This disclosure helps the universities provide appropriate support from the outset.
   - **Example**: Students can include their SEN details in their UCAS application or contact the university’s disability services directly.

2. **Pre-Admission Support**:
   - **Process**: Before admission, students can contact support services to discuss their needs and ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place before they start their studies.
   - **Example**: Meetings with disability advisors can help outline the support plan and make necessary adjustments.

### Key Considerations

1. **Early Communication**:
   - **Tip**: Early communication with the university’s support services can help ensure that all necessary arrangements are in place before the start of the academic year.
   - **Example**: Contacting support services during the summer before the academic year begins can help smooth the transition.

2. **Ongoing Support**:
   - **Tip**: Oxbridge universities offer continuous support throughout a student’s time at the institution. Regular meetings with support staff and periodic reviews ensure that the accommodations remain effective and any new needs are addressed.
   - **Example**: Annual reviews of support plans and access to counseling services as needed.

From tailored accommodations and dedicated support staff to accessibility resources, both Oxford and Cambridge offer a range of services designed to support SEN students throughout their academic journey.
