If English is not your first language, you must demonstrate your proficiency in English through approved tests or other means. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what you need to know regarding these requirements.

### General English Language Requirements

1. **Good Standard of English**: Cambridge expects a strong command of the English language for all international students. This is essential because the courses are taught in English, and effective communication is necessary for academic success.

2. **Demonstration of Proficiency**: If your first language is not English, you will need to provide evidence of your English proficiency. This can be done through standardized English language tests or other qualifications that are accepted by the university.

3. **Review for Future Entry**: The English language requirements are under review for the 2025 entry, so it’s crucial to check the entry requirements for your specific qualification regularly to ensure you have the most up-to-date information.

### Accepted English Language Tests

Cambridge primarily accepts the following tests, but keep in mind that requirements may vary depending on the specific course you are applying for:

1. **IELTS (International English Language Testing System)**:
   - Cambridge's preferred test is the IELTS.
   - You must take the **Academic** version of the test.
   - The minimum overall band score required is **7.0**.

In some cases, Cambridge may accept alternative evidence of English proficiency, which can include:

1. **C1 Advanced (formerly Cambridge English Advanced)**:
   - This qualification is accepted by some courses as proof of English language ability.

2. **C2 Proficiency (formerly Cambridge English Proficiency)**:
   - Similar to C1 Advanced, this can also demonstrate your proficiency in English for certain courses.
