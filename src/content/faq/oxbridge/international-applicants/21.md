As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I understand that navigating the financial aspects of studying abroad can be daunting, especially when it comes to securing scholarships. Cambridge University offers a limited range of scholarships and financial aid options specifically for international undergraduate students. Below, I will outline the key scholarship opportunities available, their eligibility criteria, and the application processes involved.

### Key Scholarships for International Students at Cambridge University

   - **Eligibility**: To be eligible, students must have secured a place at one of the Cambridge Colleges.
   - **Application Process**: After receiving an offer, colleges provide details about the Trust awards and the necessary application forms. It’s crucial to engage with your college’s admissions office for specific information.
   - **Means-testing**: All awards are means-tested, meaning that financial need will be assessed as part of the application process.
   - **Funding Details**: The scholarships vary in amount and can cover tuition fees, living expenses, or a combination of both. More information can be found on the [Cambridge Trust website](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/).

3. **International Disabled Students’ Fund (IDS Fund)**
   - **Overview**: This fund is specifically designed to support international students with disabilities who incur additional costs related to their studies.
   - **Eligibility**: To qualify, students must be classified as international students for fee purposes and can be either offer holders or current students.

### General Funding Information

- **Proof of Finances**: All international students must demonstrate they have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of their studies and living expenses. This may include tuition fees, accommodation, and daily living expenses.
  
- **Working Restrictions**: Be aware that Cambridge imposes restrictions on working during your studies. Therefore, it is not advisable to rely on employment as a significant source of financial support.

- **Dependants**: If you plan to bring dependants with you, you’ll need to provide evidence of sufficient financial means to support them as well.

### Additional Scholarships and Financial Aid Options

While the above scholarships specifically focus on international students, it’s useful to be aware of other notable scholarships that might be applicable, particularly for UK students. These include:

- **Black UK Students Scholarship**: Provides support for Black UK students from low-income backgrounds across any undergraduate course.
  
- **Engineering Scholarship**: Aimed at UK students from underrepresented backgrounds in Engineering.

- **Stormzy Scholarship**: Established to support UK Black students, covering full tuition fees and providing a maintenance grant.

### Application Process for Scholarships

1. **UCAS Application**: The first step in applying for undergraduate studies at Cambridge is submitting your UCAS application by the October 15th deadline (18:00 UK time). This is also the deadline for consideration for most funding opportunities.

2. **College Offer**: Once you’ve received an offer of admission from a Cambridge College, you become eligible for many scholarship awards, including those offered by the Cambridge Trust.

3. **College Nomination**: Eligible students are nominated for Trust funding by their respective colleges.

4. **Trust Application**: After being nominated, students will receive an invitation to submit a separate application to the Cambridge Trust for financial support.

5. **Deadlines**: The application period for Trust awards runs from March to July. It is crucial to keep track of these deadlines to ensure you submit your applications on time.

### Important Points to Remember

- **Limited Funding**: Be aware that financial support for international students is limited, and most awards tend to be partial rather than covering full costs.

- **Means-testing**: Many scholarships are means-tested, so you will need to provide detailed financial information to demonstrate your financial need.

- **Eligibility Research**: Thoroughly research the specific eligibility criteria for each scholarship as they can vary widely.

- **Early Application**: Start your application process early, well ahead of deadlines, to ensure that you have ample time to gather necessary documents and complete the application forms accurately.
