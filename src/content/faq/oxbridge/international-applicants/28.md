Yes, there are English language requirements for international students applying to graduate programs at Oxford University. These requirements are in place to ensure that students can fully engage with the rigorous academic curriculum, participate in discussions, write essays, and conduct research effectively.

### Key Points About English Language Requirements

1. **Proficiency Levels**: Oxford categorizes English language proficiency into two levels: **Standard** and **Higher**. The specific level required depends on the course for which you are applying. It’s crucial to check the course page for detailed requirements, as different programs may have different expectations regarding English proficiency.

2. **Accepted Tests**: Oxford accepts several English language tests, and you must achieve specific minimum scores to meet their requirements. Here are the primary tests accepted by the university:

   - **IELTS (International English Language Testing System)**:
     - **Type**: Academic
     - **Minimum Score**: Overall score of 7.5, with at least 7.0 in each component (Listening, Reading, Writing, Speaking).
     - **Note**: The IELTS General Training and other versions like IELTS for UKVI are not accepted.

   - **TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)**:
     - **Type**: iBT (Internet-Based Test) Home Edition
     - **Minimum Score**: Overall score of 110, with minimum component scores of:
       - Listening: 22
       - Reading: 24
       - Speaking: 25
       - Writing: 24
     - **Note**: Other versions like TOEFL Essentials and TOEFL ITP are not accepted.

   - **Cambridge English**:
     - **C1 Advanced (formerly CAE)**: Requires an overall score of 191, with at least 185 in each component.
     - **C2 Proficiency (formerly CPE)**: Same score requirements as C1 Advanced.

   - **Oxford Test of English (Advanced)**: Requires at least 155 in each component.

   - **Other Accepted Tests**: This includes the Trinity Integrated Skills in English, Pearson PTE Academic, and various GCSE and International Baccalaureate qualifications, among others. Each of these has specific scoring criteria that you must meet.

3. **Exemptions**: Certain students may be exempt from providing evidence of English proficiency:

   - **First Language English**: If English is your first language and you are a citizen and primarily reside in a majority English-speaking country recognized by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI), you do not need to submit test scores.
   - **Current Oxford Student**: Students already enrolled at Oxford who are applying for readmission to a graduate program are also exempt.

4. **Submitting Test Scores**:
   - You can include your English language test scores in your application if you've already taken the test before submission.
   - If you take the test after submitting your application, you can upload your scores through the Graduate Applicant Self Service portal.
   - If your application is successful but you haven't met the English requirement, meeting this requirement may become a condition of your offer.

5. **Waivers**: Applicants may request a waiver of the English language requirement based on:
   - **Substantial Professional Experience**: If you have significant work experience in an English-speaking environment.
   - **Previous Study**: If you have completed a degree taught in English that lasted at least nine months and was finished within the last two academic years.

6. **Pre-Sessional English Course**: If you have not quite met the required English language levels but your test scores are close (within 0.5 IELTS points overall and no more than 1 point lower in any component), you may consider enrolling in a pre-sessional English course offered by Oxford. This course can help bridge the gap in your language skills.

7. **Deadline for Meeting Requirements**: If you receive an offer, you must meet the English language requirement by July 31 of the year in which you were offered admission, regardless of whether your course starts in October.

8. **Validity of Test Scores**: Ensure that your test certificates are valid when you submit them. Most English language tests have expiry dates, and it’s crucial that your scores are still valid at the time of submission.

9. **Application Assessment**: Meeting the English language requirement is not a part of the academic evaluation of your application. This means you can still submit your application and have it assessed even if you haven't met the English proficiency criteria at the time of application.

10. **Student Immigration**: After meeting the English language requirement, the university will provide a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) document, which is necessary for your visa application process.

### Conclusion

In summary, meeting the English language requirement is a critical part of the application process for international students at Oxford. It is essential to familiarize yourself with the accepted tests, required scores, and exemptions well in advance of your application. This preparation will help ensure that your application is complete and competitive. If you are concerned about meeting these requirements, consider reaching out to the admissions office or your academic department for guidance and support.
