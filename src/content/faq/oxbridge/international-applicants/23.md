When applying to the University of Cambridge as an international student, it is crucial to be aware of specific deadlines that are part of the application process. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the key deadlines and other relevant information you need to consider as an international applicant.

### 1. UCAS Application Deadline

International students must submit their applications through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). The UCAS application deadline for all Cambridge applicants, including international students, is **16 October**. This is a hard deadline, and late applications are not accepted for Oxbridge or medicine programs.

### 2. Cambridge Application Deadline

While the UCAS application deadline is on the 16th of October, you must also be aware that the **specific Cambridge application deadline** is **15 October**. This means you should ensure your application is completed and submitted before this date, as it is a day earlier than the UCAS-wide deadline.

### 3. Cambridge Supplementary Application Questionnaire (SAQ)

After you submit your UCAS application, you will also need to complete the **Supplementary Application Questionnaire (SAQ)**. This document provides Cambridge with additional information about your qualifications and interests. The SAQ must be submitted within a few days of your UCAS application, specifically by the **end of October**. It is important to check your email regularly for the invitation to complete the SAQ, as it will be sent by Cambridge shortly after you submit your UCAS application.

### 4. Cambridge Extenuating Circumstances Form (SCF)

If you have any extenuating circumstances that could affect your application, you must submit the **Extenuating Circumstances Form (SCF)**. This form needs to be submitted before **6 PM on the 15th of October**. Make sure to prepare this in advance if you believe you have circumstances worth disclosing, as it can impact how your application is considered.

### 5. Written Work Submission Deadline

If your chosen course requires the submission of written work, it must be submitted to the relevant department or college by the **15th of October**. Ensure that you check the specific requirements for your course, as not all programs will require written work.

### 6. Admissions Tests

If your course requires an admissions test, you will need to register for it ahead of time, usually by early October. The specific dates for these tests vary, but they typically occur in late October. Be sure to check the individual requirements for your course to ensure you are registered and prepared.

### 7. Interviews

Interviews for Cambridge usually take place between **December and January**. While this falls outside the initial application deadlines, it's important to prepare early. Mock interviews and practice sessions can greatly enhance your performance during this critical stage of the admissions process.

### 8. Offers

After interviews, offers are typically released in early **January**. If you receive an offer, you will confirm it through UCAS in the usual manner.

### Financial Declaration and Other Requirements

As an international student, after receiving an offer, you may be required to complete a **financial declaration** to ensure you can support yourself during your studies.

### Additional Considerations

- **Application Fee:** The standard application fee for most international students is Â£60. Some applicants from specific countries may be eligible for a fee waiver. If you believe you qualify, check the Cambridge website for more details.
  
- **English Language Proficiency:** If your first language is not English, you will need to provide proof of your English language skills, usually through tests like IELTS or TOEFL. Be sure to check the specific requirements for your course regarding acceptable tests and minimum scores.

### Conclusion

In summary, the key deadlines for international students applying to Cambridge include:

- **UCAS Application Deadline:** 16 October
- **Cambridge Application Deadline:** 15 October
- **SAQ Submission Deadline:** Within a few days of UCAS submission
- **SCF Submission Deadline:** Before 6 PM on 15 October
