As an Oxbridge Admission Mentor, I’m here to provide clear and comprehensive advice regarding the English language tests accepted by Cambridge University for international students. Understanding the requirements and options available to you is crucial for a successful application. Below, I will outline the key tests accepted by Cambridge for both undergraduate and postgraduate study, along with additional details about each test.

### Accepted English Language Tests

Cambridge University recognizes several English language proficiency tests for international applicants. The main tests accepted are:

1. **IELTS (International English Language Testing System)**:
   - **Preferred Test**: IELTS is the most commonly accepted English language test at Cambridge. 
   - **Format**: The test assesses four skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking.
   - **Score Requirements**: Minimum scores vary based on the specific course you are applying to. For most courses, a score of 7.5 overall is typically necessary, with no component below 7.0.
   - **Validity**: IELTS scores are valid for two years from the date of the test.

2. **TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)**:
   - **Alternative Test**: TOEFL is accepted as an alternative to IELTS.
   - **Format**: The test includes reading, listening, speaking, and writing sections. The TOEFL iBT (Internet-Based Test) is the most commonly taken version.
   - **Score Requirements**: Similar to IELTS, the required minimum score varies by course, but a typical minimum is around 110 overall, with no section lower than 25.
   - **Validity**: TOEFL scores are also valid for two years.

3. **C1 Advanced (formerly Cambridge English Advanced)**:
   - **Alternative Test**: C1 Advanced is another option for demonstrating English proficiency.
   - **Format**: This test assesses reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, specifically geared towards more advanced learners.
   - **Score Requirements**: A score of at least 180 is generally required, but it’s essential to check the specific requirements for your course.
   - **Validity**: Like the other tests, C1 Advanced scores are valid for two years.

4. **C2 Proficiency (formerly Cambridge English Proficiency)**:
   - **Alternative Test**: C2 Proficiency is the highest level of Cambridge English exams and is accepted at Cambridge.
   - **Format**: This test assesses all four language skills, focusing on advanced-level proficiency.
   - **Score Requirements**: A minimum score of 200 is commonly required, but again, specific requirements may vary by course.
   - **Validity**: Scores are valid for two years.

### Important Points to Remember

- **Course-Specific Requirements**: Each course at Cambridge may have different minimum score requirements. It’s essential to consult the Course Directory for the specific requirements related to your intended course. This will ensure you have the correct scores needed for your application.

- **Submitting Test Scores**: For most undergraduate and postgraduate courses, you are not required to submit your English language test results at the time of application. However, if you are applying for the Master of Law (LLM) or Master of Corporate Law (MCL), you must submit your test results with your application. For postgraduate courses, if you receive an offer of admission, you will typically need to provide your scores at that time.

- **Combining Scores**: It’s crucial to understand that you cannot combine scores from different tests. You must meet the minimum requirements for all components of the same test sitting. Therefore, it’s advisable to prepare thoroughly for one test rather than attempting to combine scores from different tests.

- **Waiting Times**: Be aware that there can be long waiting times for both TOEFL and IELTS tests. It’s advisable to book your test as early as possible to avoid any last-minute issues. Additionally, allow time for a retest if necessary, especially if you are close to the application deadline.

- **Visa Information**: The English language tests accepted for admission to Cambridge are also accepted for Tier 4 visa sponsorship purposes. This means that your test results will be valid for both university admission and visa applications, streamlining the process for you as an international student.

- **Home Office SELT List**: The English language test does not need to be listed on the Home Office SELT (Secure English Language Tests) list for students applying for degree-level courses. The SELT list is primarily relevant for those applying for courses below degree level.

### Additional Resources

To help you further, here are some useful resources for each test:

- **Cambridge University Course Directory**: This is the first place to check for specific course requirements, including English language proficiency.
- **IELTS Website**: You can find information about test formats, preparation materials, and test center locations.
- **TOEFL Website**: Similar to the IELTS site, the TOEFL website offers details about the test, including preparation resources and testing locations.
- **C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency Websites**: These sites provide further information on test content and preparation for those interested in taking these Cambridge English exams.

### Conclusion

In summary, Cambridge University accepts several English language proficiency tests, with IELTS being the preferred option. It's important to review the specific requirements for your chosen course, prepare thoroughly for the test, and submit your scores as required. Always stay informed about the validity of your test scores and plan your testing schedule in advance to ensure a smooth application process.
