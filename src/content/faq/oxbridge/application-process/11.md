When structuring your personal statement for Cambridge University admissions, it's important to create a clear and engaging narrative that highlights your academic interests and suitability for your chosen course. Hereâ€™s a suggested structure:

1. **Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)**: 
   Begin with a compelling opening that captures your interest in the subject. You might share a personal experience, a book, or a project that sparked your passion. This sets the tone and shows your enthusiasm.

2. **Academic Interests (2-3 paragraphs)**:
   Focus on your specific interests within the subject. Discuss relevant coursework, projects, or research you've undertaken. Use examples to illustrate how these experiences deepened your understanding and engagement. Explain what aspects of the course excite you and how they align with your future goals.

3. **Achievements and Skills (2 paragraphs)**:
   Highlight your academic achievements and skills, but avoid merely listing them. Instead, discuss how these achievements have shaped your character and academic development. For instance, if you excelled in a particular project, explain what you learned and how it influenced your approach to your studies.

4. **Extracurricular Activities (1-2 paragraphs)**: 
   Mention any extracurricular activities, but only if they are relevant to your course. For example, if you participated in a science club or a debate team, explain how these experiences contributed to your academic interests or skills related to the course.

5. **Conclusion (1 paragraph)**:
   Wrap up with a strong conclusion that reiterates your passion for the subject and your desire to study at Cambridge. You can briefly mention how you hope to contribute to the university community and what you aim to achieve during your studies.

**Final Tips**:
- Keep your statement focused and concise, ideally around 4,000 characters (including spaces).
- Be honest and reflective; do not exaggerate your experiences.
- Ask a teacher for feedback to ensure clarity and coherence. 

By following this structure, you can present a compelling personal statement that showcases your suitability for Cambridge University.
