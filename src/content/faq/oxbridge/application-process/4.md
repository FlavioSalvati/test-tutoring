The entry requirements for Oxford and Cambridge universities are similar but may vary based on the specific course you’re applying for. Here’s a clear breakdown of what you need to consider:

### General Requirements:
1. **Academic Qualifications:**
   - Both universities accept A-levels, IB diplomas, and equivalent qualifications from international education systems.
   - Check specific subject requirements for your chosen course, especially for science and math programs.

2. **Predicted Grades:**
   - You will need to provide predicted grades from your teachers for any exams you haven’t completed yet.

3. **Teacher Reference:**
   - A strong reference from a teacher who knows you well academically is crucial.

4. **Admissions Tests:**
   - Some courses require additional admissions tests (e.g., MAT, BMAT). You must register for these tests separately, often through Pearson VUE.

5. **Interviews:**
   - If shortlisted, you may be invited for an interview. This is an important part of the selection process.

6. **Personal Statement:**
   - You need to submit one personal statement through UCAS that reflects your academic interests, achievements, and relevant extracurricular activities.

### For International Students:
- Follow the same application process as UK students.
- Verify your qualifications on the international qualifications page. If your country isn’t listed, contact the department for guidance.

### Important Notes:
- Late applications are not accepted.
- Vocational qualifications may not be suitable for most courses.
- Transfers are not accepted; you must apply as a first-time student.

In summary, strong academic performance, relevant qualifications, and a clear passion for your chosen subject are essential for both Oxford and Cambridge admissions. Always check the specific requirements for your desired course on their respective websites.
