The Oxbridge application process for postgraduate programs involves several key steps:

1. **Online Application**: Begin by applying through the Applicant Portal. Fill out the application form with accurate information.

2. **Document Submission**: Along with your application, submit all required documents, which typically include academic transcripts, a personal statement, and references. Make sure all materials are complete to avoid delays.

3. **Assessment**: Your application will be reviewed by the relevant department, Degree Committee, and the Postgraduate Admissions Office (PAO). The assessment focuses on your academic merit, available places, and the possibility of securing a suitable supervisor.

4. **Offer Notification**: If your application is successful, you can expect to receive an offer, usually in February or March. The PAO will send out the official offer of admission.

5. **Conditions of Offer**: Most offers are conditional. You must meet specific requirements, such as providing additional academic transcripts or demonstrating English language proficiency. Upload all necessary documents through the Self-Service portal.

6. **Acceptance of Offer**: To confirm your place, accept the offer by the deadline mentioned in your offer certificate. You can do this through your Self-Service account. Once accepted, you will be assigned to a college.

7. **Funding Considerations**: Although you may be considered for funding, the PAO does not handle funding decisions. Check the Application and Funding Deadlines page for details.

8. **Mitigating Circumstances**: If you face difficulties that impact your studies or submissions, you can apply for extensions or report mitigating circumstances. For short extensions (up to 7 days), self-certification is allowed.

9. **Feedback on Applications**: Note that the PAO does not provide feedback on applications. For insights regarding your application, contact the relevant faculty or department directly.

Following these steps will help you navigate the application process effectively.
