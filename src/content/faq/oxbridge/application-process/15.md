1. **University Websites**: Begin by visiting the official Cambridge University website. They often provide resources for prospective students, including guidance on writing personal statements and sometimes even links to sample statements.

2. **UCAS Resources**: The UCAS website has a section dedicated to personal statements. It features tips and sometimes examples from successful applicants, which can be very useful.

3. **Educational Forums and Communities**: Websites like The Student Room or Reddit have forums where students share their experiences and personal statements. Search for threads focused on Cambridge applications to find relevant samples.

4. **Books and Guides**: Consider looking for books on university applications that include personal statement examples. Books written specifically about applying to Oxbridge often have sample statements and detailed analyses.

6. **School Resources**: If youâ€™re still in school, ask your teachers or guidance counselors. They may have examples from past students or resources to help you.

7. **Consultation with Mentors**: If you have access to an Oxbridge mentor or tutor, they can provide you with examples and personalized feedback on your own personal statement.

When reviewing samples, focus on structure, language, and how the applicants convey their passion for their subject. Use these examples as inspiration, but ensure your personal statement reflects your unique experiences and voice.
