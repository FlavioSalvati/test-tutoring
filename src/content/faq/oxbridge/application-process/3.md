The deadline for applying to Oxford and Cambridge, commonly referred to as Oxbridge, is October 15th. This deadline is earlier than most other universities, so itâ€™s important to plan ahead. Make sure to complete your UCAS online application by this date, as late applications are not accepted. If you're applying to either university, ensure that you have all required materials ready, including your personal statement, references, and any necessary admissions tests or written work, depending on your chosen course.
