The personal statement for Cambridge University has a word limit of 4,000 characters, which typically translates to about 500 words. This limit applies to the entire statement, including spaces and punctuation. It's essential to be concise and focused in your writing, as you want to convey your academic interests and experiences effectively within this limit.

Here are some practical tips for crafting your personal statement within the character limit:

1. **Prioritize Content**: Since the majority (around 80%) should focus on your academic interests and achievements, ensure that you highlight your subject passion, relevant coursework, and any projects or research you've undertaken.

2. **Be Specific**: Use specific examples to illustrate your points. For instance, if you mention a particular project, briefly explain your role and what you learned from it.

3. **Reflect on Experiences**: When discussing extra-curricular activities (the remaining 20%), relate them back to your academic interests or skills. For example, if you volunteered for a charity, explain how that experience enhanced your understanding of a relevant issue.

4. **Edit Ruthlessly**: After drafting your statement, review it critically. Look for any redundant phrases or less relevant details that can be removed. Aim to make every word count.

5. **Seek Feedback**: Once you are satisfied with your draft, ask a teacher or someone experienced in admissions to review it. They can provide valuable insights on clarity and impact.

By adhering to the word limit and focusing on quality content, you will create a compelling personal statement that showcases your suitability for Cambridge University.
