Crafting a compelling personal statement for Oxbridge requires careful thought, reflection, and revision. The process can be intensive, and seeking guidance from a tutor can be immensely beneficial. However, the frequency of these meetings is crucial to ensure that you are making consistent progress without feeling overwhelmed. Here’s a detailed approach to how often you should meet with a tutor while working on your personal statement.

### Initial Stages: Setting a Foundation

**1. Start Early:**
   - **Timeline:** Ideally, begin the process during the summer before your final year of school. This gives you ample time to reflect on your experiences, gather your thoughts, and draft your statement without last-minute pressure.
   - **First Meeting:** Schedule an initial meeting with your tutor to discuss your ideas, motivations, and the requirements of the personal statement. This meeting should be around 1.5 to 2 hours long. 

**2. Frequency of Meetings:**
   - **Weekly Meetings:** During the initial brainstorming and drafting phase, aim for weekly sessions. This will allow you to explore your ideas deeply, receive feedback on your thought processes, and make adjustments as necessary.
   - **Focus Areas:** Use these meetings to discuss your subject interest, highlight key experiences, and brainstorm potential anecdotes or hooks for your introduction.

### Drafting and Development Phases

**3. Moving to Drafting:**
   - **First Draft Completion:** Once you have a rough draft ready, share it with your tutor. This draft doesn’t need to be perfect – it’s a starting point.
   - **Bi-weekly Meetings:** Transition to bi-weekly meetings as you refine your draft. This gives you time to incorporate feedback and develop your ideas further without feeling rushed.

**4. Feedback Sessions:**
   - **Detailed Review:** During these bi-weekly meetings, focus on specific sections of your statement. Discuss clarity, depth of content, and how well your personality and passion are conveyed.
   - **Iterative Process:** Remember that writing is an iterative process. Use these sessions to go through your draft in chunks, making sure that each part flows well and serves its purpose.

### Finalizing Your Statement

**5. Polishing Your Draft:**
   - **Final Draft Preparation:** As you approach a near-final version of your statement, increase the frequency of your meetings again to weekly. This is especially important if deadlines are approaching.
   - **Proofreading Focus:** Use these meetings to focus on proofreading, ensuring grammar, spelling, and punctuation are flawless. Discuss the overall structure and coherence of your argument.

**6. Mock Interviews:**
   - **Preparation for Interviews:** If your tutor is also providing interview preparation, plan a separate session for mock interviews where you practice discussing your personal statement in depth. This is crucial, as interviewers often ask questions based on what you have written.

### Important Considerations

**7. Adaptability and Flexibility:**
   - **Personal Pace:** Everyone works at their own pace. If you feel you need more frequent support, don’t hesitate to arrange additional meetings. Conversely, if you’re confident in your direction, you can reduce the frequency.
   - **Emerging Issues:** If new ideas, experiences, or concerns arise, feel free to schedule an extra session to address these. Flexibility is key to making the most of your tutoring.

**8. Feedback Beyond the Tutor:**
   - **Peer Review:** Consider sharing your statement with peers or family members for additional perspectives. However, be discerning about the feedback you take on board.
   - **Multiple Perspectives:** Getting different viewpoints can help you see aspects of your statement that you might overlook.

### Conclusion

In summary, when working on your Oxbridge personal statement, an effective approach to meeting with your tutor is as follows:

- **Start with weekly meetings** during the brainstorming and initial drafting stages.
- **Transition to bi-weekly meetings** as you develop the draft and incorporate feedback.
- **Increase back to weekly meetings** as you finalize your statement, focusing on proofreading and preparation for interviews.

This structured but flexible approach will help you create a strong personal statement while ensuring you have the support and guidance you need throughout the process. 

### Additional Tips

- **Stay Organized:** Keep track of your meetings and feedback notes. This will help you remember key points to address in subsequent drafts.
- **Be Open to Critique:** Embrace constructive criticism. The goal is to strengthen your statement, and sometimes that requires making difficult changes.
- **Reflect Regularly:** Take time between meetings to reflect on what you’ve learned and how your experiences connect to your desired course of study.
- **Maintain Balance:** Ensure that while you’re focused on your statement, you don’t neglect your other academic responsibilities. Balance is essential.

By following this guidance, you can navigate the personal statement process effectively, ensuring that your final submission reflects your best self and academic aspirations. Good luck!
