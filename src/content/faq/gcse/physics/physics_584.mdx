A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape its grasp.

Black holes are formed when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo a catastrophic collapse under the force of their own gravity. This collapse compresses the star's core into an incredibly small and dense point known as a singularity. Surrounding the singularity is the event horizon, which acts as a boundary; once crossed, nothing can return. This event horizon is often referred to as the "point of no return."

There are several types of black holes, including stellar black holes, supermassive black holes, and intermediate black holes. Stellar black holes arise from the remnants of massive stars and typically possess a mass ranging from $3$ to $10$ times that of our Sun. Supermassive black holes, which are found at the centers of galaxies, can have masses equivalent to millions or even billions of solar masses. Intermediate black holes are less common and have masses that lie between those of stellar and supermassive black holes.

Black holes are detected through their interactions with nearby matter. For instance, if a black hole is part of a binary system, it can draw material from its companion star. This material forms an accretion disk around the black hole, heating up and emitting X-rays that can be observed by telescopes. Furthermore, the gravitational influence of black holes affects the orbits of nearby stars and gas clouds, providing indirect evidence of their existence.

The study of black holes is essential for scientists seeking to understand fundamental aspects of physics, including gravity, quantum mechanics, and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions. Despite their enigmatic nature, black holes play a crucial role in our universe, shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies.
