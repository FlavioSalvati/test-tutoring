A barometer is an instrument that measures atmospheric pressure by balancing the weight of mercury in a tube against the surrounding air pressure.

Typically, a barometer consists of a glass tube filled with mercury, which is inverted into a basin also filled with mercury. The atmospheric pressure exerts a downward force on the mercury in the basin, causing the mercury in the tube to rise. The height of the mercury column in the tube is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). This height is directly related to the atmospheric pressure: an increase in pressure pushes the mercury column higher, while a decrease allows it to fall.

The underlying principle of a barometer is that the weight of the mercury column is balanced by the atmospheric pressure. When atmospheric pressure increases, it exerts a greater force on the mercury in the basin, resulting in a higher mercury level in the tube. Conversely, when atmospheric pressure decreases, the force on the mercury is reduced, causing the mercury level in the tube to drop.

In addition to traditional mercury barometers, there are aneroid barometers, which do not utilize liquid. Instead, an aneroid barometer contains a sealed, flexible metal chamber that expands and contracts in response to changes in atmospheric pressure. This movement is translated into a reading on a dial. While aneroid barometers are generally more portable and less fragile than mercury barometers, they operate on the same fundamental principle of balancing atmospheric pressure against a known reference.

Understanding the operation of a barometer is crucial for predicting weather changes. High atmospheric pressure often indicates fair weather, whereas low pressure can signal approaching storms. This is why barometers are indispensable tools in the field of meteorology.
