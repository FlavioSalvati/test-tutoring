The units of specific latent heat are expressed as joules per kilogram, denoted as $ \text{J/kg} $.

Specific latent heat quantifies the amount of energy necessary to change the state of 1 kilogram of a substance without altering its temperature. This energy is utilized to break or form the intermolecular bonds between the particles within the substance. For instance, when ice transitions to water, energy is required to disrupt the bonds holding the water molecules in the ice together.

There are two primary types of specific latent heat: the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization. The specific latent heat of fusion refers to the energy necessary to convert 1 kilogram of a substance from a solid to a liquid at its melting point. Conversely, the specific latent heat of vaporization is the energy needed to transform 1 kilogram of a substance from a liquid to a gas at its boiling point.

The unit $ \text{J/kg} $ is derived from the relationship between energy, measured in joules ($ \text{J} $), and mass, measured in kilograms ($ \text{kg} $). For example, if the specific latent heat of fusion for water is $ 334,000 \, \text{J/kg} $, this indicates that $ 334,000 $ joules of energy are required to melt $ 1 $ kilogram of ice at $ 0^\circ C $.

Understanding specific latent heat is crucial for various practical applications, including heating systems, refrigeration, and meteorology. It enables us to calculate the energy required for processes such as melting, boiling, and condensation, all of which are common in both everyday life and industrial operations.
