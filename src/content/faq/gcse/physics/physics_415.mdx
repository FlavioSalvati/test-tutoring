Isotopes influence the atomic mass of an element by contributing various masses due to their differing numbers of neutrons.

To elaborate, isotopes are atoms of the same element that possess the same number of protons but differ in their neutron count. This variation in the number of neutrons results in isotopes having different atomic masses. For instance, carbon has two stable isotopes: carbon-12, which has $6$ neutrons, and carbon-13, which contains $7$ neutrons. Although both isotopes have $6$ protons, the presence of an additional neutron in carbon-13 renders it heavier than carbon-12.

The atomic mass of an element, as presented on the periodic table, is actually a weighted average of all the naturally occurring isotopes of that element. This means that the atomic mass accounts for both the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance in nature. For example, if an element has two isotopes—one that is very common and another that is rare—the atomic mass will be closer to the mass of the more prevalent isotope.

To calculate the atomic mass, scientists multiply the mass of each isotope by its relative abundance (expressed as a fraction) and then sum these products. For example, consider an element with two isotopes that have masses of $10$ and $11$ atomic mass units (amu) and relative abundances of $20\%$ and $80\%$, respectively. The atomic mass can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Atomic Mass} = (10 \, \text{amu} \times 0.20) + (11 \, \text{amu} \times 0.80) = 2 + 8.8 = 10.8 \, \text{amu}.
$$

Understanding isotopes and their impact on atomic mass is essential in fields such as chemistry and physics, as it enables scientists to predict the behavior of elements in various reactions and conditions.
