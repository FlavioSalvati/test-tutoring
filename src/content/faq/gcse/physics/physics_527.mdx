Extending the duration of impact can significantly reduce the force experienced during a collision.

When two objects collide, the force that each object experiences is determined by the change in momentum and the time interval over which this change occurs. Momentum, denoted as $p$, is defined as the product of an object's mass ($m$) and its velocity ($v$), expressed mathematically as:

$$
p = mv
$$

According to Newton's second law of motion, the force ($F$) is the rate of change of momentum. This relationship is mathematically represented by the equation:

$$
F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the force, $\Delta p$ represents the change in momentum, and $\Delta t$ denotes the time interval during which this change takes place.

When the time of impact ($\Delta t$) is increased, the same change in momentum ($\Delta p$) occurs over a longer period. This results in a lower rate of change of momentum, thereby producing a smaller force. For instance, in the event of a car crashing into a barrier, the force exerted on both the car and its occupants can be mitigated through the use of crumple zones. These engineered areas are designed to deform during a collision, effectively increasing the time taken for the car to come to a complete stop, which ultimately reduces the force experienced.

This principle also explains the effectiveness of airbags and seatbelts as critical safety features in vehicles. Airbags deploy rapidly during a collision, creating a cushioning effect that extends the time over which an occupant's momentum changes, thus diminishing the force exerted on the body. Similarly, seatbelts are designed to stretch slightly during a crash, which prolongs the time of impact and reduces the force experienced by the wearer.

In sports, athletes often bend their knees when landing from a jump. This action increases the time over which their momentum changes, thereby reducing the impact force on their legs and helping to prevent injuries. 

Understanding the relationship between extending the time of impact and the resulting force is essential for designing safer vehicles, sports equipment, and protective gear.
