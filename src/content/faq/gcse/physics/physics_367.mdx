The law of electrostatics asserts that like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract.

To elaborate, electrostatics is the study of electric charges at rest. The cornerstone of electrostatics is Coulomb's Law, which quantifies the force between two point charges. According to Coulomb's Law, the force ($ F $) between two charges is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance ($ r $) separating them. This relationship is mathematically represented as:

$$ 
F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} 
$$ 

In this equation, $ F $ denotes the force, $ q_1 $ and $ q_2 $ represent the magnitudes of the charges, $ r $ is the distance between the charges, and $ k $ is Coulomb's constant.

In simpler terms, the force that two charged objects exert on each other depends on the amount of charge each possesses and the distance between them. If both objects carry positive charges or both carry negative charges, they will repel each other. Conversely, if one object has a positive charge and the other has a negative charge, they will attract one another.

Electrostatics also accounts for phenomena such as static electricity. For instance, when you rub a balloon against your hair, electrons are transferred from your hair to the balloon. This process results in the balloon acquiring a negative charge while your hair becomes positively charged. As a result, your hair stands on end due to the repulsion between the positively charged individual hairs.

A solid understanding of electrostatics is essential for various applications, ranging from the design of electronic components to the comprehension of natural occurrences such as lightning. It enables us to analyze and predict the behavior of charged objects, thereby establishing itself as a fundamental concept in the field of physics.
