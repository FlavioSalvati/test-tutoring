You can calculate the acceleration due to gravity using the formula 

$$ 
g = \frac{GM}{R^2} 
$$ 

To better understand this equation, let's break it down into its components. The symbol $ g $ represents the acceleration due to gravity, which on the surface of the Earth is approximately $ 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $. The letter $ G $ denotes the gravitational constant, valued at approximately 

$$ 
G \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2 
$$ 

This constant quantifies the strength of gravity throughout the universe.

The letter $ M $ refers to the mass of the object responsible for creating the gravitational field, which is typically the Earth in this context. The Earth's mass is approximately 

$$ 
M \approx 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} 
$$ 

Lastly, $ R $ signifies the distance from the center of the mass to the point where the gravitational acceleration is being measured. When measuring from the Earth's surface, $ R $ corresponds to the average radius of the Earth, approximately 

$$ 
R \approx 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} 
$$ 

By substituting these values into the formula, you can determine the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface. For example:

$$ 
g = \frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \times (5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg})}{(6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m})^2} 
$$ 

After performing the calculations, you will find that $ g $ is approximately $ 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $.

This formula is derived from Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every mass attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This fundamental principle explains why the formula incorporates both the mass of the Earth and the distance from its center.
