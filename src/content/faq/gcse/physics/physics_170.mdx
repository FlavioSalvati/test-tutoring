To calculate the moment of a force, you simply multiply the force by the perpendicular distance from the pivot point.

More specifically, the moment of a force, commonly referred to as torque, quantifies the turning effect that a force exerts on an object. The mathematical relationship for calculating the moment is expressed by the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Moment} = \text{Force} \times \text{Perpendicular Distance} 
$$

In this equation, the "force" represents the applied push or pull on the object, measured in newtons (N). The "perpendicular distance" refers to the shortest distance from the pivot point (or fulcrum) to the line of action of the force, measured in metres (m). The pivot point is the specific location around which the object rotates or turns.

For instance, if you apply a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ to a spanner at a distance of $0.5 \, \text{m}$ from the nut (which serves as the pivot), the moment of the force can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\text{Moment} = 10 \, \text{N} \times 0.5 \, \text{m} = 5 \, \text{Nm} 
$$

This calculation indicates that the turning effect of the force is $5 \, \text{Nm}$ (newton-metres).

It is crucial to ensure that the distance used in the calculation is perpendicular to the direction of the applied force. If the force is not applied at a perpendicular angle, you must determine the component of the force that acts perpendicularly to the distance. This can be achieved using trigonometric methods if the angle between the force and the distance is known.

A solid understanding of moments is essential for various practical applications, including the use of levers, opening doors, and designing engineering structures. By analyzing moments, you can predict how forces will cause objects to rotate, allowing for the design of stable and safe structures.
