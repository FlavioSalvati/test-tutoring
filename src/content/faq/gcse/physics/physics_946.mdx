To calculate the weight of fluid displaced by an object, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Weight} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} \times \text{Gravity}
$$

When an object is submerged in a fluid, it displaces a volume of that fluid that is equal to the volume of the object itself. According to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force acting on the object is equal to the weight of the fluid that has been displaced. To determine this weight, you need to know three key parameters: the volume of the object, the density of the fluid, and the acceleration due to gravity.

**Step 1: Determine the Volume of the Object**

If the object has a regular shape, you can calculate its volume using geometric formulas. For instance, the volume of a cube can be found by cubing the length of one of its sides. In cases where the object has an irregular shape, you might need to apply water displacement methods to accurately measure its volume.

**Step 2: Find the Density of the Fluid**

The density of a fluid is defined as its mass per unit volume and is commonly expressed in units such as kilograms per cubic meter ($\text{kg/m}^3$). For instance, the density of water is approximately $1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3$.

**Step 3: Use the Acceleration Due to Gravity**

On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$.

**Calculation of the Displaced Fluid Weight**

Once you have determined the volume of the object, the density of the fluid, and the acceleration due to gravity, you can calculate the weight of the displaced fluid. The formula is applied as follows:

$$
\text{Weight} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Density} \times \text{Gravity}
$$

**Example Calculation**

Consider an object with a volume of $0.5 \, \text{m}^3$ that is submerged in water. To find the weight of the water displaced, you would calculate:

$$
\text{Weight} = 0.5 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 4900 \, \text{N}
$$

Thus, the weight of the fluid displaced by the object is $4900 \, \text{N}$.
