Commonly used fuels in nuclear fission include uranium-235, plutonium-239, and, to a lesser extent, thorium-232.

In nuclear fission, uranium-235 is the most widely utilized fuel. This isotope of uranium is favored due to its ability to undergo fission easily when struck by a neutron, resulting in the release of a substantial amount of energy. Although uranium-235 occurs naturally, it constitutes only about $0.7\%$ of natural uranium. Consequently, it often requires enrichment to increase its concentration for use in reactors.

Another significant fuel in nuclear fission is plutonium-239. This isotope is not found in notable quantities in nature; rather, it is produced in reactors from uranium-238. When uranium-238 absorbs a neutron, it undergoes a series of transformations that ultimately yield plutonium-239, which can then be employed as fuel. Plutonium-239 is especially advantageous in fast breeder reactors, which are designed to generate more fuel than they consume.

Thorium-232, while less commonly used, is gaining traction as a potential nuclear fuel. Although thorium itself is not fissile—meaning it cannot sustain a chain reaction independently—when thorium-232 absorbs a neutron, it converts into uranium-233. Uranium-233 is fissile and can be utilized as fuel. Moreover, thorium is more abundant in the Earth's crust than uranium, making it an appealing option for future nuclear energy solutions.

These materials are selected because they can sustain a chain reaction, where the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller fragments, releasing a significant amount of energy. This energy is harnessed in nuclear reactors to generate electricity. The choice of fuel depends on the type of reactor and the specific operational requirements of the nuclear power plant.
