Radioactive decay is inherently random, as it is impossible to predict the exact moment when a specific atomic nucleus will undergo decay.

Radioactive decay occurs when an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. This process is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of particles at the smallest scales. According to these principles, the decay of a single nucleus is a probabilistic event, meaning it occurs by chance and cannot be predicted with certainty.

Each type of radioactive isotope has a distinct half-life, defined as the time required for half of a sample of the isotope to decay. While the half-life provides a statistical measure for the duration it takes for a large number of nuclei to decay, it does not indicate when any individual nucleus will decay. For instance, if you have a sample of a radioactive substance with a half-life of $10$ years, you can expect that after $10$ years, approximately half of the nuclei will have decayed. However, it remains impossible to determine which specific nuclei will decay during that period.

The randomness of radioactive decay can be likened to flipping a coin. Each coin flip is independent; although you can predict that over many flips you will obtain roughly equal numbers of heads and tails, you cannot forecast the outcome of any single flip. In a similar manner, while we can predict the behavior of a large number of radioactive atoms, the decay of any individual atom remains random and unpredictable.

This randomness is a fundamental aspect of nature at the quantum level. It is not a result of incomplete knowledge or measurement precision, but rather an intrinsic property of the particles themselves. Consequently, scientists rely on statistical methods to analyze and predict the behavior of radioactive materials, rather than attempting to forecast the decay of individual atoms.
