Ohmic conductors adhere to Ohm's Law, while non-ohmic conductors do not.

Ohmic conductors are materials that exhibit a constant resistance when a voltage is applied across them. This implies that the current flowing through an ohmic conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, as expressed by Ohm's Law:

$$
V = IR
$$

where $ V $ represents voltage, $ I $ denotes current, and $ R $ signifies resistance. Common examples of ohmic conductors include most metals, such as copper and aluminum, which maintain a linear relationship between voltage and current.

Conversely, non-ohmic conductors do not conform to Ohm's Law. Their resistance varies with the applied voltage or current, resulting in a non-linear relationship between voltage and current. Examples of non-ohmic conductors include diodes, transistors, and incandescent bulbs. For instance, in an incandescent bulb, the resistance increases as the filament's temperature rises, leading to a situation where the current does not increase proportionally with the voltage.

In practical terms, if you were to graph current against voltage for an ohmic conductor, the result would be a straight line, indicating a consistent ratio of voltage to current. In contrast, the graph for a non-ohmic conductor would display a curve, reflecting the varying resistance. This distinction is critical in the design and analysis of electrical circuits, as it influences the behavior of components under different electrical conditions.

Understanding the difference between ohmic and non-ohmic conductors is essential for predicting how various materials will respond in a circuit. This knowledge is invaluable for both theoretical research and practical applications in the fields of physics and engineering.
