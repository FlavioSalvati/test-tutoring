Geostationary satellites are designed to maintain a fixed position relative to the Earth by orbiting at the same rotational speed as the planet itself.

These satellites are placed in a specific orbit known as the geostationary orbit, which is located approximately $35,786$ kilometers above the Earth's equator. At this altitude, the orbital period of the satellite matches the Earth's rotational period of $24$ hours. Consequently, the satellite completes one full orbit around the Earth every $24$ hours, aligning perfectly with the Earth's rotation. This synchronization allows the satellite to appear stationary from a fixed point on the Earth's surface.

To achieve this effect, the satellite must be positioned in an orbit where its angular velocity equates to the Earth's rotational velocity. This precise condition can only be met at the geostationary altitude. If a satellite were to orbit at a lower altitude, it would travel faster than the rotation of the Earth, while at a higher altitude, it would orbit more slowly. The exact balance found at the geostationary altitude ensures that the satellite remains in a consistent position relative to the Earth's surface.

Furthermore, geostationary satellites are typically equipped with thrusters that enable them to make small adjustments to their position and velocity, known as station-keeping maneuvers. These maneuvers are essential for counteracting the gravitational influences from the Moon, the Sun, and the Earth's equatorial bulge, which can cause the satellite to drift from its intended position. By performing these periodic corrections, the satellite can effectively maintain its geostationary position over time.

This stable positioning is vital for various applications, including weather monitoring, telecommunications, and broadcasting, where a continuous view of the same area on the Earth's surface is required.
