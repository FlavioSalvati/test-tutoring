A white dwarf is a small, dense stellar remnant that signifies the final evolutionary stage of low to medium-mass stars.

These fascinating objects are the remnants of stars that were once similar to our Sun. When such a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it undergoes a series of transformations. Initially, the star expands into a red giant, shedding its outer layers into space. What remains is the core, which contracts under the force of gravity and ultimately becomes a white dwarf. This transformation typically occurs in stars with masses up to about $8$ times that of the Sun.

White dwarfs are incredibly dense. Despite having a volume comparable to that of Earth, they can possess a mass similar to that of the Sun. This extreme density means that a mere teaspoon of white dwarf material would weigh several tons on Earth! The core of a white dwarf is primarily composed of carbon and oxygen nuclei, often surrounded by a thin layer of hydrogen or helium.

Unlike main-sequence stars, white dwarfs do not produce energy through nuclear fusion. Instead, they shine due to residual thermal energy. Over the course of billions of years, white dwarfs gradually cool and fade, eventually becoming black dwarfs. However, the universe is not yet old enough for any black dwarfs to have formed.

The study of white dwarfs is crucial in the field of astrophysics. They provide valuable insights into the life cycles of stars and the future of our own Sun. Furthermore, white dwarfs serve as cosmic distance markers, assisting astronomers in understanding the age and expansion of the universe.

In summary, white dwarfs are intriguing celestial objects that mark the conclusion of a star's life cycle. They offer a glimpse into the future of stellar evolution and the ultimate fate of stars like our Sun.
