When the net force acting on an object is zero, the object either remains at rest or continues to move with a constant velocity.

In physics, the concept of net force is essential for comprehending motion. The net force is defined as the vector sum of all individual forces acting on an object. When the net force equals zero, it indicates that all forces are balanced. This principle is articulated in Newton's First Law of Motion, often referred to as the law of inertia. According to this law, an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.

For instance, consider a book resting on a table. The book experiences two primary forces: the gravitational force acting downward and the normal force exerted by the table acting upward. These forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net force of zero. As a result, the book remains stationary.

In a similar vein, when a car travels at a constant speed on a straight road, the forward forces, such as the engine's thrust, are counterbalanced by opposing forces like air resistance and friction. This equilibrium of forces results in a net force of zero, allowing the car to maintain its steady speed.

Understanding the implications of a zero net force is crucial for explaining the behavior of objects in various scenarios. This principle serves as a foundational concept in classical mechanics and is vital for analyzing real-world problems in physics.
