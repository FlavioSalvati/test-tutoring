Impulse during a collision is calculated by multiplying the force applied by the duration of time over which that force acts.

Impulse is an essential concept in physics, particularly in the analysis of collisions. It is defined as the change in momentum of an object when a force is exerted over a specific period. Mathematically, impulse ($J$) can be expressed as the product of the average force ($F$) and the time duration ($\Delta t$) during which the force is applied:

$$ J = F \times \Delta t $$

To gain a clearer understanding, let's break this down further. Momentum ($p$) is defined as the product of an object's mass ($m$) and its velocity ($v$):

$$ p = m \times v $$

When a collision occurs, the object's velocity changes, resulting in a change in momentum. This change in momentum is what we refer to as impulse. According to Newton's second law, the force exerted on an object is equivalent to the rate of change of its momentum. Thus, the impulse experienced by an object is also equal to the change in its momentum:

$$ J = \Delta p $$

For instance, consider a car with a mass of $1000 \, \text{kg}$ that is initially traveling at $10 \, \text{m/s}$. If the car comes to a stop in $5 \, \text{s}$ due to a collision, the change in velocity ($\Delta v$) is $-10 \, \text{m/s}$ (indicating it stops). The change in momentum ($\Delta p$) can be calculated as follows:

$$ \Delta p = 1000 \, \text{kg} \times (-10 \, \text{m/s}) = -10000 \, \text{kg m/s} $$

Thus, the impulse is also $-10000 \, \text{kg m/s}$. If we know the duration of the collision, we can determine the average force exerted during this time:

$$ F = \frac{J}{\Delta t} = \frac{-10000 \, \text{kg m/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = -2000 \, \text{N} $$

In summary, impulse offers a valuable framework for quantifying the impact of a force applied over time, allowing us to understand and predict the outcomes of collisions in terms of changes in momentum.
