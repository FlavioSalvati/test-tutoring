To measure infrared absorption, you will need to set up an apparatus that includes an infrared source, a sample, and an infrared detector.

First, select an infrared source. This could be an infrared lamp or an LED specifically designed to emit infrared radiation. The purpose of this source is to generate infrared light that will pass through the sample you wish to analyze.

Next, position the sample between the infrared source and the detector. The sample may be a gas, liquid, or solid, depending on the nature of your investigation. Ensure that the sample is arranged so that the infrared light can easily pass through it. For gases, a gas cell is typically used; for liquids, a cuvette is appropriate; and for solids, you can utilize either a thin film or a pellet.

Then, place the infrared detector on the opposite side of the sample. The detector could be a thermopile, a photodiode, or another device sensitive to infrared radiation. Its role is to measure the amount of infrared light that successfully passes through the sample.

To obtain accurate measurements, it is essential to establish a control setup. This control should allow infrared light to travel through the same path but without the sample in place. This will help you determine the baseline level of infrared light absorption.

Once your setup is complete, turn on the infrared source and record the detector's readings both with and without the sample present. The difference between these two readings will indicate the amount of infrared light absorbed by the sample.

Finally, analyze the collected data to determine the absorption characteristics of the sample. If your infrared source and detector can accommodate multiple wavelengths, you may plot the absorption against various wavelengths of infrared light. This comprehensive setup will enable you to understand how different materials absorb infrared radiation, which is valuable in a range of scientific and industrial applications.
