Balanced forces maintain an object's current state of motion, whether it is at rest or moving at a constant velocity, while unbalanced forces result in a change in that motion.

When the forces acting on an object are balanced, the object remains in its existing state of motion. This means that if the object is at rest, it will remain at rest. Conversely, if the object is in motion, it will continue to move at a constant velocity in a straight line. Balanced forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, effectively canceling each other out. For example, if you apply a force of $5 \, \text{N}$ to the right while a friend applies a force of $5 \, \text{N}$ to the left on a book resting on a table, the book will not move due to the balance of forces.

In contrast, unbalanced forces lead to a change in the object's motion. This may involve the object starting to move from a state of rest, increasing its speed, decreasing its speed, or changing direction. Unbalanced forces are unequal and do not cancel each other out. For instance, if you push a toy car with a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ while friction exerts a force of $3 \, \text{N}$ in the opposite direction, the car will accelerate in the direction of your push. The net force acting on the car is calculated as:

$$
\text{Net Force} = 10 \, \text{N} - 3 \, \text{N} = 7 \, \text{N} \text{ (in the direction of the push)}
$$

In summary, balanced forces preserve an object's motion, whereas unbalanced forces induce changes. Understanding this distinction is essential in physics, as it explains the behavior of objects in motion. Whether itâ€™s a car accelerating down a road or a book remaining stationary on a table, the dynamics of balanced and unbalanced forces underpin these common experiences.
