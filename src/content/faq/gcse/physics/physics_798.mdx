You can use the periodic table to identify both the atomic number and the mass number of an element by examining its symbol.

The atomic number of an element is typically displayed above its symbol in the periodic table. This number indicates the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom of that element. For example, when examining the element carbon (C), you will observe the number $6$ positioned above its symbol. This signifies that carbon has $6$ protons in its nucleus, thus its atomic number is $6$.

In contrast, the mass number is usually found below the element's symbol. The mass number represents the total count of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. For instance, when looking at carbon again, you may see a number like $12.01$ below its symbol. This number corresponds to the atomic mass, which is a weighted average of all the isotopes of that element. For GCSE purposes, you can round this figure to the nearest whole number to obtain the mass number. Therefore, for carbon, the mass number can be approximated as $12$.

It is crucial to understand that while the atomic number is always a whole number, the mass number can appear as a decimal. This is because it reflects the average mass of all the isotopes of that element. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that differ in the number of neutrons. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon, with mass numbers of $12$ and $14$, respectively.

By comprehending these numbers, you can analyze the properties of elements and predict their chemical reactivity. The periodic table serves as a valuable resource that organizes elements in a manner that highlights their similarities and differences, facilitating a deeper understanding of chemistry.
