Series circuits have a single pathway for current, whereas parallel circuits provide multiple pathways for current to flow.

In a series circuit, all components are connected in a linear sequence, forming a single path for the electric current. This configuration implies that if any component fails, the entire circuit is interrupted, resulting in no current flow. The total resistance in a series circuit is calculated as the sum of the individual resistances. Thus, the more components you add, the higher the overall resistance becomes, which can lead to a decrease in current. For instance, if you have three resistors in series, the total resistance can be expressed as:

$$
R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3
$$

Conversely, a parallel circuit features multiple pathways for current to flow. In this arrangement, each component is connected across the same two points, effectively creating branches. If one component in a parallel circuit fails, the current can still travel through the remaining branches, allowing the circuit to continue functioning. The total resistance in a parallel circuit is always less than the smallest individual resistance, due to the availability of multiple paths for the current. The formula for calculating total resistance in a parallel circuit is more intricate:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots
$$

Additionally, voltage behaves differently in these circuits. In a series circuit, the total voltage is divided among the components. For example, if you have a $9\,V$ battery connected to three equal resistors in series, each resistor would experience a voltage drop of:

$$
V_{resistor} = \frac{9\,V}{3} = 3\,V
$$

In contrast, in a parallel circuit, each branch receives the full voltage of the power source. Therefore, with a $9\,V$ battery, each branch in the parallel circuit will have $9\,V$ across it.

Grasping these differences is essential for the design and troubleshooting of electrical circuits, as each configuration offers distinct advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific application.
