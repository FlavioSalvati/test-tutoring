The use of coal has considerable environmental repercussions, including air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and habitat destruction.

When coal is burned for energy production, it releases a range of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. These pollutants include sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$), nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$), and particulate matter, all of which can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems in humans. Furthermore, these emissions contribute to the formation of acid rain, which can harm forests, soils, and aquatic ecosystems.

Among the most alarming effects of coal consumption is the release of carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), a significant greenhouse gas. The combustion of coal is one of the largest contributors to $\text{CO}_2$ emissions, which drive global warming and climate change. The resulting increase in global temperatures can result in more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture.

Coal mining also carries substantial environmental consequences. Surface mining methods, such as strip mining and mountaintop removal, can devastate vast areas of land, including forests and wildlife habitats. This not only threatens biodiversity but also disrupts local communities and their livelihoods. Additionally, mining operations can lead to soil erosion and the contamination of water sources with heavy metals and other harmful pollutants.

Another significant challenge is coal ash, the waste produced after coal combustion. This byproduct contains toxic substances such as mercury, arsenic, and lead, which can leach into groundwater and rivers, posing significant risks to both human health and the environment. Effective disposal and management of coal ash are essential to mitigate these harmful effects.

In summary, while coal has historically served as a major energy source, its environmental impacts are extensive and complex, adversely affecting air quality, climate, land, and water resources.
