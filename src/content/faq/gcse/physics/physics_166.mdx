To investigate the relationship between force and extension in a spring, you will measure the extension of the spring under various applied forces and subsequently plot a graph of your results.

### Materials Needed
To conduct this experiment, you will require:
- A spring
- A set of weights
- A ruler
- A stand with a clamp

### Procedure
1. **Setup**: Start by securely attaching the spring to the clamp on the stand. Ensure that the spring hangs vertically and is not under any tension.
   
2. **Measure Initial Length**: Using the ruler, measure the initial length of the spring without any weights attached. This length serves as your reference point.

3. **Add Weights**: Gradually add a known weight to the spring and measure its new length. The extension of the spring is calculated as the difference between this new length and the initial length. 

4. **Record Data**: Document the weight (which corresponds to the force applied) and the resulting extension in a table. Repeat this process by adding additional weights incrementally, measuring and recording the extension each time.

### Data Analysis
After collecting your data, plot a graph with the applied force on the vertical axis (y-axis) and the extension on the horizontal axis (x-axis). According to Hooke's Law, if the spring behaves according to this principle, the graph should yield a straight line that passes through the origin. This indicates that the extension is directly proportional to the force applied.

### Calculating the Spring Constant
The slope (gradient) of the line you plotted represents the spring constant, denoted as $k$. This constant is a measure of the spring's stiffness. You can calculate it using the formula:

$$
k = \frac{F}{e}
$$ 

where:
- $F$ is the applied force,
- $e$ is the extension of the spring.

### Safety Considerations
It is important to ensure safety by avoiding the overloading of the spring, as excessive weight could lead to permanent deformation or cause the spring to snap. Additionally, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of your results, take multiple readings for each weight.

This practical experiment not only illustrates the relationship between force and extension but also reinforces the principles of Hooke's Law through hands-on experience.
