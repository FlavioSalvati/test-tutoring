The half-life of a radioactive substance is defined as the time required for half of its radioactive nuclei to undergo decay.

To determine the half-life, scientists begin by measuring the initial activity of the radioactive substance. This initial activity reflects the rate of decay and is typically quantified in terms of decays per second, also known as the count rate. Common instruments for measuring this activity include a Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube and a scintillation counter, both of which detect the particles or radiation emitted during the decay process.

After establishing the initial activity, scientists conduct measurements at regular intervals. Over time, the activity decreases as fewer radioactive nuclei remain available to decay. By plotting a graph of activity versus time, they can visualize the decline in activity. The half-life is identified as the time interval on this graph during which the activity decreases to half of its initial value.

For instance, if a sample begins with an activity of $100$ decays per second, the half-life is the duration required for the activity to diminish to $50$ decays per second. This measurement process is repeated multiple times to ensure accuracy, and the resulting values are averaged to derive a reliable estimate of the half-life.

In certain cases, scientists employ mathematical techniques to analyze the decay data. They may fit the data to an exponential decay curve, which mathematically describes the decline in the number of undecayed nuclei over time. From this analysis, the half-life can be calculated using the decay constant, a key parameter within the exponential decay formula.

Understanding the concept of half-life is essential across various fields, including medicine, archaeology, and nuclear power. It aids in predicting the duration for which a radioactive substance will remain active and informs safe management practices for handling such materials.
