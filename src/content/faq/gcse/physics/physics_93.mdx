An isotope is a variant of a chemical element characterized by having the same number of protons but differing numbers of neutrons.

To elaborate, each element in the periodic table is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus, a value referred to as its atomic number. For example, every carbon atom contains $6$ protons. However, atoms of the same element can possess varying numbers of neutrons, leading to the formation of isotopes. For instance, carbon-12 has $6$ neutrons, whereas carbon-14 has $8$ neutrons. Both of these are isotopes of carbon because they share the same proton count.

Isotopes can be classified as stable or unstable. Stable isotopes remain unchanged over time, while unstable isotopes, commonly known as radioactive isotopes, undergo decay and emit radiation. This radioactive property renders unstable isotopes valuable for various applications, such as carbon dating in archaeology, where carbon-14 is utilized to ascertain the age of ancient artifacts.

The existence of different isotopes influences the atomic mass of an element. The atomic mass displayed on the periodic table represents a weighted average of all naturally occurring isotopes of that element. For example, chlorine has two primary isotopes: chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. The atomic mass of chlorine is calculated as an average that accounts for the relative abundances of each isotope.

A comprehensive understanding of isotopes is vital in fields such as chemistry, physics, and environmental science. They enable scientists to trace chemical pathways, comprehend nuclear reactions, and even diagnose medical conditions through techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Thus, while isotopes are merely variations of elements, their distinctive properties make them exceedingly significant in both scientific research and practical applications.
