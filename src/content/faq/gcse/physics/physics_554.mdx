A compass serves as a tool for indicating the direction of a magnetic field by aligning its needle with the Earth's magnetic field.

At its core, a compass contains a small, lightweight magnet, typically shaped like a needle, which is freely able to rotate in a horizontal plane. This magnetized needle has a defined north and south pole. When the compass is exposed to a magnetic field, the needle experiences a torque that causes it to align with the magnetic field lines. Consequently, the north pole of the needle points toward magnetic north, while the south pole points toward magnetic south.

The Earth can be thought of as a colossal magnet, possessing a magnetic field that extends from the magnetic south pole to the magnetic north pole. When you hold a compass, the needle naturally aligns itself with this geomagnetic field. This alignment explains why the north end of the compass needle points toward geographic north, which is in proximity to the Earth's magnetic north pole.

In addition to detecting the Earth's magnetic field, a compass is capable of sensing the direction of other magnetic fields. For instance, if you bring a magnet close to a compass, the needle will orient itself according to the magnetic field of the magnet rather than the Earth's field. This characteristic makes compasses invaluable in various applications, including navigation and the detection of magnetic anomalies.

Grasping the principles behind how a compass operates enhances our understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism, a fundamental concept in physics. The alignment of the compass needle with magnetic fields serves as a practical demonstration of how magnetic forces interact with magnetic materials, providing a tangible means to visualize otherwise invisible magnetic fields.
