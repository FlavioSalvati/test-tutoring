Nuclear waste management involves a combination of containment, storage, and disposal strategies to prevent harmful impacts on human health and the environment.

Nuclear waste, often referred to as radioactive waste, is generated from various sources, including nuclear reactors, medical procedures, and research activities. It is classified into three primary categories: low-level waste, intermediate-level waste, and high-level waste. Each category necessitates distinct handling and disposal approaches.

Low-level waste comprises items such as clothing, tools, and filters that have been exposed to radiation. Typically, this type of waste is compacted and subsequently buried in shallow landfills specifically engineered to contain radiation. In contrast, intermediate-level waste includes more radioactive materials, such as reactor components and chemical sludge. This waste is often encased in concrete or bitumen prior to being stored in specially designed facilities.

High-level waste, which is the most hazardous, originates from spent nuclear fuel or the by-products of nuclear reactions. This type of waste produces significant heat and remains highly radioactive for thousands of years. To manage high-level waste, it is first cooled in water pools for several years to lower its temperature and radioactivity. Following this cooling period, it is typically transferred to dry casks made of steel and concrete for prolonged storage.

For long-term disposal, numerous countries are developing deep geological repositories. These underground facilities are situated hundreds of meters below the Earth's surface and are engineered to isolate high-level waste from the environment for thousands of years. The waste is securely placed in containers and buried within stable rock formations to mitigate any potential leakage.

In addition to these disposal methods, researchers are exploring ways to minimize the volume of nuclear waste through recycling and reprocessing spent fuel. This process involves extracting usable materials from the waste for reuse in reactors, thereby decreasing both the volume and toxicity of the remaining waste.
