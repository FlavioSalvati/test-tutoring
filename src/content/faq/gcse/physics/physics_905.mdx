For the force and extension practical, you will need the following equipment: a spring, a set of weights, a ruler, and a clamp stand.

To elaborate, the main piece of equipment required is a spring. This is the object whose extension (or stretch) you will measure as you apply various forces to it. It is important to select a spring that is neither too stiff nor too loose, as these characteristics could significantly influence your results.

Next, you will need a set of weights. These weights will generate the force that causes the spring to extend. Typically, these weights are available in increments (for example, $100 \, \text{g}$, $200 \, \text{g}$, etc.), allowing you to apply a range of forces to the spring. Remember that the force applied is calculated using the formula:

$$
F = m \cdot g
$$

where $F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass (in kilograms), and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$).

A ruler is essential for measuring the extension of the spring. You will first measure the length of the spring without any weights attached (this is known as its natural length) and then measure it again after each weight is added. The difference between these two measurements will provide you with the extension of the spring.

The clamp stand is utilized to secure the spring in place, ensuring that it hangs vertically and can stretch freely without any interference. Typically, the clamp stand includes a boss head and a clamp to support the spring at its upper end.

Additionally, you may want to attach a pointer to the bottom of the spring to facilitate easier readings on the ruler. A set square can also be beneficial to ensure that your measurements are taken at right angles to the ruler, thereby enhancing accuracy.

Finally, having a notebook or a data sheet is advisable for recording your measurements and observations. This will enable you to analyze the relationship between the force applied and the extension of the spring, often culminating in a graph that illustrates Hooke's Law in action.
