The unit of electric field strength is expressed as volts per metre ($\text{V/m}$).

Electric field strength quantifies the force that a positive test charge experiences when placed in an electric field. It indicates the intensity of the electric field at a specific location. The unit $\text{V/m}$ signifies the amount of electric potential change, measured in volts, that occurs over a distance of one metre.

To clarify this concept, letâ€™s break it down further. Voltage, or electric potential difference, is measured in volts ($\text{V}$) and represents the work required to move a charge from one point to another. When discussing electric field strength, we focus on how this voltage varies over a specified distance, which is measured in metres ($\text{m}$). Thus, the unit $\text{V/m}$ effectively conveys the change in voltage per unit distance.

Consider a charged object that generates an electric field. When a small positive test charge is introduced into this field, it will experience a force. The electric field strength at any point is defined as the force experienced per unit charge at that location. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{F}{q}
$$

where $E$ denotes the electric field strength, $F$ represents the force, and $q$ is the charge. Given that force is measured in newtons ($\text{N}$) and charge in coulombs ($\text{C}$), electric field strength can also be expressed in newtons per coulomb ($\text{N/C}$). However, the unit $\text{V/m}$ is more commonly utilized in practice.

Grasping the concept of electric field strength is essential in various fields of physics and engineering, particularly in the design of electrical equipment and in understanding the interactions of electric forces with matter.
