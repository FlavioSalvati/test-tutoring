The Oort Cloud is a distant, spherical shell of icy objects that encircles our Solar System.

This enigmatic region is named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who first proposed its existence in 1950. The Oort Cloud is believed to be an extensive, spherical area extending from approximately $2,000$ to $100,000$ astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. To provide perspective, one astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, roughly $150$ million kilometers. This immense distance places the Oort Cloud far beyond the Kuiper Belt, which is located just beyond the orbit of Neptune.

The objects within the Oort Cloud are primarily composed of ices, including water, ammonia, and methane. These icy bodies are considered remnants from the early Solar System, leftover from the formation of planets and other celestial bodies. They are thought to be the source of long-period cometsâ€”comets that take over $200$ years to complete an orbit around the Sun. When gravitational interactions disturb these comets, they can be propelled towards the inner Solar System, where they may become visible from Earth.

The Oort Cloud is divided into two distinct regions: the inner Oort Cloud, also known as the Hills Cloud, and the outer Oort Cloud. The inner Oort Cloud is more densely populated and lies closer to the Sun, while the outer Oort Cloud is more sparsely populated and extends much further outwards. Despite its vast expanse, direct observation of the Oort Cloud is extremely challenging due to the faintness and great distance of its objects.

Studying the Oort Cloud is crucial for scientists seeking to understand the history and evolution of our Solar System. It also offers valuable insights into the processes that govern the formation of comets and other small celestial bodies.
