Condensation is the process in which gas particles lose energy and transition into a liquid state.

To elaborate, condensation occurs when gas particles cool down and consequently lose kinetic energy. As the particles lose energy, their motion slows, causing them to come closer together. This decrease in movement allows the attractive forces between the particles to become more significant, leading them to bond and form a liquid.

Consider the example of water vapor in the air. When this vapor encounters a cold surface, such as a window on a chilly day, it cools down. The particles in the water vapor lose energy and slow down, which facilitates their ability to bond together and form liquid water droplets on the surface. This phenomenon explains why you often observe condensation on windows or mirrors after a hot shower.

Condensation plays a crucial role in the water cycle. When warm, moist air rises and cools in the atmosphere, the water vapor condenses to form clouds. These clouds can eventually lead to precipitation, such as rain or snow, which is essential for replenishing water sources on Earth.

In summary, condensation is fundamentally linked to the energy and movement of particles. When gas particles lose energy, they slow down and come closer together, transitioning into a liquid state. This process is vital for both everyday occurrences and natural cycles, making it an important concept in physics.
