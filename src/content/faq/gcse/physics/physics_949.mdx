To determine the total pressure at a specific depth, you need to combine the atmospheric pressure with the pressure exerted by the fluid.

When you submerge yourself underwater, the pressure you experience increases due to the weight of the water above you. This increase in pressure is in addition to the atmospheric pressure that exists at the surface. The total pressure at a particular depth can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Total Pressure} = \text{Atmospheric Pressure} + \text{Pressure due to the fluid}
$$

The pressure contributed by the fluid (for example, water) can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Pressure due to the fluid} = \rho \cdot g \cdot h
$$

where:
- $\rho$ (rho) represents the density of the fluid (measured in kilograms per cubic meter, kg/mÂ³),
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$),
- $h$ is the depth of the fluid (in meters, m).

At sea level, the atmospheric pressure is approximately $101,325 \, \text{Pa}$, which is equivalent to $101.3 \, \text{kPa}$.

For instance, consider a scenario where you dive to a depth of $10 \, \text{m}$ in a swimming pool, and the density of water is $1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3$. The pressure caused by the water at this depth can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Pressure due to water} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 10 \, \text{m} = 98,000 \, \text{Pa}
$$

Next, we can add the atmospheric pressure to find the total pressure:

$$
\text{Total Pressure} = 101,325 \, \text{Pa} + 98,000 \, \text{Pa} = 199,325 \, \text{Pa}
$$

Thus, the total pressure at a depth of $10 \, \text{m}$ would be $199,325 \, \text{Pa}$. This calculation method can be applied to any depth and any fluid, provided that you know the fluid's density and the depth involved.
