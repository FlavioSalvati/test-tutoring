To achieve rotational equilibrium, the sum of all torques acting on an object must equal zero.

In more detail, rotational equilibrium is achieved when an object experiences no net rotational motion. This condition occurs when the clockwise torques and anticlockwise torques acting on the object are perfectly balanced. Torque, also referred to as the moment of force, quantifies the rotational effect of a force applied to an object. The torque depends on two primary factors: the magnitude of the applied force and the distance from the pivot point (or axis of rotation) at which this force is exerted. Mathematically, torque ($\tau$) can be expressed as:

$$
\tau = F \times d
$$

where $F$ is the force and $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of action of the force.

For an object to maintain rotational equilibrium, the total of all clockwise torques must be equal to the total of all anticlockwise torques. This relationship can be expressed as:

$$
\sum \tau_{\text{clockwise}} = \sum \tau_{\text{anticlockwise}}
$$

Consider a seesaw with two children of different weights positioned at varying distances from the pivot. For the seesaw to remain balanced (in rotational equilibrium), the heavier child must sit closer to the pivot, while the lighter child sits farther away. This arrangement ensures that the product of the force (weight) and the distance from the pivot (torque) is equal on both sides, preventing any net rotational motion.

In practical applications, engineers and designers frequently apply the principle of rotational equilibrium to ensure that structures and mechanisms remain stable and function effectively. For instance, when designing a bridge, it is essential to balance the torques resulting from the weight of the bridge and any vehicles on it to avert tipping or collapse.

Understanding rotational equilibrium is vital across various real-world applications, from simple playground equipment to intricate machinery, helping to ensure safety and functionality in everyday life.
