Electricity generation significantly affects the environment through various channels, including greenhouse gas emissions, resource depletion, habitat destruction, and pollution.

Methods of electricity generation, particularly those involving the combustion of fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, and natural gas—release substantial quantities of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide ($\mathrm{CO_2}$) and methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$), into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, contributing to global warming and climate change. Additionally, fossil fuel power plants emit other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide ($\mathrm{SO_2}$) and nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x}$), which can lead to acid rain and respiratory issues in humans.

Nuclear power plants do not emit greenhouse gases during their operation; however, they generate radioactive waste that requires meticulous management to prevent environmental contamination. While rare, accidents at nuclear facilities can have devastating consequences for both the environment and human health, as demonstrated by the incidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima.

Renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, typically present lower environmental impacts compared to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, they are not devoid of challenges. For example, large hydroelectric dams can disrupt local ecosystems, displace communities, and adversely affect water quality. Wind turbines may pose threats to avian and bat populations, while solar farms often necessitate expansive land areas, which can lead to habitat loss.

Additionally, the extraction and processing of raw materials for energy production can have detrimental environmental effects. Activities such as coal mining, oil drilling, and natural gas extraction often result in habitat destruction, water pollution, and soil erosion. The manufacturing of renewable energy technologies also requires materials like rare earth metals, which are frequently sourced through environmentally harmful mining practices.

In conclusion, every method of electricity generation carries some environmental impact, although the degree and nature of these impacts vary considerably. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of these effects enables us to make informed decisions regarding our energy sources and strive toward more sustainable solutions.
