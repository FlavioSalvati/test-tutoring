An atom is composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons, which are the fundamental building blocks of matter.

Atoms consist of three primary types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus at the center of the atom, while electrons orbit the nucleus in regions known as electron shells or energy levels.

Protons are positively charged particles, and the number of protons in the nucleus defines the atomic number of an element, which determines the identity of the element. For instance, hydrogen has one proton, giving it an atomic number of $1$, whereas carbon has six protons, making its atomic number $6$. In contrast, neutrons carry no charge (they are neutral) and contribute to the overall mass of the atom. The number of neutrons can vary among atoms of the same element, resulting in the formation of different isotopes.

Electrons, which are negatively charged particles, are significantly smaller than protons and neutrons. They move around the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells. The arrangement of electrons within these shells is crucial, as it governs how atoms interact and form chemical bonds. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, ensuring that the overall charge is balanced.

The nucleus, which contains both protons and neutrons, is extremely dense and accounts for most of the atom's mass. Despite this density, it occupies only a tiny fraction of the atom's total volume. Conversely, electrons, although much lighter, occupy the vast majority of the atom's space, creating a cloud-like region around the nucleus.

A comprehensive understanding of atomic structure is essential in the fields of physics and chemistry, as it elucidates the properties of elements and their interactions in various chemical reactions.
