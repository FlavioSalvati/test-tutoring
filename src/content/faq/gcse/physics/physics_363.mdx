Renewable energy sources connect to the National Grid through substations, which play a vital role in transforming and distributing the electricity generated.

Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power generate electricity in various ways, yet they all require a connection to the National Grid to supply energy to homes and businesses. The electricity produced by these sources often has a different voltage than that used by the National Grid. To address this discrepancy, substations are utilized. These substations are equipped with transformers capable of either increasing (step-up) or decreasing (step-down) the voltage of the electricity to align with the grid's specifications.

For instance, wind turbines typically generate electricity at a relatively low voltage. This electricity is transmitted to a nearby substation, where a transformer elevates the voltage to a significantly higher level. High voltage is essential for long-distance transmission as it minimizes energy loss. Subsequently, the electricity travels along high-voltage transmission lines to other substations nearer to the end users.

Solar panels, which are commonly installed on rooftops or in expansive solar farms, also produce electricity at a low voltage. The electricity generated is in direct current (DC) form, which must be converted to alternating current (AC) using an inverter, as the National Grid operates on AC. After conversion, the AC electricity is sent to a substation for voltage adjustment before being integrated into the grid.

Hydroelectric power stations operate in a similar manner. Water flowing through turbines generates electricity, which is then directed to a substation. At this point, the voltage is adjusted to meet the grid's requirements before the electricity is transmitted over long distances.

In summary, substations are essential for connecting renewable energy sources to the National Grid. They transform the voltage of the electricity produced, ensuring compatibility with the grid's infrastructure. This process enables the efficient distribution of renewable energy to locations where it is most needed.
