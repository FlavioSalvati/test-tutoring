Modern telescopes measure redshift by analyzing the light spectra emitted by distant celestial objects and identifying shifts in their spectral lines.

Redshift occurs when light from an object that is moving away from us stretches, resulting in an increase in the light's wavelength and a shift towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon serves as crucial evidence for the expanding universe and aids astronomers in determining the velocity and distance of galaxies.

To measure redshift, telescopes first capture the light from distant stars or galaxies. This light is then directed through a spectrometer, an instrument that disperses the light into its constituent colors, similar to how a prism functions. The resulting spectrum reveals various lines, known as spectral lines, which correspond to specific elements and compounds present in the object.

In laboratory conditions, scientists have precise knowledge of the positions of these spectral lines for various elements. When astronomers observe distant objects, they compare the observed spectral lines to these known reference positions. A shift of the lines towards the red end of the spectrum indicates that the object is receding from us. The extent of this shift can be quantified using the redshift parameter, denoted as $z$.

The redshift parameter $z$ is calculated using the formula:

$$
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}} - \lambda_{\text{rest}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}}
$$

In this equation, $\lambda_{\text{observed}}$ represents the wavelength of the spectral line observed in the light from the distant object, while $\lambda_{\text{rest}}$ is the wavelength of the same spectral line measured in a laboratory on Earth.

By measuring redshift, astronomers can ascertain not only the speed at which an object is receding but also estimate its distance from Earth. This relationship exists because a greater redshift indicates a faster receding velocity, which correlates with a greater distance. This principle is encapsulated in Hubble's Law, which states that the velocity of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from us.
