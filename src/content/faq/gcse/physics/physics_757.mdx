Latent heat refers to the energy required for a substance to undergo a phase change without a change in temperature. 

When a substance transitions from one state to another, such as from solid to liquid (a process known as melting) or from liquid to gas (known as evaporation), energy must be supplied to disrupt the bonds between its particles. This energy is termed latent heat. There are two primary types of latent heat: the latent heat of fusion and the latent heat of vaporization. The latent heat of fusion is the energy necessary to convert a substance from solid to liquid, while the latent heat of vaporization is the energy required to change a substance from liquid to gas.

During these phase changes, the temperature of the substance remains constant, even as energy is added or removed. This phenomenon occurs because the energy is utilized to break or form intermolecular bonds, rather than increasing the kinetic energy of the particles, which would raise the temperature. For instance, when ice melts into water, it absorbs latent heat from its surroundings. However, the temperature of the ice-water mixture remains at $0^\circ C$ until all the ice has fully melted.

Similarly, when water boils and transforms into steam, it absorbs latent heat of vaporization, yet the temperature remains at $100^\circ C$ until all the water has converted into steam. This concept is particularly important in understanding various phenomena, such as why sweating cools the body. When sweat evaporates from the skin, it absorbs latent heat from the body, effectively lowering body temperature.

In conclusion, latent heat is a fundamental concept in phase transitions and plays a crucial role in numerous natural and industrial processes. Grasping this concept aids in understanding why temperature remains constant during state changes and how energy is employed throughout these transformations.
