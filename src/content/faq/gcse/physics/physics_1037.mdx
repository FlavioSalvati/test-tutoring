You can measure the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave using either a diffraction grating or an interferometer.

One common method for measuring the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave is through the use of a diffraction grating. A diffraction grating consists of numerous closely spaced slits or lines. When light or another electromagnetic wave passes through these slits, it undergoes diffraction, resulting in an interference pattern characterized by alternating bright and dark spots on a screen. By measuring the angles at which these bright spots—known as maxima—occur, you can utilize the grating equation to calculate the wavelength. The grating equation is expressed as:

$$
d \sin \theta = n \lambda
$$

In this equation, $d$ represents the distance between the slits, $\theta$ is the angle of the maxima, $n$ indicates the order of the maximum, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

Another effective method for wavelength measurement involves the use of an interferometer, such as the Michelson interferometer. This device operates by splitting a beam of light into two distinct paths, reflecting them back, and then recombining them. The recombined beams produce an interference pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes. By adjusting the position of one of the mirrors and counting the number of fringes that pass a designated reference point, you can determine the wavelength. The relationship governing this process is given by:

$$
\Delta d = \frac{m \lambda}{2}
$$

Here, $\Delta d$ denotes the change in the path length, $m$ represents the number of fringes counted, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

Both methods are based on the principle of interference, where overlapping waves reinforce or cancel each other. By meticulously measuring the resulting patterns and applying the appropriate equations, you can accurately determine the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. These techniques are extensively employed in laboratories and have applications across various fields, including physics, chemistry, and engineering.
