Unstable nuclei emit radiation as they release energy in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves to achieve stability.

Unstable nuclei, commonly referred to as radioactive nuclei, exhibit an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons. This imbalance places the nucleus in a high-energy state, leading to instability. To attain stability, the nucleus undergoes a process called radioactive decay, during which it releases excess energy. There are three primary types of radiation emitted in this process: alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays.

Alpha radiation involves the emission of alpha particles, which are composed of two protons and two neutrons. This type of radiation is relatively heavy and carries a positive charge. Alpha particles possess low penetrating power and can be stopped by a sheet of paper or even the outer layer of human skin. However, they can cause significant harm if ingested or inhaled.

Beta radiation occurs when a neutron within the nucleus transforms into a proton and an electron. The emitted electron, referred to as a beta particle, is lighter and more penetrating than alpha particles. Nonetheless, beta particles can be halted by materials such as plastic or a few millimeters of aluminum. Beta radiation has the capability to penetrate the skin and can potentially damage living tissues.

Gamma radiation comprises the emission of high-energy electromagnetic waves known as gamma rays. Unlike alpha and beta particles, gamma rays are massless and carry no charge. They are highly penetrating, capable of passing through several centimeters of lead or meters of concrete. Gamma radiation frequently accompanies alpha or beta decay, as the nucleus releases excess energy following the emission of particles.

A thorough understanding of these types of radiation enables us to analyze the behavior of radioactive materials and their applications across various fields such as medicine, industry, and energy production.
