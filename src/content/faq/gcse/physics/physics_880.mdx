Elastic potential energy refers to the energy stored in an object when work is performed to deform it.

When you stretch or compress an elastic object, such as a spring or a rubber band, you are exerting a force over a distance, which constitutes work. This work is converted into elastic potential energy, which is stored within the object. The amount of energy stored is influenced by both the extent of the deformation and the inherent properties of the material. For instance, a stiffer spring will store more energy than a less stiff spring when subjected to the same degree of deformation.

The relationship between elastic potential energy and the work done can be explained using Hooke's Law for springs. Hooke's Law states that the force required to stretch or compress a spring is directly proportional to the distance it is stretched or compressed. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
F = kx
$$

In this equation, $ F $ represents the force applied, $ k $ is the spring constant, and $ x $ is the displacement from the spring's equilibrium position. The work done on the spring, which corresponds to the elastic potential energy stored, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

This formula illustrates that the energy stored in the spring increases with the square of the displacement. Consequently, if you double the amount you stretch the spring, the elastic potential energy will increase by a factor of four. This principle explains why it requires progressively more effort to stretch a spring further and further.

Understanding elastic potential energy is crucial in various real-world applications, including the design of trampolines, car suspension systems, and sports equipment like archery bows. By analyzing how energy is stored and released, engineers can develop safer and more efficient designs.
