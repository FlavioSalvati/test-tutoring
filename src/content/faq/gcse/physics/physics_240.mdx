A magnetic field is defined as a region surrounding a magnet where magnetic forces can be detected.

Magnetic fields arise from moving electric charges, such as those found in a current-carrying wire, or from the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles, which are linked to a fundamental quantum property known as spin. The strength and direction of a magnetic field are illustrated by magnetic field lines, which represent the trajectory that a north magnetic pole would follow if it were free to move. These lines emanate from the north pole of a magnet and enter the south pole, creating closed loops.

In GCSE Physics, you will frequently encounter magnetic fields in relation to bar magnets and electromagnets. A bar magnet possesses a permanent magnetic field, while an electromagnet generates a magnetic field when an electric current flows through a coil of wire. The magnetic field surrounding a straight current-carrying wire forms concentric circles. The direction of this magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule: if you point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field.

Magnetic fields are measured in units called teslas (T) or gauss (G), with the conversion factor being $1 \text{ T} = 10,000 \text{ G}$. The Earth's magnetic field, which serves to protect us from solar radiation and aids in navigation, is relatively weak, measuring approximately $0.00005 \text{ T}$.

Comprehending magnetic fields is essential for numerous applications, including electric motors, generators, and transformers. In these devices, magnetic fields facilitate the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy and vice versa. Furthermore, magnetic fields are critical in medical technologies, such as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanners, which utilize strong magnetic fields to generate detailed images of the human body's internal structures.
