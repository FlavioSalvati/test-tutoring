To determine changes in momentum, you simply subtract the initial momentum from the final momentum of an object.

Momentum quantifies the motion of an object and is calculated by multiplying the object's mass by its velocity. The momentum ($p$) can be expressed with the formula:

$$
p = m \times v
$$

In this equation, $m$ represents the mass of the object, and $v$ denotes its velocity. Whenever an object's velocity changes, its momentum changes correspondingly. The change in momentum ($\Delta p$) can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\Delta p = p_{\text{final}} - p_{\text{initial}}
$$

In this context, $p_{\text{final}}$ refers to the momentum of the object at the end of the time interval, while $p_{\text{initial}}$ indicates the momentum at the start.

For instance, consider a car with a mass of $1000 \, \text{kg}$ that is initially traveling at $10 \, \text{m/s}$. If the car accelerates to $20 \, \text{m/s}$, we can calculate both the initial and final momentum as follows:

**Initial momentum:**
$$
p_{\text{initial}} = 1000 \, \text{kg} \times 10 \, \text{m/s} = 10,000 \, \text{kg m/s}
$$

**Final momentum:**
$$
p_{\text{final}} = 1000 \, \text{kg} \times 20 \, \text{m/s} = 20,000 \, \text{kg m/s}
$$

**Change in momentum:**
$$
\Delta p = 20,000 \, \text{kg m/s} - 10,000 \, \text{kg m/s} = 10,000 \, \text{kg m/s}
$$

Thus, the car's momentum has increased by $10,000 \, \text{kg m/s}$.

Understanding changes in momentum is essential in physics, particularly when analyzing collisions and other interactions. In a closed system, the total momentum before and after an event remains constant, a concept known as the conservation of momentum. This principle is fundamental for predicting the outcomes of collisions and various dynamic events.
