The Doppler effect in the context of light refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of light emitted from a moving source.

When a light source approaches an observer, the emitted light waves become compressed. This compression leads to an increase in frequency and a decrease in wavelength. This phenomenon is termed "blue shift," as the light shifts towards the blue end of the spectrum. Conversely, when the light source moves away from the observer, the light waves are stretched, resulting in a decrease in frequency and an increase in wavelength. This effect is known as "red shift," as the light shifts towards the red end of the spectrum.

To illustrate this concept, imagine standing by a road as a car with its horn sounding drives past you. As the car approaches, the sound waves are compressed, causing the horn to sound higher in pitch. As the car moves away, the sound waves are stretched, making the horn sound lower in pitch. This same principle applies to light waves; however, instead of experiencing a change in pitch, we observe a change in color.

The Doppler effect is particularly significant in astronomy. By analyzing the light from distant stars and galaxies, scientists can ascertain whether these celestial objects are moving towards or away from us. For example, if the light from a galaxy exhibits red shift, it indicates that the galaxy is receding from us, providing evidence for the theory that the universe is expanding.

Furthermore, this effect is instrumental in measuring the velocities of stars and galaxies. By quantifying the extent of red or blue shift, astronomers can determine the speed at which these objects are moving relative to Earth. This information is crucial for understanding the dynamics of our universe, including the behavior of stars, the movement of galaxies, and the discovery of exoplanets.
