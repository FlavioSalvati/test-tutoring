To accurately measure temperature changes within a system, you can utilize various instruments, including thermometers and temperature sensors.

There are several types of thermometers available, each suited for different applications. For instance, liquid-in-glass thermometers contain a liquid—commonly mercury or alcohol—that expands and contracts in response to temperature variations. To determine the temperature, you simply observe the liquid's level against a calibrated scale.

Digital thermometers, on the other hand, employ electronic sensors to measure temperature. These sensors, typically made from materials such as thermistors or resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), alter their electrical resistance as temperature changes. The internal circuitry of the thermometer converts this resistance variation into a numerical temperature reading, which is then displayed on a digital screen.

Thermocouples represent another category of temperature sensors, widely used in scientific and industrial contexts. A thermocouple consists of two distinct metals joined at one end. When the junction of these two metals experiences a change in temperature, it generates a voltage that can be measured and translated into a temperature reading.

When measuring temperature changes, it is crucial to ensure that the thermometer or sensor is in proper contact with the system being analyzed. For example, if you are measuring the temperature of a liquid, ensure that the thermometer is fully submerged. Conversely, when measuring the temperature of a solid object, make certain that the sensor is securely attached to the surface.

Furthermore, be mindful of the response time associated with your thermometer or sensor. Some devices, such as digital thermometers, can provide readings almost instantaneously, while others, like liquid-in-glass thermometers, may require a few moments to stabilize. Always allow sufficient time for the reading to settle before recording the temperature to ensure accuracy.
