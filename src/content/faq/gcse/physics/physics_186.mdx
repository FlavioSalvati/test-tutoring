Atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude due to the diminishing amount of air above exerting downward pressure.

Atmospheric pressure can be defined as the force produced by the weight of air in the Earth's atmosphere. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is at its maximum because there is a substantial column of air above pushing down. As one ascends to higher altitudes—such as when climbing a mountain or flying in an airplane—the amount of air above decreases. This reduction in air results in less weight pressing down, which leads to a decrease in atmospheric pressure.

The relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure is nonlinear; it changes more rapidly at lower altitudes and more gradually at higher altitudes. For instance, the pressure drops significantly as one ascends from sea level to a few thousand meters, but the rate of decrease slows as the altitude continues to increase. This phenomenon occurs because the density of air also diminishes with altitude, resulting in fewer air molecules in a given volume to exert pressure.

To illustrate the scale of this change, at sea level, the atmospheric pressure is approximately $1013 \, \text{mb}$ (millibars). At an altitude of $5,500 \, \text{m}$, which is around the height of Mount Everest's base camp, the pressure decreases to about $500 \, \text{mb}$—roughly half of the pressure at sea level. At the summit of Mount Everest, approximately $8,848 \, \text{m}$ high, the atmospheric pressure falls to about $300 \, \text{mb}$, which is less than a third of the pressure at sea level.

Understanding how atmospheric pressure varies with altitude is essential for several applications, including weather forecasting, aviation, and human physiology. For example, pilots must adjust cabin pressure in airplanes to ensure the comfort and safety of passengers, as low atmospheric pressure can lead to altitude sickness due to lower oxygen levels.
