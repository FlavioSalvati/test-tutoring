To calculate the work done against friction, you can simply multiply the frictional force by the distance moved in the direction of that force.

In detail, the work done against friction represents the energy required to move an object across a surface while overcoming the opposing frictional force. The formula to compute this is given by:

$$ \text{Work done} = \text{Frictional force} \times \text{Distance} $$

Let's break this process down into clear steps:

1. **Identify the Frictional Force**: The frictional force is the force that resists the motion of an object. It can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ \text{Frictional force} = \mu \times \text{Normal force} $$

In this equation, $ \mu $ (mu) represents the coefficient of friction, and the normal force is the force that acts perpendicular to the surfaces in contact. Typically, on a horizontal surface, the normal force is equal to the weight of the object.

2. **Measure the Distance**: This refers to the distance over which the object moves while the frictional force is acting. It is important that this distance is measured in the same direction as the frictional force.

3. **Multiply the Two Values**: After determining both the frictional force and the distance, simply multiply these two values to find the work done against friction.

For example, if you have a box with a frictional force of $10 \, \text{N}$ (Newtons) and you push it $5 \, \text{m}$ across the floor, the work done against friction can be calculated as follows:

$$ \text{Work done} = 10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{J} $$

This result indicates that $50 \, \text{J}$ (Joules) of energy is expended to overcome the frictional force. Remember, work done is measured in Joules (J) according to the International System of Units (SI). Understanding this concept is essential for analyzing energy transfers and efficiency in physical systems.
