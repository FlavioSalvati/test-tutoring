The formula for calculating pressure exerted by a column of liquid is given by:

$$
P = h \rho g
$$

In this equation:

- $ P $ denotes the pressure exerted by the liquid column,
- $ h $ represents the height of the liquid column,
- $ \rho $ (rho) signifies the density of the liquid, and
- $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity.

This relationship illustrates that pressure increases with both the height of the liquid column and the density of the liquid.

To further elucidate each component:

- The height $ h $ refers to the vertical distance from the bottom to the top of the liquid column.
- The density $ \rho $ quantifies how much mass is contained within a specific volume of the liquid. For example, the density of water is approximately $1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3$.
- The acceleration due to gravity $ g $ is a constant on Earth, approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$.

When these three factors are multiplied together, the result is the pressure exerted at the bottom of the liquid column. This pressure arises from the weight of the liquid above that point. For instance, if you have a column of water that is $10 \, \text{m}$ tall, you can calculate the pressure at the bottom using the following formula:

$$
P = 10 \, \text{m} \times 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 98,000 \, \text{Pa}
$$

This means the pressure at the bottom of a $10 \, \text{m}$ column of water is $98,000 \, \text{Pascals (Pa)}$.

This formula is particularly valuable in various practical applications, such as determining the pressure at different depths in a swimming pool or understanding the functioning of barometers in measuring atmospheric pressure. It helps explain why deeper water exerts greater pressure and underscores the importance of caution for divers as they descend into greater depths underwater.
