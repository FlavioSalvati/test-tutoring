To calculate speed using a distance-time graph, you need to determine the gradient (or slope) of the graph.

In a distance-time graph, the distance traveled is represented on the y-axis, while the time taken is plotted on the x-axis. The speed of an object is defined as the rate at which it covers distance over a specific period. Mathematically, speed can be expressed with the formula:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
$$

On a distance-time graph, this concept translates to calculating the gradient of the line. The gradient is found by dividing the change in distance (the y-axis) by the change in time (the x-axis).

To compute the gradient, select two points on the line, which we will denote as $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $. The gradient $ m $ can then be calculated using the formula:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

In this context, $ y_2 - y_1 $ represents the change in distance, while $ x_2 - x_1 $ reflects the change in time. Consequently, the gradient of the line provides the speed of the object.

If the graph is a straight line, this indicates that the speed is constant, meaning the gradient between any two points on the line will be the same. However, if the graph is curved, the speed is varying. In such cases, you must calculate the gradient of the tangent to the curve at the specific point of interest to obtain the instantaneous speed.

It's important to note that the steeper the gradient, the faster the object is moving. Conversely, a horizontal line signifies that the object is stationary, as there is no change in distance over time.
