The mass number of an atom is defined as the total count of protons and neutrons within its nucleus.

To elaborate, the mass number is a fundamental concept in the study of atomic structure. Atoms are composed of three primary subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus at the center of the atom, while electrons orbit the nucleus in various energy levels. The mass number, sometimes called the nucleon number, represents the sum of the protons and neutrons found in the nucleus.

For instance, if an atom contains $6$ protons and $6$ neutrons, its mass number would be $12$. This is calculated as $6 \, \text{(protons)} + 6 \, \text{(neutrons)} = 12$. It is important to highlight that the mass number does not account for electrons, as their mass is negligible when compared to that of protons and neutrons.

The mass number should not be confused with the atomic number, which indicates the number of protons in the nucleus and determines the identity of the element. For example, carbon is characterized by an atomic number of $6$, reflecting its $6$ protons. However, the number of neutrons can vary, resulting in different isotopes of the same element. For example, Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon, with mass numbers of $12$ and $14$, respectively, due to their differing neutron counts.

Grasping the concept of mass number is crucial for calculating the relative atomic mass of elements and for balancing nuclear equations. Additionally, it plays a significant role in identifying isotopes and understanding their properties, which is vital in various fields such as chemistry, physics, and medicine.
