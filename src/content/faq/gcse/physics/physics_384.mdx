To calculate the specific heat capacity, you can use the formula:

$$
c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T}
$$

Specific heat capacity quantifies the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of $1$ kilogram of a substance by $1$ degree Celsius. The formula $$ c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T} $$ allows us to determine this value. In this equation, $c$ represents the specific heat capacity, $Q$ is the amount of heat energy supplied (measured in joules), $m$ is the mass of the substance (in kilograms), and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature (in degrees Celsius).

To apply this formula, you should first measure the heat energy added to the substance. This can be accomplished using a calorimeter or by calculating the power of a heater along with the duration it was in operation. Next, measure the mass of the substance you are heating. Finally, record the initial and final temperatures to calculate the temperature change, $\Delta T$.

For example, if you supply $5000$ joules of energy to $2$ kilograms of water and observe an increase in temperature of $5$ degrees Celsius, you can substitute these values into the formula:

$$
c = \frac{5000}{2 \times 5}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
c = \frac{5000}{10} = 500 \, \text{J/kgÂ°C}
$$

Thus, in this example, the specific heat capacity of water is $500$ joules per kilogram per degree Celsius.

Understanding specific heat capacity is essential for various practical applications, including the design of heating systems, cooking processes, and even climate science. Different materials possess distinct specific heat capacities, which explains why some substances heat up or cool down more quickly than others. For instance, metals typically have lower specific heat capacities compared to water, indicating that they require less energy to change their temperature.
