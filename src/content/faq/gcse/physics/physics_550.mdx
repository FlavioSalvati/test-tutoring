Objects absorb infrared radiation by converting the energy of this radiation into thermal energy, which results in an increase in their temperature.

Infrared radiation is a type of electromagnetic wave, akin to visible light but characterized by longer wavelengths. When infrared radiation strikes an object, its energy is absorbed by the molecules and atoms within that object. This absorption leads to increased vibrational activity of the particles, which we perceive as a rise in temperature. In essence, the energy from infrared radiation is transformed into thermal energy.

Different materials exhibit varying degrees of absorption of infrared radiation. Dark, matte surfaces are particularly effective at absorbing this type of radiation because they reflect very little of it. Conversely, light-colored or shiny surfaces tend to reflect more infrared radiation, resulting in lower absorption. This is why wearing dark clothing on a sunny day makes you feel warmer compared to wearing light-colored attire.

The capacity of a material to absorb infrared radiation also relies on its specific properties. For example, metals are generally excellent reflectors of infrared radiation, whereas materials such as water and glass are more adept at absorbing it. This characteristic explains why thermal imaging cameras can detect infrared radiation through some materials but not others.

In practical applications, understanding the absorption characteristics of different materials with respect to infrared radiation is vital. For instance, in building design, selecting materials that absorb less infrared radiation can help maintain cooler indoor environments. Similarly, infrared sensors, which are commonly used in remote controls and thermal cameras, operate based on the principles of infrared absorption and emission.

By comprehending how objects absorb infrared radiation, we can more effectively manage heat across various scenarios, ranging from everyday clothing choices to sophisticated technological applications.
