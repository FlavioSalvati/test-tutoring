Energy changes in a pendulum occur through the conversion between gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy.

When a pendulum is lifted to one side, it gains gravitational potential energy as it is raised against the force of gravity. This potential energy reaches its maximum value when the pendulum is at its highest point. As the pendulum is released and begins to swing downward, this gravitational potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.

At the lowest point of its swing, the pendulum's gravitational potential energy is at its minimum, while its kinetic energy is at its maximum. This is because the pendulum is moving at its fastest speed at this position. As the pendulum continues its motion and swings upward to the opposite side, the kinetic energy is converted back into gravitational potential energy. The pendulum slows down as it ascends, eventually reaching its highest point again, where its kinetic energy is at its minimum and gravitational potential energy is at its maximum once more.

This cycle of energy conversion continues as the pendulum swings back and forth. In an ideal scenario with no air resistance or friction, the pendulum would oscillate indefinitely, with energy perfectly transitioning between kinetic and potential forms. However, in real-world situations, some energy is lost to air resistance and friction at the pivot point, leading to the eventual cessation of the pendulum's motion.

Understanding these energy changes in a pendulum illustrates the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This principle is fundamental in physics and helps explain the behavior of various systems beyond just pendulums.
