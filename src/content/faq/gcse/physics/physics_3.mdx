Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is defined as the energy that an object possesses due to its position within a gravitational field. The calculation of GPE is governed by the formula:

$$
\text{GPE} = mgh
$$

where:
- $m$ represents the mass of the object (in kilograms, kg),
- $g$ denotes the gravitational field strength (typically $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$ on the surface of the Earth),
- $h$ is the height of the object above a reference point, usually measured in meters (m).

To compute the GPE, you need to know these three essential variables: the mass of the object, the gravitational field strength, and the height above the reference point.

In practical terms, if you have a book with a mass of $2 \, \text{kg}$ placed on a shelf that is $3 \, \text{m}$ high, you can determine its gravitational potential energy by substituting the values into the formula as follows:

$$
\text{GPE} = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 3 \, \text{m}
$$

Calculating this gives a GPE of $58.8 \, \text{J}$ (joules).

Understanding gravitational potential energy is crucial as it explains how energy is stored and transferred in gravitational systems. For example, when an object falls, its GPE diminishes while its kinetic energy increases, illustrating the principle of conservation of energy. This fundamental concept in physics is essential for analyzing a wide range of real-world scenarios, from the dynamics of roller coasters to the orbits of celestial bodies.
