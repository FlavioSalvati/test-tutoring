In a parallel circuit, the potential difference across each component remains constant and is equal to the voltage of the power supply.

In a parallel configuration, each component is connected directly to the power source, meaning that the voltage (or potential difference) across each component matches the voltage provided by the power supply. This characteristic distinguishes parallel circuits from series circuits, where the potential difference is shared among the components.

Consider a parallel circuit that includes a battery and three resistors. If the battery supplies a voltage of $9$ volts, then each resistor will experience a potential difference of $9$ volts across it, irrespective of their individual resistances. This occurs because each path within a parallel circuit operates independently, and the voltage drop across each path must equal the total voltage supplied by the battery.

This property of parallel circuits is highly beneficial in practical applications. For instance, in residential wiring, electrical devices are typically connected in parallel. This arrangement guarantees that each device receives the full voltage of the mains supply, enabling them to function correctly. If you were to plug a lamp and a toaster into the same outlet, both would receive the same voltage, ensuring their proper operation.

Moreover, if one component in a parallel circuit fails or is disconnected, the remaining components will continue to receive the same potential difference and operate normally. This explains why, when one light bulb in your home burns out, the other bulbs remain illuminated.

Understanding the behavior of potential difference in parallel circuits is essential for analyzing and designing electrical systems, as it ensures that each component operates effectively and safely.
