In a parallel circuit, the total current is equal to the sum of the currents flowing through each individual branch.

In this type of circuit, each component is connected across the same two points, which creates multiple pathways for the current to travel. Consequently, the voltage across each component remains constant. When additional branches are added to a parallel circuit, the total current supplied by the power source increases, as there are more available routes for current flow.

To illustrate this concept, consider a parallel circuit that contains three resistors. Here, the current from the power source divides at a junction where the circuit branches out. Each branch carries its own current, which is determined by the resistance of the component within that branch. According to Ohm's Law, expressed as $I = \frac{V}{R}$, if the resistance $R$ is lower, the current $I$ will be higher, and vice versa.

The total current in the circuit is calculated by summing the currents through each branch. For instance, if the current through the first branch is $2$ amps, the second branch $3$ amps, and the third branch $1$ amp, the total current supplied by the power source can be computed as follows:

$$
\text{Total current} = 2 \, \text{amps} + 3 \, \text{amps} + 1 \, \text{amp} = 6 \, \text{amps}.
$$

This behavior contrasts with that of a series circuit, where the current remains constant throughout all components. In a parallel circuit, each branch functions independently; therefore, a failure in one branch—such as a broken wire or a burned-out bulb—does not disrupt the operation of the other branches. This characteristic makes parallel circuits particularly advantageous in household wiring; if one light bulb burns out, the others continue to operate normally.

Understanding the behavior of current in parallel circuits is essential for the design and troubleshooting of electrical systems, ensuring their safe and efficient operation.
