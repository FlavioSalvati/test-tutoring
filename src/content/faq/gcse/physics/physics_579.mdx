To calculate the turns ratio of a transformer, you need to divide the number of turns in the primary winding by the number of turns in the secondary winding.

A transformer is an electrical device that transfers energy between two or more circuits through the principle of electromagnetic induction. The turns ratio is a fundamental characteristic of a transformer, as it dictates how voltage and current are converted between the primary and secondary coils. The primary coil serves as the input side, where the initial voltage is applied, while the secondary coil functions as the output side, delivering the transformed voltage.

The turns ratio, denoted as $n$, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ 
n = \frac{N_p}{N_s} 
$$

Here, $N_p$ represents the number of turns in the primary coil, and $N_s$ represents the number of turns in the secondary coil.

For instance, if a transformer has $100$ turns in the primary coil and $50$ turns in the secondary coil, the turns ratio would be:

$$ 
n = \frac{100}{50} = 2 
$$

This indicates that the primary coil contains twice as many turns as the secondary coil. The turns ratio has a direct impact on the voltage ratio between the primary and secondary coils. If you know the primary voltage, denoted as $V_p$, you can determine the secondary voltage, $V_s$, using the formula:

$$ 
\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} 
$$

For example, if the primary voltage is $240\,V$ and the turns ratio is $2$, the secondary voltage can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
V_s = \frac{V_p}{n} = \frac{240\,V}{2} = 120\,V 
$$

Understanding the turns ratio is essential for designing transformers tailored to specific applications. It ensures that the correct voltage levels are achieved, providing safe and efficient operation of electrical devices.
