Instantaneous speed refers to the speed of an object at a specific moment in time.

To elaborate, instantaneous speed can be likened to the reading displayed on a speedometer at any particular instant. In contrast to average speed, which is calculated over an interval of time, instantaneous speed concentrates on a single point in time. For instance, if you are driving and you glance at your speedometer, the value you see represents your instantaneous speed.

To clarify this concept, consider running a 100-meter race. Your average speed is determined by dividing the total distance ($100$ meters) by the total time taken to complete that distance. Conversely, your instantaneous speed will fluctuate throughout the race. At the beginning, your speed may be relatively low as you accelerate, whereas it may peak in the middle of the race when you are running at your maximum velocity.

In the realm of physics, we frequently utilize graphs to analyze motion. When plotting a distance-time graph, the slope (or gradient) of the tangent line at any point on the curve indicates the instantaneous speed at that point. This is because the slope of the tangent line signifies the rate of change of distance with respect to time, which is fundamentally what speed represents.

From a mathematical perspective, if you have a function that describes the position of an object over time, the derivative of this function with respect to time gives you the instantaneous speed. While this is a more advanced concept that you may encounter later in your studies, it is valuable to understand that there exists a mathematical method for determining instantaneous speed.

In summary, instantaneous speed provides a snapshot of an object's velocity at any given moment and can change from one moment to the next. Grasping this concept is essential for accurately analyzing motion in the real world.
