You can effectively demonstrate the magnetic field generated by an electric current using a straightforward setup involving a wire and a compass.

When an electric current flows through a wire, it produces a magnetic field around it. This phenomenon can be easily illustrated with a few basic materials: a straight piece of wire, a power source (such as a battery), and a small compass.

First, connect the wire to the battery to allow current to flow through it. Position the compass near the wire. You will observe that the compass needle, which typically points toward the Earth's magnetic north, deflects. This deflection occurs because the magnetic field created by the electric current in the wire interacts with the magnetic field of the compass needle.

To delve deeper into this experiment, you can alter the direction of the current by reversing the connections to the battery. Upon doing so, you will notice that the compass needle deflects in the opposite direction. This observation illustrates that the direction of the magnetic field is dependent on the direction of the current.

For a more visual demonstration, consider sprinkling iron filings around the wire. When the current flows through the wire, the iron filings will align themselves along the magnetic field lines, forming concentric circles around the wire. This pattern clearly reveals the shape of the magnetic field generated by the electric current.

Furthermore, you can apply the right-hand rule to predict the direction of the magnetic field. If you point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines surrounding the wire.

These simple experiments effectively illustrate the relationship between electricity and magnetism, a fundamental concept in physics known as electromagnetism.
