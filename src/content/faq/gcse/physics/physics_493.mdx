The upthrust, or buoyant force, acting on an object submerged in a fluid, is calculated using the following formula:

$$ \text{Upthrust} = \text{Weight of fluid displaced} $$

When an object is immersed in a fluid—such as water or air—it experiences an upward force known as upthrust or buoyant force. This force is responsible for making objects feel lighter when they are in water and explains why some objects float. The underlying principle, known as Archimedes' Principle, states that the upthrust on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces.

To determine the upthrust, you must first calculate the volume of the object that is submerged in the fluid. This is because the volume of the fluid displaced is equivalent to the volume of the submerged portion of the object. Once you have the submerged volume, you can find the mass of the displaced fluid by multiplying this volume by the density of the fluid. The formula for this calculation is:

$$ \text{Mass of displaced fluid} = \text{Volume of submerged object} \times \text{Density of fluid} $$

Next, to find the weight of the displaced fluid, you multiply the mass of the displaced fluid by the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$. The formula for this is:

$$ \text{Weight of displaced fluid} = \text{Mass of displaced fluid} \times g $$

where $g$ denotes the acceleration due to gravity. This weight of the displaced fluid corresponds to the upthrust acting on the object.

For instance, consider a block of wood with a submerged volume of $0.002 \, \text{m}^3$ in water, which has a density of $1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3$. To find the mass of the displaced water, you would calculate:

$$ 0.002 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 = 2 \, \text{kg} $$

Subsequently, the weight of the displaced water (and, thus, the upthrust) can be calculated as follows:

$$ 2 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 19.6 \, \text{N} $$

Therefore, the upthrust acting on the block of wood is $19.6 \, \text{N}$.
