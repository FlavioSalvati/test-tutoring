John Dalton's atomic model proposed that matter is composed of small, indivisible particles known as atoms.

Dalton, an English chemist and physicist, introduced his atomic theory in the early 19th century. His model was revolutionary for its time and laid the groundwork for modern chemistry. Dalton asserted that all matter consists of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms, which cannot be created or destroyed. He proposed that atoms of a particular element are identical in mass and properties, while atoms of different elements possess distinct masses and properties.

Furthermore, Dalton's atomic model suggested that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of these atoms. He theorized that compounds form when atoms of different elements combine in fixed, simple whole-number ratios. For instance, water, represented as $H_2O$, is produced when two hydrogen atoms combine with one oxygen atom. This concept contributed to the law of definite proportions, which states that a chemical compound consistently contains the same elements in the same proportions by mass.

Dalton's model was grounded in experimental evidence and observations, including the behavior of gases and the laws governing chemical combinations. Although his model was later refined and expanded by subsequent scientists, it represented a pivotal advancement in the development of atomic theory. Dalton's work provided a systematic framework for understanding the composition and behavior of matter, thereby paving the way for future discoveries in both chemistry and physics.
