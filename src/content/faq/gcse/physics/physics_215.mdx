The formula for frequency is given by:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

where $f$ represents the frequency and $T$ denotes the period.

In the realm of physics, frequency refers to the number of complete cycles or oscillations of a wave that occur in one second. It is measured in hertz (Hz), with one hertz defined as one cycle per second. The period $T$ is the duration required for one complete cycle of the wave, measured in seconds. The relationship between frequency and period is inversely proportional; this means that when the period increases, the frequency decreases, and vice versa.

To compute the frequency, one simply takes the reciprocal of the period. For instance, if the period of a wave is $0.5$ seconds, the frequency can be calculated as follows:

$$
f = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \text{ Hz}
$$

This indicates that two complete cycles of the wave occur every second.

Understanding frequency is essential in various fields of physics, including sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and alternating current (AC) electricity. For example, the pitch of a sound is determined by its frequency: higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds, while lower frequencies result in lower-pitched sounds. Similarly, different colors of light correspond to distinct frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

In practical applications, knowledge of a wave's frequency is crucial for designing and analyzing systems such as radios, televisions, and other communication devices. It also plays a significant role in medical technologies, such as ultrasound imaging, where various frequencies are utilized to create images of the body's interior.

By mastering the concept of frequency and its calculation, you can enhance your understanding of and ability to predict the behavior of various physical systems and phenomena.
