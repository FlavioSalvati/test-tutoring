In laboratory settings, a balance and either a graduated cylinder or a density bottle are commonly employed to measure density.

To determine the density of a substance, you must first measure both its mass and its volume. A balance is utilized for mass measurement. There are various types of balances, including digital balances, which offer precise measurements, and triple beam balances, which are manual but still provide accurate results. For most GCSE Physics experiments, a digital balance is often preferred due to its user-friendly nature and high accuracy.

The method for measuring volume depends on whether the substance is a solid or a liquid. For liquids, a graduated cylinder is the standard tool. Graduated cylinders are marked with a scale that allows for accurate volume measurements. To use one, simply pour the liquid into the cylinder and read the volume at the bottom of the meniscus, which is the curved surface of the liquid.

For irregularly shaped solids, the water displacement method can be applied using a graduated cylinder. Begin by filling the cylinder with a known volume of water and record this initial volume. Next, carefully submerge the solid object into the water and note the new volume. The difference between the initial and final volumes will provide the volume of the solid.

An alternative tool for measuring the density of liquids is the density bottle, also known as a pycnometer. This specialized flask has a precise volume. To use it, fill the bottle with the liquid, weigh it, and then use the known volume to compute the density.

By employing these instruments, you can accurately measure the mass and volume of a substance, allowing you to calculate its density using the formula:

$$
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}.
$$

This method is essential in many scientific experiments and enhances your understanding of the properties of various materials.
