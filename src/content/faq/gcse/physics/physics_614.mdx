The latent heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a substance from a liquid to a gas without altering its temperature.

When a liquid is converted into a gas, energy is needed to break the bonds between its molecules. This energy is referred to as the latent heat of vaporization. Even though the temperature of the substance remains constant during this process, a substantial amount of energy is absorbed. For example, boiling water remains at $100^\circ C$ until it has completely converted into steam.

Understanding the concept of latent heat is essential for grasping phase changes. When you heat a liquid, its temperature increases until it reaches its boiling point. At this stage, any additional energy supplied goes into changing the state of the liquid to gas, rather than raising its temperature further. This energy is utilized to overcome the intermolecular forces that keep the liquid molecules together.

Different substances possess varying latent heats of vaporization. For instance, water has a relatively high latent heat of vaporization, which explains why sweating is an effective mechanism for cooling the human body. The energy required to evaporate sweat from our skin removes a significant amount of heat, thereby helping to lower our body temperature.

In GCSE Physics, a solid understanding of the latent heat of vaporization is vital for analyzing various phenomena, such as why steam burns are more severe than burns from boiling water. Steam contains more energy because of the latent heat absorbed during vaporization, which it releases upon condensing on the skin.

To calculate the energy required for a phase change, you can use the formula 

$$
Q = mL
$$ 

where $Q$ represents the heat energy, $m$ is the mass of the substance, and $L$ is the specific latent heat of vaporization. This formula allows you to quantify the energy involved in converting a liquid to a gas, which is essential for solving related problems in your examinations.
