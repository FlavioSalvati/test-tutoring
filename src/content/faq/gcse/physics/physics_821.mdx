The half-life of a radioactive substance is defined as the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay.

In greater detail, the concept of half-life is fundamental to understanding radioactive decay, a stochastic process in which unstable atomic nuclei release energy by emitting radiation. The half-life is a characteristic constant for each isotope and remains unchanged regardless of the initial quantity of the substance. For instance, if you begin with $100$ grams of a radioactive isotope that has a half-life of $10$ years, after $10$ years, only $50$ grams will remain. After another $10$ years, the amount will further decrease to $25$ grams, and this pattern continues.

The significance of half-life spans various disciplines, including archaeology, medicine, and nuclear physics. In archaeology, carbon-14 dating utilizes the half-life of carbon-14 to estimate the age of ancient artifacts. In the field of medicine, radioactive isotopes with well-defined half-lives are employed in diagnostic imaging and cancer treatment. A solid understanding of half-life enables scientists and medical professionals to predict the duration for which a radioactive substance remains active, as well as its behavior over time.

The mathematical expression for half-life can be represented by the formula:

$$ 
N(t) = N_0 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}} 
$$ 

In this equation, $ N(t) $ denotes the remaining quantity of the substance at time $ t $, $ N_0 $ signifies the initial quantity, and $ T_{1/2} $ represents the half-life. This formula is instrumental in calculating the amount of radioactive substance that remains at any specified time.

Moreover, understanding half-life is essential for managing radioactive waste and ensuring safety in environments that utilize radioactive materials. By knowing the half-life, we can accurately forecast the time required for the radioactivity to diminish to safe levels.
