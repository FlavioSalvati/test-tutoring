A practical experiment designed to measure the specific heat capacity of a substance involves heating the material and recording the changes in temperature and energy input.

In this experiment, you will need several items: a solid material (like a metal block), an electric heater, a thermometer, a power supply, a stopwatch, and a balance to measure the mass of the block. Begin by weighing the metal block with the balance to determine its mass ($m$). Next, insert the electric heater into the block and connect it to the power supply. To accurately monitor the temperature, place the thermometer in a small hole within the block.

Before activating the heater, record the initial temperature of the block ($T_{\text{initial}}$). At this point, switch on the power supply and start the stopwatch simultaneously. The heater will transfer energy to the block, resulting in an increase in its temperature. Keep the heater running for a predetermined duration, such as $10$ minutes, and record the temperature at regular intervals.

To calculate the specific heat capacity ($c$) of the material, you need three key pieces of information: the energy supplied ($E$), the mass of the block ($m$), and the temperature change ($\Delta T$). The energy supplied by the heater can be calculated using the formula:

$$
E = P \times t
$$

where $P$ represents the power of the heater (in watts) and $t$ is the time (in seconds) that the heater was operational.

Once you have collected all the necessary data, you can determine the specific heat capacity using the formula:

$$
c = \frac{E}{m \times \Delta T}
$$

This practical experiment enhances your understanding of how different materials require varying amounts of energy to change their temperature, a fundamental principle in thermal physics.
