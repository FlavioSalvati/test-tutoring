To create a force-extension graph, you need to measure the force applied to a spring and the corresponding extension it undergoes, then plot these values on a graph.

### Materials Needed
Begin by gathering the necessary materials: a spring or elastic material, a set of weights, a ruler, and a force meter. Secure the spring vertically and ensure that it is at its natural length, with no weights attached. This position serves as your starting point, which represents zero extension.

### Data Collection
Next, gradually add weights to the spring, one at a time. After each weight is added, measure the extension of the spring using the ruler. The extension can be calculated as the difference between the spring's new length and its original length. Record the force applied (which corresponds to the weight in newtons, $N$) along with the measured extension in a table.

### Plotting the Graph
Once you have collected all your data, you can begin plotting the graph. On graph paper or using graphing software, label the horizontal axis (x-axis) as 'Extension (m)' and the vertical axis (y-axis) as 'Force (N)'. For each pair of force and extension values, plot a point on the graph.

### Analyzing the Data
After plotting all the points, draw a line of best fit through them. If the spring is obeying Hooke's Law, this line should be straight, indicating a linear relationship between force and extension. The slope of this line represents the spring constant, which quantifies the stiffness of the spring.

### Final Considerations
Be sure to examine your graph for any anomalies or outliers, as these may suggest measurement errors or that the spring has exceeded its elastic limit. This process is essential for understanding the relationship between force and extension, a fundamental concept in GCSE Physics.
