Static charge can be detected using various methods, including an electroscope, a balloon, or by observing the movement of small objects.

An **electroscope** is a specialized device designed to detect static charge. It consists of a metal rod connected to two thin metal leaves, all enclosed within a glass container. When a charged object is brought near the metal rod, the leaves repel each other due to the like charges that spread throughout them. The extent of the separation between the leaves indicates both the presence and the magnitude of the static charge.

Another straightforward method for detecting static charge involves using a **balloon**. By rubbing a balloon against your hair or a wool cloth, you transfer electrons to the balloon, giving it a static charge. When you then bring the charged balloon close to small pieces of paper or to your hair, you will notice the paper pieces being attracted to the balloon or your hair standing on end. This attraction occurs because the static charge on the balloon induces an opposite charge in the paper or hair, resulting in a force that draws them together.

You can also detect static charge by observing the movement of small, lightweight objects. For instance, if you rub a plastic comb on a wool cloth and subsequently bring it near small bits of paper, you will see the paper bits jump towards the comb. This phenomenon occurs because the comb acquires a charge and creates an electric field that polarizes the paper bits, causing them to be attracted to the comb.

These methods are simple yet effective ways to detect static charge, making them ideal for experiments and demonstrations in a GCSE Physics classroom.
