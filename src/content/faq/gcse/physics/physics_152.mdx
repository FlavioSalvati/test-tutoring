Work done by a force is defined as the energy transferred when a force acts on an object and moves it over a distance.

In the realm of physics, work represents a quantifiable measure of energy transfer that occurs when an object is displaced by an applied force. The total amount of work performed is dependent on three crucial factors: the magnitude of the force, the distance through which the force is applied, and the angle between the force and the direction of movement. The mathematical expression for work done, denoted as $W$, can be represented by the formula:

$$ 
W = F \times d \times \cos(\theta) 
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the magnitude of the applied force, $d$ denotes the distance moved by the object, and $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement. When the force is applied in the exact direction of the movement, $\theta$ equals $0$ degrees, leading to $\cos(0) = 1$. This simplifies the formula to:

$$ 
W = F \times d 
$$

For example, if you push a box with a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ over a distance of $5 \, \text{m}$ in the direction of the applied force, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
W = 10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{J} 
$$

In this context, the unit of work is the joule (J), which is defined as one newton-meter (NÂ·m).

It is important to understand that if the force is applied perpendicular to the direction of movement, no work is accomplished, as this results in $\cos(90^\circ) = 0$. For instance, when you carry a heavy bag while walking horizontally, the vertical force exerted to hold the bag does not contribute to work done in the horizontal direction.

Grasping the concept of work done by a force is essential for analyzing a variety of physical situations, including lifting objects, moving vehicles, and the operation of machines. This fundamental concept connects force, energy, and motion, providing a clearer understanding of how energy is transferred and utilized across different scenarios.
