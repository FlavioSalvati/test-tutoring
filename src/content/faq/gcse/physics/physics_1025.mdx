Wave speed is determined by the product of the wave's frequency and its wavelength.

More specifically, the wave speed $ v $ can be calculated using the equation:

$$
v = f \times \lambda
$$

In this formula, $ f $ denotes the frequency of the wave, while $ \lambda $ (lambda) represents the wavelength. Frequency is defined as the number of waves that pass a given point in one second, and it is measured in hertz (Hz). Wavelength, on the other hand, is the distance between two consecutive points that are in phase on the wave, such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough, and it is measured in meters (m).

For example, if we consider a wave with a frequency of $5 \, \text{Hz}$ and a wavelength of $2 \, \text{m}$, we can calculate the wave speed by multiplying these two values:

$$
v = 5 \, \text{Hz} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{m/s}
$$

This calculation indicates that the wave travels at a speed of $10 \, \text{m/s}$.

Understanding wave speed is essential in various scenarios, such as the propagation of sound waves through air or the transmission of light waves through different media. For instance, the speed of sound in air at room temperature is approximately $343 \, \text{m/s}$, while the speed of light in a vacuum is about 

$$
3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
$$

It's important to recognize that wave speed can vary depending on the medium through which the wave travels. For example, sound waves travel faster in water compared to air because the molecules in water are more closely packed, allowing for more efficient energy transfer.

By mastering the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and wave speed, you will gain a deeper understanding of how different types of waves behave in various contexts.
