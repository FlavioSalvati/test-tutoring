The momentum of a stationary object is zero, as it has no velocity.

Momentum is a measure of an object's motion and is calculated using the formula:

$$
p = m \times v
$$

where $p$ represents momentum, $m$ denotes mass, and $v$ signifies velocity. In physics, momentum is classified as a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram meters per second (kgÂ·m/s).

For an object to possess momentum, it must be in motion. This requirement arises from the fact that the velocity component in the momentum formula must be greater than zero. If an object is stationary, its velocity is zero. Consequently, when you multiply the object's mass by a velocity of zero, the result is zero momentum:

$$
p = m \times 0 = 0
$$

This principle holds true irrespective of the object's mass; even a very heavy object will have zero momentum if it is not moving.

Grasping the concept of momentum is essential in various areas of physics, such as the study of collisions and conservation laws. For example, in a closed system where no external forces act, the total momentum before and after a collision remains constant. This principle is known as the conservation of momentum. If one of the objects involved in a collision is stationary, its initial momentum is zero, which means the overall momentum of the system will depend solely on the moving objects.

In summary, a stationary object has zero momentum because it lacks velocity. This fundamental concept in physics aids in understanding and predicting the outcomes of various physical interactions and phenomena.
