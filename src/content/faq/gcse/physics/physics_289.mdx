To calculate energy changes using specific heat capacity, you can employ the formula:

$$ Q = mc\Delta T $$

This formula allows you to determine the amount of energy transferred to or from a substance. In this equation:

- $ Q $ represents the energy change measured in joules (J),
- $ m $ denotes the mass of the substance in kilograms (kg),
- $ c $ stands for the specific heat capacity in joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg°C), and
- $ \Delta T $ is the change in temperature measured in degrees Celsius (°C).

Specific heat capacity ($ c $) is a characteristic of a material that indicates the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of $ 1 \, \text{kg} $ of the substance by $ 1 \, \text{°C} $. Different materials have varying specific heat capacities. For instance, water has a relatively high specific heat capacity of approximately $ 4200 \, \text{J/kg°C} $, indicating that a significant amount of energy is needed to change its temperature.

To utilize the formula effectively, follow these steps:

1. Measure the mass ($ m $) of the substance.
2. Determine the initial and final temperatures to calculate the temperature change ($ \Delta T $).
3. Look up or measure the specific heat capacity ($ c $) of the substance.
4. Substitute these values into the formula $ Q = mc\Delta T $.

For example, consider a scenario where you have $ 2 \, \text{kg} $ of water and you wish to heat it from $ 20 \, \text{°C} $ to $ 30 \, \text{°C} $. The temperature change ($ \Delta T $) is:

$$ \Delta T = 30 \, \text{°C} - 20 \, \text{°C} = 10 \, \text{°C} $$

Using water's specific heat capacity ($ c $) of $ 4200 \, \text{J/kg°C} $, the energy change ($ Q $) can be calculated as follows:

$$ Q = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 4200 \, \text{J/kg°C} \times 10 \, \text{°C} = 84,000 \, \text{J} $$

This calculation indicates that $ 84,000 \, \text{J} $ of energy is required to heat the water by $ 10 \, \text{°C} $.
