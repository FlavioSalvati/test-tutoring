The atomic number and mass number are two key properties of an atom that describe its structure.

The atomic number, often represented by the symbol $Z$, is a fundamental characteristic of an element. It indicates the number of protons located in the nucleus of an atom. Since each element possesses a unique number of protons, the atomic number effectively defines the element itself. For example, hydrogen has an atomic number of $1$ because it contains one proton, while carbon has an atomic number of $6$ due to its six protons.

In contrast, the mass number, denoted by the symbol $A$, is the total count of protons and neutrons within the nucleus of an atom. Neutrons are neutral particles that contribute to the atomic mass but do not influence the chemical properties of the element. The mass number provides insight into the total mass of the nucleus. For instance, a carbon atom that contains $6$ protons and $6$ neutrons has a mass number of $12$.

It is crucial to recognize that while the atomic number remains constant for a specific element, the mass number can vary. This variation arises because atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons, resulting in distinct isotopes. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon, with mass numbers of $12$ and $14$, respectively, since they contain $6$ and $8$ neutrons.

Grasping the distinction between atomic number and mass number is essential for analyzing elements and their isotopes. This understanding also aids in calculating the relative atomic mass of elements, as represented on the periodic table.
