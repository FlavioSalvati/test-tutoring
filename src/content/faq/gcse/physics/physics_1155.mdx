Stars are formed from nebulae when gravitational forces cause gas and dust to collapse and heat up, ultimately igniting nuclear fusion.

Nebulae are immense clouds of gas and dust in space, often referred to as stellar nurseries due to their role as the birthplaces of stars. The formation process begins when a specific region within a nebula experiences a disturbance, such as a shock wave from a nearby supernova. This disturbance prompts the gas and dust to clump together under the influence of gravity. As these clumps accumulate more material, their gravitational pull strengthens, leading to increased density and temperature.

As the clump, now termed a protostar, continues to collapse under its own gravitational force, the temperature and pressure in its core rise dramatically. When the core temperature reaches approximately $10^7$ degrees Celsius, nuclear fusion reactions commence. During this fusion process, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing an enormous amount of energy. This energy generates an outward pressure that counteracts the inward pull of gravity, allowing the protostar to stabilize and evolve into a main-sequence star.

Throughout this star formation process, the surrounding material may form a rotating disk around the newly formed star, which can eventually lead to the creation of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. The entire process of star formation can span millions of years, but it is a fundamental mechanism that shapes the universe and gives rise to the diverse array of stars we observe in the night sky.
