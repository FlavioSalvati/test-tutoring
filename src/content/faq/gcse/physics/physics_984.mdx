The slope of a distance-time graph represents the speed of an object.

In a distance-time graph, the vertical (y) axis displays the distance traveled by the object, while the horizontal (x) axis represents the time taken. The slope, or gradient, of the line on this graph indicates the rate at which distance changes with respect to time, which fundamentally reflects the object's speed. A steeper slope corresponds to a higher speed, whereas a gentler slope indicates a lower speed.

To compute the slope, you need to determine the change in distance, denoted as $\Delta d$, and the change in time, denoted as $\Delta t$, between two points on the graph. The formula for calculating the slope is given by:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}
$$

For instance, if an object travels $50$ metres in $10$ seconds, the slope of the line can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{50 \text{ metres}}{10 \text{ seconds}} = 5 \text{ metres per second}
$$

This result indicates that the object is moving at a speed of $5$ metres per second.

If the line on the graph is straight, it signifies that the object is moving at a constant speed. Conversely, if the line curves, the speed is varying. A curve that becomes steeper over time indicates acceleration, while a curve that flattens suggests deceleration.

Grasping the concept of slope in a distance-time graph is essential for analyzing motion in physics. It not only reveals how far an object has traveled but also provides insight into how fast it was moving at any specific moment. This concept is fundamental in GCSE Physics and serves as the foundation for more advanced topics in kinematics and dynamics.
