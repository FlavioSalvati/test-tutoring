To write a nuclear equation for alpha decay, you need to account for the emission of an alpha particle from the original nucleus.

In the process of alpha decay, an unstable nucleus releases an alpha particle, which is composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This particle can be represented by the symbol $ \alpha $ or as $ \text{He}^{2+} $. It has a mass number of $ 4 $ and an atomic number of $ 2 $. As a result of alpha decay, the nucleus loses these 2 protons and 2 neutrons, leading to the formation of a new element that has both a lower atomic number and a reduced mass number.

For instance, let us examine the alpha decay of Uranium-238, denoted as $ ^{238}_{92}\text{U} $. When Uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, it transforms into Thorium-234, represented as $ ^{234}_{90}\text{Th} $. The nuclear equation for this decay process is:

$$ 
^{238}_{92}\text{U} \rightarrow ^{234}_{90}\text{Th} + ^{4}_{2}\text{He} 
$$

In this equation:
- $ ^{238}_{92}\text{U} $ represents the original nucleus (Uranium-238).
- $ ^{234}_{90}\text{Th} $ denotes the new nucleus (Thorium-234) that is formed following the decay.
- $ ^{4}_{2}\text{He} $ indicates the emitted alpha particle.

To verify that the equation is balanced, ensure that the sums of the mass numbers (the top numbers) and the atomic numbers (the bottom numbers) on both sides of the equation are equal. Here, we can see that $ 238 = 234 + 4 $ and $ 92 = 90 + 2 $, which confirms that the equation is indeed balanced.

Alpha decay is typically observed in heavy elements such as Uranium, Radium, and Polonium. These elements possess large, unstable nuclei, and the alpha decay process allows them to attain a more stable configuration by decreasing their size and releasing energy in the form of an alpha particle.
