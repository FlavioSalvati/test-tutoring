A velocity-time graph illustrates the changes in an object's velocity over time.

In such a graph, the y-axis represents the object's velocity, while the x-axis denotes time. Velocity-time graphs are invaluable tools for visualizing motion, as they clearly depict how an object's speed and direction evolve throughout a given time interval.

One of the most crucial features of a velocity-time graph is the slope (or gradient) of the line, which indicates the object's acceleration. A horizontal line signifies that the object is moving at a constant velocity. An upward-sloping line indicates positive acceleration (the object is speeding up), whereas a downward-sloping line represents negative acceleration (the object is slowing down). The steeper the slope, the greater the acceleration.

Additionally, the area under the line on a velocity-time graph corresponds to the object's displacement, which is the total change in its position. For example, when the line is above the time axis, the area between the line and the axis represents the distance traveled during that interval. Conversely, if the line is situated below the time axis, it indicates that the object is moving in the opposite direction.

Velocity-time graphs can also depict more complex motions. For instance, a curved line suggests that the acceleration is changing, implying that the rate of acceleration itself is not constant. This scenario often occurs in real-life situations, such as a car accelerating and then decelerating in a non-uniform manner.

Mastering the interpretation of velocity-time graphs is a fundamental skill in GCSE Physics, as it enables students to analyze various types of motion and effectively solve related problems.
