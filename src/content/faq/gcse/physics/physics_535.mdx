Reflection and refraction are two fundamental phenomena that describe how light interacts with surfaces and materials.

**Reflection** occurs when light strikes a surface and bounces back into the original medium. A common example of this is when you look into a mirror: the light emitted from your face hits the mirror's surface and reflects back to your eyes, enabling you to see your reflection. The relationship between the angle at which the light hits the surface, known as the angle of incidence, and the angle at which it reflects off the surface, known as the angle of reflection, is described by the law of reflection. This law states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, mathematically expressed as:

$$
\theta_i = \theta_r
$$

where $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_r$ is the angle of reflection.

**Refraction**, in contrast, occurs when light travels from one medium to another, resulting in a change in speed that causes the light to bend. For instance, when light transitions from air into water, it slows down and bends towards the normal line, which is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence. The degree of bending is determined by the refractive indices of the two media involved. The refractive index quantifies how much a medium can bend light. This bending effect explains why objects like a straw appear distorted or bent when viewed in a glass of water.

Both reflection and refraction are essential concepts in the field of optics. They play a crucial role in the functioning of various optical devices, such as lenses and mirrors. Reflection is utilized in instruments like periscopes and telescopes, as well as in everyday items such as car mirrors. Refraction is vital for the design of lenses in glasses, cameras, and microscopes, as it enables us to manipulate light in order to focus it and produce clear images.

A comprehensive understanding of these optical phenomena allows us to analyze and predict how light behaves under different conditions, which is critical for numerous scientific and practical applications.
