Hubble's constant quantifies the rate of expansion of the universe.

Hubble's constant, commonly represented by the symbol $H_0$, is an essential parameter in cosmology, which examines the universe's origin, structure, and evolution. This constant expresses the relationship between the distance of galaxies from Earth and their recession velocity, indicating how quickly they are moving away from us. This relationship is encapsulated in Hubble's Law, named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who first identified it in 1929. Hubble's Law states that the farther a galaxy is from us, the faster it recedes. This pivotal discovery provided compelling support for the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe originated from an extremely hot and dense state and has continuously expanded since that time.

To visualize Hubble's constant, consider the analogy of inflating a balloon covered with dots. As the balloon expands, the dots move away from one another. Similarly, as the universe expands, galaxies drift apart. Hubble's constant enables us to determine the rate of this expansion. It is typically expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc). Specifically, for every megaparsec (approximately $3.26$ million light-years) of distance from us, a galaxy's recession speed increases by a specified number of kilometers per second.

Understanding the value of Hubble's constant allows scientists to estimate the age of the universe. By observing the velocities at which galaxies are receding, we can extrapolate backwards to approximate the moment when all galaxies were concentrated in a single point, providing an estimate of the time elapsed since the Big Bang. Furthermore, Hubble's constant plays a critical role in understanding the size and scale of the universe, as well as the nature of dark energyâ€”a mysterious force believed to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.
