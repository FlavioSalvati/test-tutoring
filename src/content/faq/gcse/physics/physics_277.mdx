Redshift occurs when light travels away from an observer, resulting in the stretching of wavelengths, while blueshift happens when light approaches, leading to the compression of wavelengths.

Both redshift and blueshift are phenomena associated with the Doppler effect, which describes how the frequency of waves changes in relation to an observer's position. When an object that emits light moves away from us, the light waves are stretched, causing an increase in their wavelength. This shift towards the longer wavelength end of the spectrum is termed redshift, as red light possesses the longest wavelength within the visible spectrum. Redshift is frequently observed in distant galaxies and serves as evidence that the universe is expanding.

Conversely, blueshift occurs when an object emitting light moves toward us. In this scenario, the light waves are compressed, resulting in a decrease in wavelength. This shift towards the shorter wavelength end of the spectrum is called blueshift because blue light has one of the shortest wavelengths in the visible spectrum. While blueshift is less commonly observed than redshift, it can be detected in objects such as stars that are moving closer to Earth.

Both redshift and blueshift are vital in astrophysics for understanding the motion and behavior of celestial objects. By analyzing the light from stars and galaxies, scientists can ascertain whether these objects are moving toward or away from us. This information is crucial for studying the dynamics of the universe, including the rate of its expansion and the movements of stars within galaxies.

In summary, redshift and blueshift are essential tools for astronomers in mapping the structure of the universe and comprehending its evolution. They offer valuable insights into the movement of celestial bodies and the overall behavior of the cosmos.
