Redshift provides significant support for the Big Bang Theory by indicating that galaxies are moving away from us, which suggests an expanding universe.

When we observe light from distant galaxies, we notice that it is shifted towards the red end of the spectrumâ€”a phenomenon known as redshift. According to the Doppler effect, when an object emitting light moves away from an observer, the light waves are stretched, causing them to appear redder. This redshift indicates that these galaxies are receding from us.

The first discovery of redshift in the light from distant galaxies was made by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s. Hubble observed that nearly all galaxies exhibit redshift and identified a direct relationship between the distance of a galaxy and the degree of its redshift. This relationship, now known as Hubble's Law, implies that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us.

This observation is crucial for the Big Bang Theory, which posits that the universe originated from an extremely hot and dense singularity approximately $13.8$ billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. The redshift of galaxies provides strong evidence for this expansion. If the universe is indeed expanding, it follows that galaxies were once much closer together, thus supporting the concept of a singular origin point.

Furthermore, redshift aids in our understanding of the rate at which the universe is expanding. By measuring the redshift of various galaxies, scientists can estimate the speed of this expansion. This information is essential for constructing models of the universe's history and for predicting its future.

In summary, redshift is a fundamental piece of evidence for the Big Bang Theory, demonstrating that the universe is expanding and reinforcing the notion of a singular beginning.
