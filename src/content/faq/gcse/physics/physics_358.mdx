The National Grid is responsible for distributing electricity by transmitting it from power stations to homes and businesses through an extensive network of cables.

The process begins at power stations, where electricity is generated using a variety of energy sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable resources such as wind and solar energy. Once the electricity is generated, it must be transported over long distances to reach consumers, and this is where the National Grid plays a crucial role.

To facilitate the efficient transportation of electricity, the National Grid employs high-voltage transmission lines. Utilizing high voltage is essential because it minimizes energy loss as heat during transmission. At the power stations, transformers increase the voltage to very high levels, often reaching up to $400,000$ volts. These high-voltage transmission lines traverse the country and are supported by large pylons.

When electricity arrives at a substation located near the area of use, another transformer reduces the voltage to safer, more manageable levels. This stepped-down electricity is then distributed through a network of lower-voltage distribution lines, which may be either overhead or buried underground, leading directly to homes and businesses.

Throughout this entire process, the National Grid must meticulously balance supply and demand. An excess of electricity can overload the system, while a shortage can result in blackouts. Engineers utilize advanced monitoring and control systems to ensure that the appropriate amount of electricity is consistently available.

In summary, the National Grid's primary function is to ensure that electricity generated at power stations is efficiently and safely delivered to consumers across the country. This process includes stepping up the voltage for long-distance transmission and then stepping it down for local distribution, all while maintaining a careful balance between supply and demand.
