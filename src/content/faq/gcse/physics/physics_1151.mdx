The main sequence stage of a star is characterized by the fusion of hydrogen into helium within its core.

During this phase, a star is in the most stable period of its life cycle. The duration of the main sequence can range from millions to billions of years, depending on the star's mass. In fact, stars spend approximately $90\%$ of their lifetimes in this stage, where they maintain a delicate balance between the inward pull of gravitational forces and the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion.

Within the core of a main sequence star, hydrogen nuclei undergo nuclear fusion to form helium nuclei. This fusion process releases an immense amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which is responsible for the star's luminosity. The energy produced in the core generates an outward pressure that counteracts the gravitational force attempting to collapse the star. This balance is referred to as hydrostatic equilibrium.

The position of a star on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram during the main sequence stage is primarily determined by its mass. More massive stars are typically hotter and brighter, appearing towards the upper left region of the diagram, while less massive stars are cooler and dimmer, located towards the lower right. For instance, our Sun, classified as a medium-sized star, is situated roughly in the center of the main sequence.

The main sequence stage plays a vital role in the synthesis of heavier elements in the universe. As stars deplete their hydrogen fuel, they eventually transition away from the main sequence and enter subsequent stages of stellar evolution. Medium-sized stars may evolve into red giants, while more massive stars can culminate in spectacular supernova explosions. Understanding the main sequence is essential for astronomers as it aids in predicting the future evolution of stars and the eventual fate of stellar systems.
