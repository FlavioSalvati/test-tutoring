Non-contact forces encompass gravitational force, electromagnetic force, and nuclear forces, which include both strong and weak interactions.

Non-contact forces are defined as forces that influence objects without any physical contact between them. One of the most recognizable examples of a non-contact force is the gravitational force. This force causes two bodies to attract each other. For instance, gravitational force is responsible for keeping us anchored to the Earth and governs the motion of planets as they orbit the Sun. Notably, gravitational force has a long-range effect and is always attractive in nature.

Another significant non-contact force is the electromagnetic force, which consists of both electric and magnetic forces. Electric forces arise between charged particles; for example, two positively charged objects will repel each other, while a positive charge will attract a negative charge. Meanwhile, magnetic forces act between the poles of magnets, such as the attraction observed between the north and south poles. Electromagnetic forces play a vital role in a multitude of phenomena, from the operation of electronic devices to the behavior of light.

Nuclear forces also fall under the category of non-contact forces and are classified into strong and weak nuclear forces. The strong nuclear force is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together within an atomic nucleus, effectively overcoming the repulsive electromagnetic force that arises between the positively charged protons. This force is exceptionally powerful, though it operates over very short distances, typically confined to the nucleus of an atom. Conversely, the weak nuclear force governs certain types of radioactive decay, such as beta decay, and is crucial in the nuclear reactions that fuel the Sun.

A comprehensive understanding of non-contact forces is essential in the field of physics, as they explain a wide array of natural phenomena and are fundamental to the principles of motion and energy.
