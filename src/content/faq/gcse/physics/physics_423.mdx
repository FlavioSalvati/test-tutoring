Alpha radiation consists of helium nuclei, whereas beta radiation is composed of high-energy electrons or positrons.

Alpha radiation comprises particles that contain two protons and two neutrons, effectively making them helium nuclei. These alpha particles are relatively large and heavy compared to other forms of radiation. Due to their size, alpha particles possess a low penetration ability; they can be stopped by a sheet of paper or even the outer layer of human skin. However, they are highly ionizing, meaning they can cause significant cellular damage if they manage to enter the body.

In contrast, beta radiation consists of high-energy, fast-moving electrons (known as beta-minus particles) or positrons (referred to as beta-plus particles). Beta particles are much smaller and lighter than alpha particles, which allows them to penetrate materials more effectively. However, they can still be halted by a few millimeters of aluminum or plastic. Although beta radiation is less ionizing than alpha radiation, it can still inflict damage on living tissues and cells, especially if the radiation source is ingested or inhaled.

Regarding their sources, alpha radiation is typically emitted by heavy, unstable nuclei such as uranium-238 ($^{238}\text{U}$) or radium-226 ($^{226}\text{Ra}$). Conversely, beta radiation is often emitted by lighter, unstable nuclei like carbon-14 ($^{14}\text{C}$) or strontium-90 ($^{90}\text{Sr}$). Both types of radiation are forms of nuclear decay, processes that unstable atoms undergo to achieve greater stability.

Understanding the differences between alpha and beta radiation is essential for the safe handling of radioactive materials and for various applications in medicine, industry, and research. For instance, alpha emitters are commonly utilized in smoke detectors, while beta emitters are employed in medical tracers and treatments.
