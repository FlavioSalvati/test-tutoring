Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves that propagate energy through the vacuum of space at the speed of light.

These waves possess several fundamental properties. First and foremost, they are classified as transverse waves, which indicates that their oscillations occur perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. This is in contrast to longitudinal waves, such as sound waves, where the oscillations are parallel to the direction of travel.

Another significant characteristic of electromagnetic waves is their ability to travel through a vacuum. Unlike sound waves, which require a medium—such as air or water—to propagate, electromagnetic waves can move through empty space. This property enables us to receive light from the Sun and other celestial bodies, despite the vacuum of space that exists in between.

Moreover, all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum, approximately $300,000$ kilometres per second (or $3 \times 10^8$ metres per second). This speed, known as the speed of light, represents the maximum speed at which information or energy can be transmitted.

Electromagnetic waves encompass a broad spectrum of wavelengths and frequencies, collectively referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum. This spectrum includes, in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type of wave has distinct properties and applications. For instance, radio waves are utilized for communication, microwaves for cooking, infrared radiation for thermal imaging, visible light for vision, ultraviolet radiation for sterilization, X-rays for medical imaging, and gamma rays for cancer treatment.

Furthermore, electromagnetic waves can exhibit various behaviors, including reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Reflection occurs when waves bounce off a surface, refraction takes place when they change direction upon passing through different media, diffraction happens when waves spread out after passing through a narrow opening, and interference occurs when waves overlap and combine to create new wave patterns.

A comprehensive understanding of these properties allows us to harness electromagnetic waves in a multitude of technologies and applications, making them an indispensable component of modern life.
