Electric field lines serve as a visual representation of the electric field surrounding charged objects, illustrating both the direction and strength of the field. These lines originate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges, effectively demonstrating the force that a positive test charge would experience within the field. If a small positive charge is placed in this electric field, it will travel along the lines, moving from the region of positive charge toward negative charge.

The density of electric field lines corresponds to the strength of the electric field: where the lines are closely spaced, the field is stronger, and where they are more widely spaced, the field is weaker. This characteristic allows us to not only understand the direction of the field but also gauge its intensity at various points in space.

Importantly, electric field lines never intersect. If they were to cross, it would suggest that a positive test charge could simultaneously move in multiple directions at the same point, which is not physically possible. This principle ensures a clear and accurate representation of the electric field.

In conclusion, electric field lines provide an effective means to visualize and analyze the behavior of electric fields, revealing both the path a positive charge would take and the relative strength of the field in different regions.
