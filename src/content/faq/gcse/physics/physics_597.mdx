In astronomy, red-shift refers to the phenomenon in which light emitted by an object that is moving away from us shifts to longer wavelengths.

When we observe light from distant galaxies, we often find that it appears redder than expected. This effect occurs because the wavelengths of the light are stretched, elongating them and shifting them toward the red end of the spectrum. This stretching of light waves is termed red-shift and is a consequence of the Doppler effect, which describes the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave as perceived by an observer moving relative to the wave source.

In the context of our universe, red-shift serves as a critical piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory. As galaxies move away from us, the light they emit becomes red-shifted. The degree of red-shift is directly related to the speed at which a galaxy is receding; a greater red-shift indicates a faster movement away from us. This observation underpins the concept that the universe is expanding. By measuring the red-shift of light from various galaxies, astronomers can determine their recession velocities and gain insights into the rate of expansion of the universe.

Additionally, red-shift is instrumental in estimating the distances to far-away galaxies. The relationship between red-shift and distance is encapsulated in Hubble's Law, which states that the velocity at which a galaxy is receding is proportional to its distance from us. Consequently, by analyzing the red-shift, astronomers can approximate how far away a galaxy is located.

In summary, red-shift is a vital tool for astronomers, aiding in the understanding of the movement and distances of celestial objects while providing essential evidence for the expanding universe.
