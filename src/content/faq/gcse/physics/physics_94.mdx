Isotopes of an element are variants that differ in the number of neutrons within their nuclei while maintaining the same number of protons. 

In essence, isotopes are forms of a specific chemical element that possess identical atomic numbers—indicating the same number of protons—but vary in their mass numbers due to differing neutron counts. For instance, carbon has two stable isotopes: carbon-12 and carbon-13. Both isotopes contain $6$ protons; however, carbon-12 has $6$ neutrons, whereas carbon-13 contains $7$ neutrons.

The variation in neutron numbers influences the atomic mass of the isotopes, which is why isotopes of the same element can exhibit slight differences in physical properties, such as density and boiling point. Despite these differences, their chemical properties remain largely consistent, as these are primarily determined by the number of protons and electrons—both of which are unchanged among isotopes of a given element.

Isotopes can be classified as either stable or radioactive. Radioactive isotopes, known as radioisotopes, possess unstable nuclei that decay over time, emitting radiation. This characteristic renders them valuable in numerous applications, including medical imaging, cancer treatment, and radiocarbon dating. A notable example is carbon-14, a radioactive isotope utilized in radiocarbon dating to estimate the age of ancient artifacts.

A comprehensive understanding of isotopes is essential in various fields, such as chemistry, physics, and environmental science. They enable scientists to trace chemical pathways, investigate environmental changes, and even explore processes occurring within stars. Therefore, while isotopes of an element share many fundamental characteristics, their differences in neutron numbers unlock a multitude of scientific opportunities.
