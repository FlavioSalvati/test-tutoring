The energy required for melting is generally less than the energy needed for boiling.

When a substance undergoes melting, it transitions from a solid to a liquid state. This transformation necessitates energy to break the bonds that hold the particles in a fixed, rigid structure. The energy required for this process is referred to as the latent heat of fusion. For instance, when ice melts and becomes water, energy is absorbed to weaken the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules in the solid form. However, these bonds are not entirely broken; instead, they are loosened enough to allow the molecules to move past one another, resulting in a liquid.

In contrast, boiling involves converting a substance from a liquid to a gas. This process demands significantly more energy because it requires the complete breaking of intermolecular forces, enabling the particles to move freely and disperse as a gas. The energy necessary for this phase change is known as the latent heat of vaporization. For example, when water boils and transforms into steam, a considerably larger amount of energy is needed to fully overcome the hydrogen bonds, compared to the energy required to melt ice.

To provide a clearer perspective, the latent heat of fusion for water is approximately $334 \, \text{kJ/kg}$, while the latent heat of vaporization is around $2260 \, \text{kJ/kg}$. This indicates that boiling water requires nearly seven times more energy than melting ice. This substantial difference arises from the fact that, in the liquid state, particles remain relatively close together and continue to interact with one another. In the gaseous state, however, particles are much farther apart and have minimal interactions.

Understanding these concepts clarifies why it takes longer to boil a pot of water than to melt an equivalent amount of ice, despite both processes involving the addition of heat.
