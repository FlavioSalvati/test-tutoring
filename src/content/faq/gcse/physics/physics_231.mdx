Concave lenses are designed to cause light rays to diverge, effectively spreading them outward as they pass through the lens.

When light rays enter a concave lens, which is characterized by being thinner in the center and thicker at the edges, they undergo refraction, or bending, away from the central axis. This bending occurs due to the change in the speed of light as it transitions from one medium (air) into another (such as glass or plastic in the lens). The unique shape of the concave lens causes the light rays to spread apart, or diverge, instead of converging at a single point.

To visualize this, consider parallel light rays entering a concave lens. As these rays pass through the lens, each one is bent away from the central axis. If you were to trace these diverging rays backward, they appear to originate from a single point known as the focal point. This focal point is situated on the same side of the lens as the incoming light. It is referred to as a virtual focal point because the light rays do not actually converge there; rather, it is simply the point from which they seem to emanate.

Concave lenses are commonly utilized in various optical devices, such as glasses for individuals with myopia (short-sightedness). In myopia, the eye's lens focuses images in front of the retina instead of directly onto it. A concave lens aids by diverging the light rays before they enter the eye, effectively moving the focal point back onto the retina, which allows for clearer vision.

In summary, concave lenses play a crucial role in numerous optical applications by spreading light rays apart. They are vital for correcting vision problems and manipulating light paths in scientific instruments. A thorough understanding of how concave lenses function is fundamental to GCSE Physics, as it provides insight into broader concepts related to the behavior of light and optics.
