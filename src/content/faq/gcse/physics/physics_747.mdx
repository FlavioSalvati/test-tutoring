To calculate the mass of a liquid, you need to measure its volume and then multiply that by its density.

First, measure the volume of the liquid using a measuring cylinder, beaker, or another container that has volume markings. Itâ€™s important to read the volume at eye level to avoid parallax error, which can cause inaccuracies in your measurements.

Next, you must determine the density of the liquid. Density is defined as mass per unit volume and is typically expressed in units such as grams per cubic centimeter ($\text{g/cm}^3$) or kilograms per liter ($\text{kg/L}$). You can find the densities of common liquids in reference tables or textbooks. For instance, the density of water is approximately $1 \, \text{g/cm}^3$.

Once you have both the volume and the density, you can calculate the mass using the formula:

$$
\text{Mass} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume}
$$

For example, if you have a volume of $100 \, \text{cm}^3$ of water, and you know that the density of water is $1 \, \text{g/cm}^3$, you can calculate the mass as follows:

$$
\text{Mass} = 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 100 \, \text{cm}^3 = 100 \, \text{g}
$$

This method is straightforward and relies on the established relationship between mass, density, and volume. It is essential to ensure that the units for density and volume are compatible when performing the calculation. For example, if the density is given in $\text{kg/L}$ and the volume in liters, the resulting mass will be in kilograms. Conversely, if the density is expressed in $\text{g/cm}^3$ and the volume in $\text{cm}^3$, the mass will be in grams.

By following these steps, you can accurately determine the mass of any liquid, provided you have the required measurements and density information.
