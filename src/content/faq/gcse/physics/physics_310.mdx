Electrical current refers to the flow of electric charge through a conductor and is typically measured in amperes, abbreviated as "A".

More specifically, electrical current represents the movement of electrons within a material. When we discuss current, we are referring to the rate at which these electrons traverse a specific point in a circuit. You can think of it as similar to water flowing through a pipe; the current corresponds to the volume of water that passes through the pipe each second.

The standard unit of measurement for electrical current is the ampere, often shortened to "amp" and denoted by the symbol "A". One ampere is defined as the flow of one coulomb of charge passing through a point in one second. To illustrate, if you have a current of $1 \, \text{A}$, this implies that approximately $6.242 \times 10^{18}$ electrons are moving past a given point in the circuit every second!

There are two primary types of electrical current: direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). Direct current flows in a single direction, much like the output from a battery. In contrast, alternating current periodically changes direction, which is the type typically supplied by wall sockets.

To measure electrical current, we utilize a device known as an ammeter. This device must be connected in series with the component whose current you wish to measure. Proper connection is crucial to prevent damage to both the ammeter and the circuit.

A solid understanding of electrical current is fundamental in the fields of physics and electronics, as it enables us to analyze and design circuits effectively. Whether you are working with simple classroom experiments or complex systems in practical applications, grasping the behavior of current is essential.
