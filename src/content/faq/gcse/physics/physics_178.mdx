Pressure in a fluid increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid above.

When you dive into a swimming pool, you may notice a sensation of pressure in your ears. This occurs because, as you descend, there is an increasing amount of water above you. The weight of this water exerts a force on your body, which is described in physics as pressure. The relationship between depth and pressure in a fluid is clear: as depth increases, pressure also increases.

To illustrate this concept, consider a column of water. The water at the bottom of this column must support the weight of all the water above it. This weight generates a force that pushes down on the water at the bottom. Therefore, the deeper you go, the greater the amount of water above you, leading to increased weight and consequently, higher pressure.

The pressure at a specific depth in a fluid can be calculated using the formula:

$$ 
P = \rho gh 
$$

In this equation, $P$ represents the pressure, $\rho$ (rho) is the fluid's density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the depth. This formula indicates that pressure is dependent on the density of the fluid and the depth, but it is independent of the shape or volume of the container holding the fluid.

For instance, if you are submerged $10$ metres underwater in a swimming pool, the pressure you experience is a result of the weight of the water above you. If you dive deeper, to $20$ metres, the pressure doubles because there is now twice as much water above you.

This principle extends beyond just water; it applies to all fluids, including gases. For example, air pressure is greater at sea level than at the summit of a mountain due to the larger column of air above you at sea level. Understanding how depth influences pressure is essential for explaining various natural phenomena and is crucial in fields such as engineering and meteorology.
