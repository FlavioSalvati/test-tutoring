Redshift is quantified by comparing the observed wavelength of light from an astronomical object to its established rest wavelength.

Redshift occurs when light emitted by an object in space, such as a galaxy, is stretched to longer wavelengths as the object moves away from us. This phenomenon serves as compelling evidence for the expanding universe. To measure redshift, astronomers begin by identifying specific spectral lines in the light emitted by the object. These spectral lines represent unique patterns of light that are either emitted or absorbed by different elements, each characterized by a known rest wavelength. The rest wavelength is the wavelength of light that an element emits or absorbs when it is stationary relative to the observer.

Once the rest wavelength is determined, astronomers observe the light from the distant object and measure the wavelength of the corresponding spectral lines. If the object is receding from us, these lines will appear at longer wavelengths compared to their rest wavelengths. The increase in wavelength is used to calculate the redshift, denoted by the symbol $z$. The formula for redshift is given by:

$$
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}} - \lambda_{\text{rest}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}}
$$

In this equation, $\lambda_{\text{observed}}$ represents the observed wavelength, while $\lambda_{\text{rest}}$ denotes the rest wavelength. A higher value of redshift indicates that the object is moving away at a faster rate, which often correlates with its greater distance in the context of the expanding universe.

By measuring redshift, astronomers can ascertain not only the speed at which an object is receding but also estimate its distance from Earth. This is made possible because the universe's expansion rate, known as the Hubble constant, establishes a relationship between the redshift of an object and its distance. This method has been instrumental in enhancing our understanding of the scale and structure of the universe.
