In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, whereas in inelastic collisions, only momentum is conserved.

In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the system remains unchanged before and after the collision. This implies that no kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or sound. For instance, consider two billiard balls colliding on a pool table: they bounce off one another without losing speed, and their total kinetic energy remains constant. Elastic collisions are often considered an idealized scenario and serve as a theoretical model because, in practical situations, some energy is typically lost during most collisions.

On the other hand, inelastic collisions result in a loss of kinetic energy. Although the total momentum of the system is conserved, some of the kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, or deformation energy. A common example of an inelastic collision is a car crash. When two cars collide, they may crumple and produce heat and sound, indicating that some of the kinetic energy has been converted into other energy forms. In the most extreme case of a perfectly inelastic collision, the colliding objects stick together after the impact, moving as a single combined mass.

Understanding the distinction between elastic and inelastic collisions is essential for analyzing various physical phenomena and solving problems in mechanics. For example, determining whether a collision is elastic or inelastic allows us to predict the final velocities of the objects involved. This distinction is crucial across multiple fields, including engineering and astrophysics, where the principles of momentum and energy conservation are utilized to design safer vehicles and understand cosmic events.
