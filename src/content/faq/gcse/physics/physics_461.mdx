To convert power from newton-metres per second to watts, you can use a simple 1:1 conversion ratio.

In physics, power is defined as the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred. The standard unit of power in the International System of Units (SI) is the watt, denoted as $W$. One watt is equivalent to one joule of energy transferred per second, or mathematically:

$$
1 \, W = 1 \, \frac{J}{s}
$$

Newton-metres per second, represented as $N \cdot m/s$, is another unit of power. Here, a newton-metre ($N \cdot m$) measures torque, which quantifies rotational force. When you consider the speed at which this torque is applied over time, it results in power.

The relationship between newton-metres per second and watts is straightforward since both units quantify power. Specifically, one newton-metre per second is precisely equal to one watt:

$$
1 \, N \cdot m/s = 1 \, W
$$

This equality holds true because a newton-metre is equivalent to one joule. Hence, when you divide joules by seconds, you arrive at watts.

Consequently, if you have a power value expressed in newton-metres per second, you can directly convert it to watts without any additional calculations. For instance, a power measurement of $50 \, N \cdot m/s$ is directly equal to $50 \, W$. This straightforward 1:1 conversion simplifies the process of switching between these units, making it easier to solve physics problems or analyze data.
