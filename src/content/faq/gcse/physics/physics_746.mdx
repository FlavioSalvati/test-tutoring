To calculate the density of a material, you need to divide its mass by its volume.

Density is defined as the amount of mass contained within a specific volume. The formula for calculating density is given by:

$$
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
$$

The common units for density are kilograms per cubic meter ($\text{kg/m}^3$) or grams per cubic centimeter ($\text{g/cm}^3$). To measure the mass of an object, you can use a balance or scale, with the mass typically expressed in grams ($\text{g}$) or kilograms ($\text{kg}$).

Next, you need to determine the volume of the object. For objects with regular shapes, you can apply mathematical formulas. For instance, the volume of a rectangular block can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
$$

For objects that have irregular shapes, the water displacement method is an effective approach. To use this method, immerse the object in a graduated cylinder filled with water and record the change in water level. The increase in water level corresponds to the volume of the submerged object.

After obtaining both the mass and the volume, you can calculate the density by dividing the mass by the volume. For example, if an object has a mass of $200 \text{ g}$ and a volume of $50 \text{ cm}^3$, its density would be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Density} = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{50 \text{ cm}^3} = 4 \text{ g/cm}^3
$$

Understanding density is crucial in various fields of physics as well as in everyday situations, such as predicting whether an object will float or sink in water. It is essential to ensure accurate measurements and to use the appropriate units for both mass and volume.
