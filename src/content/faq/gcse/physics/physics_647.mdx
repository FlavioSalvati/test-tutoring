Solar energy is captured using solar panels, which convert sunlight into either electricity or heat.

Solar panels, commonly referred to as photovoltaic (PV) panels, consist of numerous solar cells. These cells are primarily made from silicon, a semiconductor material. When sunlight strikes the solar cells, it excites the electrons within the silicon, causing them to move and generate an electric current. This phenomenon is known as the photovoltaic effect. The electricity produced is in direct current (DC) form, which is subsequently converted into alternating current (AC) using an inverter, making it suitable for residential and commercial use.

An alternative method for harnessing solar energy is through solar thermal systems. These systems utilize mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a small area, thereby generating heat. This heat can be used directly for heating water or air, or it can be employed to produce steam that drives a turbine to generate electricity. Solar thermal systems are often implemented in large-scale power plants, but they can also be found in smaller applications, such as solar water heaters.

Furthermore, solar energy can be stored for later use. Batteries, particularly lithium-ion batteries, are commonly utilized to store the electricity generated by solar panels. This stored energy can be accessed when sunlight is unavailable, such as during the night or on overcast days. Additionally, some solar thermal systems store heat in materials like molten salt, which can retain heat for extended periods.

In summary, solar energy serves as a renewable and sustainable power source that diminishes our reliance on fossil fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. By understanding the fundamental principles behind the operation of solar panels and solar thermal systems, we can better appreciate the technology that enables us to harness the sun's power.
