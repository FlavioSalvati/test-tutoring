Radioactive contamination refers to the unintended presence of radioactive substances on surfaces or within solids, liquids, or gases.

This type of contamination occurs when radioactive materials are deposited in locations where they should not be. Such incidents can arise from various sources, including spills, leaks, or improper disposal of radioactive waste. The resultant contamination can have detrimental effects on the environment, impacting soil, water, and air quality, as well as living organisms, including humans.

When radioactive substances contaminate an area, they emit ionizing radiation, which poses risks to living cells. This radiation can damage or destroy cells, potentially leading to serious health issues such as radiation sickness, cancer, and genetic mutations. The severity of these effects is influenced by the type and quantity of radiation, along with the duration of exposure.

Radioactive contamination can be classified into different types, namely alpha, beta, and gamma contamination. Alpha particles are relatively heavy and can be halted by a sheet of paper or the outer layer of human skin; however, they can be particularly hazardous if ingested or inhaled. Beta particles are lighter and can penetrate the skin but are generally stopped by clothing or a few millimeters of materials like plastic. In contrast, gamma rays are highly penetrating and require dense materials, such as lead or several centimeters of concrete, for effective shielding.

Preventing and managing radioactive contamination necessitates stringent safety protocols. These include the use of protective clothing, proper storage and disposal methods for radioactive materials, and regular monitoring of environments where such substances are utilized. In cases of contamination, decontamination procedures are implemented to remove or mitigate the radioactive material, thereby safeguarding both individuals and the environment.
