Eddy currents in transformers lead to energy losses and excessive heating, which can decrease efficiency and potentially damage the transformer.

Eddy currents are loops of electric current that are induced within conductors due to a changing magnetic field. In the context of transformers, these currents are generated in the iron core when the alternating current (AC) in the primary coil creates a fluctuating magnetic field. This changing magnetic field induces currents within the core itself, referred to as eddy currents.

These eddy currents circulate in closed loops within the core and produce heat as a result of the resistance in the iron. This heating effect is undesirable because it represents a loss of energy that could otherwise be effectively transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil. In essence, the energy that contributes to heating the core is wasted, leading to reduced efficiency of the transformer.

To mitigate these losses, transformer cores are constructed from laminated sheets of iron instead of a solid block. Each sheet is insulated from the adjacent sheets, which limits the path available for the eddy currents and consequently reduces their intensity. This design significantly minimizes the heating effect and energy loss, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the transformer.

Understanding eddy currents is vital for the design of efficient transformers. By minimizing these currents, we can ensure that a larger proportion of electrical energy is transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil, rather than being dissipated as heat. This highlights the importance of the construction and materials used in transformer cores within the field of electrical engineering.
