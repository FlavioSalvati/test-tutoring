Sublimation is the process by which a substance transitions directly from a solid state to a gaseous state without first becoming a liquid.

What sets sublimation apart from other phase changes is its unique ability to skip the liquid phase entirely. Typically, when substances are heated, they undergo a sequence of changes: they first melt from solid to liquid, and then evaporate or boil from liquid to gas. In contrast, during sublimation, a substance absorbs sufficient energy to break the intermolecular bonds that maintain its solid structure, allowing it to transition directly into the gaseous state. This phenomenon occurs under specific temperature and pressure conditions.

A well-known example of sublimation is dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$). At room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, dry ice does not melt into liquid carbon dioxide; rather, it sublimates directly into carbon dioxide gas. Another example can be observed with iodine, which can transition from solid iodine crystals to iodine vapor when heated, again bypassing the liquid phase.

The mechanism of sublimation involves the molecules within the solid gaining enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold them together. This energy enables the molecules to enter the gaseous phase directly, unlike in melting, where molecules gain just enough energy to slide past one another while remaining in close proximity as a liquid. Similarly, during evaporation or boiling, molecules in the liquid absorb enough energy to break free into the gas phase.

Understanding sublimation is crucial in a variety of applications. For example, the process of freeze-drying food involves initially freezing the food and then reducing the surrounding pressure. This allows the frozen water within the food to sublimate, effectively removing moisture without passing through the liquid phase. This method helps preserve the food's structure and nutrients.

In summary, sublimation is a fascinating phase transition that bypasses the liquid phase, distinguishing it from other processes such as melting and boiling.
