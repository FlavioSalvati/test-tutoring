Radiation plays a crucial role in archaeological dating through methods such as radiocarbon dating and thermoluminescence dating.

Radiocarbon dating, often referred to as carbon-14 dating, is one of the most widely utilized techniques. This method is based on the radioactive decay of carbon-14, a naturally occurring isotope found in all living organisms. When an organism dies, it ceases to absorb carbon-14, and the isotope begins to decay at a known rate, characterized by its half-life. By measuring the remaining concentration of carbon-14 in a sample, scientists can estimate the time that has elapsed since the organism's death. This technique is particularly effective for dating organic materials, such as wood, bone, and cloth, up to approximately $50,000$ years old.

Thermoluminescence dating is another important method that employs radiation. This technique is used to date minerals and ceramics. When these materials are heated or exposed to sunlight, they trap electrons within their crystal lattice structure. Over time, these trapped electrons accumulate due to exposure to natural background radiation. When the material is reheated in a laboratory setting, the stored electrons are released in the form of light, known as luminescence. By quantifying the emitted light, scientists can determine the last time the material was heated or exposed to sunlight, thus aiding in the dating of the object.

Both radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating methods rely on the principles of radioactive decay and the interactions of radiation with matter. They serve as invaluable tools for archaeologists, allowing them to construct timelines and gain insights into historical contexts. A thorough understanding of these dating techniques enhances our ability to piece together the rich history of human civilization and the natural world.
