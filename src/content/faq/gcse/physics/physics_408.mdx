To determine the number of neutrons in an atom, you can simply subtract the atomic number from the mass number.

Every atom is composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The atomic number, which is unique to each element, represents the number of protons present in the nucleus of the atom. This number is typically displayed on the periodic table above the element's symbol. For example, carbon has an atomic number of $6$, indicating it contains $6$ protons.

Conversely, the mass number is the total count of protons and neutrons within the nucleus. Unlike the atomic number, the mass number is not usually listed on the periodic table; however, it can be provided in specific problems or found in more detailed isotope tables. For instance, a common isotope of carbon is carbon-12, which has a mass number of $12$.

To find the number of neutrons, you perform a simple subtraction of the atomic number from the mass number. Referring to our carbon example, the mass number is $12$ and the atomic number is $6$. Therefore, the number of neutrons can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Number of neutrons} = \text{Mass number} - \text{Atomic number} = 12 - 6 = 6.
$$

This method can be applied to any element. For instance, if you consider an isotope of oxygen with a mass number of $18$ and an atomic number of $8$, the calculation for the number of neutrons would be:

$$
\text{Number of neutrons} = 18 - 8 = 10.
$$

It's important to note that the mass number is always greater than the atomic number since it accounts for both protons and neutrons, while the atomic number counts only the protons. This straightforward subtraction allows you to easily ascertain the number of neutrons, thereby enhancing your understanding of the atom's composition.
