Radiation is quantified using various units, including becquerels, grays, sieverts, and rads, each serving a distinct purpose.

The **becquerel** (Bq) measures the activity of a radioactive source, reflecting the number of nuclear decays occurring per second. For instance, a sample with an activity of $1 \, \text{Bq}$ experiences one decay every second. This unit is essential for assessing the radioactivity of a given material.

The **gray** (Gy) quantifies the absorbed dose of radiation, which refers to the amount of energy deposited in a material, typically human tissue. One gray is defined as the absorption of one joule of radiation energy per kilogram of matter. This measurement is critical in medical applications, particularly in radiotherapy, where accurate dosing is necessary to target cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

The **sievert** (Sv) measures the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. It accounts not only for the energy absorbed but also for the type of radiation and its varying impacts on different tissues. For example, alpha particles are more harmful than beta particles or gamma rays, and the sievert helps quantify these differences. This unit is vital for evaluating radiation exposure and ensuring compliance with safety standards.

Lastly, the **rad** (radiation absorbed dose) is an older unit of absorbed dose, where $1 \, \text{rad}$ is equivalent to $0.01 \, \text{Gy}$. Although its use has diminished in favor of the gray, it may still be encountered in certain contexts, particularly in older literature or specific regions.

Understanding these units is crucial for measuring, comparing, and managing radiation across various applications, including medical treatments, nuclear energy, and environmental monitoring.
