To determine an atom's electron configuration, we must adhere to three fundamental principles: the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule.

Letâ€™s clarify these principles:

1. **Aufbau Principle**: This principle dictates that electrons occupy the lowest energy orbitals first. You can visualize this by thinking of filling seats in a cinema; you would start from the front row and gradually move to the back. In atomic terms, this means that electrons will occupy the $1s$ orbital before the $2s$, followed by the $2p$, and so forth.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: According to this principle, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, and these electrons must have opposite spins. Imagine a bunk bed; only two people can sleep in one bunk, and they must lie in opposite directions to fit comfortably.

3. **Hund's Rule**: This rule applies when filling orbitals that are of the same energy level, such as the three $2p$ orbitals. Hund's rule states that electrons will fill each orbital singly before any pairing occurs. Think of it like passengers on a bus; everyone prefers to sit in their own seat before having to share with another person.

Now, let's apply these principles to determine the electron configuration for carbon, which has six electrons. Following the Aufbau principle, we first fill the $1s$ orbital: 

$$ 
1s^2 
$$

Next, we fill the $2s$ orbital: 

$$ 
2s^2 
$$

At this point, we have two electrons remaining, which will occupy the $2p$ orbitals. According to Hund's rule, these electrons will occupy separate $2p$ orbitals:

$$ 
2p^2 
$$

Thus, the complete electron configuration for carbon is:

$$ 
1s^2 \, 2s^2 \, 2p^2 
$$

Keep in mind that the periodic table serves as an invaluable tool for determining electron configurations. Elements are organized in a manner that reflects their electron configurations. As you progress across a period, electrons fill orbitals in a predictable manner, simplifying the determination of configurations for elements with a greater number of electrons.
