Mass and weight are fundamental concepts in physics that describe different properties of objects. 

**Mass** refers to the amount of matter contained in an object and is typically measured in kilograms ($\text{kg}$). It is a scalar quantity, which means it possesses only magnitude and no direction. Importantly, mass remains constant regardless of the object's location in the universe. For instance, an object with a mass of $1 \, \text{kg}$ on Earth will still have a mass of $1 \, \text{kg}$ if it is taken to the Moon or any other celestial body.

**Weight**, in contrast, is the force exerted on an object due to gravity. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The weight of an object can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Weight} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Gravitational Field Strength}
$$

On Earth, the average gravitational field strength is approximately $9.8 \, \text{N/kg}$. Consequently, an object with a mass of $1 \, \text{kg}$ would have a weight of:

$$
9.8 \, \text{N}
$$

(newtons) on Earth. However, if the same object is taken to the Moon, where the gravitational field strength is about $1.6 \, \text{N/kg}$, its weight would decrease significantly to approximately:

$$
1.6 \, \text{N}
$$

It is essential to understand that while mass is an intrinsic property of an object, weight is contingent upon the local gravitational field strength. This distinction explains why astronauts experience weightlessness in space; although they are still under the influence of Earth's gravity, the gravitational force is considerably weaker, rendering their weight negligible.

Grasping the difference between mass and weight is crucial in physics, as it aids in accurately analyzing forces and motion. A helpful way to remember the distinction is: mass is what you measure on a balance, while weight is what you measure on a scale.
