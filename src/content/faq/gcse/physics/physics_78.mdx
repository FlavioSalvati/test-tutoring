To determine the energy required for a change of state, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Energy (E)} = \text{Mass (m)} \times \text{Specific Latent Heat (L)}
$$

When a substance undergoes a phase change, such as transitioning from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas, it requires energy. This energy is referred to as latent heat. The specific latent heat is defined as the amount of energy necessary to change the state of 1 kilogram of a substance without altering its temperature. There are two primary types of specific latent heat: the latent heat of fusion (associated with melting and freezing) and the latent heat of vaporization (related to boiling and condensing).

In this formula, the variables are defined as follows:
- The energy $E$ is measured in joules (J).
- The mass $m$ is expressed in kilograms (kg).
- The specific latent heat $L$ is given in joules per kilogram (J/kg).

### Example Calculations

**Melting Ice:**
To calculate the energy required to melt $2 \, \text{kg}$ of ice, where the specific latent heat of fusion for ice is $334,000 \, \text{J/kg}$, you would apply the formula as follows:

$$
E = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 334,000 \, \text{J/kg} = 668,000 \, \text{J}
$$

This result indicates that $668,000$ joules of energy are necessary to melt $2 \, \text{kg}$ of ice.

**Boiling Water:**
Similarly, if you want to calculate the energy required to boil $1.5 \, \text{kg}$ of water, where the specific latent heat of vaporization for water is $2,260,000 \, \text{J/kg}$, the calculation would be:

$$
E = 1.5 \, \text{kg} \times 2,260,000 \, \text{J/kg} = 3,390,000 \, \text{J}
$$

This means that $3,390,000$ joules of energy are required to convert $1.5 \, \text{kg}$ of water into steam.

Understanding these calculations is essential for analyzing energy changes in various physical processes.
