Seatbelts play a vital role in protecting passengers by applying Newton's Laws of Motion to minimize the forces experienced during sudden stops or collisions.

Newton's First Law, often referred to as the law of inertia, asserts that an object will remain at rest or continue moving at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. In the context of a moving vehicle, both the car and its passengers are traveling at the same speed. If the car suddenly halts due to a collision, the passengers will continue to move forward at their original speed due to inertia. Seatbelts provide the necessary external force to decelerate the passengers safely, thereby preventing them from being thrown forward.

According to Newton's Second Law, the force experienced by an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration, expressed as $F = ma$. During a collision, the rapid deceleration of the vehicle results in a high rate of acceleration (or deceleration). Without a seatbelt, the force exerted on a passenger could be extremely high, potentially leading to serious injuries. Seatbelts help distribute the stopping force across the stronger structures of the body, such as the chest and pelvis, while also prolonging the time over which deceleration occurs. This significantly reduces the overall force experienced by the passenger, thereby minimizing the risk of injury.

Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When a seatbelt restrains a passenger, it exerts a force on the passenger to decelerate them. In turn, the passenger exerts an equal and opposite force back onto the seatbelt. This interaction ensures that the passenger is securely held in place, preventing them from moving forward and colliding with the dashboard or windscreen.

By understanding and applying Newton's Laws, seatbelts effectively reduce the risk of injury during car accidents, making them an essential safety feature in vehicles.
