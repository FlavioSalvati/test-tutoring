Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, resulting in the release of energy.

To elaborate, nuclear fusion occurs when two light elements, typically isotopes of hydrogen such as deuterium and tritium, collide under conditions of extremely high temperatures and pressures. These extreme conditions are essential to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. When these nuclei successfully fuse, they form a heavier nucleus, such as helium, and release a significant amount of energy in the form of light and heat. This energy release is a consequence of the fact that the mass of the newly formed nucleus is slightly less than the total mass of the original nuclei. According to Einstein's equation, $E=mc^2$, this lost mass is converted into energy.

Fusion is the fundamental process that powers the sun and other stars, generating the energy that sustains life on Earth. In the core of the sun, temperatures reach approximately $15$ million degrees Celsius, allowing hydrogen nuclei to fuse, producing helium and releasing energy. Scientists are striving to replicate these conditions on Earth to create a sustainable and virtually limitless source of energy. Unlike nuclear fission, which involves the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei and is currently used in nuclear power plants, fusion generates significantly less radioactive waste and poses a lower risk of catastrophic failure.

One of the primary challenges in achieving practical nuclear fusion on Earth is maintaining the extremely high temperatures and pressures necessary for a sustained reaction. Devices such as tokamaks and inertial confinement reactors are being developed to contain and control the fusion process. If successful, nuclear fusion could revolutionize energy production, providing a clean, safe, and abundant energy source for the future.
