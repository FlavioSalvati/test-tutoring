The formula that relates force, spring constant, and extension is given by 

$$ 
F = k \times e 
$$

In this equation:

- $F$ represents the force applied to the spring, measured in newtons (N).
- $k$ is the spring constant, a measure of the spring's stiffness, typically expressed in newtons per meter (N/m).
- $e$ denotes the extension, which is the distance the spring is stretched or compressed from its original length, measured in meters (m).

This relationship is known as Hooke's Law, named after the 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke. Hooke's Law asserts that the force required to extend or compress a spring by a certain distance is directly proportional to that distance. This implies that if the extension is doubled, the force required to achieve that extension will also double, provided that the spring remains within its elastic limit.

The spring constant $k$ is characteristic of each individual spring and depends on various factors, including the material from which the spring is made and its dimensions. A higher spring constant signifies a stiffer spring, which necessitates a greater force to produce the same amount of extension compared to a spring with a lower spring constant.

For instance, consider a spring with a spring constant of $50 \, \text{N/m}$ that is stretched by $0.2 \, \text{m}$. The force exerted by the spring can be calculated using the formula 

$$ 
F = k \times e 
$$ 

Substituting the known values, we have:

$$ 
F = 50 \times 0.2 = 10 \, \text{N} 
$$

Grasping this formula is essential for analyzing problems in physics that involve springs, such as calculating the potential energy stored in a stretched or compressed spring. This concept can be further explored using the formula for elastic potential energy.
