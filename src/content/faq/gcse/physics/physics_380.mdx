Heating a system elevates its internal energy by enhancing the kinetic and potential energy of its constituent particles.

When a system is subjected to heat, energy is transferred to it in the form of thermal energy. This transfer causes the particles within the system—such as atoms or molecules—to move with increased vigor. In a solid, the particles vibrate more intensely around their fixed positions. In a liquid, they move more freely and with greater speed. In a gas, the particles exhibit even faster motion and occupy a larger volume.

The internal energy of a system represents the total energy contained within it, encompassing both kinetic energy (the energy of motion) and potential energy (the energy stored due to the positions of particles). When heat is introduced to a system, the kinetic energy of the particles rises because they move more rapidly. This increase in kinetic energy subsequently raises the temperature of the system, which serves as an indicator of the average kinetic energy of the particles.

In addition to increasing kinetic energy, heating can also elevate the potential energy of the particles. For instance, in a solid, as the particles vibrate more vigorously, they may shift slightly further apart, resulting in a rise in their potential energy. In liquids and gases, particles may transition to higher energy states or overcome intermolecular forces, further increasing their potential energy.

The extent of the change in internal energy is influenced by the specific heat capacity of the material, defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of $1 \, \text{kg}$ of the substance by $1 \, ^\circ \text{C}$. Different materials possess varying specific heat capacities, which means they require different amounts of energy to achieve the same temperature change.

In summary, heating a system amplifies its internal energy by enhancing the kinetic and potential energy of its particles. This process results in elevated temperatures and may induce changes in the state of the material.
