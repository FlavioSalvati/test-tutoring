Radioactive waste management involves strategies for containment, isolation, and monitoring to safeguard both people and the environment.

Radioactive waste is generated from various sources, including nuclear power plants, medical treatments, and scientific research. This waste is classified into three categories based on its radioactivity levels: low-level, intermediate-level, and high-level waste. Each category necessitates distinct management approaches.

**Low-Level Waste**: This type of waste includes items such as clothing and tools that have been exposed to radiation. Typically, low-level waste is compacted and disposed of in shallow landfills specifically designed to prevent any leakage into the environment.

**Intermediate-Level Waste**: Comprising more radioactive materials like reactor components and certain chemical sludges, intermediate-level waste demands more robust containment solutions. This waste is often encapsulated in materials such as concrete or bitumen and stored in deep underground facilities. These facilities are engineered to isolate the waste from the biosphere for thousands of years.

**High-Level Waste**: The most radioactive category, high-level waste primarily originates from spent nuclear fuel. It generates significant heat and thus requires cooling. Initially, this waste is stored in water-filled pools at the reactor site to facilitate cooling. After several years, it can be transferred to dry casks made of steel and concrete for long-term storage. Some countries are also developing deep geological repositories, where high-level waste can be buried deep underground in stable rock formations, ensuring isolation for tens of thousands of years.

Throughout the entire waste management process, stringent monitoring and safety measures are implemented to detect any potential leaks or radiation exposure. These protocols are essential to managing radioactive waste in a manner that minimizes risks to human health and the environment.
