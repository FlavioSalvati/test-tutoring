The unit of speed can be expressed in either metres per second ($\text{m/s}$) or kilometres per hour ($\text{km/h}$).

Speed quantifies how quickly an object moves from one location to another. In physics, speed is defined as the distance travelled divided by the time taken to cover that distance. The standard unit of speed in the International System of Units (SI) is $\text{m/s}$. For instance, if an object travels one metre in one second, its speed is recorded as $1 \, \text{m/s}$.

Another commonly used unit of speed, particularly in everyday situations, is $\text{km/h}$. This unit is frequently used to measure the speed of vehicles, such as cars and bicycles. For example, if a car covers a distance of $60$ kilometres in one hour, its speed is $60 \, \text{km/h}$. To convert between these units, one can use the relationship that $1 \, \text{m/s}$ is equivalent to $3.6 \, \text{km/h}$. Therefore, if you have a speed in $\text{m/s}$, you can multiply it by $3.6$ to obtain the speed in $\text{km/h}$, and the reverse is true for conversion from $\text{km/h}$ to $\text{m/s}$.

In some cases, you may also come across miles per hour ($\text{mph}$), particularly in countries like the United States. However, for GCSE Physics, the primary units you'll work with are $\text{m/s}$ and $\text{km/h}$.

Grasping the units of speed is essential for solving physics problems. For instance, if you know the distance an object has travelled and the time it took, you can determine its speed using the formula:

$$
\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}.
$$

This formula allows you to analyse various scenarios, such as calculating how long it will take to travel a certain distance at a specific speed or determining how far an object will travel in a given time period.

By mastering the concept of speed and its associated units, you will be well-prepared to tackle a wide array of physics problems and gain a deeper understanding of the motion of objects in your surroundings.
