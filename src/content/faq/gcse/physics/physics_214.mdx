In transverse waves, particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

To elaborate, transverse waves are characterized by particle vibrations that occur at right angles to the wave's travel direction. For instance, if a wave moves from left to right, the particles of the medium oscillate either up and down or side to side but do not move in the same direction as the wave. This contrasts with longitudinal waves, where particle movement is parallel to the direction of wave propagation.

A common example of a transverse wave is a wave traveling along a string. When you flick one end of a rope up and down, you generate waves that propagate along the length of the rope. In this scenario, the individual particles of the rope move vertically while the wave itself travels horizontally. Another familiar example is light waves, which are electromagnetic waves and are also classified as transverse waves.

In the context of transverse waves, the highest points are referred to as crests, while the lowest points are known as troughs. The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs is termed the wavelength, denoted as $\lambda$. The amplitude of the wave, represented as $A$, is the maximum displacement of the particles from their equilibrium position, serving as an indicator of the wave's energy.

Understanding the particle movement in transverse waves is essential for analyzing various physical phenomena, such as the behavior of light, water waves, and seismic waves generated during earthquakes. By studying these waves, we can gain valuable insights into the properties of different materials and the nature of energy transfer across various contexts.
