title: "How do you calculate the remaining quantity after a given number of half-lives?"
summary: To calculate the remaining quantity after a given number of half-lives, use the formula; $ \text{Remaining Quantity} = \text{Initial Quantity} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\text{Number of Half-Lives}} $.

To determine the remaining quantity of a substance after a specified number of half-lives, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Remaining Quantity} = \text{Initial Quantity} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\text{Number of Half-Lives}}.
$$

Understanding half-life is essential in the study of how substances decay over time. A half-life refers to the duration required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay. Consequently, after one half-life, only half of the original amount of the substance remains. After two half-lives, one-quarter remains, and this pattern continues.

To apply the formula effectively, you will need to know both the initial quantity of the substance and the number of half-lives that have elapsed. For instance, if you start with an initial quantity of $100$ grams and $3$ half-lives have passed, the remaining quantity can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify the initial quantity: $100$ grams.
2. Determine the number of half-lives: $3$.
3. Use the formula: 
   $$
   \text{Remaining Quantity} = 100 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3.
   $$

Breaking it down step-by-step:
- After $1$ half-life: 
  $$
  100 \times \frac{1}{2} = 50 \text{ grams}.
  $$
- After $2$ half-lives: 
  $$
  50 \times \frac{1}{2} = 25 \text{ grams}.
  $$
- After $3$ half-lives: 
  $$
  25 \times \frac{1}{2} = 12.5 \text{ grams}.
  $$

Thus, after $3$ half-lives, $12.5$ grams of the original $100$ grams will remain.

This method is applicable not only to radioactive materials but also to any substance that undergoes exponential decay. It serves as a powerful tool in both physics and chemistry for predicting the quantity of a substance remaining after a certain time period, given its half-life.
