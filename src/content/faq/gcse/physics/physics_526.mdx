Momentum in a two-dimensional collision is governed by the principle of conservation of momentum, which applies to both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions.

In a two-dimensional collision, the total momentum of a system before the collision is equal to the total momentum of the system after the collision. This principle is known as the conservation of momentum. To analyze this principle effectively, we separate the momentum into its x and y components, with each component being conserved independently.

Consider two objects colliding on a flat surface. Before the collision, each object possesses a certain momentum, calculated as the product of its mass and velocity. We can represent the momentum of each object as a vector, which includes components in both the x and y directions. For instance, if object A has a mass $ m_A $ and a velocity $ \vec{v}_A $, its momentum $ \vec{p}_A $ can be expressed in terms of its components as follows:

$$
p_{Ax} = m_A v_{Ax}
$$
$$
p_{Ay} = m_A v_{Ay}
$$

During the collision, forces act between the two objects, resulting in changes to their velocities and, consequently, their momenta. Nonetheless, the total momentum in the x direction before the collision must equal the total momentum in the x direction after the collision. The same applies to the y direction. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\sum p_{x \text{ before}} = \sum p_{x \text{ after}}
$$
$$
\sum p_{y \text{ before}} = \sum p_{y \text{ after}}
$$

For example, consider two ice skaters pushing off from one another. Their combined momentum in both the x and y directions remains constant throughout the interaction. If one skater moves to the right (in the positive x direction), the other must move to the left (in the negative x direction) to ensure momentum conservation. Similarly, if one skater moves upwards (in the positive y direction), the other must move downwards (in the negative y direction).

By applying the conservation of momentum in both dimensions, we can predict the final velocities of the objects following the collision. This principle is essential for understanding collisions in various contexts, including sports, automotive collisions, and particle physics experiments.
