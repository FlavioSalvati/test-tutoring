Momentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity.

More specifically, momentum quantifies the amount of motion an object possesses. It is classified as a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. The formula for calculating momentum $ p $ is given by:

$$
p = m \times v
$$

In this equation, $ p $ represents momentum, $ m $ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms (kg), and $ v $ is the object's velocity measured in metres per second (m/s). For example, consider a car with a mass of $1000 \, \text{kg}$ moving at a velocity of $20 \, \text{m/s}$. The momentum of the car can be calculated as follows:

$$
p = 1000 \, \text{kg} \times 20 \, \text{m/s} = 20000 \, \text{kg m/s}
$$

Understanding momentum is crucial in physics, particularly in analyzing how objects interact during collisions. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of a closed system—one that is not influenced by external forces—remains constant. This principle implies that the total momentum before a collision equals the total momentum after the collision.

For instance, when two ice skaters push off from one another, their combined momentum before and after the push remains unchanged, although it may be distributed differently between them. This fundamental concept is vital for analyzing collisions in various contexts, including car accidents, sports, and even the mechanics of rocket propulsion.

It's important to note that because momentum is a vector quantity, the direction of motion is significant. If two objects are moving in opposite directions, their momenta will have opposite signs. Therefore, when calculating and analyzing momentum, it is essential to consider both magnitude and direction.
