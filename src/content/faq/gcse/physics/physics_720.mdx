Electric fields are regions surrounding static charges where other charges experience a force. 

Static charges are those that do not move. For example, consider a balloon that has been rubbed on your hair. This action transfers electrons, resulting in the balloon acquiring a static charge. Consequently, an electric field is generated around the balloon. When you bring a small, charged object, such as a piece of paper, close to the balloon, the paper will either be attracted to or repelled by the balloon. This interaction occurs because the paper is influenced by the electric field produced by the balloon's static charge.

The strength and direction of an electric field depend on both the magnitude of the charge and the distance from it. The electric field is stronger when you are closer to the charge and diminishes as you move farther away. One way to visualize electric fields is through field lines. These lines emanate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges. The density of these lines—how close they are to one another—indicates the strength of the electric field: the closer the lines, the stronger the field in that area.

For instance, if you have a positively charged object, the electric field lines will radiate outward from it. Conversely, for a negatively charged object, the electric field lines will converge towards it. When a small positive test charge is placed within the field, it will move in the direction of the field lines. In contrast, a small negative test charge would move in the opposite direction of the field lines.

Understanding electric fields is essential for explaining various everyday phenomena, such as why your hair stands on end when you remove a woolly jumper or why a balloon adheres to a wall after being rubbed on your hair. These occurrences are all effects of static charges generating electric fields that exert forces on other charges.
