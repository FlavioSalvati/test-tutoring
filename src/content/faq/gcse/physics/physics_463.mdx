Lifting an object vertically requires performing work against the force of gravity by exerting an upward force.

When you lift an object, you must overcome the gravitational force that pulls it downward. To effectively lift the object, the upward force you apply must be at least equal to the weight of the object, which is the force of gravity acting on it. The work done in lifting the object can be expressed using the formula:

$$
W = F \times d
$$

In this context, $F$ represents the weight of the object, which can be calculated as the product of its mass $m$ and the gravitational field strength $g$. On Earth, $g$ is approximately $9.8 \, \text{N/kg}$.

Thus, the formula for work done while lifting becomes:

$$
W = m \times g \times d
$$

In this equation, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, $g$ is the gravitational field strength, and $d$ is the vertical distance that the object is lifted, measured in meters. For instance, if you lift a $2 \, \text{kg}$ object to a height of $3 \, \text{m}$, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$
W = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{N/kg} \times 3 \, \text{m} = 58.8 \, \text{joules}
$$

It is crucial to understand that for work to be done, both the direction of the applied force and the direction of the object's movement must align. When you lift the object directly upward, both the force you exert and the distance moved are vertical, resulting in work being done. Conversely, if you hold the object stationary, regardless of the effort you feel you are exerting, no work is performed since there is no movement.

Grasping this concept is essential for analyzing various physical scenarios, such as calculating the energy required to lift objects or understanding how machines like pulleys and levers facilitate lifting by reducing the amount of force needed.
