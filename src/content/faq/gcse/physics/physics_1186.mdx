The cosmic microwave background (CMB) serves as a compelling supporting pillar for the Big Bang Theory by offering substantial evidence of the universe's initial hot and dense state.

The CMB is a faint glow of microwave radiation that permeates the entire universe and can be detected in every direction. This radiation originates from a pivotal moment in the universe's history, approximately $380,000$ years after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled sufficiently for protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. Prior to this recombination, the universe existed as a hot, dense plasma that was opaque to radiation. As the universe expanded and cooled, it became transparent, allowing this radiation to propagate freely through space.

According to the Big Bang Theory, this radiation should still be observable today, albeit cooled to just a few degrees above absolute zero due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. In $1965$, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously discovered this background radiation, which was consistent with a predicted temperature of approximately $2.7$ Kelvin. This groundbreaking discovery provided robust evidence for the Big Bang Theory, confirming that the universe indeed expanded from a hot and dense state.

Moreover, detailed measurements of the CMB conducted by the COBE, WMAP, and Planck satellites have uncovered minuscule fluctuations in temperature. These fluctuations represent the primordial seeds of all current cosmic structures, including galaxies and galaxy clusters. The patterns of these fluctuations align with the predictions made by the Big Bang Theory and offer a snapshot of the universe during its formative years.

In conclusion, the CMB is an essential piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang Theory, as it not only affirms the universe's hot and dense origin but also provides valuable insights into its early development and subsequent expansion.
