During the process of melting, particles absorb energy and transition from a fixed, orderly arrangement to a more random, fluid state.

When a solid substance is heated, its particles take in energy, which causes them to vibrate more vigorously. In solids, particles are typically arranged in a fixed, orderly structure, often forming a crystal lattice. They are held together by strong intermolecular forces that maintain their positions.

As the temperature increases, the particles acquire more kinetic energy. Eventually, this energy becomes sufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces that keep the particles in their fixed positions. At this stage, the solid begins to melt. The particles start to move more freely, sliding past one another, which is characteristic of the liquid state. This transition from solid to liquid is known as melting.

Throughout the melting process, the temperature of the substance remains constant at its melting point. All the energy supplied during this time is utilized to break the intermolecular bonds rather than to raise the temperature. For instance, ice remains at $0^\circ C$ while it melts, even if additional heat is applied.

In summary, during melting, particles transition from a fixed, orderly arrangement to a more random, fluid state as they gain energy and overcome intermolecular forces. This process occurs at a constant temperature, where the energy input is used to change the state of the substance rather than to increase its temperature.
