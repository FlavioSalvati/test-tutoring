To calculate the distance from a velocity-time graph, you need to find the area under the graph between two specified points on the time axis.

In a velocity-time graph, the y-axis represents velocity, while the x-axis represents time. The area beneath the graph between two points on the time axis corresponds to the distance traveled during that time interval. This relationship stems from the fact that distance is the integral of velocity with respect to time.

If the graph is a straight line, such as in the case of constant velocity, you can determine the area using simple geometric shapes like rectangles or triangles. For instance, when the velocity is constant, the graph appears as a horizontal line. The area under this line, which forms a rectangle, can be calculated by multiplying the velocity (the height of the rectangle) by the time interval (the width of the rectangle):

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Velocity} \times \text{Time}
$$

In contrast, if the graph depicts changing velocity, you may encounter more complex shapes. For example, if the graph forms a triangle, you can calculate the area using the formula for the area of a triangle:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

In this context, the base represents the time interval, and the height corresponds to the change in velocity.

When dealing with a graph that is curved, you may need to divide it into smaller sections, approximate each section with appropriate geometric shapes, and then sum the areas of these shapes. This technique is known as numerical integration. For more precise calculations, especially in advanced studies, calculus can be employed to determine the exact area under the curve.

Ultimately, the crucial concept to remember is that the area under the velocity-time graph represents the distance traveled. By carefully analyzing the shape of the graph and applying suitable geometric or numerical methods, you can accurately calculate this distance.
