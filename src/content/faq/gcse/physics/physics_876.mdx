To determine the work done when a force is applied at an angle, we can use the following formula:

$$
W = F \times d \times \cos(\theta)
$$

In this equation, $ W $ represents the work done, $ F $ is the magnitude of the applied force, $ d $ is the distance over which the force is exerted, and $ \theta $ is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement.

When a force is applied at an angle, only the component of the force that acts in the direction of movement performs work. This is why we incorporate the cosine of the angle $ \theta $ into the formula. The cosine function effectively accounts for the directionality of the force relative to the movement.

### Example Calculation

Consider the scenario where you are pulling a sled with a rope that makes an angle of $30^\circ$ with the horizontal. You apply a force of $50 \, \text{N}$ over a distance of $10 \, \text{m}$. To calculate the work done, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the force $ F $**: $50 \, \text{N}$
2. **Identify the distance $ d $**: $10 \, \text{m}$
3. **Identify the angle $ \theta $**: $30^\circ$

Next, compute the cosine of the angle:

$$
\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
$$

Now, substitute these values into the work formula:

$$
W = 50 \, \text{N} \times 10 \, \text{m} \times 0.866
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
W \approx 433 \, \text{J}
$$

Thus, the work done in this scenario is approximately $433 \, \text{J}$. This calculation highlights how the work done accounts only for the component of the force that effectively contributes to the movement in the direction traveled.
