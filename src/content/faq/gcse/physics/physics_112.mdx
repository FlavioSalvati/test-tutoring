Here are some examples of isotopes characterized by their long half-lives: Uranium-238, Thorium-232, and Potassium-40.

Uranium-238 is one of the most prominent isotopes with a lengthy half-life of approximately $4.5$ billion years. This isotope is commonly located in the Earth's crust and plays a crucial role in dating rocks and geological formations. Its extensive half-life is particularly valuable for understanding the age of the Earth and the timing of significant geological events.

Thorium-232 is another isotope known for its exceptionally long half-life, which is about $14$ billion years. Like Uranium-238, Thorium-232 can also be found naturally in the Earth's crust. It holds potential for various applications, including as a future fuel source for nuclear reactors. The long half-life of Thorium-232 presents both challenges and opportunities in its utilization for energy production.

Potassium-40 has a half-life of roughly $1.25$ billion years and is prevalent in numerous minerals and rocks. It is especially important in the field of radiometric dating, where it is utilized to date ancient rocks and fossils. Potassium-40 decays into Argon-40, and by measuring the ratio of these isotopes within a sample, scientists can accurately determine its age.

These isotopes play significant roles across various scientific disciplines, including geology, archaeology, and nuclear physics. Their extended half-lives enable researchers to investigate processes and events that transpired millions or even billions of years ago, offering invaluable insights into the history of our planet and the universe at large.
