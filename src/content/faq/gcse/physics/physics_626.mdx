Power is defined as the rate at which energy is transferred or converted over time.

To differentiate between power and energy, consider energy as the capacity to perform work. Energy can manifest in various forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, and electrical energy, and it is quantified in joules ($J$). For instance, when you lift a book, you expend energy to perform work against the force of gravity.

In contrast, power quantifies how quickly energy is utilized or transferred. It represents the rate at which work is accomplished or energy is converted. Power is measured in watts ($W$), where one watt is equivalent to one joule per second ($1 \, W = 1 \, J/s$). For example, a 60-watt light bulb consumes $60 \, J$ of electrical energy each second to generate light and heat.

Consider two identical kettles for boiling water. If one kettle has a power rating of $2000 \, W$ and the other has a power rating of $1000 \, W$, the $2000 \, W$ kettle will boil the water more quickly due to its higher energy transfer rate. Although both kettles will use the same total amount of energy to boil the water, the $2000 \, W$ kettle accomplishes this task in a shorter time frame.

In conclusion, energy represents the total quantity of work done or heat transferred, while power indicates the speed at which this energy is utilized or transferred. Grasping this distinction is essential in various fields of physics and everyday life, influencing everything from electricity billing to the design of efficient machinery.
