Loudspeakers are devices that transform electrical signals into sound by utilizing electromagnetism to move a diaphragm, which generates sound waves.

When an electrical signal is transmitted to a loudspeaker, it first encounters a component known as the voice coil. The voice coil consists of a coil of wire positioned within the magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet. As the electrical signal—essentially a varying current—passes through the voice coil, it induces a fluctuating magnetic field around the coil. This changing magnetic field interacts with the static magnetic field of the permanent magnet, resulting in the voice coil moving back and forth.

Attached to the voice coil is a diaphragm, typically made from materials such as paper, plastic, or metal. As the voice coil oscillates, it exerts pressure on the diaphragm, causing it to push and pull. The movement of the diaphragm compresses and decompresses the air in front of it, generating pressure waves in the air. These pressure waves are what we perceive as sound.

The frequency of the electrical signal directly influences the frequency of the diaphragm's movement, which in turn determines the pitch of the produced sound. Higher frequency signals cause the diaphragm to move more rapidly, resulting in higher-pitched sounds, while lower frequency signals lead to slower movements, producing lower-pitched sounds. Additionally, the amplitude of the electrical signal affects the loudness of the sound; a stronger signal causes greater diaphragm displacement, resulting in louder sounds.

In summary, loudspeakers operate by converting electrical signals into mechanical movements of a diaphragm, which subsequently generates sound waves in the air. This process enables us to hear music, voices, and other audio from electronic devices.
