Nuclear fission is the process in which a large atomic nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.

In more detail, nuclear fission typically occurs when the nucleus of an atom, such as uranium-235 ($^{235}\text{U}$) or plutonium-239 ($^{239}\text{Pu}$), absorbs a neutron. This absorption causes the nucleus to become unstable, leading it to divide into two smaller nuclei, referred to as fission fragments. Alongside these smaller nuclei, additional neutrons and a considerable amount of energy are released. The energy produced during fission is primarily manifested as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and as electromagnetic radiation, which includes gamma rays.

The neutrons that are released can initiate further fission reactions in nearby nuclei, resulting in a chain reaction. This chain reaction is the fundamental principle behind nuclear reactors and atomic bombs. In a nuclear reactor, the chain reaction is meticulously controlled to maintain a steady output of energy, which is utilized for electricity generation. Control rods, made from materials like boron or cadmium, are employed to absorb excess neutrons and regulate the reaction rate.

The energy generated from nuclear fission is immense. For instance, the fission of one kilogram of uranium-235 can release energy equivalent to that produced by burning several thousand tonnes of coal. This remarkable energy output makes nuclear fission a powerful energy source; however, it also poses significant challenges. The fission process results in the production of radioactive waste, which must be managed and stored safely for many years. Furthermore, the potential for catastrophic accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster, along with the risks of nuclear proliferation, raises serious concerns.

Comprehending nuclear fission is essential for safely and effectively harnessing its power, and it plays a vital role in conversations about sustainable and clean energy sources for the future.
