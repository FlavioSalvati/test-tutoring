Background radiation originates from both natural and artificial sources, including cosmic rays, radon gas, and medical procedures.

Background radiation refers to the ionizing radiation present in our environment, which arises from a mix of natural and human-made sources. One of the primary natural sources is cosmic raysâ€”high-energy particles from outer space that collide with the Earth's atmosphere. When these particles interact with atmospheric atoms, they produce secondary particles that reach the Earth's surface, thereby contributing to background radiation.

Another major natural source is radon gas, a radioactive gas generated from the decay of uranium found in rocks and soil. Radon can infiltrate buildings through cracks in the foundation, leading to higher indoor concentrations, particularly in poorly ventilated spaces. Consequently, radon is a significant contributor to the background radiation dose that individuals receive.

Natural sources of background radiation also encompass terrestrial radiation emitted by radioactive materials in the Earth's crust, such as uranium, thorium, and potassium-40. These materials release radiation as they decay, with varying amounts found in different types of rocks and soils. Furthermore, the human body itself contains trace amounts of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, including carbon-14 and potassium-40, which also contribute to background radiation exposure.

On the other hand, man-made sources of background radiation include medical procedures such as X-rays, CT scans, and radiation therapy, all of which utilize ionizing radiation for diagnosing and treating medical conditions. Although these procedures are carefully controlled and targeted, they still contribute to the overall background radiation exposure. Additional man-made sources consist of nuclear power plants, which release small quantities of radioactive materials into the environment, as well as residual radioactive contamination from past nuclear weapons tests.

Understanding the various sources of background radiation enables us to recognize the different ways we are exposed to ionizing radiation in our daily lives, highlighting the importance of managing and minimizing unnecessary exposure.
