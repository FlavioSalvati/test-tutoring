In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not.

In the realm of physics, an inelastic collision refers to a type of collision in which the colliding objects do not completely rebound from each other. Instead, they may either stick together or undergo deformation, with a portion of their kinetic energy being converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or sound. Nevertheless, the total momentum of the system is preserved before and after the collision. This principle is rooted in the law of conservation of momentum, which states that momentum remains constant in isolated systems.

To clarify this concept further, let's break it down. Momentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity, mathematically expressed as:

$$
p = mv
$$

where $p$ represents momentum, $m$ is mass, and $v$ is velocity. In the case of an inelastic collision, even though the objects may deform or adhere to one another, the total momentum of the system (the sum of the momenta of all involved objects) before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This conservation occurs because the forces acting during the collision are internal to the system, and internal forces do not alter the overall momentum.

Conversely, kinetic energy—defined as the energy an object possesses due to its motion—is not conserved in an inelastic collision. A portion of the kinetic energy is transformed into other energy forms, such as heat, sound, or potential energy due to deformation. As a result, after an inelastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the system is less than it was prior to the collision.

For instance, consider two cars colliding and crumpling together. After the collision, they may move as a single entity with a new velocity. The momentum they possessed before the collision is now distributed across their combined mass. However, some of the kinetic energy that existed before the collision has been expended in crumpling the vehicles and generating heat and sound, resulting in a decrease in the total kinetic energy of the system.
