Latent heat refers to the energy absorbed or released by a substance during a phase change, occurring without any change in temperature.

When a substance transitions from one state of matter to another—such as from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas—it either absorbs or releases energy in the form of latent heat. The term "latent," which means hidden, is appropriate because this energy does not result in a measurable temperature change, as would be indicated by a thermometer. Instead, this energy is utilized to alter the state of the substance.

There are two primary categories of latent heat: the latent heat of fusion and the latent heat of vaporization. The latent heat of fusion is the energy required to convert a substance from a solid to a liquid at its melting point. For instance, when ice melts into water, it absorbs latent heat from its environment. Conversely, the latent heat of vaporization is the energy necessary to transform a substance from a liquid to a gas at its boiling point. For example, when water boils and turns into steam, it absorbs latent heat.

Understanding latent heat is essential for various real-world applications. In meteorology, the latent heat released during the condensation of water vapor into rain can significantly contribute to the development of powerful storms. In everyday life, the concept of latent heat is applied in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, where the absorption and release of latent heat facilitate the cooling of spaces.

In summary, latent heat is a fundamental concept in physics that elucidates how energy is involved in changing the state of matter without altering its temperature. This hidden energy plays a crucial role in numerous natural phenomena and technological processes.
