The internal energy of a substance is influenced by several factors, including its temperature, state, and the nature of its particles.

Internal energy refers to the total energy contained within a substance, arising from the kinetic and potential energy of its constituent particles. As the temperature of a substance increases, the kinetic energy of its particles also rises, resulting in faster particle motion. Consequently, higher temperatures lead to an increase in internal energy. For instance, when water is heated, its molecules move more vigorously, which in turn raises its internal energy.

The physical state of the substance—whether it exists as a solid, liquid, or gas—significantly impacts its internal energy. In solids, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in fixed positions, resulting in relatively low potential energy. In contrast, liquids have particles that are more dispersed and can slide past one another, leading to increased potential energy. Gases, with particles that are widely separated and move freely, possess the highest potential energy among these three states. Therefore, a substance in the gaseous state typically has greater internal energy than in either the liquid or solid state at the same temperature.

Additionally, the intrinsic properties of the particles, such as their mass and the types of bonds between them, play a critical role in determining internal energy. Heavier particles or those held together by stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to move or change state. For example, it takes significantly more energy to heat and melt a metal like iron compared to a lighter substance like ice, due to the stronger bonds present between iron atoms.

In conclusion, the internal energy of a substance is determined by its temperature, state, and the characteristics of its particles. These factors collectively influence the amount of kinetic and potential energy stored within the substance.
