The work done in electrical systems can be calculated using the formula:

$$
W = V \times Q
$$

where:

- $ W $ represents the work done (or energy transferred), measured in joules (J),
- $ V $ is the voltage (or potential difference), measured in volts (V),
- $ Q $ denotes the electric charge, measured in coulombs (C).

In essence, the work done in an electrical system refers to the energy transferred when an electric charge moves through a voltage. The equation $ W = V \times Q $ illustrates the relationship between these variables.

To elaborate, voltage is the measure of electrical potential difference between two points in a circuit. It indicates how much energy is available per unit charge to move electrons from one location to another. In contrast, electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electric field.

For example, if a battery has a voltage of $ 9 \, \text{V} $ and moves a charge of $ 2 \, \text{C} $ through a circuit, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$
W = V \times Q 
$$
$$
W = 9 \, \text{V} \times 2 \, \text{C} 
$$
$$
W = 18 \, \text{J} 
$$

This indicates that $ 18 $ joules of energy are transferred by the battery to move the charge through the circuit.

Grasping this concept is vital in GCSE Physics, as it helps explain how electrical devices consume energy. For instance, when you switch on a light bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. The amount of electrical work done can be calculated using the voltage of the power supply and the charge flowing through the bulb. This fundamental principle is essential for analyzing and designing electrical circuits and systems.
