To determine the cost of operating an electrical appliance, you need to multiply its power rating, the duration of use, and the cost of electricity per unit. 

First, identify the power rating of the appliance, which is typically expressed in watts (W) or kilowatts (kW). This information is usually available on a label affixed to the appliance or within the user manual. For example, a microwave may have a power rating of $800 \, \text{W}$, which is equivalent to $0.8 \, \text{kW}$.

Next, assess how long the appliance is used, measured in hours. For instance, if you operate the microwave for $30$ minutes each day, this converts to $0.5$ hours.

Then, find the cost of electricity per unit, generally measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). You can locate this information on your electricity bill. For example, let’s assume the cost is $15$ pence per kWh.

Now, apply the following formula to calculate the cost:

$$
\text{Cost} = \text{Power Rating (kW)} \times \text{Time (hours)} \times \text{Cost per kWh}
$$

Using our microwave example, the calculation would be as follows:

$$
\text{Cost} = 0.8 \, \text{kW} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} \times £0.15/\text{kWh} = £0.06
$$

Thus, it costs $6$ pence to run the microwave for $30$ minutes.

It's important to note that if the power rating is provided in watts, you must convert it to kilowatts by dividing by $1,000$. For instance, $800 \, \text{W}$ is equal to $0.8 \, \text{kW}$.

By grasping this calculation method, you can efficiently determine the running costs of any electrical appliance, enabling you to manage your energy consumption and associated expenses more effectively.
