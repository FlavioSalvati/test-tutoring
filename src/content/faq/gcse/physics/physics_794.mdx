Niels Bohr, a pioneering Danish physicist, significantly advanced our understanding of atomic structure in the early 20th century. Prior to Bohr's contributions, the atomic model proposed by Ernest Rutherford depicted atoms as consisting of a dense nucleus surrounded by electrons. However, this model failed to explain the phenomenon of spectral lines, which are distinct patterns of light emitted by atoms.

Bohr's groundbreaking proposal was that electrons exist in fixed orbits, or energy levels, around the nucleus. He introduced the concept of quantization, indicating that electrons can only occupy specific allowed energy levels and cannot reside in the spaces between them. This idea marked a significant shift from classical physics, which struggled to account for why electrons do not spiral into the nucleus due to the attractive forces acting upon them.

Furthermore, Bohr's model introduced the notion that electrons can transition between these energy levels. When an electron absorbs energy, it can ascend to a higher energy level; conversely, when it loses energy, it descends to a lower level, emitting light in the process. Each transition corresponds to a specific energy difference, and thus a specific wavelength of light, which explains the observed spectral lines in experimental results.

Bohr's atomic model was particularly effective in elucidating the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, a challenge that had perplexed scientists for many years. Although subsequent developments in quantum mechanics have further refined and expanded upon Bohr's ideas, his model remains a pivotal milestone in the evolution of modern atomic theory. It laid the groundwork for our current understanding of atomic and subatomic processes, establishing itself as a fundamental concept in GCSE Physics.
