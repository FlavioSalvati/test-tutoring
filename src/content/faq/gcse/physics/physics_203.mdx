In a closed system, the total momentum before an event is equal to the total momentum after the event. This principle is known as the conservation of momentum.

To effectively apply the conservation of momentum, it is essential to understand what momentum is. Momentum is a quantitative measure of the motion of an object, defined mathematically as the product of an object's mass and its velocity:

$$
\text{momentum} = \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}
$$

In a closed system, where no external forces are acting on the objects involved, the total momentum remains constant over time.

Consider the scenario of two ice skaters pushing off from one another on an ice rink. If they start from rest, their combined momentum is zero before they push off. When they exert force against each other, one skater moves in one direction while the other skater moves in the opposite direction. The momentum of one skater will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the momentum of the other skater. This interaction ensures that the total momentum of the system remains zero, just as it was before they pushed off.

To analyze a situation using the conservation of momentum, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects involved and determine their masses.
2. Measure the velocities of the objects prior to the event.
3. Calculate the total momentum before the event by summing the individual momenta (mass × velocity) of all objects.
4. Measure the velocities of the objects after the event.
5. Calculate the total momentum after the event.
6. Verify that the total momentum before the event is equal to the total momentum after the event.

For instance, consider a scenario where a moving car collides with a stationary car. You can compute the momentum of both vehicles before and after the collision. If the total momentum before the collision matches the total momentum after, you have successfully demonstrated the application of the conservation of momentum principle.

It is important to note that this principle is applicable only in a closed system where no external forces—such as friction or air resistance—are at play. This characteristic makes it a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the outcomes of collisions and other interactions in the realm of physics.
