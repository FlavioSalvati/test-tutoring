The discovery of redshift has fundamentally altered our understanding of the universe's origin and evolution by demonstrating that it is expanding.

Redshift occurs when light from distant galaxies shifts toward the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon arises because these galaxies are receding from us, which stretches the light waves and makes them appear redder. Edwin Hubble first observed this effect in the 1920s, leading to the formulation of Hubble's Law. Hubble's Law states that the greater the distance of a galaxy from us, the faster it is moving away. This relationship between distance and velocity provides compelling evidence for the expansion of the universe.

Prior to the discovery of redshift, many scientists adhered to the notion of a static universe that had always existed in its current state. The observation of redshift challenged this perspective and bolstered the Big Bang theory. This theory posits that the universe originated from an incredibly dense singularity approximately $13.8$ billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. As a result of this ongoing expansion, galaxies are continually moving away from one another, which explains the redshift observed in the light emitted by distant galaxies.

Furthermore, redshift enables astronomers to determine the rate of the universe's expansion, known as the Hubble constant. By measuring the redshift of various galaxies, scientists can calculate the speed at which the universe is expanding. This information is vital for understanding the universe's future, including whether it will expand indefinitely, slow down, or ultimately collapse back in on itself.

In conclusion, the discovery of redshift has revolutionized our comprehension of the cosmos by providing evidence for an expanding universe and supporting the Big Bang theory. It has also equipped scientists with the means to measure the rate of this expansion, offering valuable insights into the past, present, and future of the universe.
