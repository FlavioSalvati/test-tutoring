Nuclear radiation plays a crucial role in cancer treatment by targeting and destroying cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and division.

Radiation therapy, commonly referred to as radiotherapy, employs high-energy radiation to specifically target and eliminate cancer cells. This radiation can originate from various sources, including X-rays, gamma rays, and charged particles. The primary objective of radiotherapy is to inflict damage on the DNA within cancer cells, which disrupts their ability to replicate and proliferate. When the DNA suffers significant damage, the affected cancer cells ultimately die off, leading to a reduction in tumor size.

Radiotherapy can be categorized into two main types: external beam radiotherapy and internal radiotherapy. External beam radiotherapy involves directing radiation toward the cancer from outside the body using a device known as a linear accelerator. This method is highly precise and can be finely tuned to focus on the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. In contrast, internal radiotherapy, often referred to as brachytherapy, entails the placement of a radioactive source directly inside or adjacent to the tumor. This approach allows for a concentrated dose of radiation to be delivered to the cancer cells while limiting exposure to nearby healthy tissues.

Radiotherapy may be employed as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with other therapies, such as surgery and chemotherapy. For example, it can be used preoperatively to shrink a tumor, thus facilitating its removal, or postoperatively to eliminate any residual cancer cells. Additionally, in certain situations, radiotherapy is utilized to alleviate symptoms and enhance the quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.

While radiotherapy is effective for treating a variety of cancer types, it may also lead to side effects resulting from damage to healthy cells. Common side effects include skin irritation, fatigue, and hair loss in the treated area. However, ongoing advancements in technology and treatment techniques are continually enhancing the precision and efficacy of radiotherapy, thereby reducing collateral damage to healthy tissues and improving patient outcomes.
