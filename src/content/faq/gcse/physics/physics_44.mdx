To determine the total resistance in series circuits, you simply sum the individual resistances.

In a series circuit, the total resistance is the cumulative effect of all the resistors encountered along the current's single path. Since there is only one path for the current to flow, it passes through each resistor sequentially. For instance, if you have three resistors with values of $2 \, \Omega$, $3 \, \Omega$, and $5 \, \Omega$, the total resistance can be calculated by summing these values:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = 2 \, \Omega + 3 \, \Omega + 5 \, \Omega = 10 \, \Omega.
$$

The formula for calculating the total resistance $R_{\text{total}}$ in a series circuit is given by:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots + R_n,
$$

where $R_1, R_2, R_3, \ldots, R_n$ represent the resistances of the individual resistors.

This principle is essential for understanding how the overall resistance influences the current flowing through the circuit. According to Ohm's Law, expressed as $V = IR$, where $V$ denotes voltage, $I$ signifies current, and $R$ represents resistance, the total resistance in a series circuit directly affects the amount of current that flows for a given voltage. When you increase the total resistance by adding more resistors, the current decreases.

For example, if you have a battery supplying $12 \, \text{V}$ and the total resistance in the series circuit is $10 \, \Omega$, you can calculate the current $I$ as follows:

$$
I = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{12 \, \text{V}}{10 \, \Omega} = 1.2 \, \text{A}.
$$

Understanding how to sum resistances in series circuits is fundamental for analyzing and designing electrical systems, ensuring they operate correctly and safely.
