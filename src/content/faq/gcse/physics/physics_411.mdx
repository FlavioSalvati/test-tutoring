J.J. Thomson's groundbreaking model introduced the concept that atoms contain smaller, negatively charged constituents known as electrons.

Prior to Thomson's discovery, the prevailing view of the atom, as proposed by John Dalton, was that it was indivisible and represented the smallest unit of matter. Dalton characterized the atom as a solid, indivisible sphere. However, in 1897, Thomson performed experiments using a cathode ray tube, which yielded transformative results. He observed that cathode rays were deflected by electric and magnetic fields, indicating that these rays were composed of negatively charged particles. These particles were subsequently named electrons.

Based on his observations, Thomson proposed a new model of the atom, commonly referred to as the "plum pudding" model. In this model, the atom is visualized as a positively charged sphere with negatively charged electrons embedded within it, akin to plums distributed throughout a pudding. This marked a significant departure from Dalton's model, as it introduced the revolutionary idea that atoms are not indivisible but rather consist of smaller subatomic particles.

The "plum pudding" model posited that the positive charge of the atom was uniformly distributed, with electrons interspersed throughout. This arrangement provided an explanation for the electrical neutrality of atoms, as the positive and negative charges would effectively balance one another. However, this model also prompted new inquiries regarding the arrangement and behavior of these subatomic particles.

Thomson's contributions laid the groundwork for subsequent atomic models and experiments. His work paved the way for scientists like Ernest Rutherford, who later conducted the renowned gold foil experiment. Rutherford's findings led to the identification of the atomic nucleus and the development of the nuclear model of the atom, which significantly advanced our understanding of atomic structure. Nevertheless, J.J. Thomson's model represented a pivotal step in the evolution of atomic theory, shaping our current comprehension of atomic structure.
