Series circuits exhibit greater total resistance, whereas parallel circuits demonstrate lower total resistance in comparison to individual resistors.

In a series circuit, resistors are connected end-to-end, resulting in the current flowing sequentially through each resistor. The total resistance in a series circuit is calculated by summing the individual resistances. For example, consider three resistors with resistances of $2 \, \Omega$, $3 \, \Omega$, and $5 \, \Omega$. The total resistance can be computed as:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 \, \Omega.
$$

This indicates that as more resistors are added in series, the overall resistance increases, making it more challenging for the current to flow.

On the other hand, in a parallel circuit, resistors are connected across the same two points, which creates multiple pathways for the current. The total resistance in a parallel circuit is determined using the reciprocal formula:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots
$$

Consequently, the total resistance is always less than the smallest individual resistor in the arrangement. For instance, if we have three resistors with resistances of $2 \, \Omega$, $3 \, \Omega$, and $5 \, \Omega$, we can calculate the total resistance as follows:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5}.
$$

This computation simplifies to yield an approximate total resistance of $0.97 \, \Omega$. Therefore, adding more resistors in parallel decreases the total resistance, thereby allowing a greater current to flow.

Grasping the differences in resistance between series and parallel circuits is essential for the effective design of electrical systems. Series circuits are advantageous when there is a need to increase resistance, such as in voltage dividers. In contrast, parallel circuits are optimal for reducing resistance and ensuring that devices receive the same voltage, as is commonly required in household wiring.
