For floating objects, the upthrust (or buoyant force) is equal to the weight of the object.

When an object floats in a fluid, such as water, it experiences an upward force known as upthrust. This force arises from the pressure exerted by the fluid on the object. According to Archimedes' principle, the upthrust acting on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by that object. For an object to float, the upthrust must exactly balance the weight of the object. This means that the weight of the object is precisely equal to the upthrust.

Consider a boat floating on a lake. As the boat sits on the water, it displaces a certain volume of water, creating a space around it. The water that has been displaced exerts an upward force on the boat. For instance, if the weight of the boat is $500$ newtons, then the upthrust must also be $500$ newtons for the boat to remain afloat. If the upthrust were to drop below the weight of the boat, the boat would sink until it displaces enough water to generate an upthrust equal to its weight.

This equilibrium of forces explains why objects with a density lower than that of the fluid in which they are submerged will float. Density is defined as mass per unit volume; thus, if an object is less dense than the fluid, it will displace a volume of fluid that weighs as much as the object before it becomes fully submerged. For example, a piece of wood floats on water because wood is less dense than water. The wood displaces a sufficient volume of water to create an upthrust equal to its weight before it is completely submerged.

Understanding the relationship between upthrust and weight is crucial for explaining why some objects float while others sink. This principle is a fundamental concept in fluid mechanics and buoyancy.
