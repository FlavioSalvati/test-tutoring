To ensure the safe use of extension leads, it is crucial to avoid overloading them, regularly check for any signs of damage, and use them according to their intended purpose.

Extension leads are extremely handy for supplying power to multiple devices from a single electrical socket, but they must be handled with care to prevent potential electrical hazards. First and foremost, always verify the maximum load rating of the extension lead, which is typically labeled on the lead itself or on its packaging. Overloading an extension lead can lead to overheating and significantly increase the risk of fire. For instance, if an extension lead is rated for $13$ amps, make sure that the total current drawn by all connected devices does not exceed this limit.

Before using an extension lead, inspect it thoroughly for any signs of damage. Look for frayed wires, exposed conductors, or damaged plugs. Utilizing a damaged extension lead can result in electric shocks or short circuits. If you notice any defects, refrain from using the lead and replace it immediately.

When connecting devices, ensure that the extension lead is completely unwound if it is of the coiled type. Coiled extension leads can overheat if left partially wound during operation. Additionally, avoid daisy-chaining extension leads—connecting one extension lead to another—since this practice can increase the risk of overloading and overheating.

Position the extension lead in a safe area where it will not become a trip hazard or be subjected to physical damage. Refrain from running extension leads under carpets or rugs, as this can lead to overheating and makes it difficult to detect any potential damage.

Lastly, it is important to use extension leads solely as temporary solutions. For permanent power needs, consider installing additional wall sockets. This approach minimizes the risk of overloading and establishes a safer electrical setup in your home or workplace.
