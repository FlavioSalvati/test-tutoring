Coulomb's law provides a way to calculate the electrostatic force between two charged objects using the formula:

$$
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
$$

This fundamental principle in physics describes how charged particles interact with one another. In this equation, $F$ denotes the force between the charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$ represent the magnitudes of the two charges, $r$ is the distance between the centers of the charges, and $k$ is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately equal to $8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2$.

To apply Coulomb's law, you must first identify the values of the charges ($q_1$ and $q_2$) and the distance ($r$) that separates them. The charges can be either positive or negative; however, the formula uses their absolute values, meaning that you should disregard the signs when calculating the magnitude of the force. Ensure that the distance $r$ is measured in meters to maintain consistent units.

For instance, consider two charges: one with a magnitude of $+3 \, \text{C}$ and the other with $-2 \, \text{C}$, separated by a distance of $0.5 \, \text{m}$. To find the force between them, you would substitute these values into the formula as follows:

$$
F = 8.99 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{|3 \cdot -2|}{0.5^2}
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
F = 8.99 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{6}{0.25}
$$

$$
F = 8.99 \times 10^9 \cdot 24
$$

$$
F = 2.16 \times 10^{11} \, \text{N}
$$

This result indicates the magnitude of the force. The direction of the force is determined by the nature of the charges: opposite charges attract each other, while like charges repel. In this example, since one charge is positive and the other is negative, they will attract.

Understanding Coulomb's law is crucial for analyzing and predicting the behavior of charged particles, which is essential in various fields, including electronics, chemistry, and biology.
