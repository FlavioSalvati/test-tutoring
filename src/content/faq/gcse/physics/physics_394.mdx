The ideal gas equation is expressed as 

$$ 
PV = nRT 
$$ 

This fundamental equation in physics and chemistry describes the relationship between the pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas.

In this equation:
- $ P $ represents the pressure exerted by the gas,
- $ V $ denotes the volume occupied by the gas,
- $ n $ stands for the number of moles of the gas,
- $ R $ is the ideal gas constant, approximately equal to $ 8.31 \, \text{J/(mol \cdot K)} $, and
- $ T $ indicates the temperature measured in Kelvin.

Pressure ($ P $) is defined as the force that the gas applies against the walls of its container. Volume ($ V $) refers to the three-dimensional space that the gas occupies. The number of moles ($ n $) quantifies the amount of gas present, while the ideal gas constant ($ R $) is a proportionality factor that ensures the equation holds true. It is important to note that temperature ($ T $) must always be expressed in Kelvin to maintain accuracy, as Kelvin is the absolute temperature scale.

The ideal gas equation operates under the assumption that gas particles do not interact with one another and that they occupy negligible volume. Although no real gas perfectly adheres to these assumptions, the equation provides accurate predictions for many gases under a variety of conditions, particularly at high temperatures and low pressures.

Utilizing the ideal gas equation allows for predictions of gas behavior when any of the variables are altered. For instance, if the temperature is increased while the volume remains constant, the pressure will rise. This occurs because gas particles gain energy at higher temperatures, resulting in faster movement and more frequent collisions with the container walls, thereby increasing the pressure.

A solid understanding of the ideal gas equation is essential for various practical applications, such as calculating the required amount of gas for a chemical reaction or determining the internal conditions of a balloon or tire. Overall, it serves as a powerful tool that helps us navigate the complexities of the gaseous state of matter.
