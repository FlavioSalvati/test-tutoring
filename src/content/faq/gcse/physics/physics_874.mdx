An object is said to be in equilibrium when both the resultant force and the resultant moment acting on it are equal to zero.

To elaborate, an object achieves equilibrium when it satisfies two primary conditions. First, the resultant force acting on the object must be zero. This condition implies that all forces acting on the object balance each other perfectly. For instance, consider a book resting on a table. The downward force of gravity acting on the book is balanced by the upward normal force exerted by the table. When these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the book remains stationary, indicating that it is in equilibrium.

Second, the resultant moment (or torque) about any point must also equal zero. Moments represent the rotational effects of forces and are influenced by both the magnitude of the force and its distance from the pivot point. For an object to be in rotational equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments must equal the sum of the anticlockwise moments. For example, imagine a seesaw with two people of equal weight positioned at equal distances from the pivot. In this scenario, the seesaw will remain balanced and will not rotate, demonstrating that it is in equilibrium.

These conditions apply to both static equilibrium, where the object is at rest, and dynamic equilibrium, where the object moves with a constant velocity. In dynamic equilibrium, while the forces and moments continue to balance each other, the object is still in motion without experiencing any acceleration.

Understanding these principles is crucial for analyzing a wide range of real-world scenarios, from simple objects like books and seesaws to more complex structures such as bridges and buildings, ensuring their stability and safety.
