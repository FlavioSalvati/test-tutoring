Nuclear radiation can significantly impact DNA by inducing mutations, causing breaks, or altering its structural integrity.

Types of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, possess sufficient energy to ionize atoms and molecules. This ionization process involves the removal of tightly bound electrons from an atom's orbit, resulting in the atom becoming charged or ionized. When ionizing radiation interacts with DNA, it can inflict several types of damage. A prevalent form of this damage is the breakage of DNA strands. DNA is structured as two long strands that form a double helix, and radiation can lead to either single-strand breaks (SSBs) or double-strand breaks (DSBs). Among these, double-strand breaks are particularly concerning due to their complexity, making accurate repair by the cell more challenging.

Moreover, radiation can induce mutations in the DNA sequence. Mutations arise when radiation alters the chemical structure of the DNA basesâ€”adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. These alterations can result in incorrect base pairing during DNA replication, leading to permanent modifications in the genetic code. If such mutations occur within genes that regulate cell growth and division, they can contribute to the development of cancer.

Additionally, radiation can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as it interacts with water molecules within the cell. These ROS are highly reactive and can damage DNA by causing base modifications, strand breaks, and cross-linking between DNA strands. Although cells have mechanisms in place to repair DNA damage, excessive damage or failures in the repair process can ultimately lead to cell death or dysfunction.

Understanding the effects of nuclear radiation on DNA is essential in various fields, particularly in medicine, where radiation is utilized in treatments such as radiotherapy, and for evaluating the risks associated with radiation exposure in different environments.
