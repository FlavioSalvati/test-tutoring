The energy of electromagnetic waves is directly proportional to their frequency.

Electromagnetic waves, including light, radio waves, and X-rays, transport energy as they propagate through space. The relationship between the energy $ E $ of these waves and their frequency $ f $ is described by the equation:

$$
E = hf
$$

In this equation, $ h $ represents Planck's constant, which is approximately $ 6.63 \times 10^{-34} $ joule-seconds. This relationship indicates that as the frequency of an electromagnetic wave increases, so does its energy.

To clarify this concept further, let's define frequency. Frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specific point per second, measured in hertz (Hz). Higher frequency waves, such as X-rays and gamma rays, have more cycles per second compared to lower frequency waves like radio waves. Because energy is directly proportional to frequency, higher frequency waves carry more energy. For instance, ultraviolet light has a higher frequency and consequently more energy than visible light, which is why it can lead to sunburn.

Planck's constant is a fundamental value in physics that connects the energy of a photon (a particle of light) to its frequency. This constant is essential in quantum mechanics, providing insight into how energy is quantized into small packets known as quanta. When the frequency of an electromagnetic wave is increased, each photon in that wave possesses greater energy.

In practical terms, this relationship explains the varying effects of different types of electromagnetic waves. For example, microwaves can heat food because their frequency is sufficient to cause water molecules to vibrate, generating heat. Conversely, radio waves, which have lower frequency and energy, are effective for communication because they can travel long distances with minimal energy loss.

Understanding the connection between frequency and energy enables us to leverage electromagnetic waves for a variety of applications, ranging from medical imaging with X-rays to broadcasting with radio waves.
