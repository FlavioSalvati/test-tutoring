The area under a velocity-time graph represents the displacement of an object over a specified time interval.

In a velocity-time graph, the x-axis typically represents time, while the y-axis represents velocity. The area beneath the curve of this graph is significant because it indicates the distance an object has traveled. Displacement is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction; it can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of the object's motion.

To calculate displacement, one must determine the area between the velocity curve and the time axis. If the graph is a straight line, as in the case of constant velocity, the area can be calculated using basic geometric shapes such as rectangles and triangles. For instance, in the case of constant velocity, the area under the graph forms a rectangle, and displacement can be computed by multiplying the velocity (the height of the rectangle) by the time (the width of the rectangle):

$$ \text{Displacement} = \text{Velocity} \times \text{Time} $$

When the velocity changes over time, the graph may not conform to simple shapes. In such cases, it is helpful to divide the area into smaller sections, such as triangles and trapezoids, to accurately compute the total area. For example, if the graph forms a triangle, the area (and thus the displacement) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:

$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} $$

If the velocity-time graph includes segments that fall below the time axis, these areas correspond to negative displacement, indicating that the object is moving in the opposite direction. To find the total displacement, one must sum the areas above and below the time axis, carefully subtracting the negative areas.

Understanding how to interpret the area under a velocity-time graph is crucial for analyzing motion in physics. It provides a clear and visual representation of the distance an object travels over a specific time period.
