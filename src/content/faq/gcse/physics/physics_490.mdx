Upthrust, also known as buoyant force, is the upward force exerted by a fluid that counteracts the weight of an object immersed in it.

When an object is submerged in a fluid, such as water or air, it experiences an upward force called upthrust. This force arises from the difference in pressure acting on the top and bottom surfaces of the object. Specifically, the pressure at the bottom of the object is higher than that at the top, resulting in a net upward force. This phenomenon is quantitatively described by Archimedes' principle, which asserts that the upthrust is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

For instance, when you place a rubber duck in a bathtub, it floats because the upthrust from the water balances the duck's weight. If the upthrust exceeds the weight of the object, the object will ascend to the surface and float. Conversely, if the upthrust is less than the object's weight, it will sink. The magnitude of the upthrust is influenced by both the volume of the object and the density of the fluid; a larger volume or a denser fluid leads to greater upthrust.

Understanding upthrust is essential for various applications, including the design of ships and submarines, which must either float or submerge in water. It also clarifies why some objects float while others sink. For example, a steel ship floats because its design enables it to displace a substantial volume of water, generating sufficient upthrust to support its weight, despite the fact that steel is denser than water.

In summary, upthrust is the fundamental force that determines whether objects float or sink in fluids, playing a crucial role in numerous practical and natural phenomena.
