In a solid, particles are tightly packed in a fixed and orderly arrangement, vibrating around designated positions.

To elaborate, the particles in a solid are organized into a highly structured arrangement, often forming a regular pattern referred to as a lattice. This close packing is a result of the strong intermolecular forces that hold the particles together, which are significantly stronger than those found in liquids or gases. Due to these robust forces, the particles in a solid are unable to move freely; instead, they can only vibrate around their fixed positions. This limitation on movement is what gives solids their definite shape and volume.

The regular arrangement of particles within a solid typically results in high density, as there is minimal empty space between them. This density contributes to the solid's rigidity and incompressibility. For instance, when attempting to compress a solid, the particles cannot be pushed much closer together, which explains why solids do not easily change shape under pressure.

Solids can be categorized based on their particle arrangement. Crystalline solids, such as table salt and diamonds, feature particles arranged in a highly ordered, repeating pattern. This regularity often results in distinct shapes and sharp edges. Conversely, amorphous solids, like glass and plastics, have particles that lack a regular arrangement, making them more flexible and less brittle.

Understanding the arrangement of particles in solids is crucial for explaining many of their properties, including hardness, melting points, and thermal and electrical conductivity. For example, metals possess a specific particle arrangement that enables them to conduct electricity efficiently, while the arrangement in insulating materials prevents electrical conduction.
