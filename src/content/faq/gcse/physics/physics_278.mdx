A higher redshift indicates that a galaxy is receding from us at a greater speed.

When we observe light from distant galaxies, we frequently notice that the light is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon is known as redshift. The term "redshift" is derived from the fact that red light possesses a longer wavelength than blue light. As a galaxy moves away from us, the wavelengths of the emitted light are elongated, causing the light to appear redder. This stretching of light waves is analogous to the way the pitch of a siren changes as an ambulance passes by, a concept referred to as the Doppler effect.

The magnitude of redshift can be quantified and is directly linked to the velocity at which the galaxy is receding. A higher redshift signifies greater stretching of the wavelengths, indicating that the galaxy is moving away from us more rapidly. This relationship was first identified by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s and serves as a fundamental piece of evidence supporting the theory of an expanding universe. According to Hubble's Law, the farther a galaxy is from us, the faster it appears to be moving away.

In practical terms, astronomers utilize redshift to estimate the distances to remote galaxies. By measuring the redshift, they can ascertain how quickly a galaxy is receding and, with the help of Hubble's Law, calculate its distance from Earth. This information is crucial for scientists as they map the universe and investigate its structure and evolution.

Therefore, when you hear that a galaxy exhibits a high redshift, it indicates that the galaxy is not only moving away from us but doing so at a significant speed. This provides valuable insights into the dynamics of our ever-expanding universe.
