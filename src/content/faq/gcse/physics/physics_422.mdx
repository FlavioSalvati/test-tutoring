Radioactive contamination and irradiation are two distinct concepts related to radiation exposure. 

**Radioactive Contamination** refers to the unintended presence of radioactive materials on or within objects, individuals, or the environment. This contamination can occur through various means, such as spills, leaks, or improper disposal of radioactive substances. Contaminated items or areas can emit radiation over time, creating a long-term hazard. For instance, if radioactive dust settles on your skin or clothing, you become contaminated, which can lead to the spread of this contamination to other areas.

In contrast, **Irradiation** is the process of being exposed to radiation from a source without direct contact with radioactive materials. This phenomenon can occur during medical procedures, such as X-rays or cancer radiotherapy, as well as in industrial applications like the sterilization of medical equipment. Once the radiation source is removed or turned off, the exposure ceases, and there is no residual radioactive material on the irradiated object or individual.

Understanding the difference between these two concepts is essential for ensuring safety and health. Contaminated materials require decontamination procedures to remove or contain the radioactive substance. In contrast, irradiation only necessitates distancing oneself from the radiation source to halt exposure. For example, if a person is contaminated with radioactive dust, they must undergo thorough cleaning to eliminate the dust. However, if a person has been irradiated by an X-ray machine, simply turning off the machine terminates the exposure.

In summary, radioactive contamination involves the presence of radioactive materials, resulting in continuous radiation emission, whereas irradiation signifies a temporary exposure to radiation without any direct interaction with radioactive substances.
