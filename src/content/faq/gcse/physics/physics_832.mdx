Different isotopes exhibit varying half-lives due to differences in nuclear stability and the interactions among the particles within their nuclei.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element that possess different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. This variation in neutron count significantly impacts the stability of the nucleus. A stable nucleus maintains a balanced ratio of protons to neutrons, allowing it to remain intact over time. Conversely, when this balance is disrupted, the nucleus becomes unstable and is more prone to radioactive decay.

The half-life of an isotope is defined as the time required for half of a sample of that isotope to undergo decay. This decay process is influenced by the forces at play within the nucleus, particularly the strong nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons together, and the electromagnetic force, which results in the repulsion between protons. If the repulsive electromagnetic force exceeds the strong nuclear force, the nucleus becomes unstable and decays more rapidly, leading to a shorter half-life.

Different isotopes of the same element can have significantly different half-lives because the number of neutrons directly affects the balance of these forces. For instance, Carbon-12 is stable and does not undergo decay, while Carbon-14, which contains two additional neutrons, is unstable and has a half-life of approximately $5,730$ years. The additional neutrons in Carbon-14 contribute to the instability of its nucleus, resulting in radioactive decay.

Moreover, the type of decay that an isotope undergoes also influences its half-life. Some isotopes may emit alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays, each characterized by distinct energy levels and decay rates. The specific decay pathway and the energy associated with the decay process play crucial roles in determining the overall half-life of the isotope.
