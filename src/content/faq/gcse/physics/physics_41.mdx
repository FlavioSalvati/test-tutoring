To determine the total resistance in a series circuit, you simply add the resistance values of all the individual components together.

In a series circuit, the current flows sequentially through each component, resulting in a single path for the current to follow. Consequently, the total resistance of the circuit is the cumulative sum of the resistances of each component. This relationship can be mathematically expressed using the formula:

$$ R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots + R_n $$

In this equation, $ R_{total} $ represents the total resistance, while $ R_1, R_2, R_3, \ldots, R_n $ denote the resistances of the individual components.

For instance, consider a series circuit with three resistors having resistances of $2 \, \Omega$, $3 \, \Omega$, and $5 \, \Omega$. The total resistance can be calculated as follows:

$$ R_{total} = 2 \, \Omega + 3 \, \Omega + 5 \, \Omega = 10 \, \Omega $$

Thus, the total resistance of the circuit is $10 \, \Omega$.

It is essential to note that in a series circuit, the current remains constant through all components; however, the voltage across each component may vary. The total voltage across the circuit equals the sum of the voltages across each individual component, adhering to the principle of conservation of energy.

Grasping how to calculate total resistance in a series circuit is vital for analyzing and designing electrical circuits, as it aids in predicting the circuit's behavior under various conditions. This understanding is fundamental in both theoretical studies and practical applications within physics and engineering.
