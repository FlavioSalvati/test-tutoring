A neutron star is an extraordinarily dense remnant of a massive star that has undergone a supernova explosion.

When a massive star, typically with a mass exceeding $8$ times that of our Sun, depletes its nuclear fuel, it experiences a catastrophic event known as a supernova. During this explosion, the star's outer layers are expelled into space, while the core collapses under the force of gravity. If the core's mass falls between approximately $1.4$ and $3$ times the mass of the Sun, it compresses into a neutron star.

Neutron stars are incredibly dense; a volume of neutron-star material equivalent to that of a sugar cube would weigh around $1$ billion tonnes on Earth! This extreme density arises because the protons and electrons in the core combine to form neutrons, resulting in a star that consists almost entirely of neutrons. These neutrons are so tightly packed that the star's radius measures only about $10$ to $20$ kilometers, despite having a mass greater than that of the Sun.

Additionally, neutron stars possess extraordinarily strong magnetic fields, which can be billions of times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. Some neutron stars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles. When these beams sweep past Earth, we observe them as pulsars, which appear to pulse on and off as the star rotates.

The study of neutron stars allows scientists to explore the behavior of matter under extreme conditions that cannot be replicated on Earth. They also offer valuable insights into stellar evolution and the dynamics of supernova explosions. Neutron stars are truly captivating objects that expand the frontiers of our understanding of the universe.
