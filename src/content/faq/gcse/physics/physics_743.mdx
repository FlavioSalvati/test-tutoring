The strength of the electric field diminishes as the distance from a charged object increases, following the inverse square law.

To grasp this concept more thoroughly, let's begin with the definition of an electric field. An electric field is a region surrounding a charged object in which other charged objects will experience a force. The strength of this field is quantified in newtons per coulomb (N/C) and is denoted by the symbol $E$.

The relationship between the electric field strength ($E$) and the distance ($r$) from a point charge is described by Coulomb's Law. This relationship can be mathematically represented as:

$$ 
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2} 
$$ 

In this equation, $k$ represents Coulomb's constant, approximately $8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2$, $Q$ is the charge that generates the electric field, and $r$ is the distance from that charge. This formula illustrates that the electric field strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge.

In simpler terms, if you double the distance from the charge, the electric field strength reduces to one-quarter of its original value. If you triple the distance, the field strength decreases to one-ninth of its original magnitude. This rapid decline in field strength explains why you may not notice the effects of a charged object if you are positioned far away from it.

The inverse square law governing electric fields is analogous to the behavior of gravitational forces. Just as gravitational forces weaken with distance, electric fields behave in a similar fashion. This principle is essential in various fields of physics and engineering, including the design of electrical equipment and the study of natural phenomena such as lightning.

By understanding how the electric field varies with distance, you can better predict and analyze the behavior of charged objects in different scenarios, which is a fundamental component of GCSE Physics.
