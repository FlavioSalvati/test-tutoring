The primary factors influencing Earth's temperature include solar radiation, greenhouse gases, Earth's albedo, and atmospheric circulation.

Solar radiation serves as the fundamental source of energy for our planet. The Sun emits energy in the form of light and heat, which travels to Earth and warms its surface. The amount of solar energy received by Earth can fluctuate due to variations in the Sun's activity and changes in Earth’s orbit. These fluctuations may lead to long-term climatic changes.

Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), and water vapor ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), are critical in regulating Earth's temperature. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere through a process known as the greenhouse effect. When solar radiation reaches Earth, it is absorbed by the surface and subsequently re-emitted as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases absorb this infrared radiation and then re-radiate it in all directions, including back toward Earth’s surface. This process helps maintain a temperature that is warmer than it would otherwise be.

Earth's albedo, which refers to its reflectivity, also plays a significant role in temperature regulation. Albedo measures how much sunlight is reflected by Earth’s surface. Surfaces with high albedo, such as ice and snow, reflect most sunlight, while darker surfaces, like oceans and forests, have low albedo and absorb more sunlight. Changes in Earth's albedo—such as the melting of ice caps or deforestation—can significantly impact the amount of solar energy absorbed, thereby affecting temperature.

Atmospheric circulation, which encompasses wind patterns and ocean currents, facilitates the distribution of heat across the planet. The movement of air and water transports warm and cold temperatures to different regions, influencing local climates. For instance, the Gulf Stream carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic, thereby impacting the climate of Western Europe.

By comprehensively understanding these factors, we can better analyze how both human activities and natural processes shape Earth’s climate and temperature.
