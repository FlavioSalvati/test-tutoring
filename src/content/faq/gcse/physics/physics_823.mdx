Background radiation originates from both natural and man-made sources, including cosmic rays, radon gas, and medical procedures.

Background radiation refers to the ionizing radiation present in our environment, stemming from a variety of sources. One of the primary natural sources is cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles emitted from outer space. When these particles interact with the Earth's atmosphere, they collide with atoms, resulting in the creation of secondary particles that reach the Earth's surface, contributing to the overall background radiation.

Another notable natural source is radon gas, a radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium found in rocks and soil. Radon can infiltrate buildings through cracks in their foundations, leading to elevated concentrations indoors, particularly in poorly ventilated spaces. This accumulation makes radon a significant contributor to the background radiation dose that individuals receive.

Natural background radiation also includes terrestrial radiation, which arises from radioactive materials present in the Earth's crust, such as uranium, thorium, and potassium-40. These materials emit radiation as they decay, with varying levels of radiation found in different types of rocks and soils. Additionally, the human body itself contains small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, such as carbon-14 and potassium-40, which further contribute to our background radiation exposure.

Man-made sources of background radiation encompass medical procedures, including X-rays, CT scans, and radiation therapy, all of which utilize ionizing radiation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Although these procedures are carefully controlled and targeted, they still increase our overall exposure to background radiation. Other man-made sources include nuclear power plants, which may release small quantities of radioactive materials into the environment, as well as residual radioactive contamination from past nuclear weapons testing.

By understanding the various sources of background radiation, we can better appreciate the ways we are exposed to ionizing radiation in our daily lives and recognize the importance of managing and minimizing unnecessary exposure.
