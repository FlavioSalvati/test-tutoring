Microphones convert sound into electrical signals through the use of a diaphragm that vibrates in response to sound waves.

When sound waves—vibrations in the air—reach a microphone, they strike a thin, flexible membrane known as a diaphragm. This diaphragm is typically made from materials such as plastic or metal. As the sound waves cause the diaphragm to vibrate, these vibrations replicate the pattern of the incoming sound waves.

Attached to the diaphragm is a component responsible for converting these mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. In dynamic microphones, this component consists of a coil of wire positioned within a magnetic field. When the diaphragm moves, it causes the coil to move as well within the magnetic field, generating an electrical current via electromagnetic induction. This current produces a small electrical signal that accurately reflects the original sound wave.

In contrast, condenser microphones utilize a diaphragm placed very close to a backplate, effectively forming a capacitor. When the diaphragm vibrates, the distance between the diaphragm and the backplate changes, which in turn alters the capacitance. This variation in capacitance is then converted into an electrical signal. Notably, condenser microphones require an external power source—often provided by a battery or phantom power from a mixing console—to maintain the electrical field between the diaphragm and the backplate.

Ribbon microphones operate similarly to dynamic microphones, but they utilize a thin metal ribbon in place of the diaphragm and coil. The ribbon vibrates within a magnetic field to generate an electrical signal directly.

Each microphone type has its unique advantages and is selected based on the specific needs of the recording or amplification task at hand. A deeper understanding of how microphones function enhances our appreciation for the technology that enables us to capture and reproduce sound with accuracy.
