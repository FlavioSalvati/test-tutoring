The half-life of a radioactive isotope is defined as the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to undergo decay.

Understanding the half-life is essential for grasping the concept of radioactive decay. When a radioactive isotope decays, it converts into a different element or a different isotope of the same element. Although the process is inherently random, it adheres to a statistically predictable pattern. The half-life serves as a measure of the speed at which this decay occurs. For instance, if you begin with $100$ grams of a radioactive substance, after one half-life, only $50$ grams will remain unchanged, while the other $50$ grams will have decayed into another element or isotope.

The half-life is a characteristic constant for any specific isotope, meaning it remains unchanged regardless of the quantity of the substance or the conditions it experiences. This property makes half-life an invaluable tool for scientists. For example, carbon-14 has a half-life of approximately $5,730$ years, making it particularly useful for dating ancient organic materials through a technique known as radiocarbon dating.

Different isotopes exhibit a wide range of half-lives, from mere fractions of a second to billions of years. For example, iodine-131 has a half-life of about $8$ days, which makes it suitable for medical treatments that require a short-lived radioactive source. In contrast, uranium-238 has a half-life of approximately $4.5$ billion years, which is advantageous for dating geological formations and understanding the age of the Earth.

Grasping the concept of half-life enables us to predict how long a radioactive substance will remain active and informs us about its safe handling and application. This understanding is particularly important in fields such as archaeology, medicine, and environmental science, where knowledge of decay rates is critical for various practical applications.
