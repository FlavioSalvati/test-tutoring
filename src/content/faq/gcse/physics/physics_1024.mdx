To calculate the momentum in a system with multiple objects, you must sum the individual momenta of all objects present in that system.

Momentum serves as a measure of an object's motion and is defined mathematically by the formula:

$$
p = m \times v
$$

where $p$ represents momentum, $m$ denotes mass, and $v$ signifies velocity. In a multi-object system, you will first compute the momentum of each object separately and then add these values together to obtain the total momentum of the system.

Consider an example with two objects: Object A and Object B. To begin, you would calculate the momentum of each object. Assume Object A has a mass of $2 \, \text{kg}$ and is moving at a velocity of $3 \, \text{m/s}$. The momentum of Object A can be calculated as follows:

$$
p_A = m_A \times v_A = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 3 \, \text{m/s} = 6 \, \text{kg m/s}
$$

Next, consider Object B, which has a mass of $1 \, \text{kg}$ and is moving at a velocity of $4 \, \text{m/s}$. The momentum of Object B is calculated as:

$$
p_B = m_B \times v_B = 1 \, \text{kg} \times 4 \, \text{m/s} = 4 \, \text{kg m/s}
$$

To determine the total momentum of the system, simply add the momenta of Object A and Object B together:

$$
p_{\text{total}} = p_A + p_B = 6 \, \text{kg m/s} + 4 \, \text{kg m/s} = 10 \, \text{kg m/s}
$$

If the objects are moving in different directions, it is essential to consider their directions. Momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it possesses both magnitude and direction. For instance, if Object A is moving to the right and Object B is moving to the left, you might assign positive momentum to the right and negative momentum to the left. In this case, you would add the momenta algebraically, taking their directions into account.

Understanding how to calculate the total momentum in a multi-object system is vital for analyzing collisions and other physical interactions. This knowledge allows you to predict the outcomes of these interactions based on the principle of conservation of momentum, which asserts that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces are acting upon it.
