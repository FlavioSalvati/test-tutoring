In a series circuit, the potential difference (voltage) is distributed among the connected components.

In this type of circuit, the total potential difference provided by the power source is divided among all the components, such as resistors or bulbs. Consequently, each component experiences a portion of the total voltage. The sum of the potential differences across all components in the series circuit equals the total potential difference supplied by the power source.

To illustrate this concept, consider a series circuit containing a battery and three resistors. If the battery provides a voltage of $9$ volts, the potential difference across each resistor must add up to $9$ volts. For example, if the potential difference across the first resistor is $3$ volts, across the second is $2$ volts, and across the third is $4$ volts, we can see that:

$$
3\,\text{V} + 2\,\text{V} + 4\,\text{V} = 9\,\text{V}
$$

This confirms that the total matches the battery's output voltage.

The potential difference across each component in a series circuit is influenced by the resistance of each component. According to Ohm's Law, expressed as $V = IR$, where $V$ is the potential difference, $I$ is the current, and $R$ is the resistance, the voltage drop across a resistor in a series circuit is directly proportional to its resistance. Therefore, a resistor with a higher resistance will have a greater share of the total potential difference than one with a lower resistance.

In summary, in a series circuit, the potential difference is allocated to the components based on their resistances, and the total of these individual potential differences equals the voltage supplied by the power source. This principle is essential for understanding the operation of series circuits and for solving related problems in GCSE Physics.
