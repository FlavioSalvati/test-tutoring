Mains electricity is delivered to homes through an extensive network comprising power stations, transformers, and power lines.

The journey of electricity generation begins at power stations, where energy is produced from various sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and renewable resources such as wind and solar power. Upon generation, electricity is produced at a high voltage, a necessity for efficient long-distance transmission. This high-voltage electricity travels through transmission lines, which are the large pylons and cables commonly seen across the countryside.

To ensure the electricity is safe and usable for residential consumption, it must be stepped down to a lower voltage. This process is accomplished using transformers. The initial set of transformers, located at substations near the power stations, reduces the voltage to a level suitable for regional distribution. The electricity then flows through a network of smaller power lines to local substations.

At these local substations, another series of transformers further lowers the voltage to a safe level for household use, typically around $230$ volts in the UK. From the local substation, electricity is distributed through either underground or overhead power lines to individual homes.

Each home connects to the local distribution network via a service drop, which is the final stretch of cable that delivers electricity directly into the house. This cable connects to the home's electrical meter, which measures the amount of electricity consumed. From the meter, electricity flows into the home's consumer unit (often referred to as the fuse box), distributing power to various circuits throughout the house, thereby powering lights, appliances, and other electrical devices.

This entire process ensures that electricity is delivered efficiently and safely from power stations to homes, providing the energy essential for daily activities.
