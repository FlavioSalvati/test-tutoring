Power consumption can be observed in various domains, including household appliances, industrial machinery, transportation, and electronic devices.

### Household Appliances
Household appliances are prime examples of power consumption. For instance, a kettle utilizes electrical power to heat water, typically consuming between $2,000$ and $3,000$ watts (W). Similarly, refrigerators continuously draw power to maintain a cool environment for food, usually consuming around $100$ to $800$ W, depending on their size and energy efficiency. Washing machines and dishwashers also require significant power, often operating within the range of $1,000$ to $2,500$ W during their cycles.

### Industrial Machinery
In industrial environments, machinery and equipment consume substantial amounts of power. For example, an industrial conveyor belt system may require several kilowatts (kW) to transport materials effectively. Heavy machinery, such as cranes and forklifts, also demands considerable power, often in the range of tens to hundreds of kW, to perform tasks like lifting and moving heavy loads.

### Transportation
Transportation represents another major category of power consumption. Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly prevalent and rely on electrical power stored in batteries for operation. A typical EV may feature a battery capacity of around $60$ kilowatt-hours (kWh), which powers the motor and various onboard systems. Trains, especially electric ones, consume large quantities of power, often measured in megawatts (MW), to transport passengers and goods over long distances.

### Electronic Devices
Although smaller in scale, electronic devices are ubiquitous and collectively account for significant power usage. For example, smartphones draw power from their batteries, typically around $5$ to $10$ W during charging. Laptops and desktop computers consume more power, usually ranging from $20$ to $100$ W, depending on their usage and specifications. Notably, even when these devices are in standby mode, they continue to draw a small amount of power, contributing to overall energy consumption.

Understanding these examples helps us appreciate the diverse ways power is utilized in our daily lives and highlights the importance of managing it efficiently.
