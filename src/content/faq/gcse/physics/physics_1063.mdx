The wavelength of visible light is shorter than that of radio waves but longer than the wavelengths of ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays.

Visible light constitutes a small segment of the electromagnetic spectrum, which encompasses a wide variety of waves distinguished by their wavelengths and frequencies. The electromagnetic spectrum is organized by wavelength, ranging from the longest to the shortest. Radio waves possess the longest wavelengths, spanning approximately $1 \text{ mm}$ to over $100 \text{ km}$. These waves are commonly utilized for communication purposes, including the broadcasting of radio and television signals.

Following radio waves in the spectrum are microwaves, which have wavelengths ranging from $1 \text{ mm}$ to $1 \text{ m}$. Microwaves find applications in cooking (such as in microwave ovens) and in various forms of communication, including mobile phone networks and Wi-Fi technology.

Infrared waves come after microwaves, with wavelengths ranging from about $700 \text{ nm}$ to $1 \text{ mm}$. Infrared radiation is often associated with thermal energy, as it is emitted by warm objects. It is also widely used in devices such as remote controls and thermal imaging cameras.

Visible light, which is perceptible by the human eye, has wavelengths ranging from approximately $400 \text{ nm}$ (violet) to $700 \text{ nm}$ (red). This spectrum allows us to perceive different colors, with each color corresponding to a specific wavelength within this range. Violet light has the shortest wavelength, while red light has the longest.

Beyond the visible spectrum, ultraviolet (UV) light is found, with wavelengths from about $10 \text{ nm}$ to $400 \text{ nm}$. UV light is known for its role in causing sunburn and is also used in various sterilization processes.

X-rays have even shorter wavelengths, ranging from about $0.01 \text{ nm}$ to $10 \text{ nm}$. They are instrumental in medical imaging, allowing healthcare professionals to visualize the interior of the body.

Finally, gamma rays possess the shortest wavelengths, measuring less than $0.01 \text{ nm}$. These high-energy waves are generated by radioactive materials and certain astronomical phenomena. Gamma rays are utilized in cancer treatment and for studying the universe.

Understanding these various wavelengths enables us to appreciate how visible light fits within the broader context of the electromagnetic spectrum and highlights the diverse applications of each type of wave.
