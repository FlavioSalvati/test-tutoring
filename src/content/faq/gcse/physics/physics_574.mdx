Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction asserts that a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) in a conductor.

This law, a cornerstone of electromagnetism, was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. It elucidates how electric currents are generated by variations in magnetic fields. Specifically, according to Faraday's Law, the induced emf in a circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through that circuit. In simpler terms, if a magnet is moved near a coil of wire or if the magnetic field around the coil is altered, an electric current will be produced in the wire.

The mathematical representation of Faraday's Law is given by the formula:

$$ 
\text{emf} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} 
$$

In this equation, $\text{emf}$ denotes the electromotive force, $\Phi_B$ represents the magnetic flux, and $\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$ indicates the rate of change of magnetic flux. The negative sign in this equation arises from Lenz's Law, which states that the induced emf will always act in a direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux that caused it.

Magnetic flux, denoted as $\Phi_B$, quantifies the number of magnetic field lines passing through a given area. It is influenced by the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the angle between the magnetic field and the normal (perpendicular) to the surface of the loop. Any variation in these factors results in a change in magnetic flux, which in turn induces an emf.

Faraday's Law underpins the operation of numerous electrical devices, including transformers, electric generators, and induction cooktops. For instance, in a generator, a coil of wire rotates within a magnetic field, continuously altering the magnetic flux through the coil. This change induces an emf and generates electricity. A firm understanding of Faraday's Law is essential for comprehending how electricity is generated and utilized in various technologies.
