To determine the volume of an irregular object, you can utilize the water displacement method. This technique is both practical and effective, especially for objects that lack a regular shape.

Begin by filling a graduated cylinder or measuring jug with water. Record the initial water volume, denoted as $V_{\text{initial}}$. Next, carefully submerge the irregular object into the water, ensuring that it is fully covered and that no air bubbles are trapped beneath it. After the object is submerged, record the new water volume, referred to as $V_{\text{final}}$. The volume of the object can be calculated by finding the difference between the initial and final water volumes:

$$
V_{\text{object}} = V_{\text{final}} - V_{\text{initial}}.
$$

For instance, if the initial water level is $100 \text{ ml}$ and the water level rises to $150 \text{ ml}$ after the object is submerged, the volume of the object would be:

$$
V_{\text{object}} = 150 \text{ ml} - 100 \text{ ml} = 50 \text{ ml}.
$$

This method operates under Archimedes' principle, which asserts that the volume of fluid displaced by an object is equal to the volume of the object itself. It provides an accessible way to measure volume, particularly when mathematical formulas are not applicable due to the object's irregular shape.

When using this technique, ensure that the container is sufficiently large to hold both the water and the object without risk of overflow. Additionally, verify that the object does not dissolve or react with water, as such reactions could compromise the accuracy of your measurements. 

The water displacement method is commonly employed in laboratories and educational settings to help learners grasp the concept of volume and explore the properties of matter.
