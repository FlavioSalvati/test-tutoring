When like poles of a magnet are brought close together, they repel each other due to the interplay of magnetic forces.

Magnets possess two distinct poles: a north pole and a south pole. When the north pole of one magnet approaches the north pole of another, or when two south poles are brought together, they repel each other. This repulsion is a fundamental characteristic of magnetic fields. Each magnetic pole generates a magnetic field that exerts forces on other magnets. Like poles generate magnetic fields that interact in such a manner that they push one another apart.

The repulsive force between like poles can be understood through the concept of magnetic field lines. Magnetic field lines emanate from the north pole of a magnet and terminate at the south pole. When like poles are positioned near each other, the field lines from one magnet's north pole collide with the field lines from another magnet's north pole. This interaction causes the field lines to bend, resulting in a repulsive force. The same principle applies in the case of south poles.

The intensity of the repulsive force is influenced by both the distance between the magnets and the strength of their magnetic fields. As the like poles move closer together, the repulsive force increases. This explains why you may experience a more pronounced push when attempting to bring two like poles very close.

Grasping this concept is vital for various applications, such as in electric motors and magnetic levitation systems, where the repulsion of like poles is harnessed to generate motion or lift. It also elucidates why magnets can be used to hold objects in place or to keep them apart, depending on the orientation of their poles.
