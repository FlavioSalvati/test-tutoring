During beta decay, a neutron within the nucleus transforms into a proton, resulting in the emission of a beta particle and an antineutrino.

Beta decay is a specific type of radioactive decay that occurs when an unstable atomic nucleus seeks to attain greater stability. There are two primary types of beta decay: beta-minus ($\beta^-$) and beta-plus ($\beta^+$). 

In the case of beta-minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, an electron (referred to as a beta particle), and an antineutrino. The newly formed proton remains within the nucleus, which increases the atomic number by one, while the beta particle and antineutrino are expelled from the nucleus.

For example, in beta-minus decay, a carbon-14 nucleus (which contains $6$ protons and $8$ neutrons) decays into a nitrogen-14 nucleus (with $7$ protons and $7$ neutrons). During this process, the emitted beta particle (the electron) and the antineutrino carry away some of the energy released.

Conversely, in beta-plus decay, a proton in the nucleus is transformed into a neutron, a positron (the antimatter counterpart of an electron), and a neutrino. The neutron remains in the nucleus, which decreases the atomic number by one, while the positron and neutrino are emitted. An example of beta-plus decay is when a carbon-11 nucleus (containing $6$ protons and $5$ neutrons) decays into a boron-11 nucleus (comprising $5$ protons and $6$ neutrons).

These transformations within the nucleus during beta decay lead to the conversion of one element into another. While the atomic number changes, the mass number remains constant. This decay process is essential for unstable nuclei to achieve a more stable configuration. 

Understanding beta decay is vital in various fields, including nuclear physics, medicine, and archaeology, where it is employed in techniques such as radiocarbon dating.
