The evidence supporting the expansion of the universe primarily stems from the observation of redshift in distant galaxies.

In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble made a revolutionary discovery: galaxies are moving away from us. He noted that the light emitted from these galaxies is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum, a phenomenon referred to as redshift. This shift occurs because the wavelengths of light are stretched as galaxies recede, analogous to how the pitch of an ambulance siren decreases as it moves away from you. Hubble's observations revealed a striking pattern: the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it seems to be moving away from us. This relationship is now known as Hubble's Law.

Mathematically, Hubble's Law can be expressed as 

$$
v = H_0 \times d,
$$ 

where $ v $ represents the velocity at which a galaxy is receding, $ H_0 $ is the Hubble constant, and $ d $ is the distance to the galaxy. This linear correlation between distance and velocity provides strong evidence that the universe is expanding uniformly.

Additional evidence comes from the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR). Discovered in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, the CMBR represents the afterglow of the Big Bang and permeates the entire universe. The uniformity and slight fluctuations in this radiation offer a glimpse into the early universe, reinforcing the theory that the universe has been expanding since its formation.

Moreover, observations of distant supernovae—especially Type Ia supernovae—have contributed further evidence. These supernovae serve as "standard candles" because their intrinsic brightness is well understood. By comparing their known brightness to what we observe, astronomers can accurately determine their distance. Studies of these supernovae have indicated that not only is the universe's expansion ongoing, but it is also accelerating.

Together, the combined observations of redshift, the CMBR, and supernovae provide compelling evidence that the universe is indeed expanding.
