When gas particles are heated, they gain kinetic energy and move at increased speeds.

Upon heating a gas, the particles within it absorb energy, which is predominantly transformed into kinetic energy. This results in the particles moving more rapidly. In a gas, the particles are already in constant, random motion, but the application of heat amplifies both the speed and intensity of their movement. This phenomenon occurs because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.

As the particles accelerate, they collide with each other and the walls of their container more frequently and with greater force. This heightened frequency and intensity of collisions lead to an increase in pressure if the gas is contained in a sealed environment. Conversely, if the container is capable of expansion, such as a balloon, the volume of the gas will increase as the particles exert greater outward force.

The relationship among temperature, pressure, and volume in gases is governed by the gas laws. For instance, Charles's Law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature (measured in Kelvin) when the pressure remains constant. Similarly, Gay-Lussac's Law asserts that the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when the volume is held constant.

In summary, heating a gas causes its particles to move more rapidly, which can result in an increase in pressure or volume, depending on the surrounding conditions. This fundamental concept is essential for understanding various phenomena in physics and chemistry, including the operation of engines, the expansion of weather balloons as they ascend, and the behavior of the Earth's atmosphere.
