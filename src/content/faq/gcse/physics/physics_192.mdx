Acceleration is measured in metres per second squared, denoted as $m/s²$.

Acceleration quantifies how rapidly an object's velocity changes over time. In physics, velocity refers to the speed of an object in a specific direction. An object is said to be accelerating when it speeds up, slows down, or alters its direction of motion. The standard unit of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI) is metres per second squared, abbreviated as $m/s²$. This unit indicates the rate at which an object's velocity changes each second.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, consider the following example: if an object has an acceleration of $1 \, m/s²$, it means that its velocity increases by $1 \, m/s$ every second. For instance, if a car starts from rest and accelerates at $2 \, m/s²$, its velocity will be $2 \, m/s$ after one second. After two seconds, its velocity will reach $4 \, m/s$, and this pattern continues.

Acceleration can be calculated using the formula:

$$ 
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} 
$$

In this equation, $a$ represents acceleration, $\Delta v$ denotes the change in velocity, and $\Delta t$ signifies the change in time. The change in velocity ($\Delta v$) is expressed in metres per second ($m/s$), while the change in time ($\Delta t$) is measured in seconds ($s$). Consequently, when you divide metres per second by seconds, you obtain metres per second squared ($m/s²$).

In summary, the unit of acceleration, metres per second squared, enables us to measure how quickly an object's speed is changing. This fundamental concept is essential in physics, particularly in the study of motion and forces.
