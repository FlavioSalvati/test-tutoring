Terminal velocity refers to the constant speed an object attains when the force of gravity is counterbalanced by air resistance.

When an object falls through a fluid, such as air, it initially accelerates due to the gravitational force acting upon it. As the object's speed increases, the opposing air resistance also intensifies. Eventually, the upward force of air resistance becomes equal to the downward force of gravity. At this point, the object ceases to accelerate and continues to fall at a constant speed known as terminal velocity.

Several factors affect terminal velocity, including the object's mass, surface area, shape, and the density of the fluid through which it is falling. For instance, a skydiver in a belly-to-earth position has a larger surface area, resulting in greater air resistance and a lower terminal velocity compared to a skydiver diving headfirst.

To grasp the concept of terminal velocity, consider the forces acting on a falling object. Gravity exerts a downward force, while air resistance exerts an upward force. Initially, gravity dominates, causing the object to accelerate downwards. As the object's speed increases, air resistance builds up until it balances the force of gravity. At this equilibrium point, the net force acting on the object is zero, and the object falls at a steady rate.

In GCSE Physics, you may be tasked with calculating terminal velocity or analyzing the forces at play. It's important to remember that terminal velocity is achieved when the net force acting on the object is zero, indicating that no further acceleration occurs. This concept is vital in various real-world applications, such as designing parachutes and understanding the behavior of raindrops.
