Non-renewable energy resources encompass coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear fuels such as uranium.

These resources are defined as those that cannot be replenished within a human lifetime. Once consumed, they are permanently depleted. Coal is a solid fossil fuel that originated from plant remains over millions of years. It is primarily utilized for electricity generation and steel production. The combustion of coal releases substantial amounts of carbon dioxide, which significantly contributes to global warming.

Oil, another type of fossil fuel, is a liquid derived from ancient marine organisms. It undergoes refining to produce various essential products, including petrol, diesel, and jet fuel, all of which play a critical role in transportation. Additionally, oil is a key ingredient in the manufacture of plastics and other chemicals. However, the environmental impact of oil is profound, as oil spills and emissions from burning oil products can lead to extensive ecological damage.

Natural gas, which is predominantly composed of methane, is typically found in conjunction with oil deposits. It is commonly employed for heating, electricity generation, and as a feedstock in the chemical industry. Natural gas is considered a cleaner-burning fuel compared to coal and oil, emitting less carbon dioxide and fewer pollutants. Nonetheless, the extraction and transportation of natural gas can result in methane leaks, which are potent greenhouse gases.

Nuclear fuels, such as uranium, are harnessed in nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The process of nuclear fission involves splitting uranium atoms, which releases a substantial amount of energy. While nuclear power does not produce carbon emissions during its operation, it creates radioactive waste that requires careful management and long-term storage for thousands of years.

Understanding these non-renewable energy resources is vital for making informed decisions regarding energy consumption and its environmental impacts. As GCSE Physics students, recognizing the limitations and environmental consequences of non-renewable energy sources can enhance your appreciation for the importance of developing and utilizing renewable energy alternatives.
