Radioactive decay, specifically of carbon-14, plays a critical role in carbon dating, a technique used to estimate the age of ancient organic materials based on the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12.

Carbon dating, also known as radiocarbon dating, is a method employed to ascertain the age of organic remains. This technique relies on the radioactive decay of carbon-14 ($^{14}\text{C}$), a naturally occurring isotope of carbon. Living organisms continuously absorb carbon, including a small amount of $^{14}\text{C}$, through their diet and respiration. Upon the death of an organism, this absorption ceases, and the $^{14}\text{C}$ it contains begins to decay into nitrogen-14 ($^{14}\text{N}$) at a consistent rate defined by its half-life, which is approximately $5,730$ years.

Scientists can determine the age of a sample by measuring the remaining quantity of $^{14}\text{C}$ and comparing it to the stable carbon-12 ($^{12}\text{C}$) isotope. By analyzing the ratio of $^{14}\text{C}$ to $^{12}\text{C}$, they can estimate the time elapsed since the organism's death. This is because the amount of $^{14}\text{C}$ decreases predictably over time, while the amount of $^{12}\text{C}$ remains stable. A lower concentration of $^{14}\text{C}$ indicates that the sample is older.

For instance, if a sample contains half the amount of $^{14}\text{C}$ compared to a living organism, it signifies that one half-life, approximately $5,730$ years, has elapsed since the organism's death. Conversely, if only a quarter of the original $^{14}\text{C}$ remains, then two half-lives, or roughly $11,460$ years, have passed.

Carbon dating is particularly effective for dating materials that are up to about $50,000$ years old. Beyond this range, the residual $^{14}\text{C}$ becomes so scarce that accurate measurement becomes problematic. This technique has proven invaluable in fields such as archaeology and geology, enabling scientists to construct timelines of historical events and track environmental changes.
