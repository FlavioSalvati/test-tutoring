To calculate the total momentum before and after a collision, you must sum the individual momenta of all objects involved in the event.

Momentum is a quantitative measure of an object's motion and is determined by multiplying the object's mass by its velocity. The formula for momentum ($ p $) is given by:

$$
p = m \times v
$$

where $ m $ represents the mass and $ v $ denotes the velocity of the object. In the context of collisions, the total momentum of a closed system (comprising all objects involved) before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision, provided that no external forces are acting on the system. This fundamental principle is known as the conservation of momentum.

To find the total momentum before the collision, you calculate the momentum of each object and then sum these values. For instance, if you have two objects, A and B, with respective masses $ m_A $ and $ m_B $, and velocities $ v_A $ and $ v_B $, the total momentum before the collision can be expressed as:

$$
p_{\text{total before}} = (m_A \times v_A) + (m_B \times v_B)
$$

After the collision occurs, while the objects may have different velocities, the total momentum of the system remains unchanged. If the velocities after the collision are denoted as $ v_A' $ and $ v_B' $, the total momentum after the collision is calculated as:

$$
p_{\text{total after}} = (m_A \times v_A') + (m_B \times v_B')
$$

According to the principle of conservation of momentum, we have:

$$
p_{\text{total before}} = p_{\text{total after}}
$$

This leads to the equation:

$$
(m_A \times v_A) + (m_B \times v_B) = (m_A \times v_A') + (m_B \times v_B')
$$

Utilizing this principle allows you to analyze and solve a variety of problems involving collisions, whether they are elastic (where kinetic energy is conserved) or inelastic (where some kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy). The crucial aspect to remember is that the total momentum before and after the collision remains constant.
