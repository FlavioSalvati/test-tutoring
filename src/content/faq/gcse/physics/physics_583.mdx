Planets orbit the Sun due to the gravitational attraction between them, following elliptical paths.

The concept of elliptical orbits was first described by Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century. Kepler's First Law states that the orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun located at one of the two foci. This implies that the distance between a planet and the Sun varies as the planet traverses its orbit.

The force responsible for keeping the planets in their orbits is gravity. According to Isaac Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, every object in the universe exerts an attractive force on every other object. This force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In the context of the Solar System, the Sun's immense gravitational pull attracts the planets, ensuring they remain in their orbits.

Newton's First Law of Motion states that an object will maintain its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. For the planets, this external force is the gravitational pull of the Sun. Without this gravitational influence, the planets would continue to move in straight lines into space. Instead, the gravitational force continually alters the direction of the planets' motion, resulting in their elliptical orbits.

The speed at which a planet orbits the Sun varies based on its distance from the Sun. According to Kepler's Second Law, a line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. Consequently, planets travel faster when they are closer to the Sun and slower when they are farther away.

In summary, the interplay of gravitational forces along with the principles of motion and gravitation provides a comprehensive explanation of why and how planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths.
