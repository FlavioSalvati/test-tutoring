The density of a substance is influenced by several key factors, including its mass, volume, temperature, and pressure.

Density is defined as the mass per unit volume, mathematically expressed as:

$$
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
$$

This means that the mass and volume of a substance are the primary determinants of its density. For instance, if you have two objects with the same volume but different masses, the object with the greater mass will exhibit a higher density. Conversely, if two objects have the same mass but differing volumes, the one with the smaller volume will be denser.

Temperature also significantly impacts density. Generally, as the temperature of a substance increases, the kinetic energy of its particles rises, causing them to move more vigorously and occupy more space. This results in the expansion of the substance, which increases its volume while the mass remains unchanged, ultimately leading to a decrease in density. A common example of this phenomenon is water: when heated, it expands and becomes less dense, which explains why hot water tends to rise above cold water.

Pressure similarly affects density, particularly in gases. An increase in pressure compresses gas particles, forcing them closer together, which reduces the volume and increases the density. This is why air is denser at sea level, where atmospheric pressure is higher, compared to higher altitudes where the pressure is lower.

In summary, the density of a substance is primarily determined by its mass and volume, but it can also be influenced by changes in temperature and pressure. Understanding these factors allows us to predict and explain the behavior of various materials under different conditions.
