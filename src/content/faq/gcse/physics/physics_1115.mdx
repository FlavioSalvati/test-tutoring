An electric motor is a device that transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy through the interaction of magnetic fields and electric currents.

Electric motors function based on the principles of electromagnetism. When an electric current flows through a conductor, it generates a magnetic field around that conductor. In the case of electric motors, this conductor is typically wound into a coil, known as an armature, which is situated within a magnetic field produced by either permanent magnets or electromagnets.

The armature is mounted on a shaft positioned between the poles of a magnet. When current passes through the armature, the magnetic field generated by the current interacts with the magnetic field of the permanent magnets. This interaction produces a force on the armature, resulting in its rotation. This rotational movement is the mechanical energy output of the motor.

To maintain continuous rotation, the direction of the current in the armature must change periodically. This is accomplished through a commutator in a DC motor or by alternating the current in an AC motor. The commutator consists of a split ring that reverses the direction of the current every half turn, ensuring that the armature continues to spin in the same direction.

In summary, the essential components of an electric motor include the armature, the magnetic field (which can be created by permanent magnets or electromagnets), and a mechanism to switch the direction of the current (such as a commutator or alternating current). By understanding these components and their interactions, we can appreciate how electric motors efficiently convert electrical energy into valuable mechanical energy, powering a wide range of devices from household appliances to industrial machinery.
