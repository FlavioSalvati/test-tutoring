The average level of background radiation is approximately $2.4$ millisieverts ($\text{mSv}$) per year.

Background radiation originates from a variety of natural and artificial sources. Natural sources include cosmic rays from outer space, radon gas emitted from the Earth's crust, and even certain foods that we consume. Cosmic rays consist of high-energy particles that continuously bombard the Earth from space. Radon gas, a naturally occurring radioactive gas that seeps from the ground, significantly contributes to background radiation, particularly in regions with elevated levels of uranium in the soil.

On the other hand, artificial sources of background radiation include medical procedures such as X-rays and CT scans, as well as fallout from nuclear tests and accidents. Although these artificial sources do contribute to the overall background radiation levels, their impact is generally much smaller compared to that of natural sources.

Radiation dose is measured in sieverts ($\text{Sv}$), but because the sievert is a relatively large unit, we often use millisieverts ($\text{mSv}$) for convenience, where $1 \, \text{Sv}$ is equivalent to $1,000 \, \text{mSv}$. On average, an individual is exposed to about $2.4 \, \text{mSv}$ of background radiation each year. This exposure can vary based on factors such as geographical location, lifestyle, and occupation. For instance, individuals living at higher altitudes or in areas with significant natural radioactivity may experience elevated levels of background radiation.

Understanding background radiation is crucial as it enables us to evaluate the risks associated with additional exposure from medical procedures or other sources. While the average background radiation level is generally regarded as safe, it is essential to minimize unnecessary exposure to safeguard our health.
