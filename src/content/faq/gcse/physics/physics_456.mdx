The formula for calculating work done is expressed as:

$$ W = F \times d \times \cos(\theta) $$

In physics, work done ($ W $) quantifies the energy transferred when a force ($ F $) moves an object over a certain distance ($ d $). The angle ($ \theta $) represents the angle between the direction of the applied force and the direction of the object's movement.

To clarify, when a force is applied directly in the direction of movement (i.e., when $ \theta = 0^\circ $), the cosine of $ 0^\circ $ is $ 1 $. Thus, the formula simplifies to:

$$ W = F \times d $$

In this case, all of the applied force contributes to the work done. For example, if you push a box with a force of $ 10 \, \text{N} $ over a distance of $ 5 \, \text{m} $, the work done is calculated as:

$$ W = 10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{J} $$

where $ \text{J} $ represents joules, the unit of work.

Conversely, when the force is applied at an angle to the direction of movement, only the component of the force that acts in the direction of movement does work. For instance, if you pull a sled using a rope at an angle of $ 30^\circ $ to the horizontal, the cosine of $ 30^\circ $ (approximately $ 0.866 $) must be taken into account. If the applied force is still $ 10 \, \text{N} $ and the sled moves $ 5 \, \text{m} $, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$ W = 10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} \times \cos(30^\circ) \approx 10 \times 5 \times 0.866 = 43.3 \, \text{J} $$

Comprehending this formula is essential for analyzing different scenarios where forces are applied at various angles, making it a fundamental concept in GCSE Physics.
