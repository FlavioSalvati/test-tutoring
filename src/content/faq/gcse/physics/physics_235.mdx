The relationship between temperature and radiation emission is characterized by the fact that hotter objects emit more radiation, and do so at shorter wavelengths.

When an object is heated, it radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. This radiation can manifest as visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, or other types of electromagnetic radiation. The quantity and type of radiation emitted are directly related to the object's temperature. As temperature increases, the total amount of radiation emitted also increases. This occurs because the particles within the object gain energy and move more vigorously, resulting in more frequent and energetic radiation emissions.

A key concept in this discussion is blackbody radiation. A blackbody is an idealized theoretical object that perfectly absorbs all incident radiation and emits radiation solely based on its temperature. The relationship between temperature and radiation for a blackbody is articulated by Planck's law, which indicates that as the temperature of a blackbody rises, it emits more radiation across all wavelengths. Importantly, the peak wavelength—the wavelength at which the maximum amount of radiation is emitted—shifts to shorter wavelengths as temperature increases. This phenomenon is described by Wien's displacement law.

For instance, consider a piece of metal heated to several hundred degrees Celsius; it will emit a reddish glow, primarily in the infrared and red regions of the spectrum. If the metal is heated further to several thousand degrees, it will emit a white glow, spanning the visible spectrum and extending into the ultraviolet range. This is why stars, which possess extremely high temperatures, emit both visible light and ultraviolet radiation.

In summary, the hotter an object becomes, the more radiation it emits, and the peak of this radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths. This fundamental principle explains a variety of phenomena, from the warm glow of a hot stove to the brilliant light emitted by stars.
