Electricity is transmitted over long distances through high-voltage power lines to minimize energy loss.

When electricity is generated at power stations, it must be transported to homes and businesses, which may be located many miles away. To facilitate this process efficiently, the electricity is first elevated to a high voltage using transformers. High voltage is essential because it reduces the current flowing through the power lines. Since energy loss due to resistance in the wires is proportional to the square of the current, decreasing the current significantly reduces these losses.

The high-voltage electricity is then transmitted through a network of power lines known as the National Grid. These power lines are typically supported by tall pylons, which keep them safely elevated above the ground. The materials used for these lines, such as aluminum or copper, are selected for their excellent conductivity and durability.

As the electricity approaches its final destination, it must be made safe for use in homes and businesses. This is accomplished by stepping down the voltage with another set of transformers. The voltage is reduced to safer levels, typically $230$ volts in the UK, which is appropriate for household appliances and other everyday applications.

Throughout this entire process, various safety measures are implemented to protect both the infrastructure and the public. Insulators are employed to prevent high-voltage electricity from coming into contact with the pylons or the ground. Additionally, circuit breakers and other protective devices are installed to quickly disconnect the power in the event of faults or overloads.

By utilizing high-voltage transmission, the National Grid ensures that electricity can be delivered efficiently and reliably over long distances, minimizing energy loss and maintaining a stable supply for everyone.
