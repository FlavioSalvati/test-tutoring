To determine the average speed of an object, you divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken. 

Average speed is a quantitative measure of how quickly an object moves over a specific distance. It can be expressed using the formula:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

To use this formula, you need two essential pieces of information: the total distance the object has traveled and the total time it took to cover that distance. For instance, if a car travels $150$ kilometres in $3$ hours, the average speed can be calculated by dividing $150$ km by $3$ hours, resulting in an average speed of $50$ km/h.

It is crucial to ensure that the units for distance and time are consistent. If the distance is measured in kilometres and the time in hours, the average speed will be expressed in kilometres per hour (km/h). Conversely, if the distance is in metres and the time is in seconds, the average speed will be in metres per second (m/s).

In practical situations, objects often do not maintain a constant speed, making the average speed a useful overall measure of how fast the object was moving during the entire journey. For example, if you walk to school and it takes you $30$ minutes to cover a distance of $2$ kilometres, your average speed would be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2 \text{ km}}{0.5 \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ km/h}
$$

Keep in mind that average speed does not account for variations in speed throughout the journey; it simply provides a single value that represents the overall rate of travel. This concept is fundamental in physics and is essential for analyzing motion in various contexts, from everyday activities to complex scientific studies.
