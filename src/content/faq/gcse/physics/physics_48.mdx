Domestic electrical systems incorporate several essential safety devices, including circuit breakers, fuses, residual current devices (RCDs), and earthing systems, to ensure safe operation and reduce the risk of electrical hazards.

**Circuit Breakers**  
Circuit breakers are automatic switches that protect electrical circuits from damage due to overload or short circuits. When the current flowing through the circuit exceeds a safe threshold, the circuit breaker trips, interrupting the electrical supply. This mechanism prevents overheating and potential fires. Notably, circuit breakers can be manually reset after addressing the underlying issue, making them reusable and convenient.

**Fuses**  
Fuses serve a similar purpose but operate on a simpler principle. A fuse contains a thin wire that melts when the current exceeds a specified limit, thereby breaking the circuit and halting the flow of electricity. Unlike circuit breakers, once a fuse has "blown," it must be replaced. Fuses are commonly found in plug tops and older electrical systems.

**Residual Current Devices (RCDs)**  
Residual Current Devices (RCDs) are specialized devices designed to protect against electric shock. They monitor the difference in current between the live and neutral wires. If an imbalance is detected, it indicates that current may be leaking, potentially through a person who has come into contact with a live wire. In such cases, the RCD swiftly disconnects the power supply, significantly reducing the risk of serious injury or fatality. RCDs are typically installed in modern consumer units (fuse boxes) and can also be used in individual sockets.

**Earthing Systems**  
Earthing systems are another vital safety feature in electrical installations. They provide a safe pathway for electrical current to flow into the ground in the event of a fault, thereby minimizing the risk of electric shocks. Metal components of electrical appliances are connected to the earth wire, ensuring that if a live wire contacts the metal casing, the current will safely flow to the ground instead of passing through a person.

Together, these safety devices work in concert to ensure that domestic electrical systems operate safely, effectively protecting individuals and property from electrical hazards.
