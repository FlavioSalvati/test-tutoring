The unit of work done in physics is the joule, denoted as $J$.

In the context of physics, work done quantifies the transfer of energy that occurs when a force causes an object to move over a distance. The joule is the standard unit for measuring work, defined as the amount of work performed when a force of one newton moves an object one meter in the direction of the force. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
1 \, J = 1 \, N \cdot m
$$

where $N$ represents newtons and $m$ represents meters.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, consider the scenario of pushing a box across the floor. If you apply a force of one newton to the box and move it one meter, you have performed one joule of work. The general formula for calculating work done is:

$$
W = F \times d \times \cos(\theta)
$$

In this equation, $W$ represents work done, $F$ is the force applied, $d$ is the distance moved, and $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the force and the direction of movement. In simpler situations where the force and the movement are perfectly aligned, $\theta$ is $0$ degrees, and since $\cos(0) = 1$, the formula simplifies to:

$$
W = F \times d
$$

It is also important to recognize that work can be expressed in various units depending on the context. For larger quantities of work, kilojoules ($kJ$) are often used, where:

$$
1 \, kJ = 1000 \, J
$$

Additionally, you may encounter older units such as foot-pounds or ergs in certain fields; however, the joule remains the standard unit in the International System of Units (SI).

A solid understanding of the units of work done is essential for solving physics problems, as it allows for the quantification of energy transfer in various processes, ranging from lifting objects to operating machinery.
