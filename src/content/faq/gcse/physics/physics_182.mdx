Atmospheric pressure is measured using a device known as a barometer, which can be categorized into two types: the mercury barometer and the aneroid barometer.

A mercury barometer consists of a glass tube filled with mercury that is inverted into a basin also filled with mercury. The atmospheric pressure exerts a downward force on the mercury in the basin, causing the mercury in the tube to rise. The height of the mercury column, typically measured in millimeters of mercury ($\text{mmHg}$), indicates the atmospheric pressure. At sea level, standard atmospheric pressure is $760 \, \text{mmHg}$.

In contrast, an aneroid barometer operates without liquid. It features a small, flexible metal chamber known as an aneroid cell. This cell is sealed and partially evacuated of air. Variations in atmospheric pressure cause the cell to either expand or contract. These movements are mechanically amplified and displayed on a dial, commonly in units of millibars ($\text{mb}$) or hectopascals ($\text{hPa}$), where $1 \, \text{hPa} = 1 \, \text{mb}$. The standard atmospheric pressure at sea level for this type of barometer is $1013.25 \, \text{hPa}$.

Both types of barometers are instrumental in monitoring weather conditions. For instance, a declining barometer reading often indicates an approaching low-pressure system, which can lead to inclement weather. Conversely, an increasing barometer reading suggests the arrival of a high-pressure system, typically associated with fair weather.

Understanding how to measure atmospheric pressure is essential in fields such as meteorology and aviation, as well as in everyday activities like hiking, where fluctuations in pressure can influence weather forecasts and altitude readings.
