Archimedes' principle states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by that object.

This principle is a cornerstone of physics and provides insight into the behavior of objects in fluids, such as water. When an object is submerged, the fluid exerts an upward force on it, known as the buoyant force. The magnitude of this buoyant force is precisely equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

In simpler terms, when you drop an object into water, it displaces some water as it submerges. The weight of the displaced water corresponds to the buoyant force acting on the object. If the buoyant force exceeds the weight of the object, the object will float; conversely, if the buoyant force is less than the object's weight, it will sink.

For instance, when you place a block of wood in water, it floats because the buoyant force—equal to the weight of the water displaced by the wood—is greater than the weight of the wood itself. In contrast, a stone sinks because its weight surpasses the buoyant force acting on it.

Archimedes' principle is not only vital for understanding everyday occurrences but also has numerous practical applications. It plays a crucial role in the design of ships and submarines, ensuring they can float and maneuver effectively in water. Additionally, this principle aids in measuring the density of various objects and fluids, which is essential in a wide range of scientific and industrial processes.

Grasping Archimedes' principle can also enhance your problem-solving skills related to buoyancy, particularly in your GCSE Physics exams. By understanding the relationship between the buoyant force and the weight of the displaced fluid, you can predict whether an object will float or sink and calculate the relevant forces involved.
