To measure the refraction of light through a lens, you will need a ray box, a protractor, and a sheet of paper. 

Begin by setting up your equipment. Place the lens on the paper and carefully outline its shape. Next, use the ray box to project a narrow beam of light onto the lens. It is advisable to conduct this experiment in a dimly lit room to enhance visibility of the light beam.

Once the light beam is directed at the lens, trace the path of the incoming light ray, known as the incident ray, as well as the path of the outgoing light ray, referred to as the refracted ray. With the protractor, measure the angles of incidence and refraction. The angle of incidence, denoted as $i$, is the angle between the incident ray and the normal lineâ€”an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the surface of the lens at the point of incidence. The angle of refraction, denoted as $r$, is the angle between the refracted ray and the same normal line.

By comparing these angles, you can analyze the degree to which the light bends as it passes through the lens. This bending occurs due to the change in the speed of light as it transitions from one medium (air) into another medium (the lens material). The extent of this bending is influenced by the refractive index of the lens material.

For a more comprehensive analysis, you can apply Snell's Law, which asserts that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction remains constant and is equal to the refractive index. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$ 
n = \frac{\sin(i)}{\sin(r)} 
$$

In this equation, $n$ represents the refractive index, $i$ is the angle of incidence, and $r$ is the angle of refraction. By accurately measuring these angles and utilizing Snell's Law, you can determine the refractive index of the lens material, thereby gaining a deeper insight into the behavior of light as it traverses through the lens.
