To calculate the total resistance in parallel circuits, we use the formula:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots
$$

In parallel circuits, the total resistance differs from that in series circuits. Rather than simply summing the individual resistances, we take the reciprocal (or inverse) of the total resistance, which equals the sum of the reciprocals of each resistor's resistance. This phenomenon occurs because, in a parallel circuit, the current has multiple paths to flow through, which effectively decreases the overall resistance.

Letâ€™s take a closer look with an example involving three resistors: $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$. The formula to determine the total resistance ($R_{\text{total}}$) remains:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}
$$

Assume we have the following resistor values: $R_1 = 6 \, \Omega$, $R_2 = 3 \, \Omega$, and $R_3 = 2 \, \Omega$. We can calculate the total resistance as follows:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}
$$

To proceed, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which in this case is $6$:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{3}{6}
$$

Now, we can add the fractions together:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{6}{6}
$$

Since $\frac{6}{6}$ equals $1$, we have:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = 1
$$

To find $R_{\text{total}}$, we take the reciprocal of $1$:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = 1 \, \Omega
$$

Thus, the total resistance in this parallel circuit is $1 \, \Omega$. This calculation method accurately reflects how the current divides across the various paths in a parallel circuit, resulting in a lower total resistance than any individual resistor.
