To determine acceleration from a velocity-time graph, you need to calculate the gradient (or slope) of the graph.

Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. On a velocity-time graph, this is visually represented by the gradient of the line. If the graph is linear (a straight line), the acceleration remains constant. To calculate the gradient, select two distinct points on the line, which we will denote as $(t_1, v_1)$ and $(t_2, v_2)$, where $t$ represents time and $v$ represents velocity.

The formula for calculating the gradient, and consequently the acceleration, is given by:

$$ 
\text{Acceleration} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} 
$$

In this formula, $\Delta v$ represents the change in velocity, calculated by subtracting the initial velocity ($v_1$) from the final velocity ($v_2$). Similarly, $\Delta t$ signifies the change in time, derived by subtracting the initial time ($t_1$) from the final time ($t_2$). The acceleration is then obtained by dividing the change in velocity by the change in time.

For instance, consider a scenario where a car's velocity increases from $10 \, \text{m/s}$ to $30 \, \text{m/s}$ over a time interval of $5 \, \text{s}$. The acceleration can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\text{Acceleration} = \frac{30 \, \text{m/s} - 10 \, \text{m/s}}{5 \, \text{s} - 0 \, \text{s}} = \frac{20 \, \text{m/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 
$$

If the velocity-time graph is curved, it indicates that the acceleration is not constant. In such cases, you need to determine the gradient of the tangent line to the curve at the specific point in time of interest. This involves drawing a straight line that just touches the curve at that point, and then calculating its gradient using the aforementioned method.

It's important to note that a positive gradient signifies positive acceleration (indicating an increase in speed), while a negative gradient denotes negative acceleration (indicating a decrease in speed). If the line is horizontal, the gradient is zero, which means there is no acceleration, and the velocity remains constant.
