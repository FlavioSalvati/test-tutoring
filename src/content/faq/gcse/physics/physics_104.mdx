A Geiger-Muller counter is an instrument designed to detect and quantify ionising radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays.

Often referred to simply as a Geiger counter, this device operates using a Geiger-Muller tube, which is filled with a gas that becomes ionised in the presence of radiation. When radiation interacts with the gas, it ionises the gas molecules, resulting in the generation of electrical pulses. The Geiger counter detects these pulses, and the frequency of the pulses over a specified time interval provides a measure of the radiation's intensity.

The Geiger-Muller tube is the core component of the counter. It consists of a central wire anode and a cylindrical cathode, across which a high voltage is applied. When ionising radiation enters the tube, it ionises the gas, producing positive ions and free electrons. These charged particles are drawn toward the electrodes, initiating a chain reaction of further ionisations that culminates in a detectable electrical pulse.

Geiger counters find applications across a variety of fields. In the medical sector, they are vital for ensuring safe radiation levels during diagnostic imaging and cancer therapies. In environmental science, they are used to monitor background radiation and identify contamination. Within nuclear power plants, Geiger counters help maintain safety by detecting radiation leaks and monitoring radiation levels. Additionally, they are employed in research and educational settings to study radioactive materials and the effects of radiation.

For GCSE Physics students, understanding the functionality of a Geiger-Muller counter is essential for grasping the fundamental concepts of radiation detection and safety. The device's capability to detect various types of radiation—namely, alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays—illustrates its versatility and significance in numerous scientific and industrial contexts. By exploring Geiger counters, students gain valuable insights into the practical aspects of radiation and its measurement, which is a crucial component of the physics curriculum.
