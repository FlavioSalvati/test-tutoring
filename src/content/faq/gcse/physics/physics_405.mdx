Protons and neutrons reside within the nucleus of an atom, while electrons orbit around the nucleus in designated energy levels or shells.

In an atom, protons and neutrons are densely packed in the central region known as the nucleus. This nucleus is remarkably dense and contains nearly all of the atom's mass. Protons are positively charged particles, whereas neutrons are neutral, carrying no charge. The atomic number, which is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus, determines the identity of the element. For instance, hydrogen has one proton, giving it an atomic number of $1$, while carbon, with six protons, has an atomic number of $6$.

Electrons, which are negatively charged, move around the nucleus within regions referred to as energy levels or shells. These shells are not tangible structures but rather areas where electrons are likely to be found. The first energy level can accommodate up to $2$ electrons, the second can hold up to $8$, and this pattern continues with increasing levels. Electrons are significantly lighter than protons and neutrons, and their configuration within these shells plays a crucial role in defining the atom's chemical properties and its interactions with other atoms.

The arrangement of electrons in shells is essential for understanding chemical reactions. Atoms achieve maximum stability when their outermost shell is fully occupied. Consequently, atoms will either gain, lose, or share electrons to fill their outer shell, which can result in the formation of ions or molecules. For example, sodium (Na) has one electron in its outermost shell and typically loses that electron to attain a full shell, thereby becoming a positively charged ion, denoted as Na$^+$.

In summary, the nucleus contains protons and neutrons, while electrons orbit the nucleus in energy levels, which significantly influences the chemical behavior of the atom. Understanding this configuration is vital for explaining the reactivity of elements and forms the foundation of the fields of chemistry and physics.
