To measure the speed of sound in air, you can conduct a straightforward experiment that involves timing how long it takes for sound to travel a known distance.

### Experiment Setup

1. **Choose an Open Space**: Select a large, unobstructed area where you can measure a straight-line distance, such as a field or a long hallway.
   
2. **Measure the Distance**: Use a tape measure or a trundle wheel to measure a specific distance. For instance, you might choose a distance of $100$ meters.

### Conducting the Experiment

1. **Position Participants**: Have one person stand at the starting point with a sound-producing device, such as a clapper or a starting pistol. The second person should stand at the end point equipped with a stopwatch.

2. **Initiate the Timing**: When the sound is produced, the person at the end point starts the stopwatch as soon as they see the visual cue (like the clapper closing or the flash from the starting pistol) and stops it when they hear the sound. The recorded time is the duration it takes for the sound to travel the measured distance.

### Calculating Speed

To calculate the speed of sound, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}.
$$

For example, if the distance is $100$ meters and the recorded time is $0.29$ seconds, the speed of sound can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{speed} \approx \frac{100 \text{ m}}{0.29 \text{ s}} \approx 344.83 \text{ m/s}.
$$

### Factors Influencing Speed

It is essential to recognize that the speed of sound can vary based on several factors, including temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Typically, at room temperature (around $20^\circ C$), the speed of sound in air is approximately $343$ meters per second.

### Improving Accuracy

For more reliable results, consider repeating the experiment multiple times and averaging the recorded times. This approach offers a practical and effective means to measure the speed of sound in air.
