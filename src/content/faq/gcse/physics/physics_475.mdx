To ensure a safe and effective force-extension experiment, follow these guidelines for setup and conduct:

1. **Stability of Apparatus**: Begin by confirming that your apparatus is stable. This involves checking that the clamp stand is securely fastened to the bench and that the spring is correctly attached to both the stand and the mass hanger. A stable setup is crucial to prevent any accidental toppling of equipment, which could lead to injuries or damage.

2. **Wear Safety Goggles**: Always wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from potential hazards. In the event that the spring snaps or a mass falls, goggles will provide essential protection. This precaution is a simple yet effective way to ensure your safety during the experiment.

3. **Avoid Overloading the Spring**: Be mindful not to overload the spring with excessive weight. Each spring has a maximum load it can bear before undergoing permanent deformation or breaking. It is advisable to start with smaller masses and gradually increase the weight while closely observing the spring's behavior. If you notice any signs of excessive stretching or distortion, cease adding more weight immediately.

4. **Handle Masses Carefully**: When working with weights, handle them with care. Dropping masses can damage the equipment and pose a risk of injury. To maintain control and prevent accidents, always use both hands when adding or removing weights.

5. **Maintain a Tidy Workspace**: Keep your workspace organized and free from unnecessary items. A clutter-free environment minimizes the risk of tripping or inadvertently knocking over equipment. Stay aware of your surroundings and ensure that your classmates are also adhering to safety protocols.

By adhering to these precautions, you can conduct the force-extension experiment in a safe and effective manner. This will allow you to focus on exploring the principles of Hooke's Law and the relationship between force and extension.
