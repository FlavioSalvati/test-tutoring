Double-glazed windows are designed to minimize energy transfer by trapping air or an inert gas between two panes of glass, effectively reducing heat loss and gain.

The structure of double-glazed windows consists of two layers of glass separated by a gap filled with air or an inert gas like argon. This configuration is particularly effective at decreasing energy transfer through three primary mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation. The air or gas trapped between the panes serves as an insulating barrier. Notably, air and gases such as argon are poor conductors of heat, which significantly slows the rate at which heat can pass through the window.

When it comes to conduction, the two layers of glass, along with the insulating gas-filled gap, limit the amount of heat that can be transferred directly through the material of the window. Since glass is a better conductor of heat than air or argon, the presence of the gas-filled space means that less heat is conducted from the warmer side to the cooler side.

Convection is likewise minimized in double-glazed windows. In a single-glazed window, air can circulate freely, facilitating the transfer of heat from the warm interior to the cooler exterior. However, in double-glazed windows, the narrow gap between the panes restricts significant air movement, thereby reducing heat transfer through convection.

Radiation is yet another form of energy transfer that double-glazed windows help to mitigate. The two glass layers can be treated with low-emissivity (low-E) coatings that reflect infrared radiation. This means that heat generated inside the home is reflected back into the living space, while solar heat is deflected away, helping to maintain a cooler interior during the summer and a warmer atmosphere during the winter.

In summary, double-glazed windows are an effective solution for enhancing energy efficiency in homes. They reduce the reliance on heating and cooling systems, leading to lower energy consumption and reduced utility bills.
