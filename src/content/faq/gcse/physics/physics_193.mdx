Motion along a straight line is characterized by three fundamental concepts: displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Each of these concepts encompasses both magnitude and direction, making them vector quantities.

We begin with **displacement**, which refers to the change in an object's position. Displacement is defined as a vector quantity, meaning it has both a numerical value (magnitude) and a direction. For example, if you walk $5$ meters to the east, your displacement can be expressed as $5$ meters east. This is distinct from distance, which measures the total length of the path traveled without regard to direction.

Next, we explore **velocity**, which represents the rate of change of displacement over time. Like displacement, velocity is also a vector quantity. It provides information about how fast an object is moving and in which direction. For instance, if a car travels at a speed of $60$ kilometers per hour to the north, we describe its velocity as $60 \, \text{km/h}$ north. If the car alters its direction but maintains the same speed, its velocity changes due to the change in direction.

**Acceleration** is the rate at which velocity changes over time. It indicates how quickly an object is speeding up or slowing down and is also a vector quantity. For example, if a car accelerates from rest to a velocity of $60 \, \text{km/h}$ in $10$ seconds, we say it has an acceleration. If the car decelerates, it experiences negative acceleration, commonly referred to as deceleration.

To analyze motion along a straight line, we often utilize graphical representations. A **displacement-time graph** illustrates how an object's position varies with time, where the slope of the graph indicates the object's velocity. Conversely, a **velocity-time graph** displays how velocity changes over time, and the slope of this graph represents acceleration. By comprehending these concepts and employing these graphical tools, we can effectively describe and predict the motion of objects moving along a straight line.
