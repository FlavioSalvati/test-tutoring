In an elastic collision, the total momentum of the system is conserved. 

This means that the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. In other words, the sum of the momenta of all objects involved remains constant throughout the interaction. Since momentum is a vector quantity, it possesses both magnitude and direction. Therefore, when analyzing momentum during collisions, it's essential to consider both the speed and direction of the involved objects.

To clarify further, momentum is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{momentum} = \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}
$$

In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This sets elastic collisions apart from inelastic collisions, where some kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat or sound.

Consider the example of two snooker balls colliding on a table. Prior to the collision, each ball has a specific momentum determined by its mass and velocity. During an elastic collision, the total momentum of the two balls before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision. For instance, if one ball is stationary while the other is in motion, post-collision, the moving ball may slow down or alter its direction, while the previously stationary ball begins to move. The crucial aspect is that the overall sum of their momenta remains unchanged.

In mathematical terms, let us denote two objects, A and B, with masses $ m_A $ and $ m_B $, and velocities $ v_A $ and $ v_B $ before the collision, and velocities $ v'_A $ and $ v'_B $ after the collision. The conservation of momentum can be expressed as:

$$
m_A v_A + m_B v_B = m_A v'_A + m_B v'_B
$$

This principle of momentum conservation is fundamental in physics, as it allows us to predict the outcomes of collisions and understand the behavior of moving objects.
