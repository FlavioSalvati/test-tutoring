The amplitude of a wave is defined as the maximum displacement of particles from their equilibrium (rest) position.

To elaborate, the amplitude quantifies how far the particles in a medium move from their rest position as the wave propagates. For transverse waves, such as water waves or waves on a string, the amplitude can be measured by determining the height of the wave crest (the highest point) or the depth of the wave trough (the lowest point) relative to the rest position. The rest position is represented by the central line of the medium, which would be present if no wave were occurring.

In the case of longitudinal waves, such as sound waves, the amplitude is associated with the maximum degree of compression or rarefaction of the particles in the medium. Here, you would measure the extent to which the particles are compressed or spread apart compared to their normal spacing.

To accurately measure amplitude, various tools can be employed, depending on the type of wave being analyzed. For instance, with water waves, a ruler can be used to measure the height of a crest above the still water level. For sound waves, a microphone connected to an oscilloscope can be utilized, which visualizes the wave as a graph of pressure against time. The amplitude in this context is represented by the maximum height of the wave on the graph.

Understanding amplitude is crucial because it directly correlates with the energy carried by the wave. A wave with a larger amplitude transmits more energy. For example, louder sounds correspond to higher amplitudes, while larger ocean waves possess greater energy and can exert more force when they reach the shore.
