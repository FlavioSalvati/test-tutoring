To calculate specific latent heat, you need to divide the energy change by the mass of the substance.

Specific latent heat quantifies the energy required to change the state of a unit mass of a substance without altering its temperature. There are two primary types of specific latent heat: latent heat of fusion, which pertains to melting and freezing, and latent heat of vaporization, which relates to boiling and condensing.

The formula for calculating specific latent heat $ L $ is given by:

$$ 
L = \frac{Q}{m} 
$$

where $ Q $ represents the energy change in joules (J), and $ m $ denotes the mass of the substance in kilograms (kg).

For instance, to determine the specific latent heat of fusion for ice, you would measure the energy required to melt a specific mass of ice into water at $ 0^\circ C $. Suppose you supply $ 334,000 $ joules of energy to melt $ 1 $ kilogram of ice. By applying the formula, the specific latent heat of fusion can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
L = \frac{334,000 \text{ J}}{1 \text{ kg}} = 334,000 \text{ J/kg} 
$$

In a similar manner, to calculate the specific latent heat of vaporization, you would measure the energy needed to convert a specific mass of liquid into gas at its boiling point. If $ 2,260,000 $ joules of energy are required to vaporize $ 1 $ kilogram of water at $ 100^\circ C $, then the specific latent heat of vaporization would be:

$$ 
L = \frac{2,260,000 \text{ J}}{1 \text{ kg}} = 2,260,000 \text{ J/kg} 
$$

Understanding specific latent heat is vital for various practical applications, such as designing heating and cooling systems, as well as in natural processes like the water cycle. It enables us to analyze the energy requirements for phase changes, which is essential for effective energy use and management.
