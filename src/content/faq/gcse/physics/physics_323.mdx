To experimentally investigate the factors that affect electrical resistance, you can change one variable at a time while measuring the resistance.

**Materials Required:**
First, gather the necessary materials:
- A power supply
- A variable resistor (rheostat)
- An ammeter
- A voltmeter
- Connecting wires
- Wires of various lengths and types
Additionally, have a ruler and a micrometer on hand to accurately measure the wire's length and diameter.

**Investigating Wire Length:**
Begin by examining how the length of the wire impacts resistance. Connect the wire to the circuit, ensuring that the ammeter is in series and the voltmeter is in parallel with the wire. To determine the resistance, record the voltage ($V$) and current ($I$), and apply Ohm's Law, given by the formula:

$$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$

Repeat this process for wires of different lengths while keeping all other variables constant. Once you have gathered the data, plot a graph of resistance ($R$) against length ($L$) to analyze the relationship.

**Exploring Cross-Sectional Area:**
Next, investigate how the cross-sectional area of the wire influences resistance. Use wires made of the same material but differing in diameter. Measure the diameter using a micrometer, then calculate the cross-sectional area ($A$) using the formula:

$$ A = \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 $$

Set up the circuit as before, and measure the resistance for each wire. Create a plot of resistance ($R$) against cross-sectional area ($A$) to observe how they correlate.

**Examining Wire Material:**
You can also explore the effect of wire material on resistance. Choose wires that are the same length and diameter but constructed from different materials, such as copper, aluminum, and nichrome. Measure the resistance for each material, and compare the results. This experiment will help you understand how the intrinsic properties of different materials affect resistance.

**Investigating Temperature Effects:**
Finally, consider the influence of temperature on resistance. Start with a wire at room temperature and measure its resistance. Then, gently heat the wire using a hairdryer or hot plate, and measure the resistance at various temperatures. Exercise caution to prevent overheating the wire. Record your findings and analyze how resistance changes with temperature.

By systematically varying one factor at a time and keeping all other factors constant, you can effectively investigate and gain insights into the various factors that influence electrical resistance.
