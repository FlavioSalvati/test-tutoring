Reversing the direction of current in an electric motor reverses the direction of its rotation.

In an electric motor, the direction of rotation is determined by the flow of current through its coils. This is due to the interaction between the magnetic field generated by the current and the permanent magnets located within the motor. When the current flows in one direction, it produces a magnetic field that interacts with the magnets in a specific manner, causing the motor to rotate in a designated direction.

When you reverse the direction of the current, the magnetic field generated by the coils also reverses. This alteration in the magnetic field results in a reversal of the forces acting on the motor's rotor, which in turn makes the rotor spin in the opposite direction. This principle is illustrated by Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, which can be used to predict the direction of force on a current-carrying conductor situated within a magnetic field.

In practical terms, this means that if you switch the connections of the power supply to the motor, it will begin to rotate in the opposite direction. This fundamental concept is applicable to various devices, ranging from simple toys to intricate machinery.

Understanding this principle is essential for GCSE Physics students, as it forms the basis for many topics related to electromagnetism and electric circuits. Moreover, it has significant real-world applications, such as in the operation of electric vehicles, where controlling the direction of motor rotation is vital for maneuvers like reversing the car.
