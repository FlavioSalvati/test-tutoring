Objects emit infrared radiation as a result of the thermal motion of their atoms and molecules.

Infrared radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation, which is energy that propagates in waves. Every object emits some form of electromagnetic radiation, with both the type and quantity depending on the object's temperature. When atoms and molecules within an object move, they generate energy, which is then released as electromagnetic radiation, including infrared radiation.

The intensity of infrared radiation emitted by an object increases with its temperature. For instance, a hot stove emits significantly more infrared radiation than a cold one. This difference arises because the atoms and molecules in a hot stove are in more vigorous motion, resulting in the production of greater energy. Even objects that do not appear visibly hot, such as the human body, emit infrared radiation. This characteristic enables thermal cameras to detect individuals in darkness, as they register the infrared radiation emitted by the body.

Infrared radiation is a component of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes other types of radiation such as visible light, ultraviolet light, and X-rays. Notably, infrared radiation has longer wavelengths than visible light, which is why it remains invisible to the naked eye. However, we can perceive it as heat. For example, standing near a fire makes you feel warm due to the infrared radiation it emits.

In summary, infrared radiation is emitted by all objects due to the thermal motion of their atoms and molecules, and the quantity of this radiation increases with temperature. This radiation is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum and is experienced as heat, even though it is not detectable by the human eye.
