Hubble's Law articulates a fundamental principle of cosmology: the farther a galaxy is from us, the faster it is receding. 

This law is crucial for comprehending the expanding universe. It was first formulated by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s, when he observed that galaxies are moving away from us. He found that the speed at which they recede is directly proportional to their distance from us. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as 

$$ 
v = H_0 \times d 
$$ 

where $v$ represents the velocity at which a galaxy is moving away, $H_0$ denotes the Hubble constant, and $d$ indicates the distance to the galaxy.

A related phenomenon is redshift, which occurs when light from an object moving away from us shifts towards the red end of the spectrum. This shift happens because the wavelengths of light are stretched, resulting in longer wavelengths that appear redder. In the context of galaxies, redshift serves as a direct measure of their velocity relative to our location. The greater the redshift, the faster the galaxy is receding.

Hubble's Law and redshift are intricately connected since redshift provides the observational evidence for the velocities of galaxies. By measuring the redshift of a galaxy's light, astronomers can ascertain how quickly it is moving away. When they graph these velocities against the corresponding distances of the galaxies, they observe a linear relationship, which is the essence of Hubble's Law. This correlation reinforces the notion that the universe is expanding, with galaxies moving apart over time.

Grasping Hubble's Law and the concept of redshift enhances our understanding of the universe's scale and dynamics. It reveals that the universe is not a static entity but is in a state of continuous change, with galaxies drifting apart as space itself expands. This groundbreaking discovery has significant implications for cosmology, the scientific study of the universe's origin and evolution.
