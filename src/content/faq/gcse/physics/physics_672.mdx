In the United Kingdom, the standard voltage for mains electricity is set at $230$ volts, with a frequency of $50$ hertz (Hz). This frequency indicates that the electrical power delivered to homes and businesses oscillates $50$ times per second. The choice of $230$ volts represents a compromise between the older British standard of $240$ volts and the European standard of $220$ volts, which was harmonized to ensure compatibility across different countries.

The $230$ volts supply is classified as high voltage, which is essential for the efficient transmission of electrical power over long distances. When electricity is generated at power stations, it is typically produced at very high voltages, often in the range of hundreds of thousands of volts. To reduce this high voltage to the $230$ volts used in residential and commercial settings, a series of transformers is employed. This step-down process minimizes energy loss during transmission.

In practical terms, the $230$-volt supply means that most household appliances, such as kettles, toasters, and televisions, are specifically designed to operate safely and efficiently at this voltage. It is important to note that the actual voltage can fluctuate slightly, usually within a range of Â±$10\%$. This means the voltage can vary from $207$ volts to $253$ volts. Such variations are generally acceptable for most electrical devices.

Understanding the standard voltage is critical for ensuring both safety and compatibility. Using an appliance that is designed for a different voltage can be hazardous and may lead to damage to the appliance or create electrical risks. Therefore, it is essential to always verify the voltage rating of any electrical device before connecting it to the mains supply.
