Sound waves propagate through various media by vibrating the particles found in solids, liquids, and gases.

Sound is classified as a mechanical wave, meaning it requires a medium to transmit energy. As a sound wave progresses through a medium, it induces vibrations in the particles of that medium. These vibrations facilitate the transfer of energy from one particle to another, enabling the sound wave to move through the medium. The speed and efficiency of this transmission are influenced by the nature of the medium.

In solids, particles are closely packed together, which allows sound waves to travel rapidly and efficiently. The strong intermolecular forces in solids enable quick transfer of vibrations from one particle to its neighbors. This is why sound travels faster in solids than in liquids or gases. For instance, in steel, sound travels at approximately $5,960$ metres per second, significantly faster than in air.

In liquids, particles are less densely packed than in solids but more so than in gases. Consequently, sound waves can still propagate relatively quickly, although not as swiftly as in solids. The particles in a liquid can move around each other, allowing vibrations to be transferred, albeit with slightly reduced efficiency. For example, sound travels at about $1,480$ metres per second in water.

In gases, particles are much more dispersed compared to those in solids and liquids. This increased distance means that vibrations must travel further from one particle to the next, resulting in a less efficient and slower transmission process. In air, which is a common gaseous medium, sound travels at approximately $343$ metres per second at room temperature. It's important to note that the speed of sound in gases can also be influenced by factors such as temperature and pressure.

Understanding how sound waves move through different media allows us to analyze various phenomena. For example, it explains why sounds are clearer when heard underwater and why sound travels faster on warmer days.
