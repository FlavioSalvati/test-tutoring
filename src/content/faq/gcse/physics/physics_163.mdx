To calculate the work done in stretching a spring, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Work} = 0.5 \times k \times x^2
$$

When you stretch a spring, you are performing work against the spring’s restoring force. This work is determined by the formula above, where \( k \) represents the spring constant and \( x \) denotes the extension (or compression) of the spring from its natural length.

The spring constant \( k \) is a measure of the spring's stiffness. It indicates how much force is required to stretch or compress the spring by a unit length. The unit of the spring constant is Newtons per meter (N/m). You can determine the spring constant through an experiment where you measure the force applied to the spring and the corresponding extension. By applying Hooke's Law, which states \( F = kx \), you can calculate \( k \).

The extension \( x \) refers to the distance by which the spring is stretched or compressed from its equilibrium position, measured in meters (m). For instance, if you stretch a spring by $0.1$ meters, then \( x \) would be \( 0.1 \).

The formula 

$$
\text{Work} = 0.5 \times k \times x^2
$$ 

arises from the fact that the force required to stretch a spring increases linearly with the extension. Consequently, the work done is not simply the product of force and distance, but rather the area under the force-extension graph, which forms a triangle. The factor of \( 0.5 \) accounts for this triangular area.

For example, consider a spring with a spring constant of \( 200 \, \text{N/m} \) that is stretched by \( 0.05 \, \text{m} \). The work done in this case would be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Work} = 0.5 \times 200 \times (0.05)^2 = 0.5 \times 200 \times 0.0025 = 0.25 \, \text{Joules}
$$

This means you have performed \( 0.25 \) Joules of work to stretch the spring.
