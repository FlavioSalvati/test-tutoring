Charles's Law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, provided that the pressure remains constant.

To gain a clearer understanding of Charles's Law, let's break it down. Imagine you have a balloon filled with gas. When you heat the balloon, the gas particles inside gain energy and move more rapidly. As their speed increases, they exert greater outward pressure, causing the balloon to expand. This phenomenon illustrates that, according to Charles's Law, an increase in the temperature of a gas leads to an increase in its volume, as long as the pressure is held constant.

Mathematically, Charles's Law can be expressed as:

$$ V \propto T $$

or equivalently,

$$ \frac{V}{T} = k $$

where $ V $ represents the volume of the gas, $ T $ is its temperature measured in Kelvin, and $ k $ is a constant. This relationship implies that if you know the volume and temperature of a gas at one state, you can predict its volume at a different temperature using the formula:

$$ \frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} $$

For instance, consider a gas at a temperature of $ 300 \, \text{K} $ with a volume of $ 2 \, \text{litres} $. If you heat it to $ 600 \, \text{K} $, the volume will double to $ 4 \, \text{litres} $, assuming the pressure remains constant. This relationship is crucial for understanding gas behavior under varying temperature conditions, which has significant implications in both scientific research and industrial applications.

It's essential to remember that temperatures must always be expressed in Kelvin when applying Charles's Law. To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, you simply add $ 273.15 $ to the Celsius temperature. Therefore, a temperature of $ 25^\circ \text{C} $ converts to:

$$ 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K} $$

Charles's Law is a foundational principle in the study of gases and is instrumental in predicting how gases respond to temperature changes, making it a key concept in GCSE Physics.
