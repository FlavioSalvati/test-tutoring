Coulomb's law describes the interaction between two charged objects, stating that the force between them is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.

More specifically, Coulomb's law provides insight into the behavior of electric charges. Imagine you have two small objects, each possessing an electric charge that can be either positive or negative. According to Coulomb's law, the force $ F $ acting between these two charges, denoted as $ q_1 $ and $ q_2 $, is influenced by two primary factors: the magnitude of the charges and the distance $ r $ between them.

The mathematical expression of Coulomb's law is given by:

$$ 
F = k \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2} 
$$

In this equation, $ k $ represents Coulomb's constant, approximately valued at $ 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 $. This constant facilitates the conversion of the units so that the resultant force is expressed in newtons (N).

Coulomb's law indicates that increasing the charge on either object will result in a greater force between them. For instance, if you double the charge on one of the objects, the resulting force will also double. Conversely, if you increase the distance between the two charges, the force will diminish. Specifically, if the distance is doubled, the force will reduce to one-quarter of its original value.

This law bears a strong resemblance to Newton's law of gravitation; however, instead of focusing on masses and gravitational interactions, it pertains to electric charges and the forces they exert on one another. Understanding Coulomb's law is fundamental for grasping the concepts of electric fields and the behavior of charged particles, which are essential in various fields of physics and engineering.
