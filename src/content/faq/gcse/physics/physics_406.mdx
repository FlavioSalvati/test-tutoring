The charge of an electron is approximately $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.

Electrons are subatomic particles that possess a negative electric charge. This charge is fundamental to numerous processes in both physics and chemistry. Although the magnitude of the electron's charge is exceedingly small, it is essential for understanding atomic and molecular structures. The negative sign denotes that the electron carries a negative charge, in contrast to the positive charge associated with protons.

In the context of GCSE Physics, comprehending the charge of an electron is crucial for explaining how atoms bond and interact. For example, in an atom, electrons orbit the nucleus, which contains positively charged protons. The attractive force between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged protons is what holds the atom together. This balance of charges is vital for the stability of matter.

Additionally, the concept of electric charge is significant when studying electric circuits. Electrons flow through conductors, such as wires, generating an electric current. The movement of these negatively charged particles powers our electronic devices. Understanding the charge of an electron enables us to calculate the amount of charge transferred in a circuit, which is important for determining the energy consumption of those devices.

In summary, the charge of an electron is a fundamental constant in physics, valued at approximately $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs. This minuscule charge plays a critical role in the structure of atoms, the formation of molecules, and the operation of electric circuits. Grasping this concept is essential for understanding more advanced topics in both physics and chemistry.
