An I-V graph illustrates the relationship between current ($I$) and voltage ($V$) in an electrical component. 

To interpret an I-V graph, begin by examining the axes: the x-axis generally represents voltage ($V$) while the y-axis represents current ($I$). The shape of the graph provides valuable insights into the behavior of the electrical component. For example, a straight line that passes through the origin indicates a resistor that adheres to Ohm's Law, where current is directly proportional to voltage. The slope of this line represents the resistance ($R$) and is calculated using the formula:

$$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$

If the graph takes the form of a curve instead of a straight line, it suggests that the component does not comply with Ohm's Law. For instance, a filament bulb's I-V graph exhibits an upward curve, indicating that as voltage increases, the resistance also rises due to the heating effect of the filament. Diodes present a distinctive I-V graph: they permit current to flow easily in one direction (forward bias) while blocking it in the opposite direction (reverse bias). This results in a graph that shows a sharp increase in current after a specific threshold voltage in the forward direction, while showing negligible current in the reverse direction.

By analyzing the I-V graph, you can identify the type of component and its characteristics, such as resistance, threshold voltage, and compliance with Ohm's Law. Understanding these features is essential for predicting how different components will behave in a circuit, as well as for designing circuits that operate correctly.
