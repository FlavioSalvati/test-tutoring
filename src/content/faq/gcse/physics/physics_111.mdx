A long half-life indicates that a substance remains radioactive for an extended duration, releasing energy gradually over many years.

In GCSE Physics, grasping the concept of half-life is essential when studying radioactive decay. The half-life of a radioactive substance is defined as the time required for half of its radioactive atoms to decay. A long half-life signifies that the substance decays at a very slow rate. Consequently, this slow decay leads to prolonged radiation emission, which can be advantageous or hazardous depending on the situation.

For example, in medical applications, certain radioactive isotopes with long half-lives are utilized in both treatments and diagnostic procedures. These isotopes provide a consistent source of radiation, making them valuable for long-term therapies. However, this same characteristic can create significant safety and disposal challenges. Radioactive waste from nuclear reactors frequently contains isotopes with long half-lives, necessitating secure storage for thousands of years to prevent environmental contamination.

In the field of environmental science, the long half-life of specific isotopes allows scientists to date ancient objects. A prime example is carbon-14, which has a half-life of approximately $5,730$ years. Carbon-14 is used in radiocarbon dating to ascertain the age of archaeological artifacts. This method relies on the predictable decay rate of carbon-14 to estimate the time elapsed since the organism died.

In summary, a long half-life means that a radioactive substance remains active and continues to emit radiation for an extended period. This characteristic has a variety of applications and implications across fields such as medicine, environmental science, and nuclear energy, making it a vital concept to understand in GCSE Physics.
