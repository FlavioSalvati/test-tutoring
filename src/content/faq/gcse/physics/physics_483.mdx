To calculate the gear ratio, you divide the number of teeth on the driven gear by the number of teeth on the driving gear.

In more detail, the gear ratio quantifies how the driving gear influences the movement of the driven gear. Specifically, it indicates how many times the driving gear must rotate to make the driven gear complete one full turn. This measurement is crucial in mechanical systems as it directly impacts both the speed and torque of the output.

To determine the gear ratio, you first need to count the number of teeth on each gear. For instance, if the driving gear has $10$ teeth and the driven gear has $20$ teeth, the gear ratio can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\text{Gear Ratio} = \frac{\text{Number of teeth on driven gear}}{\text{Number of teeth on driving gear}} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 
$$

This calculation reveals that for every complete turn of the driving gear, the driven gear will turn at half the speed, while providing twice the torque. Essentially, the driven gear will complete one full rotation for every two rotations of the driving gear.

Gear ratios play a vital role in various applications, including bicycles, automobiles, and machinery, where specific speeds and torque values are required. For example, in a bicycle, lower gear ratios make it easier to pedal uphill, whereas higher gear ratios enable faster speeds on flat terrain.

By understanding gear ratios, you can effectively analyze and design mechanical systems to meet specific performance objectives, whether that involves increasing speed, enhancing torque, or achieving a balance of both.
