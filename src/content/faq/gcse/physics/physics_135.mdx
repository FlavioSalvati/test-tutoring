A vector quantity is characterized by both its magnitude and direction, and is typically represented using either an arrow or boldface notation.

In physics, vector quantities differ from scalar quantities because they encompass both a size (magnitude) and a direction. For instance, velocity is considered a vector because it indicates how fast an object is moving and in which direction. In contrast, speed is classified as a scalar since it only provides information about how fast an object is moving, without any reference to direction.

Vectors can be visually represented using arrows. The length of the arrow indicates the magnitude of the vector, while the direction of the arrow shows its orientation. For example, if you wanted to depict a force of $5$ Newtons directed to the right, you would draw an arrow pointing to the right, with the length of the arrow proportional to $5$ Newtons.

Another common representation of vectors is through boldface letters, such as **v** for velocity or **F** for force. In written text, vectors are often denoted with an arrow above the letter, such as $\vec{v}$ for velocity or $\vec{F}$ for force. This notation is useful for distinguishing vectors from scalars, which are typically presented in standard typeface.

Vectors can also be expressed in terms of their components, particularly in two or three dimensions. For instance, a vector in two dimensions can be decomposed into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components. If you have a vector $\vec{A}$ with components $A_x$ and $A_y$, it can be represented as 

$$
\vec{A} = (A_x, A_y).
$$

This component representation is especially beneficial when adding or subtracting vectors, as you can simply combine their corresponding components.

Mastering the representation and manipulation of vectors is essential in physics, as many physical quantities, such as displacement, acceleration, and force, are inherently vectorial.
