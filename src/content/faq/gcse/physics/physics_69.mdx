Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume for a given substance. 

More specifically, density quantifies how much mass is contained within a specific volume. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} $$

This means that if the mass and volume of an object are known, its density can be determined by dividing the mass by the volume. The units commonly used for density are kilograms per cubic metre ($\text{kg/m}^3$) and grams per cubic centimetre ($\text{g/cm}^3$).

For instance, consider a block of wood with a mass of $200$ grams and a volume of $250$ cubic centimetres. To find its density, you would divide $200$ grams by $250$ cubic centimetres, yielding a density of $0.8 \, \text{g/cm}^3$. This indicates that each cubic centimetre of the wood weighs $0.8$ grams.

Understanding density is crucial as it aids in the identification of substances and provides insight into their properties. For example, if two objects occupy the same volume but have different masses, the object with the greater mass will inherently have a higher density. This principle explains why certain objects float in water while others sink: water has a density of $1 \, \text{g/cm}^3$, so any object with a density lower than this will float, whereas those with a higher density will sink.

In practical applications, density is relevant across various fields, including material science, engineering, and cooking. For instance, knowledge of a material's density assists engineers in designing structures that are both strong and lightweight. Similarly, in cooking, understanding the density of ingredients can influence the texture and consistency of a dish.

By comprehending the relationship between mass, volume, and density, you can gain deeper insights into the behavior of different materials in various scenarios.
