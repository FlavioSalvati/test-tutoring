To calculate the total resistance in a parallel circuit, you can use the following formula:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots
$$

In a parallel circuit, the total resistance is not simply the sum of the individual resistances, as it would be in a series circuit. Instead, the reciprocal of the total resistance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of each individual resistance. This relationship arises because, in a parallel circuit, the current has multiple pathways to follow, which effectively reduces the overall resistance.

Letâ€™s illustrate this with an example. Suppose you have three resistors connected in parallel with resistances of $6\, \Omega$, $3\, \Omega$, and $2\, \Omega$. First, we will find the reciprocal of each resistance:

$$
\frac{1}{6}, \quad \frac{1}{3}, \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Next, we need to sum these reciprocals:

$$
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}.
$$

To perform this addition, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of $6$, $3$, and $2$ is $6$. Therefore, we will convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

- $\frac{1}{6}$ remains $\frac{1}{6}$,
- $\frac{1}{3}$ becomes $\frac{2}{6}$,
- $\frac{1}{2}$ becomes $\frac{3}{6}$.

Now we can add them together:

$$
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1.
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = 1.
$$

To find the total resistance, we take the reciprocal of $1$, which is simply $1\, \Omega$. Therefore, the total resistance in this parallel circuit is $1\, \Omega$.

This method can be applied to any number of resistors in parallel. Just remember to take the reciprocal of each resistance, sum those reciprocals, and then take the reciprocal of that total to find the overall resistance. This approach ensures that you accurately account for how the current is distributed across the different paths in a parallel circuit.
