Current is the rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor.

In more detail, electric current (I) is defined as the amount of electric charge (Q) that passes through a point in a circuit per unit time (t). This relationship can be expressed with the formula: $ I = \frac{Q}{t} $. Here, current is measured in amperes (A), charge in coulombs (C), and time in seconds (s).

Imagine electric charge as water flowing through a pipe. The current is like the flow rate of the water â€“ how much water passes a certain point in a given amount of time. Similarly, in an electrical circuit, the current tells us how much charge is moving through the circuit per second.

For example, if a current of 2 amperes flows through a wire, it means that 2 coulombs of charge are passing through the wire every second. This relationship helps us understand how electrical devices work. For instance, a higher current means more charge is flowing, which can power more demanding devices or make a light bulb shine brighter.

Understanding this relationship is crucial for analysing circuits and predicting how they will behave. It also helps in calculating other important quantities in electricity, such as voltage and resistance, using Ohm's Law and other principles. So, by grasping the connection between current and charge, you can better understand the flow of electricity and how it powers the world around us.
