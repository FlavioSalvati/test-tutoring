Waves reflect off surfaces by bouncing back at an angle that is equal to the angle at which they initially strike the surface.

When a wave, whether it be light or sound, encounters a surface, it does not simply come to a stop; rather, it reflects back. This phenomenon is known as reflection. According to the law of reflection, the angle at which the wave strikes the surface—referred to as the angle of incidence—is equal to the angle at which it reflects off, known as the angle of reflection. Both angles are measured with respect to an imaginary line called the normal, which is perpendicular to the surface at the point of contact.

Consider the scenario of shining a flashlight at a mirror. When the light beam hits the mirror, it reflects back. If the flashlight is directed at an angle of $30^\circ$ relative to the normal, the light will reflect off at the same $30^\circ$ angle on the opposite side of the normal line. This principle is consistent across all types of waves, including sound waves and water waves.

The nature of the surface plays a significant role in the reflection of waves. Smooth surfaces, such as mirrors or calm water, create clear and predictable reflections, which is why you can see your image in a mirror or a still pond. In contrast, rough surfaces scatter the waves in multiple directions, resulting in diffuse reflection. This scattering explains why you cannot see a clear reflection on a rough wall or in choppy water.

Understanding wave reflection is essential in various fields of physics and has practical applications in everyday life. For instance, it aids in the design of superior acoustics in concert halls, enhances the effectiveness of sonar systems, and helps us comprehend the behavior of light in different environments. So, the next time you gaze into a mirror or listen to an echo, remember that it all comes down to the reflection of waves off surfaces!
