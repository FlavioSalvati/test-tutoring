The units of density can be expressed as kilograms per cubic metre ($\text{kg/m}^3$) or grams per cubic centimetre ($\text{g/cm}^3$).

Density quantifies the amount of mass contained within a specific volume. It is calculated using the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} 
$$

In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit for mass is the kilogram ($\text{kg}$), while the standard unit for volume is the cubic metre ($\text{m}^3$). Consequently, the SI unit for density is expressed as kilograms per cubic metre ($\text{kg/m}^3$). This unit is particularly advantageous when measuring the density of larger objects or substances.

Conversely, in many practical situations, especially in the fields of chemistry and smaller-scale physics experiments, we commonly utilize grams ($\text{g}$) for mass and cubic centimetres ($\text{cm}^3$) for volume. In these contexts, the unit for density is grams per cubic centimetre ($\text{g/cm}^3$). This unit is more convenient for handling smaller quantities of material.

To illustrate, the density of water is approximately $1 \, \text{g/cm}^3$ or $1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3$. This indicates that $1 \, \text{cm}^3$ of water has a mass of $1 \, \text{g}$, while $1 \, \text{m}^3$ of water has a mass of $1000 \, \text{kg}$.

Understanding the units of density is essential as it enables us to compare the 'heaviness' or 'lightness' of various materials when occupying the same volume. For instance, iron possesses a higher density than wood, which explains why a piece of iron feels significantly heavier than a similarly sized piece of wood.

In summary, density can be measured in either $\text{kg/m}^3$ or $\text{g/cm}^3$, depending on the context and the scale of the measurement.
