To calculate the total moment in a system, you must sum the moments of all forces about a designated pivot point.

A moment, also known as torque, represents the turning effect produced by a force around a pivot or fulcrum. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Moment} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
$$

In this formula, the distance refers to the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force. The unit of moment is Newton-metres ($\text{Nm}$).

To determine the total moment in a system, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Pivot Point**: Determine where the pivot is located in the system.
2. **Measure Distances**: For each force acting on the object, measure the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of that force.
3. **Calculate Individual Moments**: Multiply each force by its corresponding distance to obtain the individual moments.

Next, you need to assess the direction of each moment. Typically, moments that induce a clockwise rotation are considered positive, while those that induce an anti-clockwise rotation are considered negative (or vice versa, depending on your chosen convention). Sum all the moments, ensuring you add or subtract them according to their respective directions.

For example, consider a seesaw with a pivot at its center. If there is a $10 \, \text{N}$ force acting $2 \, \text{m}$ to the right of the pivot and a $15 \, \text{N}$ force acting $1 \, \text{m}$ to the left of the pivot, the moments can be calculated as follows:

- **Moment from the $10 \, \text{N}$ Force**: 
  $$ 
  10 \, \text{N} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 20 \, \text{Nm} \quad (\text{clockwise}) 
  $$

- **Moment from the $15 \, \text{N}$ Force**: 
  $$ 
  15 \, \text{N} \times 1 \, \text{m} = 15 \, \text{Nm} \quad (\text{anti-clockwise}) 
  $$

Assuming clockwise moments are positive, the total moment can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Total Moment} = 20 \, \text{Nm} \, (\text{clockwise}) - 15 \, \text{Nm} \, (\text{anti-clockwise}) = 5 \, \text{Nm} \, (\text{clockwise})
$$

By summing the moments, you can analyze the rotational effects of all forces within the system and ascertain whether it is in equilibrium or if there exists a resultant turning effect.
