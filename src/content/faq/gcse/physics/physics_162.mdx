The equation that describes elastic potential energy is given by 

$$ 
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 
$$ 

where:

- $E$ represents the elastic potential energy, measured in joules (J),
- $k$ is the spring constant, which quantifies the stiffness of the spring or elastic material, measured in newtons per meter (N/m),
- $x$ denotes the displacement, or the distance by which the object is either stretched or compressed from its original position, measured in meters (m).

Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an object when it is either stretched or compressed. This form of energy is typically associated with objects such as springs, rubber bands, and other elastic materials. The equation $E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$ allows us to calculate the amount of energy stored in these objects.

To illustrate this concept with an example, consider a spring that has a spring constant $k$ of $200 \, \text{N/m}$. If you compress the spring by $0.1 \, \text{m}$, you can substitute these values into the equation:

$$ 
E = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \times (0.1)^2 
$$ 

This simplifies to:

$$ 
E = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \times 0.01 
$$ 

Thus, we find:

$$ 
E = 1 \, \text{J} 
$$ 

Therefore, the elastic potential energy stored in the spring is $1 \, \text{joule}$.

This equation is derived from Hooke's Law, which states that the force required to extend or compress a spring by a distance $x$ is directly proportional to that distance. The formula representing Hooke's Law is 

$$ 
F = kx 
$$ 

When you integrate this force over the displacement $x$, you arrive at the formula for elastic potential energy.

Grasping this concept is essential in physics as it provides insight into how energy is conserved and transferred in systems involving elastic materials.
