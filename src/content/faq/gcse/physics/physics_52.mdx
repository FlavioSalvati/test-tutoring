To determine the energy consumption of an appliance, you can use a straightforward calculation: multiply its power rating by the duration it is in operation.

Energy consumption is generally measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). The power rating of an appliance is typically expressed in watts (W) or kilowatts (kW), where $1 \, \text{kW}$ is equivalent to $1000 \, \text{W}$. To accurately calculate energy usage, you need both the power rating and the amount of time the appliance is used.

First, if the power rating is provided in watts, convert it to kilowatts. For instance, if an appliance has a power rating of $1500 \, \text{W}$, you can convert it to kilowatts by dividing by $1000$, resulting in $1.5 \, \text{kW}$.

Next, identify the duration the appliance is used, which should be measured in hours. For example, if you operate a $1.5 \, \text{kW}$ heater for $3$ hours, you can calculate the energy consumption using the following formula:

$$
\text{Energy (kWh)} = \text{Power (kW)} \times \text{Time (hours)}
$$

Applying this formula to the heater:

$$
\text{Energy} = 1.5 \, \text{kW} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh}
$$

This calculation indicates that the heater consumes $4.5 \, \text{kWh}$ of energy.

Understanding how to perform this calculation is crucial for analyzing the electricity usage of various appliances, enabling you to manage your energy consumption more effectively. For instance, recognizing that a $100 \, \text{W}$ light bulb used for $10$ hours consumes $1 \, \text{kWh}$ of energy can empower you to make informed decisions about your energy consumption, ultimately helping you to reduce your electricity bills.
