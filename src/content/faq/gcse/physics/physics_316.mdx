In circuit diagrams, a resistor is typically represented by either a zigzag line or a rectangle.

Resistors are fundamental components in electrical circuits, as they limit the flow of electric current. The most commonly recognized symbol for a resistor is the zigzag line, which visually illustrates the resistance to current flow. This symbol is prevalent in many countries, including the UK. Conversely, in some European nations, a rectangular shape is used to denote a resistor. Although the symbols differ, both serve the same purpose and are widely understood by individuals familiar with circuit diagrams.

When you encounter a resistor symbol in a circuit diagram, it is usually accompanied by a label indicating its resistance value, measured in ohms ($\Omega$). For instance, a resistor with a resistance of $100$ ohms may be labeled as "$100 \, \Omega$". This value indicates the degree to which the resistor impedes the flow of electric current; a higher resistance results in a lower current flowing through the circuit.

Resistors play a crucial role in controlling both current and voltage within a circuit. They can be utilized to protect sensitive components, divide voltages, and establish the operating conditions of electronic devices. Mastering the ability to read and interpret resistor symbols in circuit diagrams is an essential skill in GCSE Physics, as it enables you to analyze and construct electrical circuits effectively.

In conclusion, whether represented by a zigzag line or a rectangle, both symbols signify a resistor in a circuit diagram. Familiarity with these symbols will enhance your understanding and ability to work with electrical circuits in your studies.
