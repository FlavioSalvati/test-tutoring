To measure the density of an object in a practical setting, you will need to determine both its mass and volume, and then use these values to calculate the density.

### Measuring the Density of a Solid Object

1. **Determine the Mass**: 
   Begin by measuring the mass of the object using a calibrated balance. Make sure the balance is correctly calibrated, then place the object on it to obtain its mass in grams ($g$).

2. **Find the Volume**:
   - **Regular-Shaped Objects**: For objects with regular shapes, such as cubes or cylinders, measure their dimensions—length, width, and height—using a ruler or vernier caliper. You can then calculate the volume using the appropriate geometric formula. For example, the volume of a cube can be calculated with the formula:
   $$ V = l \times w \times h $$
   where $l$ is the length, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height.
   
   - **Irregular-Shaped Objects**: For objects that do not have a regular shape, you can employ the water displacement method. Fill a graduated cylinder with a known volume of water and record this initial volume. Submerge the object in the water carefully and record the new volume. The volume of the object can be determined by calculating the difference between the initial and final volumes. Ensure that the object is fully submerged and does not touch the sides of the cylinder for an accurate measurement.

3. **Calculate Density**: 
   Once you have both the mass and volume, you can calculate the density using the formula:
   $$ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} $$
   It is important to use consistent units; typically, mass is measured in grams ($g$) and volume in cubic centimeters ($\text{cm}^3$), resulting in density measured in grams per cubic centimeter ($\text{g/cm}^3$).

### Measuring the Density of Liquids

For liquids, the process is slightly different. Start by measuring the mass of an empty measuring cylinder. Next, fill the cylinder with the liquid and measure the mass again. The difference in mass will give you the mass of the liquid. The volume of the liquid can be directly read from the measuring cylinder. Use the same density formula to find the density of the liquid.

### Conclusion

This practical exercise not only reinforces your understanding of the relationship between mass, volume, and density but also highlights a fundamental concept in physics applicable to numerous real-world situations.
