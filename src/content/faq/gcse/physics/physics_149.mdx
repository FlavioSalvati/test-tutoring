The work done on an object can either increase or decrease its potential energy, depending on the direction of the applied force.

When work is performed on an object, energy is transferred either to or from that object. If the work is done in opposition to gravity, such as when lifting an object upwards, the gravitational potential energy of the object increases. This increase occurs because gravitational potential energy is directly related to the height of the object above the ground. The formula for gravitational potential energy is given by

$$
E_p = mgh
$$

where $m$ represents the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height above the ground. Thus, lifting an object to a greater height increases $h$, which in turn raises $E_p$.

On the other hand, when work is exerted in the same direction as gravity, such as lowering an object, the gravitational potential energy decreases. This decrease occurs because lowering the object results in a reduction of height $h$, leading to a corresponding decrease in $E_p$.

In the case of elastic potential energy, the work done on an object—such as stretching or compressing a spring—also alters its potential energy. The more the spring is stretched or compressed, the more work is done, and consequently, the more elastic potential energy is stored within the spring. The formula for elastic potential energy is expressed as

$$
E_e = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the spring’s equilibrium position.

In summary, the work done on an object influences its potential energy by either increasing it when the object is moved against a resisting force (such as gravity or spring tension) or decreasing it when the object moves with the force. Understanding this relationship is crucial for analyzing various physical systems and predicting how energy is transferred and transformed.
