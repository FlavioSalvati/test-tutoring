Gravity causes objects in free fall to accelerate toward the Earth at a constant rate of approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$.

When an object is in free fall, it is solely influenced by gravity, with no other forces acting on it, such as air resistance. This means that the object accelerates downward at a constant rate, which on Earth is roughly $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$. This acceleration due to gravity is commonly represented by the symbol $g$.

To illustrate this concept, consider the scenario of dropping a ball from a height. The moment you release the ball, gravity begins to pull it toward the ground. In the first second, the ball will accelerate from rest ($0 \, \text{m/s}$) to $9.8 \, \text{m/s}$. After two seconds, its velocity will increase to $19.6 \, \text{m/s}$, and this pattern continues. The acceleration remains constant until the ball either strikes the ground or another force intervenes.

The principle of free fall is fundamental in physics because it enables us to predict the motion of objects influenced only by gravity. For instance, if you know the height from which an object is dropped, you can calculate the time it takes to reach the ground using the equations of motion. These equations consider the initial velocity (which is zero in the case of free fall), the acceleration due to gravity, and the distance fallen.

It is also essential to recognize that in a vacuum—where air resistance is absent—all objects, regardless of their mass, will fall at the same rate. This phenomenon was famously demonstrated by Galileo's experiments and later confirmed by astronauts on the Moon, who observed that a feather and a hammer fell at the same rate.

Understanding how gravity affects free fall is crucial for analyzing various real-world scenarios, from the motion of celestial bodies to the design of safety equipment like parachutes.
