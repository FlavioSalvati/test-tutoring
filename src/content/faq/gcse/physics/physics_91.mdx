A proton possesses a positive charge of $+1$ elementary charge, which is approximately $+1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.

To elaborate, protons are subatomic particles located within the nucleus of an atom. They are one of the three primary types of particles that constitute atoms, the other two being neutrons and electrons. The charge of a proton is fundamental to atomic structure and the behavior of matter. Specifically, the positive charge of a proton is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the negative charge of an electron. This balance of charges is essential for the stability of atoms.

The unit used to quantify a proton's charge is called the elementary charge, denoted as $e$. The value of the elementary charge is approximately $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs. Consequently, a single proton carries a charge of $+1e$, or $+1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs. In contrast, an electron carries a charge of $-1e$, or $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.

Grasping the charge of protons is crucial for understanding atomic interactions. For example, the number of protons in an atom's nucleus defines the element's identity and its position in the periodic table, a quantity known as the atomic number. Moreover, the positive charge of protons attracts the negatively charged electrons, which keeps them in orbit around the nucleus, thereby forming a stable atom.

In summary, the positive charge of protons is pivotal to the structure and behavior of atoms, influencing a wide array of phenomena from chemical reactions to the formation of molecules.
