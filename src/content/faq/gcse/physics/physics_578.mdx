A transformer operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction to modify the voltage of an alternating current (AC).

Transformers are comprised of two coils of wire, known as the primary and secondary coils, which are wound around a shared iron core. When an alternating current flows through the primary coil, it generates a changing magnetic field in its vicinity. This fluctuating magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary coil through the process of electromagnetic induction.

The change in voltage between the primary and secondary coils is directly influenced by the number of turns of wire in each coil. If the secondary coil has more turns than the primary coil, the transformer increases the voltage; this configuration is referred to as a step-up transformer. Conversely, if the secondary coil contains fewer turns than the primary coil, the transformer decreases the voltage, and it is known as a step-down transformer.

The relationship between the number of turns in the coils and the corresponding voltages can be expressed by the following formula:

$$ 
\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p} 
$$

In this equation, $ V_s $ and $ V_p $ represent the voltages in the secondary and primary coils, respectively, while $ N_s $ and $ N_p $ denote the number of turns in the secondary and primary coils, respectively.

Transformers play a crucial role in the transmission of electrical power over long distances. Power stations generate electricity at relatively low voltages, which are then stepped up to higher voltages to facilitate efficient transmission through power lines. Upon reaching their destination, the voltage is stepped down to a safer, more usable level suitable for homes and businesses.

For GCSE Physics students, understanding transformers is essential as it illustrates the practical application of electromagnetic principles and underscores the importance of efficient energy transfer in contemporary electrical systems.
