To measure the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a component, you will need to set up a circuit that includes a power supply, a variable resistor, an ammeter, a voltmeter, and the component you wish to analyze.

### Required Equipment
- **Power Supply**: Provides the necessary voltage.
- **Variable Resistor (Rheostat)**: Allows you to adjust the resistance in the circuit.
- **Ammeter**: Measures the current ($I$) flowing through the circuit.
- **Voltmeter**: Measures the voltage ($V$) across the component.
- **Component**: The device whose I-V characteristics you wish to study (e.g., resistor, diode, or LED).

### Circuit Setup
1. **Connect the Power Supply**: Begin by connecting the power supply to your circuit.
  
2. **Insert the Ammeter**: Place the ammeter in series with the component. This configuration ensures that the current flows through both the ammeter and the component sequentially, allowing the ammeter to measure the current directly.

3. **Add the Variable Resistor**: Connect the variable resistor in series with both the ammeter and the component. Adjusting the variable resistor will change the total resistance in the circuit, which in turn modifies the current flowing through the component. This adjustment is essential for obtaining a range of current and voltage readings.

4. **Connect the Voltmeter**: Position the voltmeter in parallel with the component. This means that the voltmeter is connected across the component, enabling it to measure the voltage drop directly across it.

### Data Collection
Once all components are connected, turn on the power supply. Adjust the variable resistor to change the current flowing through the circuit. For each setting of the variable resistor, record the current reading from the ammeter and the corresponding voltage reading from the voltmeter.

### Analysis
After gathering your data, plot the recorded values on a graph with current ($I$) on the y-axis and voltage ($V$) on the x-axis. Analyzing the resulting graph will provide insights into the I-V characteristics of the component. 

For instance, a straight line passing through the origin suggests that the component behaves like a resistor, following Ohm's Law. In contrast, a curved line may indicate the presence of a diode or LED, which exhibits more complex behavior.
