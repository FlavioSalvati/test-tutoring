Redshift is a crucial concept in cosmology as it provides compelling evidence for the expansion of the universe.

To elaborate, redshift refers to the phenomenon where light from distant galaxies is displaced towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This occurs because the wavelengths of the emitted light are stretched as galaxies move away from us. This effect is analogous to the Doppler effect, wherein the frequency of sound changes based on the motion of the source relative to the observer. Specifically, when a galaxy is receding from us, its light appears redder; conversely, if it were approaching, the light would appear bluer, a phenomenon known as blueshift.

The identification of redshift in the light from distant galaxies marked a revolutionary advancement in cosmology. In the 1920s, American astronomer Edwin Hubble made a pivotal observation: nearly all galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther a galaxy is, the faster it is receding. This observation is encapsulated in what is now called Hubble's Law. The redshift measurements of galaxies provide robust evidence supporting the theory of an expanding universe, which aligns with the Big Bang theory. According to this theory, the universe originated from an extremely hot, dense point approximately $13.8$ billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.

Furthermore, redshift plays a vital role in helping cosmologists determine the rate of the universe's expansion, known as the Hubble constant. By analyzing the redshift of light from various galaxies, scientists can estimate the velocity at which the universe is expanding. This data is essential for understanding the cosmic timelineâ€”our universe's past, present, and future.

In conclusion, redshift serves as a fundamental piece of evidence for the expanding universe and is instrumental in helping scientists decipher the dynamics and history of the cosmos. It is a foundational concept in cosmology that has significantly enhanced our comprehension of the universe.
