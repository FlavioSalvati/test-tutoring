The ITER project is a groundbreaking international collaboration aimed at constructing the world's largest experimental nuclear fusion reactor.

ITER stands for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. Its primary objective is to demonstrate the viability of nuclear fusion as a large-scale, carbon-free energy source. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers the sun and other stars, wherein two light atomic nuclei fuse to form a heavier nucleus, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the process. This is in contrast to nuclear fission, which involves the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei and is currently utilized in nuclear power plants. Fusion generates significantly less radioactive waste and has the potential for a virtually limitless supply of fuel.

The ITER reactor is being built in southern France and involves collaboration from 35 countries, including the European Union, the United States, Russia, China, India, Japan, and South Korea. A key component of ITER is a device known as a tokamak, which is a doughnut-shaped chamber that employs powerful magnetic fields to contain and control hot plasma. Plasma is a state of matter in which electrons are separated from their nuclei. To facilitate fusion reactions, the plasma must achieve temperatures around $150$ million degrees Celsius, which is approximately ten times hotter than the core of the sun.

One of the main goals of ITER is to produce $500$ megawatts of fusion power from an input of only $50$ megawatts, achieving an impressive tenfold energy gain. This would mark a significant milestone, demonstrating that fusion can generate more energy than it consumes. Additionally, the project aims to test the technologies and materials necessary for future commercial fusion power plants.

Although ITER is still under construction, with the first plasma expected in the mid-2020s, it represents a substantial advancement in the pursuit of clean and sustainable energy. If successful, it could usher in a new era of energy production, addressing global energy demands while helping to combat climate change.
