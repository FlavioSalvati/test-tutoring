Hydraulic systems rely on fluid pressure to transmit force and perform work through confined liquids.

In a hydraulic system, a liquid—typically oil—is used to transfer force from one location to another. This principle is grounded in Pascal's Principle, which asserts that any change in pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally throughout that fluid. Consequently, when pressure is applied to a liquid in one segment of the system, all parts of the system experience that same pressure change.

Consider a basic hydraulic system consisting of two interconnected cylinders of varying sizes, each containing a piston. When force is exerted on the smaller piston, it generates pressure in the fluid. Since the fluid is incompressible, this pressure is uniformly transmitted through the fluid to the larger piston. If the area of the larger piston is ten times greater than that of the smaller piston, the force exerted on the larger piston will be ten times greater than the force applied to the smaller piston. This mechanism allows hydraulic systems to effectively amplify force, facilitating the lifting of heavy objects or performing other tasks that require substantial force.

Hydraulic systems find applications in a wide range of fields, including automotive brakes, hydraulic jacks, aircraft, and industrial machinery. For instance, in automotive braking systems, pressing the brake pedal activates a piston in the master cylinder. This action generates pressure in the brake fluid, which travels through brake lines to the pistons located at each wheel. These pistons then exert pressure on the brake pads, pressing them against the brake discs to slow down the vehicle.

By harnessing fluid pressure, hydraulic systems can efficiently and effectively transmit force, making them essential in numerous mechanical and engineering applications.
