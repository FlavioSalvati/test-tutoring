Fusion typically generates more energy per reaction compared to fission; however, the practical implementation of fusion poses significantly greater challenges.

In the process of nuclear fusion, light atomic nuclei merge to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a substantial amount of energy in the process. This reaction is the fundamental source of energy that powers the sun and other stars, where hydrogen nuclei combine to form helium under extreme temperatures and pressures. The energy released during fusion arises from the mass difference between the reactants and the products, as articulated by Einstein's renowned equation, 

$$
E = mc^2.
$$

For instance, the fusion of deuterium and tritium—two isotopes of hydrogen—releases approximately $17.6$ MeV (million electron volts) of energy per reaction.

In contrast, nuclear fission involves the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into smaller nuclei, accompanied by the release of a few neutrons and a significant amount of energy. Fission reactions typically release around $200$ MeV of energy per reaction. Although this amount is considerable, it is less than the energy produced per unit mass in fusion reactions.

Despite its potential, achieving the necessary conditions for fusion on Earth is extraordinarily challenging. Fusion requires temperatures in the range of millions of degrees Celsius to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei. This extreme requirement is one reason why fusion reactors, such as tokamaks, remain in the experimental phase and have yet to become a viable source of energy. In contrast, fission reactors are well-established and currently supply a significant portion of the world's electricity.

In conclusion, while fusion holds the promise of generating more energy per reaction than fission, the technological hurdles associated with creating and sustaining the conditions necessary for fusion make it a more complex and, at present, less practical option for energy production.
