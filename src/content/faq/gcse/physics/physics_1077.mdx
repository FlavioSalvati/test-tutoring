Greenhouse gases play a vital role in trapping heat in Earth's atmosphere, which leads to an increase in the planet's temperature.

Key greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide ($\mathrm{CO_2}$), methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$), and water vapor ($\mathrm{H_2O}$). These gases are instrumental in regulating Earth's temperature because they can absorb infrared radiation that is emitted from the Earth's surface. When solar energy reaches the Earth, it is absorbed by the surface and subsequently re-emitted as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases capture this infrared radiation and re-radiate it in all directions, including back towards the Earth's surface. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect.

Without the greenhouse effect, Earth's average temperature would be approximately $-18^\circ \mathrm{C}$, a temperature far too cold to sustain most life forms. However, human activities, such as the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This intensified greenhouse effect results in more heat being trapped, leading to a rise in Earth's average temperatureâ€”a phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming.

The rise in Earth's temperature due to the enhanced greenhouse effect has numerous consequences. It can lead to more extreme weather events, including heatwaves, storms, and heavy rainfall. Additionally, the warming contributes to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, which in turn causes sea levels to rise. This rise in sea levels can result in the flooding of coastal areas and the loss of habitats for many species.

Understanding the role of greenhouse gases in regulating Earth's temperature is crucial for addressing climate change. By reducing emissions of these gases, we can mitigate the impacts of global warming and safeguard our planet for future generations.
