Energy production from coal negatively affects air quality by releasing pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.

When coal is burned to produce energy, it releases a variety of harmful substances into the atmosphere. One of the primary pollutants is sulphur dioxide (SO₂), which can lead to the formation of acid rain. Acid rain can harm ecosystems, damage buildings, and affect human health by irritating the respiratory system.

Another significant pollutant is nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). These gases contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, a key component of smog. Smog can cause respiratory problems, reduce lung function, and exacerbate conditions like asthma and bronchitis. Additionally, nitrogen oxides can also contribute to acid rain and the formation of fine particulate matter.

Particulate matter (PM) is another major concern. These tiny particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing a range of health issues, from minor irritations to serious conditions like heart disease and lung cancer. Particulate matter can also reduce visibility, leading to hazy conditions that affect both the environment and human activities.

Coal combustion also releases carbon dioxide (CO₂), a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change. While CO₂ itself is not directly harmful to human health, the broader impacts of climate change can have serious consequences for air quality and public health.

In summary, the burning of coal for energy releases a range of pollutants that can harm human health, damage the environment, and contribute to climate change. Understanding these impacts is crucial for making informed decisions about energy production and environmental protection.
