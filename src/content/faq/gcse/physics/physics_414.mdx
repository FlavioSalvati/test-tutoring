Protons and neutrons have comparable masses, while electrons are significantly lighter, weighing approximately $\frac{1}{1836}$ of a proton's mass.

To elaborate, the mass of a proton is roughly $1$ atomic mass unit (amu), which translates to about $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kilograms. Neutrons have a mass very similar to that of protons, also around $1$ amu or $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kilograms. This close similarity in mass is the reason protons and neutrons are collectively referred to as nucleons; they both reside in the nucleus of an atom and together contribute substantially to its overall mass.

In contrast, electrons are much lighter. The mass of an electron is approximately $9.11 \times 10^{-31}$ kilograms, which is about $\frac{1}{1836}$ the mass of a proton. Because of their minimal mass, electrons contribute negligibly to the total mass of an atom. Nonetheless, they play a vital role in the chemical behavior of atoms, as they are integral to forming chemical bonds and determining an atom's reactivity.

Grasping the relative masses of these subatomic particles is crucial for understanding concepts in atomic structure and nuclear physics. For example, the mass number of an atom, defined as the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, provides a good approximation of the atom's mass. The influence of electrons on this mass number is negligible due to their tiny mass.

In summary, while protons and neutrons are the heavyweights of the atomic realm, electrons are the lightweights, orbiting the nucleus and driving the chemistry that shapes our world!
