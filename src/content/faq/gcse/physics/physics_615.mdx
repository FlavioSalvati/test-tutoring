Intermolecular forces are essential in determining the energy required for substances to transition between solid, liquid, and gas states.

Intermolecular forces refer to the attractive interactions between molecules. These forces are pivotal in establishing the physical state of a substance at a specific temperature and pressure. When a substance undergoes a change of state—such as melting from solid to liquid or evaporating from liquid to gas—the intermolecular forces must be overcome. The stronger these forces are, the more energy is necessary to facilitate the state change.

In solids, molecules are tightly packed in a fixed arrangement due to strong intermolecular forces. This is the reason solids possess a definite shape and volume. To melt a solid into a liquid, sufficient energy must be supplied to overcome these robust forces, allowing the molecules to move more freely. This required energy is known as the latent heat of fusion.

In liquids, the intermolecular forces are weaker compared to those in solids, which enables the molecules to move around each other while still remaining attracted to one another. Consequently, liquids maintain a definite volume but lack a fixed shape. To convert a liquid into a gas, even greater energy must be provided to completely overcome the intermolecular forces, allowing the molecules to move independently. This energy is referred to as the latent heat of vaporization.

In the gaseous state, intermolecular forces are exceedingly weak, resulting in molecules that are far apart and capable of moving freely. This characteristic explains why gases do not have a definite shape or volume. When a gas condenses into a liquid, the molecules lose energy, and the intermolecular forces become significant once more, drawing the molecules closer together.

A thorough understanding of intermolecular forces provides insight into why different substances exhibit varying melting and boiling points. For instance, water has relatively strong hydrogen bonds, which accounts for its higher boiling point compared to other compounds of similar molecular size.
