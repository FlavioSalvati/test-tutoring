The relationship between force and momentum can be expressed with the formula:

$$
F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
$$

where $F$ represents force, $\Delta p$ denotes the change in momentum, and $\Delta t$ is the time interval during which this change occurs.

To elaborate, momentum quantifies the motion of an object and is calculated as the product of its mass ($m$) and velocity ($v$). Mathematically, momentum ($p$) is defined by the equation:

$$
p = m \cdot v
$$

When an object's momentum changes, it indicates that either its mass, its velocity, or both have changed. This alteration in momentum is typically a result of a force acting upon the object.

According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the force applied to an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes. This principle is encapsulated in the formula:

$$
F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
$$

In this context, $\Delta p$ represents the change in momentum, while $\Delta t$ signifies the time period over which this change occurs. Essentially, the formula implies that a greater force is required to change an object's momentum more rapidly.

For instance, consider a car with a mass of $1000 \, \text{kg}$ that accelerates from a velocity of $10 \, \text{m/s}$ to $20 \, \text{m/s}$ over a duration of $5 \, \text{s}$. To calculate the force exerted on the car, we first determine its initial momentum:

$$
p_{\text{initial}} = 1000 \, \text{kg} \cdot 10 \, \text{m/s} = 10,000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
$$

Next, we calculate the final momentum:

$$
p_{\text{final}} = 1000 \, \text{kg} \cdot 20 \, \text{m/s} = 20,000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
$$

The change in momentum ($\Delta p$) is then:

$$
\Delta p = p_{\text{final}} - p_{\text{initial}} = 20,000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} - 10,000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} = 10,000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
$$

Using the formula for force, we find:

$$
F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{10,000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = 2000 \, \text{N}
$$

Thus, a force of $2000 \, \text{N}$ was applied to the car.

Grasping this relationship enhances our ability to analyze various physical scenarios, such as collisions, where understanding forces and changes in momentum is essential for predicting outcomes.
