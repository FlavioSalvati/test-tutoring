Isotopes are represented using a standardized notation that incorporates the element's chemical symbol, atomic number, and mass number.

In this notation, an isotope is depicted with the element's chemical symbol, where the mass number (the total count of protons and neutrons) is placed as a superscript to the left of the symbol, and the atomic number (the number of protons) is shown as a subscript to the left of the symbol. For instance, the isotope of carbon that contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons is represented as 

$$
^{12}_{6}\text{C}.
$$

The mass number is essential because it distinguishes between the various isotopes of the same element. For example, carbon has multiple isotopes, including 

$$
^{12}_{6}\text{C}, \quad ^{13}_{6}\text{C}, \quad \text{and} \quad ^{14}_{6}\text{C}.
$$ 

All of these isotopes have 6 protons (indicated by the atomic number $6$), but they differ in the number of neutrons: 6, 7, and 8, respectively.

This notation facilitates clear and efficient identification of specific isotopes, which is particularly valuable in disciplines such as chemistry and physics, where the properties of different isotopes can significantly vary. For example, 

$$
^{12}_{6}\text{C}
$$ 

is stable, while 

$$
^{14}_{6}\text{C} 
$$ 

is radioactive and commonly used in radiocarbon dating.

Grasping isotope notation is crucial for analyzing nuclear reactions, comprehending atomic structure, and exploring the properties of elements. This system provides a concise and effective means for conveying detailed information about the atomic composition of an element.
