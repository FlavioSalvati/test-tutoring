The fundamental components of a transformer include the primary coil, the secondary coil, and the iron core.

A transformer is a device designed to modify the voltage of an alternating current (AC) supply. The primary coil, which is where the input voltage is applied, consists of a coil of wire—typically made of copper—that is wound around one side of the iron core. When an AC voltage is applied to the primary coil, it generates a varying magnetic field within the iron core.

The secondary coil is responsible for delivering the transformed voltage. Similar to the primary coil, the secondary coil is also composed of a wire coil wound around the opposite side of the iron core. The changing magnetic field in the iron core induces a voltage in the secondary coil. The relationship between the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils determines whether the voltage is stepped up (increased) or stepped down (decreased).

The iron core plays a vital role in the operation of the transformer. It is constructed from laminated iron sheets, which help minimize energy losses caused by eddy currents. The iron core effectively channels the magnetic field generated by the primary coil through to the secondary coil, ensuring efficient energy transfer between the two coils. Its high magnetic permeability allows the core to support the magnetic field effectively, enhancing the transformer's overall efficiency.

In summary, the primary coil receives the input voltage, the secondary coil provides the output voltage, and the iron core facilitates efficient energy transfer between the coils. Understanding these components is essential for comprehending how transformers function to adjust voltage levels in electrical circuits.
