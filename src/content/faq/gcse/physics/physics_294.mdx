Efficiency is determined using the following formula:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful Energy Output}}{\text{Total Energy Input}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

In essence, efficiency measures how effectively a device or system transforms the energy it receives into useful work or output. This formula is expressed as a percentage, which facilitates the comparison of performance among various devices or systems. To calculate efficiency, two critical pieces of information are required: the useful energy output and the total energy input.

The **useful energy output** refers to the amount of energy that is effectively utilized for its intended purpose. For instance, in the case of a light bulb, the useful energy output is the light energy it produces. Conversely, the **total energy input** is the total amount of energy supplied to the device or system. For a light bulb, this would be the electrical energy it consumes.

To calculate efficiency, you divide the useful energy output by the total energy input. This calculation yields a decimal value, which is then multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage. For example, if a light bulb consumes $100$ joules of electrical energy and emits $20$ joules of light energy, its efficiency can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{20}{100} \right) \times 100\% = 20\%
$$

Understanding efficiency is crucial because it enables us to evaluate how well energy is utilized and to pinpoint areas where improvements can be made. Devices with higher efficiency are more adept at converting energy into useful work, which can lead to energy savings and reduced costs. In GCSE Physics, you will frequently encounter questions requiring you to calculate the efficiency of various devices and to understand the real-world implications of these calculations.
