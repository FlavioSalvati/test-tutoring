The standard unit of power in the International System of Units (SI) is the watt, denoted as (W).

Power quantifies the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. In SI, one watt is defined as the transfer of one joule of energy per second. Therefore, if a device consumes one joule of energy each second, its power output is one watt.

To illustrate this concept, consider a light bulb with a power rating of 60 watts. This indicates that the bulb uses 60 joules of energy every second to produce light. In general, a higher wattage signifies that the device consumes more energy over a specified period.

Power can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Power (P)} = \frac{\text{Energy (E)}}{\text{Time (t)}}
$$

In this formula, power ($P$) is measured in watts (W), energy ($E$) is in joules (J), and time ($t$) is in seconds (s).

Understanding power is essential in daily life. For instance, when examining electrical appliances, their power ratings provide insight into their energy consumption. Typically, a higher power rating indicates that the appliance will use more electricity, which can subsequently impact your energy bills.

In addition to watts, power can also be expressed in kilowatts (kW), where $1 \text{ kW} = 1000 \text{ W}$. This unit is commonly used for larger appliances and is relevant in contexts such as electricity bills, where energy consumption is often measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Grasping the concept of power and its measurement is crucial for making informed decisions regarding energy usage and efficiency, which is a fundamental aspect of studying physics at the GCSE level.
