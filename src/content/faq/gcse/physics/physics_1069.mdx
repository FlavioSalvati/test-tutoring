Black body radiation refers to the emission of electromagnetic radiation by an object that is in thermal equilibrium.

When an object is in thermal equilibrium, it maintains a constant temperature and does not gain or lose heat to its environment. A black body is an idealized entity that absorbs all incoming radiation, irrespective of wavelength or angle, and emits radiation in a characteristic spectrum that depends solely on its temperature. This emitted radiation is termed black body radiation.

The idea of black body radiation is essential for understanding thermal equilibrium, as it illustrates how objects emit and absorb energy. In thermal equilibrium, the energy emitted by an object as radiation is equal to the energy it absorbs from its surroundings. This balance ensures that the object's temperature remains constant. The spectrum of the emitted radiation adheres to Planck's law, which indicates that the intensity and distribution of wavelengths of the radiation depend exclusively on the temperature of the black body.

For instance, when a piece of metal is heated, it begins to glow, transitioning from red to yellow and eventually to white as its temperature increases. This change in color corresponds to the emission of different wavelengths of light as the metal becomes hotter. The metal radiates energy in an attempt to achieve thermal equilibrium.

Additionally, understanding black body radiation clarifies why objects at varying temperatures emit different types of radiation. Cooler objects, such as humans, emit infrared radiation, which is invisible to the naked eye but can be perceived as heat. In contrast, hotter objects, like the Sun, emit visible light and even ultraviolet radiation.

In summary, black body radiation is a fundamental concept that enhances our understanding of how objects in thermal equilibrium emit and absorb energy, thereby maintaining a constant temperature.
