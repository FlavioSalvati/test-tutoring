The limit of proportionality on a graph represents the point at which the straight-line relationship between two variables ceases to hold.

To elaborate, consider a graph that plots force against extension for a spring. The limit of proportionality is identified as the point where the graph transitions from a straight line to a curve. Up to this limit, force and extension are directly proportional; this means that if you double the force applied, the extension will also double. This linear relationship is described by Hooke's Law, which asserts that the force exerted on a spring is directly proportional to its extension, as long as the limit of proportionality is not exceeded.

To locate this point on the graph, look for the area where the curve begins to deviate from the straight line. Prior to reaching the limit of proportionality, the graph should depict a straight line that passes through the origin, indicating a constant ratio between force and extension. However, once the graph begins to curve, the material no longer adheres to Hooke's Law, and the extension starts to increase at a different rate relative to the applied force.

In practical applications, you can draw a best-fit straight line through the initial linear segment of your data points. The limit of proportionality is the point at which your data points begin to consistently fall away from this straight line. This point is significant in the fields of physics and engineering because it indicates the maximum stress that can be applied to a material while still maintaining a predictable, linear relationship between force and extension. Exceeding this limit may lead to permanent deformation or even failure of the material.
