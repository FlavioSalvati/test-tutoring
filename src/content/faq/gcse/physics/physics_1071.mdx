Wien's displacement law describes the relationship between the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a black body and its temperature, stating that they are inversely proportional.

In essence, Wien's displacement law provides insights into how the color of light emitted by an object varies with its temperature. A black body is an idealized physical object that perfectly absorbs all incoming radiation and re-emits it flawlessly. According to Wien's law, as the temperature of a black body increases, the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation—known as the peak wavelength—decreases. This indicates that hotter objects emit light at shorter wavelengths, which corresponds to higher energy levels and different colors.

Mathematically, Wien's displacement law is articulated as:

$$
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
$$

where:
- $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ denotes the peak wavelength,
- $T$ represents the absolute temperature of the black body measured in Kelvin (K),
- $b$ is Wien's constant, approximately $2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m K}$.

For instance, when you heat a piece of metal, it may first emit a red glow, then shift to orange, and eventually appear white as its temperature rises. This transition occurs because the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation moves from longer wavelengths (red) to shorter wavelengths (blue and beyond) as the temperature increases.

Grasping Wien's displacement law is essential in various disciplines, particularly in astrophysics, where it aids scientists in determining the temperatures of stars by analyzing the light they emit. Additionally, it has practical applications in designing thermal cameras and understanding the thermal radiation of everyday objects. By knowing the temperature of an object, we can predict the color of light it will emit, and conversely, infer its temperature from the observed color.
