The work done by a force is determined by multiplying the force by the distance over which the force acts in the direction of that force.

To clarify this concept, we can express the formula for work done ($W$) as follows:

$$ 
W = F \times d \times \cos(\theta) 
$$

In this equation, $W$ represents the work done, $F$ is the magnitude of the applied force, $d$ is the distance that the object moves while the force is applied, and $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement.

In simpler terms, when you exert a force on an object and it moves a certain distance in the direction of that force, you can compute the work done by using the formula: multiply the force by the distance. For instance, if you push a box with a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ and it travels $5 \, \text{m}$ in the direction of that push, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
W = 10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{J} 
$$

The unit of work is the joule ($\text{J}$), which is defined as one newton-meter ($\text{N} \cdot \text{m}$).

When the force is not applied exactly in the direction of the movement, it is important to account for the angle $\theta$. In such cases, only the component of the force that acts in the direction of the movement contributes to the work done. This is where the term $\cos(\theta)$ in the formula becomes significant. For example, if the force is applied at an angle of $30^\circ$ to the direction of movement, the work done would be calculated using:

$$ 
W = F \times d \times \cos(30^\circ) 
$$

Grasping this concept is essential in physics, as it allows for the analysis of energy transfer in various scenarios, such as lifting objects, pushing carts, and even in more complex systems like engines and machinery.
