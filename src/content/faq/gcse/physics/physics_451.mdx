The gravitational force between two objects diminishes with the square of the distance separating them.

This phenomenon is articulated by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which asserts that every mass exerts an attractive force on every other mass. This force is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ denotes the distance between the centers of these masses.

Consequently, if the distance between two objects is doubled, the gravitational force between them decreases to one-quarter of its original value. Similarly, if the distance is tripled, the force reduces to one-ninth of what it was. This characteristic is referred to as the inverse-square law, highlighting that the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.

Grasping this concept is essential in various fields of physics and astronomy. For instance, it clarifies why planets situated farther from the Sun, such as Neptune, experience significantly weaker gravitational forces compared to those that are closer, like Earth. This principle also explains the microgravity phenomena experienced by astronauts aboard the International Space Station; they are positioned at a distance where the Earth's gravitational pull is markedly diminished, although it is not entirely absent.

In practical terms, the inverse-square relationship signifies that gravitational forces can become exceedingly weak over vast distances, which accounts for why we do not perceive the gravitational influence of distant stars and galaxies in our daily experiences. However, at shorter distances, such as between the Earth and the Moon, the gravitational force is sufficiently strong to produce notable effects, such as the generation of ocean tides.
