Materials that can be magnetized include iron, nickel, cobalt, and certain alloys derived from these metals.

**Magnetization** is the process through which specific materials develop magnetic properties. The most commonly known materials capable of being magnetized are iron, nickel, and cobalt, collectively referred to as **ferromagnetic materials**. These ferromagnetic materials contain regions known as **magnetic domains**, where the magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned in a uniform direction. When an external magnetic field is applied, these domains can align, resulting in the magnetization of the material.

Among these, iron is the most recognized ferromagnetic material and is extensively utilized in various applications, such as in the cores of electromagnets and transformers. Nickel and cobalt also possess significant magnetic properties and are employed in specialized applications, including the production of high-strength permanent magnets and certain sensor technologies.

In addition to pure metals, several alloys can also exhibit magnetic properties. For instance, steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon, can be magnetized. Other notable examples include **Alnico**, an alloy composed of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt, and **Permalloy**, which consists of nickel and iron. These alloys are specifically engineered to possess unique magnetic characteristics and find applications in various technologies, such as electric motors, magnetic storage devices, and loudspeakers.

It is crucial to recognize that not all materials can be magnetized. Non-magnetic materials, such as copper, aluminum, and plastic, lack the necessary atomic structure to facilitate the alignment of magnetic domains. These materials are categorized as **diamagnetic** or **paramagnetic**, and they exhibit either very weak or no magnetic properties when subjected to a magnetic field.
