Newton's First Law of Motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force. This law, also known as the law of inertia, emphasizes that an object will not change its state of motion without the influence of a force. Specifically, for an object that is stationary, it will continue to be at rest until a force causes it to move. This external force can take various forms, including a push, a pull, or any interaction capable of altering the object's motion.

Consider a book resting on a table. According to Newton's First Law, the book will remain in that position indefinitely unless a force acts upon it. This force might be you lifting it, a strong gust of wind, or even the table being tilted. In the absence of such forces, the book stays at rest because there is no impetus for it to begin moving.

Inertia refers to the property of matter that resists changes in its state of motion. For objects at rest, this means that they will not initiate movement on their own. The greater the mass of an object, the larger its inertia, and consequently, the more force is required to alter its state of rest. For instance, it is significantly easier to push a small toy car than it is to push a real car, as the real car possesses much greater mass and, therefore, significantly more inertia.

In summary, Newton's First Law elucidates the reason why objects at rest remain at rest: they require an external force to overcome their inertia and initiate motion. This principle is foundational for understanding the relationship between forces and motion in the physical world.
