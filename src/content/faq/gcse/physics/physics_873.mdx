Work done is calculated by multiplying the force applied to an object by the distance over which that force acts in the direction of the force. 

To determine the work done in practical situations, you first need to identify both the magnitude of the force applied to an object and the distance it moves as a result of that force. The formula for calculating work done is expressed as:

$$
\text{Work Done (J)} = \text{Force (N)} \times \text{Distance (m)}
$$

In this equation, the unit of work done is the joule (J), the unit of force is the newton (N), and the unit of distance is the metre (m).

For example, if you push a box with a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ over a distance of $5 \, \text{m}$, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$
10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{J}
$$

It is crucial to measure the distance in the direction of the applied force. If the force and the movement do not align, you must only consider the component of the force that acts in the direction of the movement. This adjustment can be made using trigonometric principles if the force is applied at an angle.

In practical scenarios, you might use tools such as a spring balance to measure the force and a tape measure or ruler to determine the distance. For instance, when pulling a sled, you could employ a spring balance to gauge the pulling force and a tape measure to assess how far the sled travels.

Keep in mind that if there is no movement, no work is accomplished, regardless of the amount of force applied. This principle is fundamental to understanding the concept of work in physics.
