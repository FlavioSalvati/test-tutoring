Convex lenses and concave lenses have distinct effects on light rays: convex lenses converge light rays, while concave lenses cause them to diverge.

**Convex Lenses**  
Convex lenses, also referred to as converging lenses, are characterized by being thicker in the center than at the edges. When parallel light rays enter a convex lens, they are refracted inward and converge at a point known as the focal point. This unique property makes convex lenses essential for various applications, such as magnifying glasses, cameras, and corrective lenses for treating farsightedness. The distance from the lens to the focal point is called the focal length, denoted as $f$, and for convex lenses, this value is positive: 

$$ f > 0 $$

**Concave Lenses**  
In contrast, concave lenses, or diverging lenses, are thinner in the center and thicker at the edges. When parallel light rays pass through a concave lens, they spread out or diverge. The light rays appear to originate from a single point known as the focal point, which is located on the same side of the lens as the incoming light. This property makes concave lenses useful in devices like peepholes in doors and corrective lenses for nearsightedness. The focal length of a concave lens is negative, indicating that the focal point is virtual and lies on the same side as the incoming light:

$$ f < 0 $$

**Image Formation**  
When it comes to image formation, convex lenses can produce both real and virtual images, depending on the object's position relative to the focal point. If the object is placed beyond the focal length, a real, inverted image is formed on the opposite side of the lens. Conversely, when the object is positioned within the focal length, a virtual, upright, and magnified image appears on the same side as the object. In contrast, concave lenses consistently produce virtual, upright, and smaller images, regardless of the object's position.

Understanding these differences is essential for various practical applications in optics. This knowledge aids in the design of instruments that effectively manipulate light for numerous uses.
