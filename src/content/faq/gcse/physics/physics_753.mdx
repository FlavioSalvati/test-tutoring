Phase changes significantly influence internal energy by either absorbing or releasing energy while maintaining a constant temperature for the substance involved.

When a substance undergoes a phase change—such as melting, freezing, boiling, or condensing—its internal energy is altered. Internal energy refers to the total energy contained within a substance, which encompasses both kinetic energy (arising from the motion of particles) and potential energy (resulting from the spatial arrangement of particles). During a phase change, the temperature of the substance does not fluctuate; consequently, the average kinetic energy of the particles remains unchanged. Instead, the energy that is absorbed or released during this transition modifies the potential energy of the particles.

For instance, when ice melts to form water, it absorbs energy from its surroundings. This energy is utilized to break the bonds between the water molecules in the solid state, enabling them to move more freely in the liquid state. Despite the energy absorption, the temperature of the ice-water mixture stays constant at $0\,^\circ\text{C}$ until all the ice has completely melted. Similarly, during the boiling of water to generate steam, energy is absorbed to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold the liquid molecules together, allowing them to move freely as gas molecules. Throughout this process, the temperature remains steady at $100\,^\circ\text{C}$.

On the other hand, when a substance releases energy during a phase change—such as when water freezes to become ice or when steam condenses into water—the energy is expelled into the surrounding environment. This energy release enables the particles to form stronger bonds, transitioning from a higher potential energy state to a lower one. Once again, the temperature remains constant during these phase changes, specifically at $0\,^\circ\text{C}$ for freezing and $100\,^\circ\text{C}$ for condensation.

A comprehensive understanding of how phase changes affect internal energy is crucial for analyzing various natural and industrial processes. This knowledge can help explain phenomena such as the cooling effect of sweating and the functioning of refrigerators and heat pumps.
