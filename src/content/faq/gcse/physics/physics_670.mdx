The terms "direct potential difference" (DC) and "alternating potential difference" (AC) refer to two distinct types of electrical current, each with unique characteristics and applications.

### Direct Current (DC)

Direct potential difference, commonly referred to as direct current (DC), is a type of electrical current where the flow of electric charge is unidirectional. This means that the electric charge consistently moves in a single directionâ€”from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. Common sources of DC include batteries and solar cells. In a circuit powered by a DC source, the potential difference between two points remains constant, indicating that the voltage does not fluctuate over time.

### Alternating Current (AC)

In contrast, alternating potential difference, known as alternating current (AC), is characterized by the periodic reversal of the direction of electric charge flow. In an AC circuit, the voltage between two points varies over time, typically following a sinusoidal pattern. This oscillation means that the potential difference alternates between positive and negative values. A prevalent source of AC is the mains electricity supply; for instance, in the UK, the frequency is $50 \, \text{Hz}$, meaning that the current changes direction $50$ times per second.

### Key Differences

The primary distinction between DC and AC lies in how the potential difference behaves over time. In a DC system, the potential difference remains steady and unchanging, making it ideal for low-voltage applications and electronic devices that require a stable voltage. Conversely, the fluctuating potential difference of AC makes it more efficient for transmitting electricity over long distances, which is why it is predominantly used for mains electricity.

Understanding these differences is essential for analyzing electrical circuits and selecting the appropriate power source for various applications. For example, while household appliances are typically designed to operate on AC, many electronic devices run on DC and thus require an adapter to convert the AC from the mains supply into the necessary DC voltage.
