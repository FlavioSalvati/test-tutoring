To assess the efficiency of energy transfer, we utilize the formula:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful Energy Output}}{\text{Total Energy Input}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

Efficiency serves as a measure of how effectively energy is utilized within a process. To compute this value, two key components are required: the useful energy output and the total energy input. The useful energy output represents the energy that is successfully employed for its intended purpose, while the total energy input is the energy initially supplied to the system.

Consider the example of a light bulb. The total energy input is the electrical energy consumed by the bulb, whereas the useful energy output is the light energy it generates. However, it is important to note that not all of the electrical energy is converted into light; a portion is dissipated as heat. By measuring both the electrical energy input and the light energy output, one can apply the efficiency formula to determine the light bulb's efficiency.

The efficiency formula can be expressed as follows:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful Energy Output}}{\text{Total Energy Input}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

This calculation yields a percentage. If a device achieves 100% efficiency, it indicates that all input energy is transformed into useful output energy. However, in practice, no device reaches 100% efficiency, as some energy is invariably lost, typically in the form of heat.

For example, if a light bulb consumes $100$ joules of electrical energy and produces $60$ joules of light energy, the efficiency can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{60}{100} \right) \times 100\% = 60\%
$$

This result indicates that $60\%$ of the electrical energy is converted into light, while the remaining $40\%$ is wasted, primarily as heat.

Understanding efficiency is crucial for selecting better devices and enhancing energy utilization, which ultimately aids in conserving energy and reducing costs.
