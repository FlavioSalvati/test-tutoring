Speed is determined by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken to cover that distance. 

To calculate speed, you can use the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} 
$$

This formula indicates that you need to take the total distance an object has moved and divide it by the total time it took to travel that distance. The units you choose for distance and time will dictate the resulting units for speed. For example, if distance is measured in metres ($\text{m}$) and time in seconds ($\text{s}$), the speed will be expressed in metres per second ($\text{m/s}$).

Letâ€™s illustrate this with an example. Suppose you walk a distance of $100$ metres in $20$ seconds. Applying the formula gives:

$$ 
\text{Speed} = \frac{100 \text{ m}}{20 \text{ s}} = 5 \text{ m/s} 
$$

Thus, your speed would be $5$ metres per second.

It's crucial to understand that speed is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction. This distinguishes it from velocity, which is a vector quantity that encompasses both magnitude and direction.

In everyday situations, you might commonly encounter speed in units like kilometres per hour ($\text{km/h}$) or miles per hour ($\text{mph}$). The same formula applies, but it's vital to ensure that the units for distance and time are consistent. For instance, if you drive $150$ kilometres in $3$ hours, your speed would be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\text{Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ km}}{3 \text{ h}} = 50 \text{ km/h} 
$$

Grasping how to calculate speed is fundamental in physics, as it enables you to analyze motion and comprehend how objects move in various contexts.
