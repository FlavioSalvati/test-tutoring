Scientists analyze changes in Earth's temperature using a range of data sources, including satellite observations, weather stations, ocean buoys, and climate models.

To comprehend how Earth's temperature evolves over time, researchers employ various tools and methodologies. One of the primary sources of temperature data is satellite observations. Satellites orbiting the Earth are equipped with advanced instruments that continuously measure the temperature of both the atmosphere and the surface. These measurements provide a comprehensive view of global temperature patterns.

Ground-based weather stations also play a critical role in temperature monitoring. Distributed across the globe, these stations collect temperature data at specific locations. By aggregating data from thousands of weather stations, scientists can track temperature changes over extensive areas and extended periods. This ground-based information is essential for validating and calibrating satellite measurements.

Ocean buoys represent another vital tool in climate research. These floating devices are equipped with sensors that measure sea surface temperatures. Given that oceans cover approximately $70\%$ of the Earth's surface and significantly influence global climate, monitoring ocean temperatures is crucial. The data collected from these buoys help scientists understand how heat is distributed and stored within the oceans.

Climate models are sophisticated computer programs that simulate the Earth's climate system. These models utilize mathematical equations to represent the interactions among the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. By inputting historical temperature data and other climate variables, scientists can predict future temperature changes and evaluate the impacts of various factors, such as greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to these methods, scientists investigate natural records such as ice cores and tree rings to gain insights into past climate conditions. For instance, ice cores contain trapped air bubbles that provide valuable information about historical atmospheric temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations. By integrating data from these diverse sources, scientists can create a comprehensive understanding of how Earth's temperature has changed over time and make informed predictions about future climate scenarios.
