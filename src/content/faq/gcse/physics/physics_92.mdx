The atomic number is defined as the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom.

More specifically, the atomic number is a fundamental characteristic of an element, represented by the symbol $ Z $. It uniquely identifies an element and determines its position within the Periodic Table. For instance, hydrogen has an atomic number of $ 1 $, indicating the presence of one proton in its nucleus, while carbon has an atomic number of $ 6 $, signifying that it contains six protons.

The atomic number plays a crucial role in defining the chemical behavior of an element. Elements that share the same atomic number have an identical number of protons and, typically, an equal number of electrons when in a neutral state. These electrons are organized into specific energy levels or shells surrounding the nucleus, and their configuration influences how the element interacts chemically with others.

For example, all oxygen atoms possess an atomic number of $ 8 $, which means each has eight protons. This uniformity allows scientists to predict the behavior of oxygen in chemical reactions, such as its ability to form water when it combines with hydrogen.

Furthermore, the atomic number is essential for distinguishing between various isotopes of an element. Isotopes are variants that have the same number of protons but differ in their number of neutrons. For example, both carbon-12 and carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon, sharing an atomic number of $ 6 $ while differing in their neutron counts.

Grasping the concept of atomic number is vital for analyzing the properties of elements and their compounds, making it a foundational principle in the fields of chemistry and physics.
