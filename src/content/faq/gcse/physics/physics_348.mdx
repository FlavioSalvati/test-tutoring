If an electrical appliance catches fire, your immediate actions should be to unplug it (if it is safe), use a fire extinguisher, and contact emergency services.

When responding to an electrical fire, the first step is to unplug the appliance, provided you can do so safely. Disconnecting it from the electrical supply can help prevent the fire from spreading. However, if the fire is too intense or you would need to reach through flames to unplug the appliance, do not attempt this. Your safety is the top priority.

Next, if you have access to a fire extinguisher, ensure it is suitable for electrical fires. Look for one labeled as Class C or Class E. These extinguishers contain non-conductive agents such as dry powder or carbon dioxide, which can effectively extinguish electrical fires without the risk of conducting electricity. Never use water to douse an electrical fire, as water conducts electricity and can lead to electric shocks or exacerbate the fire.

If a suitable fire extinguisher is not available, consider using a fire blanket to smother the flames. A fire blanket can effectively cut off the oxygen supply, helping to extinguish the fire. When using a fire blanket, ensure your hands are protected and carefully place the blanket over the flames.

After attempting to control the fire or if it is too large to manage, evacuate the area immediately and call emergency services. Provide them with all necessary information, including the type of appliance involved and the nature of the fire. Emergency responders are trained to handle such situations and will arrive with the appropriate equipment to safely manage the fire.

Always prioritize your safety and the safety of those around you. If at any point you feel the fire is beyond your control, evacuate the area and wait for professional help to arrive.
