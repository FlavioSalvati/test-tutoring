The unit of a moment is expressed in newton-metres (Nm).

In the realm of physics, a moment quantifies the turning effect produced by a force applied at a specific point on an object. It is calculated by multiplying the force (measured in newtons, denoted as $N$) by the perpendicular distance from the point of rotation to the line of action of the force (measured in metres, denoted as $m$). Consequently, the unit of a moment is derived from the product of these two measurements, resulting in newton-metres ($\text{Nm}$).

To illustrate this concept, consider the scenario of using a spanner to tighten a bolt. The force exerted on the spanner is quantified in newtons, while the length of the spanner—representing the distance from the bolt (the axis of rotation) to the point where the force is applied—is measured in metres. The moment is determined by multiplying these two values together. For instance, if you apply a force of $10 \, N$ at a distance of $0.5 \, m$ from the bolt, the moment can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Moment} = 10 \, N \times 0.5 \, m = 5 \, \text{Nm}
$$

Moments play a vital role in understanding the rotational effects of forces on objects. They are essential for analyzing various mechanical situations, such as assessing whether an object will tip over or maintain its balance. For example, when you sit on a seesaw, the moments generated by your weight and the weight of the individual on the opposite side dictate whether the seesaw remains level or tilts.

In conclusion, the unit of a moment—newton-metres—captures the relationship between the applied force and the distance from the pivot point, offering a precise measure of the rotational impact of that force.
