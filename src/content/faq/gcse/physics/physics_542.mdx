In this investigation, you will explore the absorption of infrared radiation by various materials and measure the resulting temperature changes using an infrared sensor.

To conduct this experiment, you will need a heat source, such as a lamp, and a selection of materials with different properties, including black paper, white paper, and aluminum foil. Ensure that each material is placed at an equal distance from the heat source to maintain consistency and fairness in your tests. Utilize an infrared sensor or thermometer to measure the temperature of each material after a predetermined exposure time to the infrared radiation.

Begin the experiment by turning on the heat source and allowing it to warm up sufficiently. Next, position the first material in front of the heat source and record its initial temperature. After a fixed duration, such as $5$ minutes, measure the temperature again and calculate the temperature change. Ensure you document these changes meticulously. Repeat this process for each of the materials, making sure that the distance from the heat source and the duration of exposure remain constant throughout the experiment.

By comparing the temperature changes recorded for each material, you can analyze which materials are more effective at absorbing infrared radiation. Generally, darker and matte surfaces, such as black paper, tend to absorb infrared radiation more effectively, resulting in a greater increase in temperature. Conversely, lighter and reflective surfaces, like white paper and aluminum foil, absorb less infrared radiation and exhibit a smaller temperature increase.

This experiment not only aids in understanding the principles of infrared radiation absorption but also illustrates the practical applications of these principles. Such knowledge is crucial in fields like energy-efficient building design and the development of advanced thermal insulation materials.
