Energy efficiency is defined as the ratio of useful energy output to total energy input, expressed as a percentage. To calculate energy efficiency, you multiply this ratio by $100\%$.

To clarify the concept of energy efficiency, it measures how effectively a device or system transforms energy from one form to another while minimizing energy waste. The formula for calculating energy efficiency is:

$$ 
\text{Energy Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful Energy Output}}{\text{Total Energy Input}} \right) \times 100\% 
$$

For instance, consider a light bulb that consumes $100$ joules of electrical energy and produces $20$ joules of light energy. In this scenario, the useful energy output is $20$ joules, while the total energy input is $100$ joules. By substituting these values into the formula, we obtain:

$$ 
\text{Energy Efficiency} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ J}}{100 \text{ J}} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% 
$$

This calculation indicates that $20\%$ of the electrical energy is successfully converted into light, whereas the remaining $80\%$ is lost, typically as heat.

In the context of GCSE Physics, it is essential to recognize that no device can achieve $100\%$ efficiency due to energy losses, which often occur in the form of heat due to friction or electrical resistance. For example, in a car engine, the chemical energy from the fuel is transformed into kinetic energy to propel the vehicle, but a portion of this energy is dissipated as heat and sound.

To enhance energy efficiency, engineers and scientists strive to minimize these energy losses. A practical example is the use of LED bulbs instead of traditional incandescent bulbs; LEDs are significantly more efficient as they convert a greater percentage of electrical energy into light.

In summary, understanding energy efficiency is vital not only in physics but also in our daily lives. It plays a key role in conserving resources and reducing environmental impact.
