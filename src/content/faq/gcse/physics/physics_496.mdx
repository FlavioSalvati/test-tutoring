Speed and velocity are fundamental concepts in physics that describe motion, but they have distinct meanings.

**Speed** is a scalar quantity that measures how fast an object is moving, expressed as the rate at which it covers distance. Since speed is a scalar, it possesses only magnitude (size) and lacks any directional component. For example, if a car travels at a speed of $60$ miles per hour, this indicates how quickly the car is moving without providing information about the direction of its travel.

In contrast, **velocity** is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. For instance, if the same car is moving at $60$ miles per hour to the north, we can say its velocity is $60$ miles per hour north. The inclusion of direction is essential, as it distinguishes velocity from speed. If the car changes its direction while maintaining the same speed, its velocity will change due to the alteration in the directional component.

Understanding the difference between speed and velocity is crucial for analyzing motion in physics. For instance, when calculating the displacement of an object—defined as how far it is from its starting point—one must consider its velocity rather than just its speed. Displacement is a vector quantity and is inherently dependent on the direction of travel.

Another important aspect to note is that velocity can be negative, indicating movement in the opposite direction, while speed is always a non-negative value. For example, if you walk $5$ meters forward and then $5$ meters backward, your speed remains the same in both instances, but your velocity will be positive during the forward motion and negative during the backward motion.

In summary, while speed conveys how fast an object is moving, velocity provides information on both the speed and the direction of its movement. This distinction is vital for a comprehensive understanding of motion in physics.
