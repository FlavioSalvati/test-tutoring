Internal energy refers to the total energy contained within a substance, encompassing both kinetic and potential energy.

To elaborate, internal energy is crucial for understanding the behavior of particles across different states of matter. It is the cumulative total of two energy types: kinetic energy, which pertains to the energy of motion, and potential energy, which relates to the energy stored due to the relative positions of the particles.

When we discuss kinetic energy in the context of internal energy, we focus on the movement of particles. For instance, in a gas, particles move rapidly and freely, frequently colliding with one another and with the walls of their container. This rapid motion contributes to a high kinetic energy component in the internal energy of gases. In liquids, although particles are still in motion, they are more closely packed and slide past each other, resulting in a moderate level of kinetic energy. Conversely, in solids, particles vibrate in fixed positions, leading to a comparatively lower kinetic energy than that found in liquids and gases.

Potential energy, in contrast, is influenced by the interactions and forces between particles. In solids, where particles are tightly packed in a regular arrangement, the potential energy is relatively high due to the strong forces that hold them together. In liquids, particles are less tightly packed, which results in lower potential energy. In gases, the particles are widely spaced, leading to very low potential energy as the forces between them are minimal.

Changes in internal energy can occur through processes such as heating or cooling. When a substance is heated, its particles absorb kinetic energy, causing them to move more rapidly and thereby increasing the internal energy. Conversely, when a substance is cooled, its particles lose kinetic energy, move more slowly, and the internal energy decreases. Understanding internal energy is essential for explaining the transitions between states of matter, such as melting, boiling, and freezing, since these processes involve significant changes in the energy of the particles involved.
