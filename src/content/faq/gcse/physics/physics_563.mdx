When a magnet is cut in half, each resulting piece becomes a smaller magnet, complete with its own north and south poles.

Upon cutting a magnet, you do not obtain a distinct north pole and a distinct south pole. Instead, each of the two halves generates its own north and south poles. This occurs because the magnetic domains within the magnet—tiny regions where the magnetic fields of atoms are aligned—realign themselves to create new north and south poles in each segment.

Consider a bar magnet with a north pole at one end and a south pole at the other. If you cut this bar magnet in the middle, the atoms in each half will rearrange such that each new piece has a north pole at one end and a south pole at the other. This behavior arises because the magnetic domains within the magnet seek to align themselves in a manner that forms a complete magnetic circuit, always featuring a north and south pole.

It is important to note that the strength of the magnetic field in each of the new magnets will be weaker than that of the original magnet, assuming the original magnet was uniformly magnetized. The strength of the magnetic field is directly related to the size of the magnet. However, the overall magnetic properties remain unchanged; each piece will still attract ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and will interact with other magnets in the same manner as the original magnet.

This phenomenon exemplifies a fundamental property of magnets and serves as a clear illustration of the workings of magnetic fields and magnetic domains. It also highlights an essential principle: you cannot isolate a north pole from a south pole; they always exist in pairs, regardless of how many times the magnet is cut.
