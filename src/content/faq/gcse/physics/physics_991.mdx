Action and reaction forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, as articulated by Newton's Third Law of Motion.

When you exert a force against a wall, the wall responds by pushing back with an equal force in the opposite direction. This scenario exemplifies action and reaction forces in action. According to Newton's Third Law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This principle indicates that forces always occur in pairs. If object A applies a force on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction on object A.

Consider the situation where you are standing on a skateboard and you push against a wall. The force you exert on the wall represents the action force. In response, the wall exerts an equal reaction force back on you. Although the wall is much larger and fixed in place—thus not moving—you and the skateboard roll backward. This scenario illustrates how action and reaction forces can result in movement.

Another example occurs when a bird takes flight. The bird pushes air downwards with its wings (action force), and in turn, the air pushes the bird upwards (reaction force), enabling it to ascend from the ground. Similarly, when you leap off a diving board, you push down on the board (action force), and the board pushes you upward into the air (reaction force).

It is crucial to understand that action and reaction forces act on different objects. This distinction is why they do not cancel each other out. If both forces acted on a single object, they would indeed balance each other, resulting in no movement. Grasping this concept is essential for explaining a wide range of physical phenomena, from the simple act of walking to the intricate mechanics of rocket propulsion.
