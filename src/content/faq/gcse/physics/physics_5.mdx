Energy undergoes changes during physical processes through transfer, transformation, or conservation, all in accordance with the fundamental laws of physics.

In any physical process, energy can shift between different forms, but the total amount of energy remains constant. This principle is encapsulated in the law of conservation of energy. For instance, when water is boiled, electrical energy is converted into thermal energy, resulting in an increase in the water's temperature. This transformation is a crucial concept for understanding energy dynamics in various scenarios.

Let's consider a roller coaster: at the peak of a hill, it possesses maximum gravitational potential energy. As the coaster descends, this potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy, which is the energy associated with motion. When the coaster ascends another hill, kinetic energy is converted back into potential energy. Throughout the ride, energy continuously changes between these two forms, although the total energy remains constant, excluding any losses due to factors like friction and air resistance.

In chemical reactions, such as the combustion of wood, the chemical energy stored in molecular bonds is released as thermal energy and light. This serves as another example of energy transformation. Likewise, in electrical circuits, the chemical energy stored in batteries is converted into electrical energy, which can subsequently be transformed into light, heat, or mechanical energy depending on the device being powered.

Energy can also be transferred from one object to another. For example, when you push a book across a table, kinetic energy is transferred from your hand to the book. However, a portion of this energy is transformed into thermal energy due to the friction between the book and the table.

Understanding these energy changes is essential for analyzing physical processes in daily life as well as in scientific experiments. By recognizing how energy is transferred and transformed, we can gain deeper insights into the principles that govern the physical universe.
