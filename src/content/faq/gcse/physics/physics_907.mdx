To determine the spring constant, you can analyze a graph of force versus extension by calculating the gradient of the force-extension curve.

Let's begin with Hooke's Law, which states that the force $ F $ applied to a spring is directly proportional to the extension $ x $ of that spring, provided the elastic limit is not exceeded. This relationship is mathematically represented as:

$$
F = kx
$$

where $ k $ is the spring constant. The spring constant $ k $ quantifies the stiffness of the spring.

When you graph force $ F $ against extension $ x $, the result is typically a straight line if the spring behaves according to Hooke's Law. The slope (or gradient) of this line corresponds to the spring constant $ k $. To find the gradient, you need to select two points on the straight line. Let's denote these points as $(x_1, F_1)$ and $(x_2, F_2)$.

The gradient $ k $ can be calculated using the formula:

$$
k = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = \frac{F_2 - F_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

This calculation involves subtracting the force values and the extension values of the two selected points, and then dividing the difference in force by the difference in extension. The result will give you the spring constant in units of Newtons per meter (N/m).

For instance, consider a graph with one point at $ (0.1 \, \text{m}, 2 \, \text{N}) $ and another point at $ (0.3 \, \text{m}, 6 \, \text{N}) $. The spring constant $ k $ can be calculated as follows:

$$
k = \frac{6 \, \text{N} - 2 \, \text{N}}{0.3 \, \text{m} - 0.1 \, \text{m}} = \frac{4 \, \text{N}}{0.2 \, \text{m}} = 20 \, \text{N/m}
$$

Thus, by analyzing the gradient of the force-extension graph, you can effectively determine the spring constant, which indicates how stiff or flexible the spring is.
