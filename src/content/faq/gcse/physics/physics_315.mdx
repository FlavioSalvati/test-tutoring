To calculate the current in a circuit, you can use the formula:

$$ I = \frac{V}{R} $$

Where:
- $I$ is the current measured in amperes (A),
- $V$ is the voltage measured in volts (V),
- $R$ is the resistance measured in ohms (Ω).

In essence, current refers to the flow of electric charge through a circuit. Voltage represents the potential difference that drives this charge, while resistance indicates the opposition to the flow of current. 

Ohm's Law encapsulates the relationship between these three quantities, stating that current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance. For example, if a circuit has a voltage of $12 \, \text{V}$ and a resistance of $4 \, \Omega$, the current can be calculated as follows:

$$ I = \frac{12 \, \text{V}}{4 \, \Omega} = 3 \, \text{A} $$

Before performing any calculations, it is essential to ensure that all measurements are in the appropriate units. If, for instance, the voltage is provided in millivolts (mV) or the resistance in kilo-ohms (kΩ), you must convert these to volts and ohms, respectively. To clarify:
- $1 \, \text{mV} = 0.001 \, \text{V}$
- $1 \, \text{k}\Omega = 1000 \, \Omega$

Understanding how to accurately calculate current is vital for analyzing and designing electrical circuits, whether dealing with simple series circuits or more intricate parallel circuits. By mastering this fundamental principle, you will be well-prepared to address a wide array of problems encountered in GCSE Physics.
