Gravity plays a crucial role in the motion of planets by keeping them in orbit around the Sun.

As a fundamental force, gravity attracts objects with mass toward one another. In our solar system, the Sun, which possesses a substantial amount of mass, exerts a significant gravitational pull on the planets. This gravitational force functions as a centripetal force, drawing the planets toward the Sun and maintaining their elliptical orbits. Without this force, the planets would travel in straight lines and eventually drift off into the vastness of space.

The strength of the gravitational force between two objects is determined by their masses and the distance separating them. According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, the gravitational force $F$ can be expressed as:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers. This equation shows that the gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Consequently, the closer a planet is to the Sun, the stronger the gravitational pull it experiences, necessitating a higher orbital speed to maintain its orbit.

For instance, Mercury, being the closest planet to the Sun, has a much shorter orbital period compared to Neptune, which is significantly farther away. Mercury completes its orbit in approximately $88$ Earth days, while Neptune takes about $165$ Earth years to make one complete orbit. This disparity can be attributed to the varying strength of the Sun's gravitational influence at different distances.

Moreover, gravity is responsible for the elliptical shape of planetary orbits, as outlined by Kepler's First Law of Planetary Motion. Rather than moving in perfect circles, planets travel in elliptical paths with the Sun located at one of the two foci of the ellipse. This elliptical motion arises from the gravitational forces exerted on the planets as they navigate through space.

In conclusion, gravity is the essential force that governs the motion of planets, ensuring they remain in stable orbits around the Sun and adhere to predictable trajectories within our solar system.
