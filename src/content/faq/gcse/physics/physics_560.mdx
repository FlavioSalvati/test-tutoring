Magnetic field lines provide a visual representation of the magnetic field surrounding a magnet, illustrating both the direction and strength of the magnetic forces at play. 

Outside a magnet, these lines consistently travel from the north pole to the south pole. This trajectory means that if you place a small compass near a magnet, the needle will align itself along these lines, pointing from the north pole to the south pole.

Conversely, inside the magnet, the magnetic field lines travel from the south pole back to the north pole, thereby completing a closed loop. This continuity is vital, as magnetic field lines are characterized by their closed-loop nature; they do not begin or end abruptly. This distinguishes them from electric field lines, which can originate or terminate on electric charges.

The density of the magnetic field lines serves as an indicator of the magnetic field's strength. When the lines are closely packed, the magnetic field is stronger; conversely, when they are spaced farther apart, the magnetic field is weaker. For instance, near the poles of a bar magnet, the field lines are densely concentrated, signifying a strong magnetic field.

Grasping the direction and characteristics of magnetic field lines is essential for various applications, including the design of electric motors, generators, and transformers. Additionally, it enhances our understanding of natural phenomena, such as the Earth's magnetic field, which plays a crucial role in shielding us from harmful solar radiation. By studying magnetic field lines, we gain valuable insights into the interactions between magnets and other materials.
