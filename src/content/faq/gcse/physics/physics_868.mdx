When work is performed on an object, energy is either transferred to or from that object.

In physics, work is defined as the process of energy transfer that occurs when a force is applied to an object, resulting in its movement. The amount of work done can be calculated using the formula:

$$
W = F \times d \times \cos(\theta)
$$

where $W$ represents the work done, $F$ is the applied force, $d$ is the distance moved by the object, and $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the force and the direction of movement. When work is performed on an object, its energy changes, which can take various forms, including kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, or even sound energy.

For instance, consider pushing a book across a table. In this scenario, you are doing work on the book. The energy you exert is transferred to the book, resulting in an increase in its kinetic energy as it moves. Similarly, when you lift a book from the floor to a shelf, you are doing work against the force of gravity. The energy expended to lift the book is converted into gravitational potential energy.

In certain situations, the energy transferred can also lead to an increase in thermal energy. For example, when you rub your hands together, the work done against friction transforms kinetic energy into thermal energy, which warms up your hands.

It is crucial to understand that energy is conserved throughout these processes. This means the total energy before and after the work is done remains constant, although it may change forms. Grasping how energy is transferred and transformed during work is essential for analyzing various physical systems and solving problems related to energy and forces, particularly in GCSE Physics.
