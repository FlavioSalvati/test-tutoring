Lenses play a crucial role in modifying the path of light by bending (or refracting) it, allowing for the formation of images through convergence or divergence.

Lenses are typically made from transparent materials such as glass or plastic, and they refract light rays that pass through them. The specific shape of the lens dictates how it interacts with light. There are two primary types of lenses: convex (converging) lenses and concave (diverging) lenses.

A convex lens is characterized by being thicker at its center than at its edges. When parallel light rays enter a convex lens, they are bent toward one another, ultimately converging at a point known as the focal point. This phenomenon is referred to as convergence. Convex lenses are commonly utilized in devices such as magnifying glasses, cameras, and corrective lenses for individuals with farsightedness. The distance from the lens to the focal point is called the focal length, denoted as $f$, and is a critical factor in determining the degree to which the lens converges light.

In contrast, a concave lens is thinner at the center and thicker at the edges. When parallel light rays pass through a concave lens, they spread out or diverge. These light rays appear to originate from a point known as the focal point, which is located on the same side of the lens as the incoming light. Concave lenses are frequently employed in applications such as peepholes and corrective lenses for nearsightedness.

The bending of light by lenses can be explained by the principle of refraction, which arises because light travels at varying speeds in different materials. When light enters or exits a lens at an angle, its speed and direction change. The extent of this bending is influenced by both the lens material and the curvature of its surfaces.

A solid understanding of how lenses function is vital across numerous fields, from the design of optical instruments to the correction of vision impairments. By manipulating the path of light, lenses allow us to perceive the world in innovative and enhanced ways.
