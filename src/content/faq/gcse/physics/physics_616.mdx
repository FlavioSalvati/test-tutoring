In a laboratory setting, specific heat capacity is measured using a combination of equipment, including a calorimeter, thermometer, balance, and heater.

A calorimeter serves as the primary instrument for measuring specific heat capacity in a typical GCSE Physics lab. It is an insulated container designed to minimize heat exchange with the surrounding environment, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the measurements. To monitor the temperature change of the substance being tested, a thermometer is necessary. Accurate temperature readings are crucial, as the calculation of specific heat capacity relies on the change in temperature.

The balance is employed to determine the mass of the substance. Knowing the precise mass is essential because specific heat capacity is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a substance by one degree Celsius. Thus, accurate mass measurements are vital for precise calculations.

An electric immersion heater is commonly used to provide a known amount of energy to the substance. This heater is typically connected to a power supply, and the energy supplied can be calculated using the formula:

$$ E = P \times t $$

where $ E $ represents the energy, $ P $ denotes power, and $ t $ indicates time. In some cases, a joulemeter may be utilized to measure the energy directly.

To ensure a uniform temperature distribution within the substance, a stirrer may be incorporated in certain experiments. This addition aids in achieving more accurate temperature readings. Furthermore, a stopwatch is often used to accurately measure the duration for which the heater is active, ensuring precise energy calculations.

By meticulously measuring the mass, temperature change, and energy supplied, you can calculate the specific heat capacity $ c $ using the formula:

$$ c = \frac{E}{m \Delta T} $$

In this equation, $ E $ is the energy supplied, $ m $ is the mass of the substance, and $ \Delta T $ is the change in temperature.
