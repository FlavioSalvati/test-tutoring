Terrestrial planets are characterized by their rocky composition and smaller size, whereas gas giants are significantly larger and primarily made up of gases.

Terrestrial planets, often referred to as rocky planets, include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets feature solid, rocky surfaces adorned with mountains, craters, and canyons. They are primarily composed of silicate rocks and metals, and they possess relatively thin atmospheres when compared to gas giants. Additionally, terrestrial planets are smaller in size and have higher densities. For instance, Earth has a dense core composed of iron and nickel, which is enveloped by a mantle and a crust.

In contrast, gas giants consist of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are considerably larger than their terrestrial counterparts and are predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium, with potential small rocky cores. Unlike terrestrial planets, gas giants lack a solid surface; their atmospheres gradually transition into deeper layers of gas and liquid. Jupiter and Saturn are commonly referred to as "true" gas giants, while Uranus and Neptune are sometimes designated as "ice giants" due to their higher concentrations of ices such as water, ammonia, and methane.

The formation processes of these two types of planets also differ significantly. Terrestrial planets formed in the hotter inner regions of the Solar System, where temperatures were too high for gases to condense. This environment allowed rocky materials to accumulate and solidify into planets. In contrast, gas giants formed in the cooler outer regions, where gases could condense and eventually accumulate around a solid core, resulting in their massive sizes and thick atmospheres.

In summary, terrestrial planets are characterized by their small size, rocky composition, and dense, solid surfaces, while gas giants are much larger, predominantly gaseous, and lack solid surfaces. Understanding these distinctions is essential for analyzing the diverse characteristics of planets within our Solar System.
