A practical example of the conservation of momentum can be observed in the collision between two ice skaters on a rink.

When two ice skaters collide, the total momentum of the system remains constant before and after the collision, assuming no external forces are acting on them. Consider two skaters gliding toward each other: Skater A has a mass of $50 \, \text{kg}$ and is moving at a velocity of $3 \, \text{m/s}$, while Skater B has a mass of $70 \, \text{kg}$ and is moving at a velocity of $-2 \, \text{m/s}$ (the negative sign indicates the opposite direction).

The momentum of each skater can be calculated by multiplying their mass by their velocity. For Skater A, the momentum is computed as follows:

$$
\text{Momentum of Skater A} = 50 \, \text{kg} \times 3 \, \text{m/s} = 150 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
$$

For Skater B, moving in the opposite direction, the momentum is given by:

$$
\text{Momentum of Skater B} = 70 \, \text{kg} \times (-2 \, \text{m/s}) = -140 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
$$

To find the total momentum before the collision, we sum the momenta of both skaters:

$$
\text{Total momentum before collision} = 150 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} + (-140 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}) = 10 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
$$

After the collision, if the skaters stick together and move as a single unit, their combined mass is:

$$
\text{Combined mass} = 50 \, \text{kg} + 70 \, \text{kg} = 120 \, \text{kg}.
$$

To determine their velocity after the collision, we apply the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision. Thus, we have:

$$
10 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} = 120 \, \text{kg} \times v,
$$

where $v$ represents the velocity after the collision. Solving for $v$, we find:

$$
v = \frac{10 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}}{120 \, \text{kg}} = 0.0833 \, \text{m/s}.
$$

This example effectively demonstrates how the principle of conservation of momentum functions in real-life scenarios. It enhances our understanding of how objects interact and move post-collision, a concept that is fundamental in physics with practical applications in fields such as vehicle safety and sports.
