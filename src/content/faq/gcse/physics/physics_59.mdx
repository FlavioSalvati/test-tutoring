Objects become negatively charged when they gain additional electrons.

In GCSE Physics, it is essential to grasp that all matter is composed of atoms. Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons carry a positive charge, electrons possess a negative charge, and neutrons are neutral. Typically, an atom maintains an equal number of protons and electrons, resulting in an overall neutral charge.

When an object acquires extra electrons, it becomes negatively charged. This change can occur through several mechanisms, including friction, conduction, or induction. For instance, when you rub a balloon against your hair, electrons are transferred from your hair to the balloon. This transfer results in the balloon having more electrons than protons, thus granting it a negative charge.

In the case of conduction, a negatively charged object can share some of its excess electrons with a neutral object when they come into contact. Consequently, the neutral object also becomes negatively charged. Induction, however, involves bringing a charged object near a neutral object without any direct contact. The influence of the charged object induces a redistribution of electrons within the neutral object, which can result in either a temporary or permanent charge.

Understanding these processes is crucial for explaining everyday phenomena, such as static electricity. For example, when you walk across a carpet and then touch a metal doorknob, you may experience a slight shock. This occurs because your body has gained extra electrons from the carpet, making you negatively charged. When you make contact with the doorknob, the electrons rapidly flow into the metal, neutralizing your charge and causing the shock.

By studying these concepts, you will gain a clearer understanding of how and why objects become negatively charged. This knowledge is fundamental to the principles of electricity and magnetism in physics.
