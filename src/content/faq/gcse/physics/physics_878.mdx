To determine the resultant force, you need to combine the individual force vectors using vector addition techniques.

Vector addition entails merging two or more force vectors to obtain a single resultant vector that has the same effect as the combined original forces. Each force vector is characterized by its magnitude (the strength of the force) and its direction (the orientation in which the force is applied).

There are two primary methods for adding vectors: the graphical method and the analytical method.

1. **Graphical Method**: This technique involves sketching the vectors to scale on a graph. Begin by drawing the first vector. From the tip of this vector, draw the second vector. Repeat this process for all subsequent vectors. The resultant vector is then drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last vector. Although this method is useful for visualizing the problem, it may lack precision.

2. **Analytical Method**: This approach requires breaking each vector into its horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) components. For instance, if you have a force vector $F$ at an angle $\theta$, the horizontal component $F_x$ can be calculated as:

$$
F_x = F \cdot \cos(\theta)
$$

and the vertical component $F_y$ can be calculated as:

$$
F_y = F \cdot \sin(\theta)
$$

After determining all the components, sum all the horizontal components to find the resultant horizontal component ($R_x$) and sum all the vertical components to find the resultant vertical component ($R_y$). The magnitude of the resultant force ($R$) can then be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem:

$$
R = \sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}
$$

The direction of the resultant force can be determined using the inverse tangent function:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{R_y}{R_x}\right)
$$

By mastering these vector addition techniques, you will be well-equipped to analyze and solve problems involving multiple forces acting on an object.
