To determine the efficiency of a transformer, you can use the following formula:

$$
\eta = \left( \frac{\text{Output Power}}{\text{Input Power}} \right) \times 100
$$

Here, the efficiency ($\eta$) quantifies how effectively the transformer converts electrical energy from the primary coil to the secondary coil. 

In this context:
- **Output Power** refers to the electrical power that is delivered to the load connected to the secondary coil.
- **Input Power** is the electrical power supplied to the primary coil.

Both power measurements are expressed in watts (W).

For instance, consider a transformer with an input power of $1000 \, \text{W}$ and an output power of $950 \, \text{W}$. The efficiency can be calculated as follows:

$$
\eta = \left( \frac{950 \, \text{W}}{1000 \, \text{W}} \right) \times 100 = 95\%
$$

This result indicates that $95\%$ of the input power is efficiently converted to output power, while the remaining $5\%$ is lost, typically in the form of heat due to resistive losses in the coils and other inefficiencies.

Transformers are generally very efficient, often achieving efficiencies between $95\%$ and $99\%$. However, there are always some losses associated with their operation. These losses can be attributed to several factors, including:
- **Copper losses**, which arise from the resistance in the winding wires.
- **Iron losses**, which occur due to hysteresis and eddy currents in the core material.
- Other minor losses that may occur in various components.

Understanding transformer efficiency is crucial for designing electrical systems that utilize power more effectively. By minimizing energy waste, we can achieve significant energy savings and improve overall system performance.
