The Earth's atmosphere significantly influences the balance of infrared radiation by absorbing and re-emitting this type of radiation, which in turn affects the planet's temperature.

The atmosphere plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's temperature through a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. When solar energy reaches the Earth, it primarily arrives as visible light and ultraviolet radiation. The Earth's surface absorbs this energy and re-emits it as infrared radiation. However, not all of this infrared radiation can escape directly into space.

Certain gases in the atmosphere, referred to as greenhouse gases, are responsible for absorbing and re-emitting infrared radiation. These gases include carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), water vapor ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and nitrous oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$). When these gases absorb infrared radiation, they re-emit it in all directions, including back toward the Earth's surface. This process effectively traps heat within the atmosphere, preventing it from escaping into space and thereby keeping the planet warmer than it would be otherwise. This mechanism is analogous to the functioning of a greenhouse, which is why it is termed the "greenhouse effect."

Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average temperature would be approximately $-18^\circ \text{C}$, instead of the current average of around $15^\circ \text{C}$. This temperature difference is crucial for sustaining the conditions necessary for life as we know it. However, human activities—such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation—have led to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This enhanced greenhouse effect results in additional heat being trapped, which contributes to global warming and climate change.

In summary, the Earth's atmosphere, through the actions of greenhouse gases, absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation, significantly influencing the planet's temperature and climate. Understanding this intricate balance is essential for addressing challenges related to global warming and promoting environmental sustainability.
