Electromagnets are designed using a core made of ferromagnetic material, typically iron, along with a coil of insulated wire.

The operation of electromagnets relies on electric current to generate a magnetic field. The core is generally composed of ferromagnetic materials such as iron, which enhances the resultant magnetic field. Iron is particularly favored due to its high magnetic permeability, allowing it to become magnetized easily and significantly amplify the magnetic field created by the electric current.

The coil of wire, often constructed from copper, is wrapped around the iron core. Copper is selected for its excellent electrical conductivity, which enables the electric current to flow with minimal resistance. The insulation on the wire is crucial as it prevents short-circuiting, ensuring that the current travels through the entire length of the coil.

When an electric current flows through the coil, it generates a magnetic field around the wire. This magnetic field subsequently magnetizes the iron core, greatly increasing the strength of the magnetic field produced. The strength of the electromagnet can be modified by varying the amount of electric current passing through the coil or by increasing the number of turns of the wire around the core.

In conclusion, the primary materials used in the construction of electromagnets are a ferromagnetic core—typically iron—and a coil of insulated copper wire. Together, these components create a powerful and adjustable magnetic field when an electric current is applied.
