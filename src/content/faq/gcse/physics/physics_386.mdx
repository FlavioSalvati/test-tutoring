To experimentally determine the specific latent heat of a substance, you need to measure both the energy change and the mass of the substance during a phase change, such as when it transitions from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas.

The specific latent heat, denoted as $L$, is calculated using the following formula:

$$ 
L = \frac{Q}{m} 
$$

In this equation, $Q$ represents the energy transferred during the phase change, and $m$ is the mass of the substance that is undergoing the change.

For instance, to find the specific latent heat of fusion (the melting process) of ice, you can set up an experiment where a known mass of ice is placed in a calorimeter filled with a known amount of water at a specific initial temperature. As the ice melts, you would measure the temperature change of the water. The energy transferred to the ice, denoted as $Q$, can be calculated using the equation:

$$ 
Q = mc\Delta T 
$$

Here, $m$ is the mass of the water, $c$ is the specific heat capacity of water, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature of the water. This calculated energy $Q$ corresponds to the energy needed to melt the ice.

Similarly, to determine the specific latent heat of vaporization (the boiling process), you would heat a known mass of liquid until it completely transforms into gas. During this process, you would measure the energy supplied by an electric heater. The energy supplied, $Q$, can be calculated using the power of the heater, $P$, and the duration of time, $t$, for which it was operational:

$$ 
Q = Pt 
$$

Knowing the mass of the liquid that has vaporized allows you to use the formula 

$$ 
L = \frac{Q}{m} 
$$ 

to find the specific latent heat of vaporization.

It is important to conduct these experiments with precision, carefully measuring and controlling all variables to ensure accurate results. Additionally, always consider potential heat losses to the surroundings, as this can significantly affect the accuracy of your measurements.
