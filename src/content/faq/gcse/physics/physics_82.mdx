The latent heat of vaporization is the amount of energy required to convert a substance from a liquid state to a gaseous state without altering its temperature.

When a liquid transitions into a gas, energy is necessary to overcome the intermolecular forces that bond the molecules together. This energy is referred to as the latent heat of vaporization. Although the temperature of the substance remains constant throughout this process, a considerable amount of energy is absorbed. For example, boiling water remains at $100^\circ C$ until it has completely transformed into steam.

Understanding the concept of latent heat is essential for grasping phase changes. When a liquid is heated, its temperature rises until it reaches the boiling point. At this stage, any additional energy supplied is used to change the state of the liquid into gas, rather than increasing its temperature. This energy is utilized to overcome the forces that hold the liquid molecules together.

Different substances possess varying latent heats of vaporization. For instance, water has a relatively high latent heat of vaporization, which makes sweating an effective method for humans to cool down. The energy needed to evaporate sweat from our skin effectively removes a significant amount of heat, aiding in the reduction of body temperature.

In GCSE Physics, comprehending the latent heat of vaporization is crucial for analyzing various phenomena, such as the reason steam burns are more severe than burns from boiling water. Steam carries more energy due to the latent heat absorbed during vaporization, which it subsequently releases when it condenses on the skin.

To calculate the energy required for a phase change, you can use the formula:

$$
Q = mL
$$

where $Q$ represents the heat energy, $m$ is the mass of the substance, and $L$ is the specific latent heat of vaporization. This formula is instrumental in quantifying the energy involved in converting a liquid to a gas, and it is vital for solving related problems in your examinations.
