The Sun generates energy through a process known as nuclear fusion, in which hydrogen nuclei are fused together to form helium, releasing immense amounts of energy in the process.

Deep within the core of the Sun, where temperatures soar to approximately $15$ million degrees Celsius, nuclear fusion takes place. This intense environment allows hydrogen nuclei, or protons, to collide with sufficient energy to overcome their inherent repulsion and merge. The primary mechanism by which fusion occurs in the Sun is referred to as the proton-proton chain reaction.

The first step of this reaction involves the fusion of two protons, resulting in the formation of a deuterium nucleus, which consists of one proton and one neutron. During this fusion, a positron and a neutrino are emitted. Subsequently, the deuterium nucleus collides with another proton to produce a helium-3 nucleus, composed of two protons and one neutron, while also emitting a gamma-ray photon. The final stage occurs when two helium-3 nuclei collide and fuse to form a helium-4 nucleus, made up of two protons and two neutrons, releasing two protons in the process.

The energy generated during these fusion reactions stems from the conversion of mass into energy, as articulated by Einsteinâ€™s renowned equation, $E=mc^2$. This equation illustrates that even a minute amount of mass can yield a significant quantity of energy. In the Sun, the mass difference between the initial reactants and the final products of the fusion process is transformed into energy, which radiates outward from the core and eventually reaches Earth in the form of sunlight.

This energy is vital for sustaining life on Earth, as it provides the heat and light necessary for photosynthesis in plants and plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate. By studying nuclear fusion in the Sun, scientists aim to develop potential future energy sources, such as fusion reactors, which could offer a nearly limitless and clean supply of energy.
