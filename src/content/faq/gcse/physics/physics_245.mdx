A permanent magnet maintains its magnetism indefinitely, whereas an induced magnet becomes magnetic solely in the presence of an external magnetic field.

Permanent magnets, such as bar magnets or refrigerator magnets, generate a persistent magnetic field. This characteristic means that they continuously produce a magnetic field without any external influence. The materials commonly used to manufacture permanent magnets—such as iron, cobalt, and nickel—contain magnetic domains, which are tiny regions that exhibit magnetism. In permanent magnets, these domains are aligned in the same direction, which confers lasting magnetic properties to the magnet. Once the alignment of these domains is achieved during the manufacturing process, they remain aligned, resulting in a magnet that is permanently magnetic.

In contrast, induced magnets only display magnetism when subjected to an external magnetic field. For instance, when a material like iron is placed in a magnetic field, its magnetic domains temporarily align with that field, causing the material to behave like a magnet. However, once the external magnetic field is removed, the domains revert to their random orientations, and the material loses its magnetism. This temporary nature of induced magnetism makes these magnets particularly useful in applications where a controllable magnetic effect is desired, such as in electromagnets.

Understanding the distinction between these two types of magnets is essential for various applications. Permanent magnets are commonly found in everyday devices like compasses, motors, and speakers due to their ability to provide a consistent magnetic force. Induced magnets, on the other hand, are frequently utilized in industrial settings where it is necessary to turn the magnetic effect on and off, such as in cranes for lifting heavy metal objects or in electric bells.

In summary, the primary difference between permanent and induced magnets lies in the duration and dependency of their magnetism: permanent magnets are always magnetic, while induced magnets exhibit magnetism only when exposed to an external magnetic field.
