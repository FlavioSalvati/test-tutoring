A series circuit consists of components connected end-to-end, creating a single pathway for current to flow.

In a series circuit, all electrical components are linked sequentially in one continuous loop. This configuration ensures that the same current flows through each component without any branching into alternative paths. If you were to trace the current's route, you would pass through each component in succession, encountering no junctions where the current could diverge.

A fundamental characteristic of a series circuit is that if one component fails or is removed, the entire circuit becomes open, stopping the flow of current. Since there is only one pathway for the current, any interruption in the circuit halts the flow of electricity completely. For instance, consider a string of fairy lights connected in series; if one bulb burns out, all the lights will extinguish.

Another significant aspect of series circuits is that the total resistance is equal to the sum of the individual resistances of each component. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots + R_n
$$

where \(R_1, R_2, R_3, \ldots, R_n\) are the resistances of the individual components. Thus, adding more resistors in series increases the overall resistance, which consequently reduces the current flowing through the circuit. The total voltage across the circuit is also distributed among the components, with each component experiencing a voltage drop proportional to its resistance.

To identify a series circuit, look for a single continuous loop without any branches. Ensure that the current has only one path to follow from the power source, through each component, and back to the power source. If you observe multiple paths or branches, then the circuit is not a series circuit; it is classified as a parallel circuit.
