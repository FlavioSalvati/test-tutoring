Direct potential difference, commonly known as voltage, is defined as the electrical energy difference measured between two points in a circuit when current flows in a single direction.

To elaborate, potential difference quantifies the difference in electrical energy between two locations within a circuit. This energy difference is what propels electric current throughout the circuit. When we refer to direct potential difference, we are specifically discussing the scenario where the current maintains a constant direction, contrasting with alternating current (AC), where the current's flow direction reverses periodically.

Typically, direct potential difference is supplied by sources such as batteries or direct current (DC) power supplies. For instance, in a simple circuit consisting of a battery and a light bulb, the battery creates a direct potential difference that drives electrons through the circuit, illuminating the bulb. The unit of measurement for potential difference is the volt, denoted as $V$, named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta.

To measure direct potential difference, a voltmeter is employed. This device is connected in parallel across the two points where the voltage is to be assessed, ensuring that it gauges the energy difference without significantly disrupting the current flow in the circuit.

Understanding direct potential difference is essential for analyzing and designing electrical circuits, as it enables you to determine the amount of energy available for moving charges through various components. This concept is foundational in GCSE Physics and serves as a stepping stone to more advanced topics in electricity and electronics.
