Torque and moment are fundamentally the same concept, both referring to the rotational effect produced by a force.

In physics, torque and moment are often used interchangeably to describe the turning effect generated by a force applied at a distance from a pivot point. This effect induces rotation around an axis. The formula for calculating both torque and moment is expressed as:

$$
\text{Torque (or Moment)} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
$$

In this equation, the "force" represents the push or pull exerted, while the "distance" refers to the perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of action of the force.

Consider the scenario where you are using a spanner to tighten a bolt. The force you apply to the spanner generates torque, which in turn causes the bolt to rotate. A longer spanner increases the distance from the pivot point (the bolt), resulting in greater torque for the same applied force. This explains why longer spanners make it easier to turn bolts.

In common language, the term "moment" is frequently used in engineering contexts, whereas "torque" is more prevalent in automotive and mechanical discussions. Despite this difference in terminology, both terms describe the same physical phenomenon. For instance, when you push a door open, you apply a force at a distance from the hinges, creating a moment (or torque) that enables the door to rotate on its hinges.

Grasping the concepts of torque and moment is essential in various real-world applications, ranging from machinery and vehicle design to understanding the mechanics of levers. By analyzing the forces and distances involved, engineers can optimize the safety and efficiency of structures and mechanisms.
