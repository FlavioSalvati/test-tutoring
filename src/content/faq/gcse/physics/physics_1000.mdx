In longitudinal waves, particles oscillate in a direction parallel to the wave's propagation.

More specifically, longitudinal waves are a type of mechanical wave in which the displacement of the medium's particles occurs in the same direction as the wave travels. A helpful analogy is to consider a slinky: when you push and pull one end, you generate compressions and rarefactions that propagate along the length of the slinky. This movement is analogous to how particles behave in a longitudinal wave.

In a longitudinal wave, particles oscillate back and forth around their equilibrium positions. When a particle moves forward, it compresses the particles in front of it, creating a region of high pressure known as a compression. Conversely, when the particle moves backward, it leaves behind a region of low pressure called a rarefaction. These alternating compressions and rarefactions travel through the medium, carrying energy from one location to another.

A common example of longitudinal waves is sound waves. When you speak, your vocal cords vibrate, causing air particles to undergo compression and rarefaction. These fluctuations in pressure propagate through the air to reach the ears of a listener, allowing them to hear your voice.

It is important to highlight that, although the wave travels through the medium, the individual particles do not move along with the wave; instead, they oscillate around their original positions. This oscillatory motion is what enables the wave to propagate through various media, including air, water, and solid materials.

Understanding how particles move in longitudinal waves is crucial for analyzing a range of phenomena in physics, from sound waves to seismic waves, and it forms a foundational aspect of wave mechanics.
