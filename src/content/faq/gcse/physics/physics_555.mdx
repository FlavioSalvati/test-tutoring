You can determine the North and South poles of a magnet using a compass or another magnet with known poles.

### Using a Compass
To identify the poles of a magnet, a simple compass is an effective tool. A compass needle is essentially a small magnet, with its North pole consistently pointing toward the Earth's geographic North. It's important to note that this geographic North actually corresponds to the Earth's magnetic South pole. When you bring a magnet near a compass, the needle will respond to the magnet's poles. If the North pole of the compass needle is attracted to one end of the magnet, that end is identified as the magnet's South pole. Conversely, if the North pole of the compass needle is repelled, then that end of the magnet is its North pole.

### Using a Known Magnet
Another method for determining the poles involves using a second magnet with known poles. When you bring the North pole of the known magnet close to one end of the unknown magnet, you can observe their interaction. If the two poles attract, the unknown end is the South pole. If they repel each other, the unknown end is the North pole. This behavior occurs because like poles repel each other, while opposite poles attract.

### Free Suspension Method
You can also suspend the magnet using a piece of string, allowing it to rotate freely. In this position, the magnet will align itself with the Earth's magnetic field. The end that points toward the geographic North is the magnet's North pole, while the end that points toward the geographic South is the magnet's South pole. This alignment occurs because the Earth's magnetic field exerts a force on the magnet, causing it to orient itself along the field lines.

These methods are straightforward and effective for identifying the poles of a magnet, making them ideal for GCSE Physics students to understand and apply.
