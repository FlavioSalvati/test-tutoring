The formula for acceleration can be expressed as:

$$ a = \frac{\Delta v}{t} $$

where $\Delta v$ represents the change in velocity and $t$ denotes the time taken for that change.

Acceleration is defined as the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. In physics, velocity is the speed of an object in a specific direction. An object is considered to be accelerating if it is either speeding up, slowing down, or altering its direction. The formula for acceleration enables us to quantify this change in motion.

To elaborate, acceleration ($a$) is calculated by determining the difference between the final velocity ($v$) and the initial velocity ($u$) of the object, and then dividing that difference by the time ($t$) over which this change occurs. This relationship can be mathematically represented as:

$$ a = \frac{v - u}{t} $$

In this equation:
- $a$ is the acceleration,
- $v$ is the final velocity,
- $u$ is the initial velocity,
- $t$ is the time duration over which the change in velocity occurs.

For instance, consider a car that accelerates from $10 \, \text{m/s}$ to $30 \, \text{m/s}$ over a period of $5 \, \text{s}$. The acceleration can be calculated as follows:

$$ a = \frac{30 \, \text{m/s} - 10 \, \text{m/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = \frac{20 \, \text{m/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 $$

This result indicates that the car's velocity increases by $4 \, \text{m/s}$ every second.

It is essential to recognize that acceleration can be either positive or negative. Positive acceleration indicates an increase in velocity, whereas negative acceleration, often referred to as deceleration, signifies a decrease in velocity. Understanding acceleration is vital for analyzing motion and predicting how objects respond to various forces, which is a fundamental concept in GCSE Physics.
