To calculate velocity from displacement, you divide the change in displacement by the time interval during which that change occurs.

In physics, velocity is defined as a vector quantity that measures the rate at which an object alters its position. To determine velocity, you need two essential pieces of information: the displacement, which is the change in position, and the time period over which this change takes place. Displacement is also a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.

The formula for calculating velocity ($v$) is given by:

$$
v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}
$$

In this equation, $\Delta s$ denotes the change in displacement, while $\Delta t$ represents the change in time.

For example, consider a car that travels $100$ metres to the east in $20$ seconds. Here, the displacement ($\Delta s$) is $100$ metres east, and the time interval ($\Delta t$) is $20$ seconds. Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$
v = \frac{100 \, \text{m}}{20 \, \text{s}} = 5 \, \text{m/s east}
$$

It is crucial to remember that velocity incorporates direction; therefore, simply stating "5 m/s" is insufficient. It is necessary to specify the direction, as done here by stating "east."

In cases where the path of displacement is not a straight line, you may need to apply vector addition to determine the resultant displacement. For example, if an object moves $3$ metres north and then $4$ metres east, you would utilize the Pythagorean theorem to find the resultant displacement, which would be $5$ metres northeast.

Understanding how to derive velocity from displacement is fundamental in various branches of physics, including the analysis of motion in mechanics and the study of wave propagation. Always remember to account for both magnitude and direction to provide a complete description of velocity.
