The unit of momentum is expressed as kilogram metres per second, abbreviated as $ \text{kg m/s} $.

Momentum quantifies the motion of an object and is determined by the product of its mass and velocity. In the International System of Units (SI), mass is measured in kilograms ($ \text{kg} $) and velocity in metres per second ($ \text{m/s} $). Consequently, when mass and velocity are multiplied, the resulting unit for momentum is $ \text{kg m/s} $.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, consider a car with a mass of $ 1000 \, \text{kg} $ that is traveling at a velocity of $ 10 \, \text{m/s} $. The momentum of the car can be calculated using the formula:

$$ 
\text{Momentum} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Velocity} 
$$

Substituting the values:

$$ 
\text{Momentum} = 1000 \, \text{kg} \times 10 \, \text{m/s} 
$$

This results in:

$$ 
\text{Momentum} = 10000 \, \text{kg m/s} 
$$

Thus, the car has a momentum of $ 10000 \, \text{kg m/s} $. This unit, $ \text{kg m/s} $, indicates the extent of motion the car possesses, taking into account both its mass and speed.

Understanding the units of momentum is essential in physics as it enables us to analyze and predict the outcomes of collisions and other interactions. For instance, in a collision, the total momentum before the event is equal to the total momentum after, assuming no external forces are acting on the system. This principle, known as the conservation of momentum, is fundamental for solving a wide range of problems in mechanics.

Therefore, whenever you encounter momentum, remember that it is measured in kilogram metres per second ($ \text{kg m/s} $), which reflects the combined effects of an object's mass and velocity, providing a comprehensive understanding of its motion.
