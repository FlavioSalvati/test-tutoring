A common example of static electricity in daily life is the shock you experience when you touch a metal doorknob.

Static electricity arises from an imbalance of electric charges within or on the surface of a material. This imbalance can accumulate through various processes, such as friction. For example, when you walk across a carpet, electrons are transferred from the carpet to your shoes, resulting in your body acquiring a negative charge. Meanwhile, the carpet, having lost some of its electrons, becomes positively charged. This separation of charges generates static electricity.

When you later touch a metal doorknob, which is an excellent conductor of electricity, the excess electrons on your body rapidly flow into the doorknob to neutralize the charge difference. This swift movement of electrons produces the small shock you feel. Essentially, the shock is a miniature electric discharge, akin to a tiny lightning bolt, albeit on a much smaller and safer scale.

Another familiar example occurs when you rub a balloon against your hair. The friction between the balloon and your hair leads to the transfer of electrons from your hair to the balloon, resulting in the balloon becoming negatively charged and your hair becoming positively charged. Consequently, your hair stands on end and is drawn toward the balloon due to the attraction between opposite charges.

Static electricity also explains why clothes sometimes cling together after coming out of the dryer. The tumbling action in the dryer creates friction between the garments, leading to a buildup of static charge. This causes the clothes to stick together, as opposite charges attract.

Understanding static electricity not only clarifies these everyday occurrences but also has practical applications in devices such as photocopiers and air purifiers, where static charges are utilized to attract and capture particles.
