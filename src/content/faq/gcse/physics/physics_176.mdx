The principle of flotation asserts that an object will remain afloat if it displaces a volume of fluid whose weight is equal to its own weight.

This principle is rooted in Archimedes' principle, which states that any object that is either wholly or partially submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force. This force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. For an object to float, the buoyant force acting on it must be equal to its weight. If the object displaces a volume of fluid that weighs more than the object itself, it will ascend to the surface and float. Conversely, if the volume of displaced fluid weighs less than the object, the object will sink.

To illustrate this concept, consider a boat floating on water. As the boat enters the water, it displaces some of the water, creating a space that would otherwise be occupied by it. The weight of the displaced water is equal to the weight of the boat. This equilibrium of forces enables the boat to float. If additional weight is added to the boat, it will sink further into the water, displacing more water until the weight of the displaced water equals the new total weight of the boat.

The density of both the object and the fluid is also a crucial factor in flotation. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. An object will float if its density is less than that of the fluid in which it is placed. For instance, a piece of wood floats on water because the density of wood is less than that of water. In contrast, a stone sinks because its density exceeds that of water.

Grasping the principle of flotation helps to explain why ships constructed from steel, which is denser than water, can still float. The design of the ship ensures that it displaces a sufficient volume of water to generate a buoyant force equal to its weight, thereby allowing it to float.
