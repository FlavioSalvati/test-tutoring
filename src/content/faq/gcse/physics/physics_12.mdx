To calculate the energy transferred by a force, we use the formula:

$$ \text{Energy} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \times \cos(\theta) $$

This energy transferred by a force is commonly known as work done. Let’s break down this formula for clarity.

In this equation:
- **Force** represents the magnitude of the force applied, measured in newtons (N).
- **Distance** is the distance over which the object moves in the direction of the applied force, measured in meters (m).
- The angle $\theta$ (theta) is the angle between the direction of the force and the direction of the object's movement. The cosine function, $\cos(\theta)$, adjusts for this angle.

For instance, consider a scenario where you push a box with a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ over a distance of $5 \, \text{m}$ in the same direction as the force, with an angle $\theta$ of $0$ degrees (where $\cos(0) = 1$). The energy transferred (or work done) can be calculated as follows:

$$ \text{Energy} = 10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} \times \cos(0) $$
$$ \text{Energy} = 10 \times 5 \times 1 $$
$$ \text{Energy} = 50 \, \text{J} $$

Thus, $50 \, \text{J}$ of energy is transferred to the box.

Now, if the force is applied at an angle, such as $30$ degrees, we would use the cosine of $30$ degrees, which is approximately $0.866$. The calculation for energy transferred becomes:

$$ \text{Energy} = 10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} \times \cos(30) $$
$$ \text{Energy} = 10 \times 5 \times 0.866 $$
$$ \text{Energy} \approx 43.3 \, \text{J} $$

In this case, only about $43.3 \, \text{J}$ of energy is transferred when the force is applied at an angle. This illustrates that less energy is transferred when the force is not applied directly in the direction of movement.

Understanding this concept is essential in physics, as it clarifies how forces contribute to the motion of objects and the amount of energy involved in these interactions.
