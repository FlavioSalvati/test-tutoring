A star transitions into a red giant once it has depleted the hydrogen fuel in its core and begins the process of fusing helium into heavier elements.

When a star, such as our Sun, exhausts the hydrogen in its core, it can no longer sustain the nuclear fusion reactions that have maintained its stability throughout most of its lifetime. The absence of the outward pressure generated by these reactions allows the core to contract under the influence of gravity. As the core contracts, its temperature rises, which in turn causes the outer layers of the star to expand and cool. This expansion and cooling give the star a larger and redder appearance, marking the onset of the red giant phase.

In more detail, the contraction of the core raises its temperature until it reaches the levels necessary to initiate the fusion of helium into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. This process is referred to as helium burning. Concurrently, the outer layers of the star, which still contain a significant amount of hydrogen, undergo substantial expansion. As a result, the star's surface temperature decreases, imparting a reddish hue to its appearance, which is why it is called a "red giant."

During the red giant phase, the outer layers of the star become loosely bound and can be expelled into space through stellar winds. This mass loss can lead to the formation of stunning nebulae, such as the well-known Ring Nebula. The red giant phase is relatively brief in a star's life cycle, typically lasting only a few hundred million years, in stark contrast to the billions of years spent in the main sequence phase.

Ultimately, the core will deplete its helium reserves, leading to further evolutionary changes that depend on the star's mass. For stars akin to the Sun, this process results in the shedding of the outer layers and the creation of a white dwarf. On the other hand, more massive stars may undergo a supernova explosion, leaving behind either a neutron star or a black hole.
