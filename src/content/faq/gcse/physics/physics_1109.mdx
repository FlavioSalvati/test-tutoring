Auroras are spectacular natural light displays that occur when charged particles from the Sun interact with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. Commonly referred to as the Northern and Southern Lights, these phenomena are predominantly visible near the polar regions and are intricately linked to the dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field.

The Sun continuously emits a stream of charged particles, collectively known as the solar wind. This stream travels through space and occasionally reaches Earth. Upon encountering the Earth's magnetic field, these charged particles are directed towards the polar regions along the magnetic field lines.

The Earth's magnetic field serves as a protective shield, safeguarding us from the majority of the solar wind. However, at the poles, the magnetic field lines converge, resulting in a weaker magnetic field that allows some of these charged particles to penetrate the Earth's atmosphere. When these particles collide with atmospheric gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen, they transfer energy to these molecules. This energy is subsequently released as light, illuminating the sky with the stunning colors characteristic of auroras.

The specific colors of the auroras are influenced by the type of gas involved and the altitude at which the collisions occur. For instance, oxygen at higher altitudes, around $300 \, \text{km}$, can produce red auroras, while at lower altitudes, approximately $100 \, \text{km}$, it can create green auroras. In contrast, nitrogen can generate blue or purplish-red auroras.

In addition to directing charged particles towards the poles, the Earth's magnetic field also shapes and influences the movement of the auroras. These lights often manifest as curtains, arcs, or spirals that dance across the sky, a phenomenon resulting from the complex interactions between the solar wind and the magnetic field. By studying these interactions, scientists can gain deeper insights into both the behavior of the solar wind and the characteristics of the Earth's magnetic field.
