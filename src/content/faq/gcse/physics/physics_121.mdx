Nuclear fission is a process that releases energy by splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei. 

To elaborate, nuclear fission occurs when a heavy nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, absorbs a neutron. This absorption renders the nucleus unstable, resulting in its division into two smaller nuclei, referred to as fission fragments. Alongside these smaller nuclei, several additional neutrons and a substantial amount of energy are emitted. This energy originates from the strong nuclear forces that bind the nucleus together. When the nucleus undergoes fission, a portion of this binding energy is transformed into the kinetic energy of the fission fragments and the emitted neutrons, as well as in the form of electromagnetic radiation known as gamma rays.

The neutrons that are released can collide with other heavy nuclei, inducing them to undergo fission as well. This phenomenon can lead to a chain reaction, which is the fundamental principle behind both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. In a nuclear reactor, this chain reaction is meticulously controlled to ensure a steady release of energy, which is then harnessed for electricity generation. Conversely, in a nuclear weapon, the chain reaction is uncontrolled, resulting in a rapid and immense release of energy.

The energy produced during nuclear fission is vastly greater than that released from chemical reactions. For instance, the fission of a single uranium-235 nucleus releases approximately $200$ million electron volts (MeV) of energy, whereas the combustion of a single molecule of methane yields only a few electron volts. This remarkable energy density is what makes nuclear power an exceptionally powerful source of energy.

Understanding nuclear fission requires knowledge of concepts from both physics and chemistry, including atomic structure, the forces that operate within the nucleus, and neutron behavior. It is a captivating process with significant implications for energy production and safety, presenting both powerful applications and challenges.
