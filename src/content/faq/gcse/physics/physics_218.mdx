Refraction is the phenomenon that occurs when a wave changes direction as it passes from one medium into another.

When a wave, such as light or sound, transitions between different media—such as from air into water—its speed is altered. This variation in speed results in the wave bending, a process referred to as refraction. The extent to which the wave bends is influenced by the angle at which it enters the new medium as well as the difference in wave speeds between the two media.

Consider a light wave striking the surface of a glass of water at an angle. As the wave enters the water, it slows down because light propagates more slowly in water than in air. This reduction in speed causes the light wave to bend towards the normal line, which is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface. Conversely, when the light wave exits the water and re-enters the air, it accelerates and bends away from the normal line.

The degree of bending can be quantitatively described using Snell's Law. This law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence (the angle formed between the incoming wave and the normal) to the sine of the angle of refraction (the angle formed between the refracted wave and the normal) remains constant. This constant is equal to the ratio of the speeds of the wave in the two different media. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$ 
\frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\sin(\theta_2)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} 
$$

In this equation, $ \theta_1 $ represents the angle of incidence, $ \theta_2 $ denotes the angle of refraction, $ v_1 $ is the speed of the wave in the first medium, and $ v_2 $ is the speed of the wave in the second medium.

A thorough understanding of refraction is essential for numerous applications, including the design of lenses for eyeglasses and cameras, as well as for explaining natural phenomena such as rainbows. By analyzing how waves alter their direction when moving between different media, we gain valuable insights into the behavior of waves in various contexts and can apply this knowledge to practical situations.
