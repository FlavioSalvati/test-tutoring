Fleming's Left-Hand Rule is a mnemonic that assists in determining the direction of force acting on a current-carrying conductor within a magnetic field. 

According to this rule, if you position your left hand so that your thumb, index finger, and middle finger are all perpendicular to one another, each finger represents a different vector. Specifically, the thumb indicates the direction of the force (or motion), the index finger points in the direction of the magnetic field, and the middle finger shows the direction of the current.

The angles formed between these vectors are crucial for correct interpretation. The perpendicular arrangement, which forms right angles of $90^\circ$ between the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, is vital for accurately determining the direction of the force. If these angles were not at $90^\circ$, the relationships among the force, magnetic field, and current could be misrepresented, potentially leading to incorrect predictions.

In practical applications, such as in electric motors and generators, understanding these angles is essential for designing devices that efficiently convert electrical energy into mechanical energy and vice versa. For example, in an electric motor, current flows through a coil situated in a magnetic field, and the resulting force causes the motor to rotate. By applying Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, engineers can predict the direction of this force and design the motor accordingly.

In summary, the angles defined by Fleming's Left-Hand Rule are significant because they ensure proper interpretation of the directions of force, current, and magnetic field. This understanding is crucial for the effective operation of many electrical devices.
