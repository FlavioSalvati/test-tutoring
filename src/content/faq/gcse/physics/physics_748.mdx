The particle model of matter posits that all matter is composed of tiny particles that are in constant motion.

In this model, the particles can be classified as atoms, molecules, or ions, depending on the type of matter being considered. This framework enables us to understand and describe the properties and behaviors of solids, liquids, and gases. 

In solids, the particles are tightly packed in a fixed arrangement and can only vibrate in place. This characteristic explains why solids maintain a definite shape and volume.

In liquids, the particles remain close together but have the ability to move past one another. This movement allows liquids to flow and conform to the shape of their containers while still maintaining a constant volume. The particles in a liquid possess more energy than those in a solid, which accounts for their increased mobility.

In gases, the particles are widely spaced and move rapidly in all directions. This energetic movement enables gases to expand and fill any available space, as well as to be easily compressed. The energy of the particles in a gas is significantly higher than that of particles in solids and liquids, which explains their swift motion and the considerable distances between them.

The particle model also elucidates changes in state, such as melting, boiling, and freezing. When a substance is heated, its particles absorb energy and begin to move more vigorously. For instance, when a solid is heated, its particles may vibrate intensely enough to break free from their fixed positions, resulting in the transformation of the solid into a liquid (a process known as melting). Likewise, when a liquid is heated, its particles can gain enough energy to escape into the air as a gas (a process known as boiling).

Grasping the particle model of matter is essential for explaining various physical phenomena and is a foundational concept in GCSE Physics.
