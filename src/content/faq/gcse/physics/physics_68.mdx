Density varies among solids, liquids, and gases due to the differences in the arrangement and spacing of their particles.

In solids, particles are tightly packed together in a fixed and orderly arrangement. This close packing results in solids typically having the highest density among the three states of matter. The particles vibrate in place but do not move freely, which helps maintain the shape and volume of the solid. For instance, metals such as iron and gold exhibit high density because their atoms are closely packed in a regular pattern.

In contrast, liquids consist of particles that are still relatively close together but not in a fixed position. These particles can move around and slide past one another, enabling liquids to flow and adapt to the shape of their container. Since the particles in liquids are not as tightly packed as those in solids, liquids generally have a lower density. A common example is water, which has a density of approximately $1 \, \text{g/cm}^3$.

Gases, on the other hand, have particles that are significantly farther apart compared to solids and liquids. The particles in a gas move freely and rapidly in all directions, filling the entire volume of their container. This substantial spacing between particles results in gases having the lowest density of the three states of matter. For example, the density of air at room temperature is approximately $0.0012 \, \text{g/cm}^3$, which is considerably less than that of solids and liquids.

Understanding these variations in density is crucial for explaining why certain materials float or sink when placed in a liquid, as well as why gases are commonly used to fill balloons and tires. The arrangement and movement of particles in each state of matter play a fundamental role in determining their density.
