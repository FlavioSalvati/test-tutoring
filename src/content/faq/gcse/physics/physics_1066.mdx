Black body radiation is essential for understanding how objects emit and absorb thermal radiation.

The term "black body radiation" describes an idealized object known as a black body, which absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of its frequency or angle of incidence. This idealized object also emits radiation in a specific spectrum that depends solely on its temperature. The study of black body radiation has played a fundamental role in the development of quantum mechanics and our understanding of thermal radiation.

A key feature of black body radiation is its emission spectrum, which illustrates the amount of radiation emitted at various wavelengths. As the temperature of a black body increases, it emits a greater amount of radiation overall, and the peak of its emission spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths. Consequently, when a metal is heated, it first glows red, then yellow, and ultimately white as its temperature rises.

The importance of black body radiation became particularly apparent in the late 19th century, when classical physics failed to account for the observed spectrum of black body radiation. This discrepancy led to the phenomenon known as the ultraviolet catastrophe, which occurred when classical theories predicted infinite energy emission at short wavelengths. The resolution to this issue was provided by Max Planck's introduction of quantized energy levels, which marked the inception of quantum theory. Planck proposed that energy is emitted in discrete packets, known as quanta, which successfully explained the black body spectrum and resolved the ultraviolet catastrophe.

In addition to its theoretical significance, understanding black body radiation has practical applications. For example, it is instrumental in designing thermal cameras and analyzing the radiation emitted by stars, including our Sun. This concept is also vital in climate science, where it helps model how the Earth absorbs and emits radiation, which is crucial for studying global warming and the greenhouse effect.
