The unit of electrical charge is known as the coulomb (C).

In the field of physics, electrical charge is a fundamental property of matter that enables it to experience a force when situated within an electromagnetic field. The coulomb serves as the standard unit for measuring this charge. Specifically, one coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge transferred by a current of one ampere over the duration of one second. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
Q = I \times t
$$

where $Q$ represents the charge in coulombs, $I$ is the current in amperes, and $t$ is the time in seconds.

To provide a sense of scale, the charge of a single electron is approximately $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs. Consequently, one coulomb of charge is equivalent to the charge of about $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

Grasping the concept of the coulomb is essential for analyzing electrical circuits and various electrical phenomena. For instance, the capacity of a battery is often measured in ampere-hours (Ah), which can be converted into coulombs. A battery rated at $1 \text{ Ah}$ can deliver a current of one ampere for one hour, which corresponds to:

$$
3600 \text{ coulombs} \quad (\text{since } 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds})
$$

In practical scenarios, understanding the amount of charge is crucial for determining how long a battery will last, the energy stored in a capacitor, or the total charge transferred during a lightning strike. The concept of electric charge and its unit, the coulomb, forms the foundation for understanding and working with electrical systems.
