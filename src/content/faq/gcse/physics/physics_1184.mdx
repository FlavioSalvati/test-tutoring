Hubble's Law articulates that the speed at which a galaxy recedes from us is directly proportional to its distance from our vantage point.

This fundamental concept in cosmology is named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who made this discovery in 1929. According to Hubble's Law, galaxies move away from us at velocities that increase with their distance. This relationship is mathematically represented by the formula:

$$
v = H_0 \times d
$$

In this equation, $ v $ denotes the velocity at which a galaxy is receding, $ H_0 $ represents the Hubble constant, and $ d $ indicates the distance to the galaxy.

The Hubble constant ($ H_0 $) is a pivotal parameter in cosmology, signifying the rate of the universe's expansion. It is typically measured in kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc), where one megaparsec corresponds to approximately 3.26 million light-years. Although the precise value of the Hubble constant remains a subject of ongoing research and debate, it is generally estimated to be around $70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}$.

Hubble's groundbreaking discovery provided compelling evidence for the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe originated from an extremely hot and dense state and has been expanding ever since. Prior to Hubble's observations, many scientists held the view that the universe was static and unchanging. His findings demonstrated that the universe is dynamic and continually evolving.

To determine the speed at which galaxies are receding, astronomers analyze the redshift of light. As a galaxy moves away from us, the light it emits shifts towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon, known as redshift, enables scientists to calculate the velocity of a galaxy's recession. By measuring the redshift in conjunction with the distances to various galaxies, Hubble established the proportional relationship that underpins his law.

Understanding Hubble's Law enhances our comprehension of the universe's vastness and its ongoing expansion, offering insights into both the history and future of cosmic evolution.
