To effectively balance a nuclear equation, it is essential to ensure that the sums of atomic numbers and mass numbers are equal on both sides of the equation.

Balancing a nuclear equation requires confirming that the total number of protons, represented by the atomic numbers, and the total number of nucleons, represented by the mass numbers, are identical before and after the reaction. This process is akin to balancing chemical equations, but instead of whole atoms, we focus on subatomic particles.

First, identify the reactants and products involved in the nuclear reaction. For instance, consider the alpha decay of Uranium-238, which can be expressed as:

$$
_{92}^{238}\text{U} \rightarrow _{2}^{4}\text{He} + _{90}^{234}\text{Th}
$$

In this equation, Uranium-238 decays into Thorium-234 and an alpha particle (which is a Helium-4 nucleus). To verify the balance of this equation, check the atomic and mass numbers:

- The atomic number of Uranium ($92$) is equal to the sum of the atomic numbers of Thorium ($90$) and Helium ($2$).
- The mass number of Uranium ($238$) matches the sum of the mass numbers of Thorium ($234$) and Helium ($4$).

Next, consider a scenario involving beta decay, where a neutron transforms into a proton, emitting an electron (the beta particle). In this case, the atomic number increases by one, while the mass number remains unchanged. An example is:

$$
_{6}^{14}\text{C} \rightarrow _{7}^{14}\text{N} + _{-1}^{0}\text{e}
$$

Here, Carbon-14 decays into Nitrogen-14 and a beta particle. The atomic number of Carbon ($6$) increases to that of Nitrogen ($7$), while the mass number remains at $14$.

By ensuring that the sums of atomic and mass numbers are equal on both sides of the equation, you can successfully balance any nuclear reaction. This principle is crucial for understanding the conservation of mass and charge in nuclear processes.
