In an explosion, while the total momentum of the system remains constant, the individual momenta of the resulting fragments change significantly.

In physics, momentum quantifies the motion of an object and is calculated as the product of its mass and velocity. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of a closed system—one that is not influenced by external forces—remains constant. This principle is essential for analyzing explosions.

When an explosion occurs, a single object disintegrates into multiple fragments. Prior to the explosion, the object possesses a certain momentum, determined by multiplying its mass by its velocity. If the object is initially at rest, its total momentum is $0$. Following the explosion, the mass of the object is redistributed among the fragments, which then move in various directions at different speeds.

Despite the dramatic alterations in the individual momenta of the fragments, the total momentum of the system—the sum of the momenta of all fragments—remains unchanged from its value before the explosion. This constancy arises because the forces involved in the explosion are internal to the system. For instance, consider a firework that explodes in the sky: the momentum of all the pieces flying off in various directions will collectively equal the momentum the firework had just prior to the explosion.

To illustrate this concept, let’s envision a firework at rest before its explosion. Its total momentum is $0$. After the explosion, if one fragment moves to the right with a certain momentum, another fragment must move to the left with an equal and opposite momentum to ensure that the total momentum remains $0$. This necessary balance ensures the law of conservation of momentum is maintained.

Understanding this principle clarifies why, in the absence of external forces, the overall motion of a system remains predictable—even during a violent event like an explosion.
