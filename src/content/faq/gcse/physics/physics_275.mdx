Redshift provides compelling evidence for the expanding universe by demonstrating that distant galaxies are moving away from us.

When we observe the light emitted by distant galaxies, we find that it is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon is referred to as redshift. According to the Doppler effect, when an object that emits light moves away from an observer, the light waves are stretched, resulting in an increased wavelength and a shift towards the red part of the spectrum. This redshift serves as an indicator that these galaxies are indeed receding from our position.

The relationship between distance and redshift is significant: the farther a galaxy is from us, the greater its redshift. This correlation was first identified by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s and is now known as Hubble's Law. Hubble discovered that more distant galaxies appear to be moving away from us at faster speeds. This observation suggests that the universe is expanding uniformly, with galaxies moving apart from one another in all directions.

Redshift is a crucial piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe originated from an extremely hot and dense state and has been expanding ever since. By analyzing the redshifts of galaxies, scientists can estimate the rate of expansion of the universe, known as the Hubble constant. This estimation is vital for understanding the age and size of the universe.

In summary, redshift is a fundamental piece of evidence for the expanding universe, as it indicates that distant galaxies are receding from us, thereby supporting the notion that the universe is continuously growing larger over time.
