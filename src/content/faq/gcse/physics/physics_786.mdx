Increasing the number of gas particles within a container leads to an increase in pressure, provided that both the volume and temperature remain constant.

When additional gas particles are introduced into a container, the total number of molecules increases, resulting in more frequent collisions with the walls of the container. The pressure exerted by a gas arises from these collisions; specifically, each time a gas particle strikes the wall, it applies a small force. As the number of particles increases, the frequency of collisions also rises, thereby resulting in a greater cumulative force on the walls. Consequently, this leads to an increase in pressure.

Consider a balloon: when you blow air into it, you are effectively adding more gas particles. This addition causes the balloon to expand, as the pressure inside rises. If the balloon were rigid and unable to expand, the pressure would increase even more dramatically due to the confined space.

This relationship between the number of gas particles and pressure is quantitatively described by the ideal gas law, expressed as:

$$
PV = nRT
$$

In this equation, $ P $ represents pressure, $ V $ denotes volume, $ n $ indicates the number of moles of gas, $ R $ is the universal gas constant, and $ T $ signifies temperature. When both volume $ V $ and temperature $ T $ are held constant, an increase in $ n $ (the number of gas particles) will result in a corresponding increase in $ P $ (pressure).

In summary, adding more gas particles to a fixed volume at a constant temperature increases the pressure due to the heightened frequency of collisions between gas particles and the container walls. This principle is fundamental to understanding gas behavior and is crucial for a variety of applications, from inflating tires to comprehending the mechanics of our lungs.
