Scientists predict the future expansion of the universe by analyzing redshift data from distant galaxies.

Redshift occurs when the light emitted from distant galaxies is stretched, resulting in a shift towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon is a consequence of the universe's expansion, which causes galaxies to move away from us. The greater the velocity at which a galaxy is receding, the more pronounced the redshift of its light. By measuring this redshift, scientists can ascertain the speed at which each galaxy is moving away.

To forecast the future expansion of the universe, researchers utilize redshift data to calculate the rate of expansion, referred to as the Hubble constant, denoted as $H_0$. The Hubble constant provides insight into how quickly the universe is expanding at various distances. By examining numerous galaxies at different distances, scientists can construct a comprehensive picture of the universe's expansion history.

With this information, scientists develop mathematical models to simulate the future behavior of the universe. These models consider the current rate of expansion, the total amount of matter and energy present, as well as the influence of dark energy, which is believed to drive the accelerated expansion of the universe. Running these simulations enables scientists to make informed predictions about how the universe will continue to expand over billions of years.

In summary, by measuring the redshift of light from distant galaxies, scientists can determine the rate of the universe's expansion. This data, when combined with mathematical models, allows for predictions regarding the future expansion of the universe.
