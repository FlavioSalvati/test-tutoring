To calculate the extension of a spring, we can apply Hooke's Law, which states that the extension of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied, as long as the spring is not stretched beyond its elastic limit. The formula for Hooke's Law is expressed as:

$$ 
F = k \cdot e 
$$

where:
- $F$ represents the force applied to the spring (measured in newtons, N),
- $k$ is the spring constant (a measure of the spring's stiffness, measured in newtons per meter, N/m), and
- $e$ is the extension (or change in length) of the spring from its original length (measured in meters, m).

To determine the extension of the spring, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $e$:

$$ 
e = \frac{F}{k} 
$$

For instance, if a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ is applied to a spring with a spring constant of $200 \, \text{N/m}$, we can calculate the extension as follows:

$$ 
e = \frac{10 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{N/m}} = 0.05 \, \text{m} 
$$

This result indicates that the spring will extend by $0.05$ meters, which is equivalent to $5$ centimeters.

It is crucial to understand that Hooke's Law is valid only within the elastic limit of the spring. Should the applied force exceed this limit, the spring may undergo permanent deformation, resulting in a condition known as plastic deformation, where it does not return to its original shape. In the context of GCSE Physics, grasping the principles of Hooke's Law is essential for analyzing the behavior of materials and their mechanical properties.
