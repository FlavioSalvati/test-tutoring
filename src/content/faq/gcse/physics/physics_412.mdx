The contemporary understanding of the atom is encapsulated in the quantum mechanical model, which characterizes electrons in terms of probabilities rather than fixed trajectories.

In this quantum mechanical framework, atoms are composed of a compact nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons. Unlike previous models that depicted electrons as orbiting the nucleus in predetermined paths, the quantum mechanical model utilizes intricate mathematical equations to convey the likelihood of locating an electron within specific regions around the nucleus. These regions are referred to as orbitals, which exhibit various shapes and sizes.

The nucleus, situated at the center of the atom, comprises positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. The number of protons in the nucleus defines the identity of the element and is termed the atomic number, denoted as $Z$. Neutrons contribute to the overall mass of the atom but do not influence its charge. Collectively, protons and neutrons are known as nucleons, and their total count is referred to as the mass number, represented as $A$.

Electrons, which possess a negative charge, inhabit the orbitals surrounding the nucleus. These orbitals are not rigid paths; instead, they are regions where there is a high probability of finding an electron. The precise location of an electron cannot be pinpointed; rather, we can only estimate where it is likely to be found. This principle is articulated through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

Furthermore, the quantum mechanical model introduces the concept of energy levels, or shells. Electrons occupy these energy levels, with each level having the capacity to hold a specific number of electrons. Electrons preferentially fill the lower energy levels before transitioning to higher ones. This systematic arrangement of electrons across various energy levels is fundamental to understanding the chemical behavior of elements.

In summary, the quantum mechanical model offers a more precise and comprehensive perspective on atomic structure, elucidating phenomena that earlier models failed to explain.
