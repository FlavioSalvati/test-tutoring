The units of impulse are expressed as Newton-seconds ($\text{Ns}$) or kilogram-metres per second ($\text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}$).

Impulse is a fundamental concept in physics that quantifies the change in momentum of an object when a force is applied over a specific time interval. The relationship can be represented by the formula:

$$ 
\text{Impulse} = \text{Force} \times \text{Time} 
$$

Here, force is measured in Newtons ($\text{N}$) and time in seconds ($\text{s}$), which leads to the unit of impulse being Newton-seconds ($\text{Ns}$).

Alternatively, impulse can also be defined in terms of momentum. Momentum is the product of an object’s mass and its velocity, and it is measured in kilogram-metres per second ($\text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}$). Since impulse is essentially the change in momentum, it can also be expressed in these units.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, let’s consider a practical example: Imagine you are playing cricket and hit a ball with a bat. The force exerted on the ball during the brief contact changes its momentum. This change in momentum is what we refer to as impulse. If you know the force applied and the duration of contact, you can calculate the impulse in Newton-seconds. Conversely, if you know the mass of the ball and the change in its velocity, you can determine the impulse in kilogram-metres per second.

In conclusion, impulse can be measured in either Newton-seconds ($\text{Ns}$) or kilogram-metres per second ($\text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}$), and both units represent the same physical quantity.
