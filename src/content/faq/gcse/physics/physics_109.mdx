Common units for measuring radiation include becquerels, grays, sieverts, and rads.

Radiation refers to energy emitted from a source, and it can be quantified in different ways depending on the specific aspect of radiation being analyzed. The becquerel (Bq) is the unit that measures the activity of a radioactive source, specifically indicating the number of decays occurring per second. For instance, if a radioactive sample has an activity of $1 \, \text{Bq}$, it signifies that one atom within the sample decays every second.

The gray (Gy) is the unit used to quantify the absorbed dose of radiation, which is the amount of radiation energy absorbed per kilogram of matter. One gray is defined as the absorption of one joule of radiation energy by one kilogram of material. This unit is particularly significant in medical applications, such as radiotherapy, where precise doses of radiation are employed in the treatment of cancer.

The sievert (Sv) is another important unit, measuring the biological effect of radiation. It not only considers the absorbed dose (expressed in grays) but also accounts for the type of radiation and its varying impacts on different tissues. For example, $1 \, \text{Sv}$ of alpha radiation exerts a different biological effect than $1 \, \text{Sv}$ of gamma radiation. This unit is essential for evaluating the potential health risks associated with radiation exposure in humans.

Lastly, the rad is an older unit of absorbed dose, where $1 \, \text{rad}$ is equivalent to $0.01 \, \text{Gy}$. Although the rad is less commonly used today, it may still be encountered in certain contexts, particularly in older literature or in the United States.

Understanding these units is crucial for analyzing and managing the effects of radiation across various fields, including medical treatments, nuclear energy, and environmental safety.
