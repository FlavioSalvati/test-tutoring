Elastic potential energy refers to the energy stored within an object when it is either stretched or compressed.

When you stretch or compress an elastic object—such as a spring or a rubber band—you perform work on it. This work is stored as elastic potential energy. The amount of energy stored depends on both the extent of the stretch or compression and the properties of the material itself. For instance, a stiffer spring will store more energy than a softer one when both are stretched by the same amount.

The formula for calculating elastic potential energy (EPE) in a spring is given by 

$$ 
EPE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 
$$ 

where $ k $ is the spring constant (a measure of the spring's stiffness) and $ x $ represents the displacement from its equilibrium position (the degree to which it is stretched or compressed). This equation illustrates that the energy stored is proportional to the square of the displacement. Consequently, if you double the amount of stretch, the energy stored increases by a factor of four.

Elastic potential energy is a specific type of mechanical energy, akin to gravitational potential energy, but it specifically pertains to the deformation of materials. This stored energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy. For example, when you release a stretched rubber band, the elastic potential energy that was stored is transformed into kinetic energy, causing the rubber band to snap back to its original shape and potentially fly across the room.

Understanding elastic potential energy is crucial in numerous real-world applications. Engineers apply this concept in the design of various systems, including car suspension systems, trampolines, and even the soles of running shoes. By analyzing how materials store and release energy, they can create products that are both efficient and safe.
