The law of reflection asserts that the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection.

When a wave, such as light, strikes a reflective surface, it behaves in a predictable manner by bouncing off. The angle at which the incoming wave, referred to as the incident wave, interacts with the surface is known as the angle of incidence. This angle is measured between the incident wave and an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the surface, known as the normal. Conversely, the angle at which the wave reflects off the surface is called the angle of reflection, and it is measured between the reflected wave and the normal.

According to the law of reflection, these two angles are always equal, expressed mathematically as:

$$
\theta_i = \theta_r
$$

where $\theta_i$ represents the angle of incidence and $\theta_r$ represents the angle of reflection. This principle is applicable to all types of waves, including light, sound, and water waves. For instance, if a light ray strikes a mirror at an angle of $30^\circ$ to the normal, it will reflect off the mirror at the same angle of $30^\circ$ on the opposite side of the normal.

This law is essential for understanding the operation of mirrors, the behavior of light, and the design of various optical instruments such as periscopes and telescopes. Additionally, it explains phenomena like image formation in plane mirrors, where the image appears to be located the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it.

In practical applications, the law of reflection plays a vital role in numerous everyday scenarios. For example, in road safety, reflective signs and road markings utilize this principle to ensure that light from car headlights is directed back towards the driver, enhancing visibility at night. A solid grasp of this law is fundamental for anyone studying physics, as it lays the groundwork for more advanced concepts in optics and wave behavior.
