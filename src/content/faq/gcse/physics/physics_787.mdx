To determine the pressure of a gas, you can utilize the ideal gas equation, which is expressed as:

$$ P = \frac{nRT}{V} $$

The ideal gas equation is a fundamental concept in both physics and chemistry that links the pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), temperature ($T$), and the amount of gas ($n$) measured in moles. It can be rewritten in the form:

$$ PV = nRT $$

where $R$ represents the ideal gas constant. To isolate the pressure, you rearrange the equation, resulting in:

$$ P = \frac{nRT}{V} $$

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to effectively use the ideal gas equation:

1. **Identify the Variables**:
   - **$P$**: This is the pressure of the gas, which we aim to calculate.
   - **$V$**: This represents the volume of the gas.
   - **$n$**: This denotes the number of moles of the gas.
   - **$R$**: The ideal gas constant, which is approximately $8.31 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}$ when using SI units.
   - **$T$**: This is the temperature of the gas, measured in Kelvin (K).

2. **Convert Units if Necessary**:
   Ensure that the volume is expressed in cubic meters ($\text{m}^3$), the temperature is in Kelvin (K), and the amount of gas is in moles (mol). If the temperature is provided in degrees Celsius, convert it to Kelvin by adding $273.15$.

3. **Substitute the Values into the Equation**:
   Insert the values for $n$, $R$, $T$, and $V$ into the equation:

   $$ P = \frac{nRT}{V} $$

For instance, if you have $2$ moles of gas at a temperature of $300$ K contained within a volume of $0.05 \, \text{m}^3$, you can calculate the pressure as follows:

$$ P = \frac{2 \, \text{mol} \times 8.31 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \times 300 \, \text{K}}{0.05 \, \text{m}^3} $$

Breaking this down further:

$$ P = \frac{4986 \, \text{J}}{0.05 \, \text{m}^3} $$

This results in:

$$ P = 99720 \, \text{Pa} $$

Thus, the pressure of the gas is calculated to be $99720$ Pascals (Pa). This method provides a straightforward approach to determining gas pressure using the ideal gas equation.
