Scientists utilize red-shift to determine the velocity of galaxies by measuring how much the light emitted by these galaxies is stretched towards the red end of the spectrum.

When a galaxy moves away from us, the light it emits undergoes stretching, resulting in longer wavelengths. This phenomenon is referred to as red-shift. The extent of the red-shift is directly related to the speed at which the galaxy is receding; a greater red-shift indicates a higher velocity. This effect is analogous to the Doppler effect, where the pitch of a sound changes depending on whether the source is moving towards or away from an observer.

To measure red-shift, scientists examine the light from a galaxy and analyze its spectrum. A spectrum serves as a unique "fingerprint" of light, indicating the various wavelengths present. By comparing the observed spectrum with the known spectrum of elements such as hydrogen or helium, scientists can determine how much the spectral lines have shifted towards the red. This shift is quantified using a value known as the red-shift parameter, represented as $ z $.

The red-shift parameter $ z $ is calculated with the following formula:

$$
z = \frac{\lambda_{observed} - \lambda_{rest}}{\lambda_{rest}}
$$

In this equation, $ \lambda_{observed} $ represents the wavelength of light that we observe from the galaxy, while $ \lambda_{rest} $ denotes the wavelength of light emitted by the galaxy if it were stationary. Once the value of $ z $ is determined, the galaxy's speed can be calculated using Hubble's Law, which states that the velocity $ v $ of a galaxy is proportional to its red-shift $ z $ and the Hubble constant $ H_0 $:

$$
v = H_0 \times z
$$

Hubble's Law illustrates the expansion of the universe, indicating that galaxies are moving away from one another. By measuring red-shift, scientists can map both the speed and direction of galaxies, thereby enhancing our understanding of the universe's dynamics.
