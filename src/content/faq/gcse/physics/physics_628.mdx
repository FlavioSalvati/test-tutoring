To experimentally determine the specific heat capacity of a substance, you will need to heat the substance while carefully recording both the temperature change and the amount of energy supplied.

The process begins with the use of a calorimeter, an insulated container designed to minimize heat loss to the environment. Start by placing a known mass of the substance inside the calorimeter. For instance, if you are measuring the specific heat capacity of water, you might use a mass of $100$ grams.

Next, employ an electric heater to deliver a precisely measured amount of energy to the substance. The energy supplied can be calculated using the formula:

$$
E = P \times t
$$

In this equation, $E$ represents the energy in joules, $P$ denotes the power of the heater in watts, and $t$ is the duration in seconds for which the heater operates. It is important to stir the substance gently throughout the heating process to ensure uniform temperature distribution.

While the substance is being heated, utilize a thermometer to record both the initial and final temperatures. The temperature change, denoted as $\Delta T$, is calculated as the difference between these two temperature readings.

Once you have measured the energy supplied and the temperature change, you can calculate the specific heat capacity, $c$, using the formula:

$$
c = \frac{E}{m \times \Delta T}
$$

Here, $m$ is the mass of the substance in kilograms, $E$ is the energy supplied in joules, and $\Delta T$ is the temperature change in degrees Celsius.

For example, if you supply $5000$ joules of energy to $0.1$ kg of water and observe a temperature increase of $12.5^\circ C$, the specific heat capacity can be calculated as follows:

$$
c = \frac{5000}{0.1 \times 12.5} = 4000 \text{ J/kg}^\circ C.
$$

This method provides a reliable means to experimentally determine the specific heat capacity of various substances.
