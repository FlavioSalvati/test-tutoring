Radioactive decay is the phenomenon by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy through the emission of radiation.

To elaborate, radioactive decay occurs because certain atomic nuclei lack stability and must release energy in order to achieve a more stable configuration. This process involves the emission of either particles or electromagnetic waves. The three primary types of radioactive decay are alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay.

**Alpha Decay** occurs when an unstable nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is composed of two protons and two neutrons. This process results in a decrease of the atomic number by $2$ and a reduction of the mass number by $4$. For instance, when uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay, it transforms into thorium-234.

**Beta Decay** manifests in two forms: beta-minus decay and beta-plus decay. In beta-minus decay, a neutron within the nucleus is converted into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. The emitted electron, known as a beta particle, and the antineutrino exit the nucleus. This process increases the atomic number by $1$ while leaving the mass number unchanged. Conversely, in beta-plus decay, a proton is transformed into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. During this decay, the positron and neutrino are emitted, resulting in a decrease of the atomic number by $1$.

**Gamma Decay** involves the release of gamma rays, which are high-energy electromagnetic waves. This type of decay typically occurs following alpha or beta decay, as the nucleus may remain in an excited state after these processes. Gamma decay enables the nucleus to expel excess energy without altering the number of protons or neutrons.

Radioactive decay is inherently random, making it impossible to predict the exact moment when a specific nucleus will decay. However, we can characterize the decay rate using the concept of half-life, defined as the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay. Understanding radioactive decay is essential across various fields, including medicine, archaeology, and nuclear energy.
