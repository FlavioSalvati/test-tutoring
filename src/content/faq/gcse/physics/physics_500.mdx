Terminal velocity occurs when the force of gravity is balanced by the drag force, resulting in zero acceleration.

When an object falls through a fluid, such as air, it initially accelerates due to the gravitational force acting on it. As the object's speed increases, the drag force opposing its motion also increases. The drag force acts as a type of friction that resists the object's movement and depends on several factors, including the object's speed, surface area, and the density of the fluid it is traveling through.

At the beginning of the fall, the drag force is relatively small compared to the gravitational force. Consequently, the object accelerates downward. However, as the object's speed continues to increase, the drag force increases as well. Eventually, a point is reached where the drag force equals the gravitational force acting on the object. When these two forces are balanced, the net force on the object becomes zero, which means there is no further acceleration. At this stage, the object continues to fall at a constant speed, referred to as terminal velocity.

The specific value of terminal velocity is influenced by several factors, including the mass and shape of the object, as well as the density of the fluid through which it is falling. For instance, a skydiver in a belly-to-earth position presents a larger surface area against the direction of motion, which increases the drag force and results in a lower terminal velocity compared to a head-down position.

Understanding terminal velocity is crucial in various fields, such as parachute design, where the objective is to maximize drag to lower the terminal velocity and ensure a safe landing speed. This knowledge also aids in analyzing the motion of objects through different fluids, whether they are falling raindrops or engineered components in fluid dynamics studies.
