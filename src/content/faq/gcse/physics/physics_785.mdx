When the volume of a gas decreases, its pressure increases, provided that the temperature and the quantity of gas remain constant.

This relationship is described by Boyle's Law, which states that the pressure of a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to its volume, as long as the temperature does not change. To put it simply, when you compress a gas into a smaller space, the particles have less room to move around. As a result, they collide with the walls of their container more frequently, leading to an increase in pressure.

Consider a sealed syringe with its nozzle blocked. When you push the plunger inward, you reduce the volume inside the syringe. The gas particles now have less space to move, which means they collide with each other and the walls of the syringe more often. This increased frequency of collisions results in a higher pressure within the syringe.

Boyle's Law can be mathematically expressed as:

$$ P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 $$

In this equation, $ P_1 $ and $ V_1 $ represent the initial pressure and volume, while $ P_2 $ and $ V_2 $ denote the new pressure and volume after a change occurs. This formula illustrates that when the volume decreases, the pressure must increase to maintain a constant product of $ P \times V $, assuming that both the temperature and the amount of gas remain unchanged.

Understanding this principle is essential in various real-life scenarios. For instance, when you inflate a bicycle tire, you are effectively reducing the volume available for the air inside, which results in an increase in pressure, causing the tire to become firm. Similarly, in deep-sea diving, the pressure in a diver's lungs increases as the volume of air decreases due to the higher water pressure at greater depths.

By comprehending the interplay between gas pressure and volume, you can better understand the behavior of gases in different contexts, which is a fundamental concept in GCSE Physics.
