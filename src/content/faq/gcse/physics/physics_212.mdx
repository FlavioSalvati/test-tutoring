Airbags play a crucial role in enhancing passenger safety during car collisions by extending the time over which a passenger's momentum changes, thereby reducing the force exerted on them.

When a car crashes, the passengers inside continue to move at the original speed of the vehicle. According to the principle of momentum, the momentum $p$ of an object is calculated as the product of its mass $m$ and its velocity $v$, expressed as:

$$
p = m \cdot v
$$

To safely bring the passengers to a stop, their momentum must be reduced to zero. If this change occurs too rapidly, it can lead to serious injuries.

Airbags function by rapidly inflating during a collision, creating a cushion that allows for a more gradual deceleration of the passenger. This increased duration of momentum change enhances the safety of the occupants. According to Newton's second law, the force $F$ experienced by an object is equal to the change in momentum $\Delta p$ divided by the time interval $\Delta t$ over which this change occurs:

$$
F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
$$

By extending the time interval $\Delta t$, the resultant force $F$ acting on the passenger is significantly reduced.

To illustrate this, consider a scenario where a passenger's momentum changes from a high value to zero in a very short time span. In such a case, the resulting force would be immense, potentially leading to severe injuries. Conversely, if the same change in momentum is spread over a more extended period, the resulting force is much smaller, thereby diminishing the risk of injury.

Moreover, airbags are designed to distribute the force over a larger area of the passenger's body compared to just a seatbelt. This distribution further lessens the pressure on any single body part, which reduces the likelihood of injuries to critical areas such as the chest or head.

In conclusion, by increasing the duration of momentum change and distributing the force over a broader area, airbags significantly mitigate the forces experienced by passengers during a crash. This innovative safety feature plays a vital role in decreasing both the likelihood and severity of injuries sustained in automobile accidents.
