Irradiation can cause significant damage to living tissue by ionizing atoms and molecules, which may lead to cell death or mutations.

When living tissue is exposed to radiation, the energy from the radiation can ionize atoms and molecules within the cells. Ionization refers to the process where electrons are ejected from their orbits, resulting in the formation of charged particles known as ions. These ions can behave unpredictably, disrupting normal cellular functions. For example, they may break chemical bonds in crucial molecules like DNA. Damage to DNA can lead to mutations, which are alterations in the genetic code. Such mutations can sometimes trigger uncontrolled cell growth, resulting in cancer.

The effects of radiation on living tissue vary depending on the type of radiation. Alpha particles, for example, are highly ionizing but have low penetration power. This means they can cause significant harm if ingested or inhaled, but are generally stopped by the skin. Beta particles possess moderate ionizing power and can penetrate the skin to some degree, potentially leading to burns or other injuries. In contrast, gamma rays and X-rays are highly penetrating forms of radiation that can traverse the body and may result in widespread ionization and damage to internal organs.

The extent of damage also varies with the radiation dose received. A small dose may cause minor harm that the body can repair, while a large dose can inflict severe damage, potentially leading to radiation sickness or even death. Symptoms of radiation sickness include nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, and occur when a substantial number of cells are damaged or destroyed.

To minimize the harmful effects of radiation, protective measures such as lead aprons for X-ray procedures and limiting exposure time are essential. Understanding how irradiation affects living tissue is crucial for ensuring the safe use of radiation in medical treatments and various applications.
