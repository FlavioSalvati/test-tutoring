The motion of particles in gases is characterized by rapid and random movement as they collide with one another and with the walls of their container.

In gaseous states, particles are significantly more spaced apart compared to those in solids and liquids. This increased distance grants them greater freedom of movement. Gas particles are in continuous, high-speed motion, traveling in straight lines until they collide with either another particle or the container's walls. These collisions are elastic, meaning that kinetic energy is conserved; it is transferred between the colliding particles rather than being lost.

The velocity of gas particles is influenced by the temperature of the gas. As the temperature increases, more energy is imparted to the particles, causing them to move more swiftly. This phenomenon explains why a balloon expands when heated: the gas particles within move more rapidly and strike the walls of the balloon with greater force, thereby increasing the pressure and resulting in the balloonâ€™s expansion.

The random motion of gas particles also accounts for the tendency of gases to fill their containers completely. When a gas is released into a room, the particles disperse in all directions, eventually achieving an even distribution throughout the space. This process is referred to as diffusion. The rate of diffusion is influenced by the mass of the gas particles and the temperature; lighter particles diffuse more quickly, and higher temperatures facilitate faster diffusion.

Understanding the behavior of gas particles is crucial in explaining various phenomena, such as the ability to smell perfume from across a room or the increased firmness of a tire when it is properly inflated. The kinetic theory of gases serves as an essential model for predicting and elucidating the behavior of gases under varying conditions, making it a fundamental concept in GCSE Physics.
