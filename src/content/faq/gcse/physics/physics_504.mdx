Newton's First Law of Motion asserts that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. 

This principle is commonly known as the law of inertia. Inertia refers to the inherent tendency of an object to resist any change in its state of motion. Specifically, if an object is at rest, it will remain at rest until a force acts upon it. Likewise, if an object is moving with a constant velocity in a straight line, it will continue to do so unless a force intervenes to alter its velocity or direction.

For instance, consider a book resting on a table. According to Newton's First Law, the book will stay at rest until a force, such as a push from your hand, is applied to it. Once you exert a force and push the book, it will begin to move. If you cease to apply the force, the book will eventually come to a stop due to friction acting between the book and the surface of the table.

In the context of a moving object, such as a car traveling along a straight road, the vehicle will maintain its speed and direction unless a force is applied, such as applying the brakes or turning the steering wheel. This illustrates the importance of seatbelts in vehicles; they provide the necessary force to restrain your body from continuing to move forward when the car comes to an abrupt stop.

A solid understanding of inertia is crucial for analyzing and predicting the behavior of objects under various conditions, making it a fundamental concept in the field of physics.
