Waves exhibit several key properties, including amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and speed, and can be categorized as either transverse or longitudinal waves.

A wave is defined as a disturbance that transfers energy from one location to another without the transfer of matter. The **amplitude** of a wave represents the maximum displacement of a point on the wave from its equilibrium position. This property is directly related to the energy carried by the wave; a greater amplitude indicates a higher energy level. For instance, in the case of sound waves, an increased amplitude results in a louder sound.

The **wavelength** is the distance between two corresponding points on consecutive waves, such as from crest to crest or trough to trough. It is typically measured in meters ($m$). The **frequency** of a wave refers to the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in one second, expressed in hertz ($Hz$). A higher frequency signifies that more waves pass through a point each second.

The **wave speed** indicates how quickly a wave propagates through a medium and is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Wave Speed} = \text{Frequency} \times \text{Wavelength}
$$

Different types of waves propagate at varying speeds depending on the medium through which they travel. For example, light waves travel more rapidly in a vacuum compared to their speed in air or water.

Waves can be classified into two primary categories: **transverse** and **longitudinal**. In transverse waves, the oscillations occur perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; common examples include ripples on a pond and light waves. Conversely, in longitudinal waves, the oscillations occur parallel to the direction of wave travel. An example of this is sound waves in air, where compressions and rarefactions move along the wave's path.

Understanding these fundamental properties of waves allows us to analyze and predict wave behavior across various contexts, from everyday phenomena such as sound and light to sophisticated applications in technology and scientific research.
