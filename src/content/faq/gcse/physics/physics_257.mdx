To calculate the force acting on a current-carrying conductor, you can use the formula:

$$ F = BIL \sin(\theta) $$

When a conductor that carries an electric current is placed within a magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force can be determined using the equation above, where:
- $F$ represents the force in newtons (N),
- $B$ denotes the magnetic flux density in teslas (T),
- $I$ indicates the current flowing through the conductor in amperes (A),
- $L$ signifies the length of the conductor that is situated within the magnetic field in metres (m), and
- $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the current and the magnetic field.

The magnetic flux density, $B$, illustrates the strength of the magnetic field. The current, $I$, refers to the flow of electric charge through the conductor. The length, $L$, is the portion of the conductor that is immersed in the magnetic field. The angle, $\theta$, plays a critical role since the magnitude of the force is dependent on the orientation of the conductor relative to the magnetic field. When the conductor is positioned perpendicular to the magnetic field ($\theta = 90^\circ$), $\sin(\theta)$ equals 1, resulting in the maximum force. Conversely, if the conductor is aligned parallel to the magnetic field ($\theta = 0^\circ$), $\sin(\theta)$ equals 0, and thus the force becomes zero.

For instance, consider a wire that is $0.5$ metres long and carries a current of $3$ amperes, positioned in a magnetic field of $0.2$ teslas at an angle of $90^\circ$ to the field. The force can be calculated as follows:

$$ F = 0.2 \, \text{T} \times 3 \, \text{A} \times 0.5 \, \text{m} \times \sin(90^\circ) $$

Since $\sin(90^\circ)$ is equal to $1$, we find:

$$ F = 0.2 \times 3 \times 0.5 \times 1 = 0.3 \, \text{N} $$

Grasping this concept is crucial for various practical applications, including electric motors and generators, where the interaction between electric currents and magnetic fields is harnessed to produce motion or generate electricity.
