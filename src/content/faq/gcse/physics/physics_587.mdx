Stars similar to our Sun conclude their life cycles by evolving into red giants, shedding their outer layers, and ultimately forming white dwarfs.

During most of their existence, stars like our Sun reside in the main sequence phase, where they fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores. This fusion process releases energy, which counteracts the gravitational forces that seek to collapse the star. However, once the hydrogen in the core is depleted, the star can no longer maintain this equilibrium.

As a result, the core contracts under the influence of gravity, leading to an increase in temperature, while the outer layers expand significantly. This expansion transforms the star into a red giant. In this phase, the star's outer layers are pushed outward, causing it to become much larger and cooler at the surface, which gives it a characteristic reddish hue.

As the core continues to contract and heat up, it reaches temperatures sufficient to initiate the fusion of helium into heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen. This helium fusion provides a temporary extension of the star's life, but it is not sustainable for as long as the previous hydrogen fusion phase. Eventually, the helium in the core becomes exhausted.

At this stage, the star lacks the mass necessary to fuse heavier elements. Consequently, the outer layers are expelled into space, forming an intricate shell of gas and dust known as a planetary nebula. What remains is the hot, dense core, which evolves into a white dwarf. This white dwarf is remarkably dense and undergoes a slow cooling process over billions of years, eventually fading from view.

Throughout this stellar transformation, the star loses a substantial portion of its mass, thereby enriching the surrounding interstellar medium with heavier elements. This ejected material can later play a crucial role in the formation of new stars and planets, perpetuating the cosmic cycle of stellar evolution.
