title: "How do you calculate the focal length of a lens?"
summary: "The focal length of a lens can be calculated using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, where f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance."

To determine the focal length of a lens, you can utilize the lens formula given by 

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}.
$$

The focal length, denoted as $f$, represents the distance from the lens to the point at which it converges parallel rays of light. This relationship connects the focal length ($f$), the object distance ($u$), and the image distance ($v$). In this formula, $u$ is the distance from the object to the lens, while $v$ is the distance from the lens to the image.

To apply this formula, you need to accurately measure both the object distance ($u$) and the image distance ($v$). It's crucial to adhere to the correct sign convention: for a converging lens, distances that are measured in the direction of the incoming light should be considered positive, while those measured against this direction should be negative. Conversely, for a diverging lens, the focal length is treated as negative.

For instance, suppose you place an object at a distance of $30 \, \text{cm}$ from a converging lens, and the image is formed $60 \, \text{cm}$ on the opposite side of the lens. Substituting these values into the lens formula gives:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{60} - \frac{1}{30}.
$$

By simplifying this expression, we find:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1 - 2}{60} = -\frac{1}{60}.
$$

From this, we can deduce that 

$$
f = -60 \, \text{cm}.
$$

However, since we are working with a converging lens, the focal length must be positive, leading to the conclusion that 

$$
f = 60 \, \text{cm}.
$$

This method enables you to accurately determine the focal length of any lens, provided you have precise measurements of both the object and image distances.
