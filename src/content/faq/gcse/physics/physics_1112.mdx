A magnetic field is generated by an electric current due to the movement of electric charges.

When an electric current flows through a conductor, such as a wire, it creates a magnetic field around that conductor. This phenomenon arises because electric currents are comprised of moving electric charges, typically electrons. According to the principles of electromagnetism, moving electric charges generate a magnetic field. This relationship is encapsulated in Amp√®re's Law, which states that the magnetic field in the space surrounding an electric current is proportional to the amount of current flowing through the conductor.

The direction of the magnetic field produced by an electric current can be determined using the right-hand rule. By pointing the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the current, the curl of your fingers indicates the direction of the magnetic field lines encircling the wire. Consequently, the magnetic field forms concentric circles around the wire.

The strength of the magnetic field is influenced by several factors, including the magnitude of the current and the distance from the conductor. A greater current will yield a stronger magnetic field, while the strength of the field diminishes as one moves farther from the wire. Moreover, the material surrounding the wire can also affect the magnetic field. For instance, placing a wire within a coil of ferromagnetic material, such as iron, can substantially enhance the strength of the magnetic field.

In practical applications, this principle is utilized in devices like electromagnets, where a coil of wire (known as a solenoid) generates a strong magnetic field when an electric current passes through it. Electromagnets are extensively employed in various technologies, including electric motors, generators, and transformers, highlighting the fundamental connection between electricity and magnetism.
