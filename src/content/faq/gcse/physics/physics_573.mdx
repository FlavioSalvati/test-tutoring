Induced potential refers to the voltage generated in a conductor when it undergoes a change in magnetic field.

When a conductor, such as a wire, moves through a magnetic field, or when the magnetic field around a stationary conductor varies, an electric current can be induced. This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction. The induced potential, often referred to as induced voltage, serves as the driving force for this current. It is a fundamental concept in physics and underpins the operation of numerous electrical devices, including generators and transformers.

The principle of induced potential is articulated by Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction. This law states that the induced potential in a circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through that circuit. To put it simply, the quicker the magnetic field changes, the greater the induced voltage. This change can occur either by moving the conductor through the magnetic field or by altering the strength or direction of the magnetic field itself.

For instance, in a basic generator, a coil of wire is rotated within a magnetic field. As the coil spins, the magnetic field through the coil shifts, thereby inducing a potential difference across the ends of the wire. If the circuit is complete, this induced potential will cause an electric current to flow. The direction of the induced current is determined by both the direction of the coil's movement and the orientation of the magnetic field, a relationship described by Fleming's Right-Hand Rule.

Induced potential is also essential in transformers, devices that are used to either increase or decrease the voltage of alternating current (AC) in power distribution systems. In a transformer, an alternating current in the primary coil generates a changing magnetic field, which in turn induces a potential in the secondary coil. This process enables the efficient transmission of electrical power over long distances.

By understanding induced potential, we gain insight into the functioning of many common electrical devices and appreciate the critical role that magnetic fields play in the generation of electricity.
