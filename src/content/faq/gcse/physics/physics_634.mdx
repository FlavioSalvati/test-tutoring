Energy can be transferred within a system through four primary mechanisms: conduction, convection, radiation, and mechanical work.

### Conduction
Conduction refers to the transfer of energy through direct contact between particles. This phenomenon predominantly occurs in solids, where particles are closely packed together. When a segment of a solid is heated, its particles absorb energy and begin to vibrate more vigorously. These vibrations are then transmitted to neighboring particles, resulting in the transfer of energy throughout the material. For instance, when one end of a metal rod is heated, the other end will eventually become warm due to conduction.

### Convection
Convection is the process of energy transfer through the movement of fluids, which may be either liquids or gases. When a fluid is heated, it becomes less dense and rises, while cooler, denser fluid sinks to occupy its place. This creates a convection current that facilitates the transfer of energy throughout the fluid. A common example of convection can be observed when water is heated in a pot on the stove: as hot water rises, cooler water descends to be heated, thus establishing a circulating flow.

### Radiation
Radiation is the transfer of energy through electromagnetic waves, such as infrared radiation. Notably, this method does not require a medium, allowing energy to be transmitted through a vacuum. The energy from the Sun reaches Earth primarily through radiation. When you feel the Sun's warmth on your skin, you are experiencing energy transfer via radiation.

### Mechanical Work
Mechanical work involves the transfer of energy when a force is exerted to move an object. For example, when you push a trolley, your muscles perform work on the trolley, transferring energy to it and causing it to move. This type of energy transfer is evident in numerous everyday activities and is a fundamental concept in mechanics.

Understanding these methods of energy transfer is crucial for analyzing various physical processes and addressing practical problems in science and engineering.
