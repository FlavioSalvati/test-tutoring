The carbon footprint associated with the use of natural gas is approximately $2.75$ kilograms of CO$_2$ emitted for every cubic metre of gas burned.

Natural gas is a fossil fuel predominantly composed of methane (CH$_4$). When burned, methane reacts with oxygen (O$_2$) in the atmosphere, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and water (H$_2$O). This combustion process releases energy that we utilize for various purposes such as heating, electricity generation, and cooking. However, it simultaneously releases CO$_2$, a greenhouse gas that significantly contributes to global warming.

To comprehend the carbon footprint of natural gas, it is essential to examine the amount of CO$_2$ generated per unit of gas. For every cubic metre of natural gas burned, approximately $2.75$ kilograms of CO$_2$ are emitted. This emission level is lower than that of coal or oil, positioning natural gas as a comparatively cleaner fossil fuel. Nevertheless, it remains a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions.

Moreover, the carbon footprint of natural gas encompasses emissions resulting from its extraction, processing, and transportation. Methane, being the primary component of natural gas, is a highly potent greenhouse gas. If methane escapes into the atmosphere during these stages, it can exert a far greater impact on global warming than CO$_2$ does. Therefore, efforts to mitigate these leaks are vital for managing the overall carbon footprint associated with natural gas.

In conclusion, while natural gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels, it still plays a role in greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding its carbon footprint is crucial for making informed decisions regarding energy consumption and its environmental implications.
