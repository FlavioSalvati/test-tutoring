The unit used to measure energy consumption is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).

Kilowatt-hours (kWh) are commonly employed to quantify electrical energy usage over time because they provide a clear and practical representation of consumption. Specifically, one kilowatt-hour reflects the amount of energy consumed by a device that operates at a power level of $1$ kilowatt ($1000$ watts) for a duration of $1$ hour. For instance, if you have a $100$-watt light bulb and leave it on for $10$ hours, it will consume $1$ kWh of energy, calculated as follows: 

$$
100 \text{ watts} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 1000 \text{ watt-hours} = 1 \text{ kWh}.
$$

In the context of GCSE Physics, understanding energy consumption is vital. It allows us to analyze the energy usage of various appliances and assess how this affects our electricity bills and the environment. The kilowatt-hour is a particularly useful unit because it directly correlates with the power ratings of household devices and the duration of their use.

Electricity meters installed in homes measure energy consumption in kilowatt-hours, which utility companies then use to calculate your electricity bill. For example, if your household consumes $500$ kWh in a month and the cost per kWh is $15$ pence, your electricity bill for that month would amount to £75, computed as follows:

$$
500 \text{ kWh} \times £0.15 = £75.
$$

It is also important to recognize that while the kilowatt-hour is the standard unit for electrical energy, other units such as the joule (J) are used in different contexts. Specifically, one kilowatt-hour is equivalent to $3.6$ million joules, derived from the fact that $1$ watt equals $1$ joule per second, and there are $3600$ seconds in an hour:

$$
1 \text{ kWh} = 1000 \text{ watts} \times 3600 \text{ seconds} = 3,600,000 \text{ joules}.
$$

Grasping these conversions can enhance your understanding of energy consumption levels and the efficiency of various devices.
