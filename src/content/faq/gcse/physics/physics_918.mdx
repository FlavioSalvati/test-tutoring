Fluid pressure is defined as the force exerted per unit area by a fluid on a surface.

More specifically, fluid pressure quantifies the force that a liquid or gas exerts on the walls of its container or any surface it encounters. This pressure arises from the constant, random motion of the fluid's molecules, which collide with surfaces to generate force. The relationship between fluid pressure $ P $, force $ F $, and area $ A $ is expressed by the equation:

$$ 
P = \frac{F}{A} 
$$

This equation indicates that pressure is equal to the force applied divided by the area over which that force is distributed.

For instance, consider a container filled with water. The water molecules are in constant motion and collide with the container's walls. The cumulative force of these collisions over a specific area generates pressure. If you increase the force—by adding more water, for example—the pressure will also increase. Conversely, if you reduce the area—by using a smaller container—the pressure will rise as well, since the same force is now concentrated over a smaller area.

This principle explains why sharp objects can penetrate surfaces more easily than blunt ones. A sharp knife has a small edge surface area, allowing even a modest force to generate high pressure, which facilitates cutting through materials. In contrast, a blunt object has a larger surface area, resulting in lower pressure for the same force, thereby reducing its cutting effectiveness.

Understanding fluid pressure is essential in numerous applications, ranging from hydraulic system design to weather prediction. In hydraulics, for example, fluid pressure is utilized to transmit force through liquids, enabling machines to lift heavy loads with relatively little effort. By grasping the relationship between pressure, force, and area, one can gain deeper insights into the behavior of fluids across various contexts.
