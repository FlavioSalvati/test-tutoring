There are three primary types of nuclear radiation: alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays.

**Alpha Particles**  
Alpha particles are composed of two protons and two neutrons, giving them a relatively large mass and a positive charge. These particles are emitted from the nucleus of unstable atoms. Due to their significant mass and charge, alpha particles possess low penetration power; they can be effectively stopped by a sheet of paper or even the outer layer of human skin. However, if materials that emit alpha radiation are ingested or inhaled, they can cause considerable damage to internal tissues because of their high ionizing ability.

**Beta Particles**  
Beta particles are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons emitted by a decaying atomic nucleus. There are two varieties of beta particles: beta-minus ($\beta^-$) particles, which are electrons, and beta-plus ($\beta^+$) particles, which are positrons. Beta particles are lighter than alpha particles and carry either a negative or positive charge. They possess greater penetration power compared to alpha particles but can still be stopped by materials such as plastic or a few millimeters of aluminum. When beta radiation penetrates the skin, it can damage living tissues, making it more hazardous than alpha radiation in cases of external exposure.

**Gamma Rays**  
Gamma rays are high-frequency electromagnetic waves emitted from the nucleus of a radioactive atom. Unlike alpha and beta particles, gamma rays have no mass and no charge. They exhibit the highest penetration power among the three types of radiation, capable of passing through several centimeters of lead or meters of concrete. Gamma rays are highly ionizing and can inflict serious damage on living cells and tissues, making them particularly dangerous. Effective shielding against gamma radiation requires dense materials such as lead or thick concrete to minimize exposure.

Understanding these types of nuclear radiation is essential for safely handling radioactive materials and protecting oneself from potential hazards.
