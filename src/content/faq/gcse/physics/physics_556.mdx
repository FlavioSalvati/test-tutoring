The albedo effect plays a significant role in regulating Earth's temperature by reflecting sunlight back into space, thereby minimizing the amount of heat absorbed by the planet.

Albedo is defined as the fraction of sunlight that a surface reflects. Surfaces with high albedo, such as ice and snow, reflect the majority of the sunlight that strikes them, while darker surfaces, like forests and oceans, exhibit low albedo and consequently absorb more sunlight. This dynamic of reflection and absorption is crucial in maintaining Earth's temperature balance.

When sunlight reaches Earth, a portion of it is absorbed by the surface, which warms the planet, while the remainder is reflected back into space. The fraction of sunlight that gets reflected is influenced by the surface's albedo. For instance, ice and snow can have an albedo as high as $90\%$, reflecting most of the incoming sunlight. In contrast, dark ocean water has a low albedo, reflecting only about $10\%$ of sunlight. This characteristic allows regions covered in ice and snow to help keep the Earth cooler by reflecting a significant amount of solar radiation.

Changes in Earth's surface can significantly modify the albedo effect. As global temperatures rise, for example, the melting of ice and snow exposes darker surfaces, such as water or land beneath. These darker surfaces absorb more sunlight, leading to increased warming and further ice melt. This process initiates a feedback loop known as the ice-albedo feedback, which can exacerbate climate change.

Human activities also have a notable impact on the albedo effect. Deforestation, for example, can convert dark forests into lighter-colored agricultural fields, potentially increasing the albedo and leading to local cooling. Conversely, urbanization often replaces natural landscapes with dark surfaces, such as asphalt, which decreases the albedo and can contribute to localized warming.

Understanding the albedo effect is vital for predicting and addressing climate change. By examining how various surfaces reflect sunlight, scientists can gain insights into how changes in land use and ice cover influence global temperatures.
