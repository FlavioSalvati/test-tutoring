In a series circuit, the current remains constant at every point throughout the circuit.

To elaborate, a series circuit is an electrical configuration where components are connected in a linear sequence, creating a single pathway for the current to flow. Since there is only one path available, the same amount of current flows through each component. Consequently, if you measure the current at any point in a series circuit, you will consistently obtain the same value.

Consider a series circuit containing a battery and three resistors connected sequentially. The current that flows from the battery travels through the first resistor, then the second, and finally the third, before returning to the battery. Because there are no alternative routes for the current, it must pass through each resistor in turn. As a result, the current is identical at every point in the circuit.

The total resistance in a series circuit is simply the sum of the individual resistances. For instance, if you have three resistors with resistances of $2 \, \Omega$, $3 \, \Omega$, and $5 \, \Omega$, the total resistance can be calculated as follows:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = 2 \, \Omega + 3 \, \Omega + 5 \, \Omega = 10 \, \Omega.
$$

According to Ohm's Law, which states that $V = IR$, the current in the circuit can be determined by dividing the total voltage by the total resistance. If the battery supplies $10 \, V$, the current would be calculated as:

$$
I = \frac{V}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{10 \, V}{10 \, \Omega} = 1 \, A.
$$

It is essential to understand that while the current is uniform throughout a series circuit, the voltage across each component may vary. The voltage drop across each resistor is influenced by its resistance and the current flowing through it. In our example, although the voltage drop across each individual resistor will differ, the sum of these voltage drops will equal the total voltage provided by the battery.
