A series circuit is an electrical circuit where components are connected end-to-end, creating a single pathway for current to flow.

In a series circuit, the same current flows through all components since there is only one route for the current. This characteristic means that if one component fails or is disconnected, the entire circuit ceases to function. For instance, if you have a string of fairy lights connected in series and one bulb burns out, all the lights will go dark.

The total resistance in a series circuit is the sum of the individual resistances of each component. This occurs because the current must pass through each resistor sequentially, thereby accumulating total resistance. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots
$$

Here, $ R_1, R_2, R_3 $ represent the resistances of the individual components.

Additionally, the voltage in a series circuit is distributed among the components. The total voltage supplied by the power source is equal to the sum of the voltages across each component. This can be represented as:

$$
V_{\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + \ldots
$$

In this equation, $ V_1, V_2, V_3 $ are the voltages across each component. This phenomenon is referred to as the voltage drop, which occurs because each component consumes a portion of the total voltage.

Series circuits are commonly utilized in applications where the operation of the circuit relies on all components functioning correctly, such as in older Christmas lights or certain types of battery packs. Understanding series circuits is crucial in GCSE Physics, as it provides foundational knowledge about how electrical circuits operate and lays the groundwork for calculating current, voltage, and resistance in more complex configurations.
