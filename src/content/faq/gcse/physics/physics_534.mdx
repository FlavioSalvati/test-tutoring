To conduct an experimental investigation of wave reflection, you will need to set up a wave source, observe the reflected waves, and measure the angles of incidence and reflection.

**Detailed Procedure:**

1. **Equipment Setup**: Begin by utilizing a ripple tank, which is a shallow glass container filled with water. Introduce a straight-edged barrier within the tank to serve as a reflective surface.

2. **Generating Waves**: Employ a wave generator, such as a vibrating bar or a motor, to produce waves in the water. These waves will propagate towards the barrier and subsequently reflect off it.

3. **Enhancing Visibility**: To clearly observe the waves, shine a light from above the tank. This illumination will cast shadows of the waves onto a screen or a piece of white paper placed beneath the tank. As a result, you will be able to see both the incident waves (those moving toward the barrier) and the reflected waves (those moving away from the barrier after striking it).

4. **Measuring Angles**: Next, you will need to measure the angles of incidence and reflection. The angle of incidence is defined as the angle between the direction of the incident wave and the normal line (an imaginary line perpendicular to the barrier). In contrast, the angle of reflection is the angle between the direction of the reflected wave and the normal. According to the law of reflection, these two angles should be equal, i.e.,

$$
\text{Angle of Incidence} = \text{Angle of Reflection}.
$$

5. **Using a Protractor**: To measure these angles, utilize a protractor. Place the protractor on the screen or paper where the waves are visible. Align the normal with the 90-degree mark on the protractor. First, measure the angle between the direction of the incident wave and the normal. Then, measure the angle between the direction of the reflected wave and the normal. Compare these measurements to confirm the law of reflection.

By following these steps, you will be able to experimentally investigate wave reflection and gain insights into the behavior of waves when they encounter a reflective surface.
