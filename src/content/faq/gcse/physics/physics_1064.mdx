To conduct an experiment on lenses, you will measure the focal length and magnification using a convex lens, a light source, and a screen.

### Equipment Needed
First, gather the following equipment:
- A convex lens
- A light source (such as a lamp or candle)
- A screen (like a piece of white paper)
- A metre ruler
- A lens holder

Make sure to perform the experiment in a darkened room to enhance visibility of the image formed by the lens.

### Experimental Setup
Begin by placing the convex lens in the lens holder and positioning it along the metre ruler. Place the light source at one end of the ruler. To ensure a clear and sharp image, if you are using a candle, make sure the flame is steady. If you opt for a lamp, consider placing a small object, such as a cross or arrow, in front of the light source to produce a distinct image.

### Finding Image Distance
Next, move the screen along the ruler until you achieve a sharp image of the light source on the screen. Measure the distance from the lens to the screen; this distance is referred to as the image distance, denoted as $v$. Additionally, measure the distance from the lens to the light source; this is known as the object distance, denoted as $u$.

### Calculating Focal Length
To determine the focal length $f$ of the lens, apply the lens formula:
$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
$$
It is advisable to take multiple measurements by varying the object distance $u$ and repeating the process. This will allow you to calculate an average value for the focal length, thereby increasing the accuracy of your results.

### Measuring Magnification
For magnification, measure the height of the image on the screen, denoted as $h_i$, and the height of the object, denoted as $h_o$. The magnification $M$ can be calculated using the formula:
$$
M = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{v}{u}
$$

By carefully recording and analyzing your measurements, you will be able to investigate the properties of lenses, including their focal length and magnification, and gain a deeper understanding of how they form images.
