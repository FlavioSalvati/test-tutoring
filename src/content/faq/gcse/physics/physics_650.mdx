Nuclear energy generates power by harnessing heat produced from nuclear fission to create steam, which in turn drives turbines to produce electricity.

To elaborate, nuclear power plants function based on the principle of nuclear fission. In this process, the nucleus of a heavy atom—typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239—is split into smaller fragments. This splitting releases a substantial amount of energy in the form of heat. The fission process begins within the reactor core, where fuel rods containing uranium or plutonium are bombarded with neutrons. When a neutron collides with the nucleus of a fuel atom, it causes the nucleus to split, releasing additional neutrons along with a significant amount of heat.

The neutrons released from this initial fission event can then collide with other fuel atoms, leading to a self-sustaining chain reaction. This chain reaction is meticulously controlled using control rods, which are capable of absorbing neutrons. By adjusting the position of these control rods, operators can regulate the reaction rate, either slowing it down or accelerating it as necessary. The heat generated from the fission process is then utilized to convert water into steam within the reactor's heat exchanger.

The high-pressure steam produced is directed to rotate the blades of a turbine. As the turbine blades spin, they drive a generator that transforms the mechanical energy of the rotating turbine into electrical energy. This electricity is subsequently transmitted through power lines to homes, schools, and businesses.

Nuclear power plants are equipped with multiple safety systems to maintain control over the reaction and prevent the release of harmful radiation. These safety measures include containment structures, cooling systems, and emergency shutdown protocols. Despite the intricacies involved, nuclear power stands out as a highly efficient method for producing large amounts of electricity, with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.
