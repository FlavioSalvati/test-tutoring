In physics, equilibrium refers to a state in which all forces and moments acting on a system are perfectly balanced.

Equilibrium can be categorized into two primary types: static and dynamic. **Static equilibrium** occurs when an object is at rest, with all the forces acting on it in balance. For instance, a book resting on a table exemplifies static equilibrium because the downward gravitational force is countered by the upward normal force exerted by the table.

Conversely, **dynamic equilibrium** takes place when an object is moving at a constant velocity. In this scenario, the forces acting on the object remain balanced, even though the object is not stationary. A practical example of dynamic equilibrium is a car traveling at a steady speed along a straight road. Here, the forward thrust produced by the engine is balanced by opposing forces such as air resistance and friction.

To ascertain whether an object is in equilibrium, we rely on two fundamental conditions. The first is the **translational equilibrium condition**, which states that the vector sum of all forces acting on the object must be zero. This can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\Sigma F = 0
$$

where $\Sigma F$ denotes the sum of all forces.

The second condition pertains to rotational equilibrium. This condition requires that the sum of all moments (or torques) acting on the object must also equal zero. This is known as the **rotational equilibrium condition** and can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\Sigma \tau = 0
$$

where $\Sigma \tau$ signifies the sum of all moments.

Understanding the concept of equilibrium is essential in physics, as it enables us to analyze and predict the behavior of objects in a variety of contexts. Whether we are designing a stable bridge or ensuring that a satellite maintains a stable orbit, the principles of equilibrium are fundamental to addressing real-world challenges.
