The speed of sound is influenced by several key factors, including the medium through which it travels, as well as temperature, pressure, and humidity.

One of the most significant factors is the medium itself. Sound travels faster in solids compared to liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases. This difference arises because the particles in solids are more closely packed, enabling vibrations to be transferred more efficiently from one particle to another. For instance, sound travels at approximately $343$ meters per second in air, around $1,480$ meters per second in water, and up to $5,120$ meters per second in steel.

Temperature also plays a crucial role in determining the speed of sound. Generally, sound travels faster in warmer conditions. Higher temperatures provide additional energy to the particles in the medium, causing them to vibrate more rapidly and thereby facilitating the efficient transfer of sound waves. For example, the speed of sound in air at $0^\circ C$ is roughly $331$ meters per second, but it increases to about $343$ meters per second at $20^\circ C$.

The effect of pressure on the speed of sound in gases is less straightforward. While increasing pressure at a constant temperature does not significantly alter the speed of sound, it can influence the speed when accompanied by changes in temperature and density. In the case of liquids and solids, alterations in pressure can affect the material's density and elasticity, thus impacting the speed of sound.

Humidity, defined as the amount of water vapor present in the air, also affects the speed of sound. Higher humidity levels result in a greater concentration of water molecules, which are less massive than nitrogen and oxygen molecules. This reduction in overall air density allows sound to travel faster. For example, sound travels slightly more quickly on a humid day compared to a dry one.

Understanding these factors is essential for analyzing sound behavior in various environments. This knowledge is crucial for a range of applications, from designing concert halls to enhancing sonar technology.
