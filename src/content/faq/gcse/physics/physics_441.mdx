Inertial confinement in nuclear fusion refers to the use of lasers or ion beams to compress and heat a fuel pellet.

More specifically, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is a technique that involves tiny pellets of fusion fuel, typically isotopes of hydrogen such as deuterium ($D$) and tritium ($T$). These pellets are rapidly compressed and heated to extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures. This is accomplished by directing powerful laser beams or ion beams onto the pellet from all angles. The energy imparted by these beams causes the outer layer of the pellet to explode outward, which subsequently drives the inner layers inward, compressing the fuel to the conditions necessary for nuclear fusion reactions to occur.

The entire process occurs extremely quickly, within a timespan of nanoseconds ($10^{-9}$ seconds). The term "inertial confinement" derives from the concept that the fuel is held together by its own inertia long enough for fusion to occur. Inertia is the property of matter that resists changes in motion; hence, even though the pellet is being compressed and heated at a rapid rate, it doesnâ€™t have sufficient time to disperse before the fusion reactions commence.

The primary objective of ICF is to create the conditions necessary for nuclear fusion, where hydrogen nuclei combine to form helium, thereby releasing an enormous amount of energy. This is the same type of reaction that powers the sun and other stars. If scientists can harness and sustain these reactions on Earth, it could lead to a nearly limitless source of clean energy.

ICF is one of the two principal approaches to achieving controlled nuclear fusion, the other being magnetic confinement fusion, which utilizes magnetic fields to contain hot plasma. Both methods are still in the experimental phase, yet they hold significant promise for the future of energy production.
