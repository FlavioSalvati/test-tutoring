Displacement is defined as the difference between the final and initial positions of an object, as depicted on a distance-time graph.

In a distance-time graph, the y-axis represents the distance traveled, while the x-axis represents time. To calculate displacement, you need to identify the starting and ending points of the object's journey. Displacement is a vector quantity, meaning it possesses both magnitude and direction. This differentiates it from distance, which is a scalar quantity that only considers the total length of the path traveled, ignoring direction.

To determine displacement, follow these steps: First, locate the initial position of the object on the y-axis at the starting time, which is typically at $t=0$. Next, identify the final position on the y-axis at the ending time. The displacement can then be expressed mathematically as:

$$ \text{Displacement} = \text{Final Position} - \text{Initial Position} $$

For instance, if an object starts at $2 \, \text{metres}$ and ends at $8 \, \text{metres}$, the displacement is calculated as follows:

$$ 8 \, \text{metres} - 2 \, \text{metres} = 6 \, \text{metres} $$

It's important to note that if the object returns to its starting point, the displacement will be zero, regardless of the distance it has traveled. This is because displacement only accounts for the net change in position from the start to the end, not the path taken.

Direction plays a crucial role in displacement. If an object moves in the opposite direction from its starting point, the displacement may be negative. For example, if an object begins at $5 \, \text{metres}$ and moves to $2 \, \text{metres}$, the displacement would be calculated as:

$$ 2 \, \text{metres} - 5 \, \text{metres} = -3 \, \text{metres} $$

The negative sign indicates that the object has moved in the opposite direction relative to its starting point. Understanding these principles will enhance your ability to accurately analyze distance-time graphs and determine displacement effectively.
