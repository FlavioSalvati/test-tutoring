The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is the residual glow of the Big Bang, permeating the universe with microwave light.

The CMB is a type of electromagnetic radiation that serves as a remnant from a primordial phase of the universe, commonly referred to as the "Big Bang." It was first identified in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who detected a persistent noise emanating from all directions in the sky using their radio telescope. This noise was ultimately determined to be the CMB, providing substantial evidence supporting the Big Bang theory.

In the universe's infancy, it was characterized by extreme heat and density. As the universe expanded, it began to cool, allowing protons and electrons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. This process, known as "recombination," occurred approximately $380,000$ years after the Big Bang. Before recombination, the universe was opaque, as photons (light particles) were continuously scattered by free electrons. Following recombination, photons could move freely, and the light we now observe as the CMB emerged.

The CMB is remarkably uniform, featuring only minute fluctuations in temperature. These fluctuations are significant because they represent the initial seeds of all current cosmic structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. By examining these temperature variations, scientists can gain insights into the conditions of the early universe and the processes that led to the formation of cosmic structures.

The CMB is observed in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, with a temperature of approximately $2.7$ Kelvin, just above absolute zero. Modern satellites, including the Planck satellite, have meticulously mapped the CMB, yielding a wealth of information regarding the universe's age, composition, and evolution. As such, the CMB stands as a cornerstone of cosmology, enhancing our understanding of the universe's origins and its subsequent development.
