The relationship between redshift and the distance of galaxies reveals that more distant galaxies exhibit greater redshift.

Redshift occurs when the light emitted by a galaxy is stretched to longer wavelengths, causing it to appear redder. This phenomenon serves as a fundamental piece of evidence for the expanding universe. When we observe distant galaxies, we notice that their light is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. This redshift arises because the space between us and the galaxy is expanding, which stretches the light waves as they travel toward us.

The greater the distance of a galaxy from us, the more its light has been stretched, leading to a larger redshift. This relationship was first discovered by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s and is now known as Hubble's Law. Hubble's Law states that the velocity at which a galaxy is receding from us is directly proportional to its distance. In mathematical terms, if we measure the redshift of a galaxy, we can determine its velocity and, consequently, estimate how far away it is.

In practical terms, astronomers utilize redshift to estimate the distances to distant galaxies. By analyzing the spectrum of light emitted from a galaxy, they can measure the degree of redshift and apply Hubble's Law to calculate its distance. This method is crucial for mapping the universe and enhancing our understanding of its large-scale structure.

In summary, redshift is an essential tool in cosmology that aids our comprehension of the universe's expansion and the distances to galaxies. The more distant a galaxy is, the greater its redshift, establishing a clear and measurable relationship between distance and the stretching of light.
