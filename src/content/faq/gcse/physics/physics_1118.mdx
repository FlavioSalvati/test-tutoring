The interaction between the magnetic field and the coil in a loudspeaker is fundamental to sound production.

In a loudspeaker, the coil—commonly referred to as the voice coil—is situated within a magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet. When an electric current passes through the coil, it creates its own magnetic field. According to the principles of electromagnetism, this newly generated magnetic field interacts with the magnetic field of the permanent magnet. The result of this interaction is a force exerted on the coil, which causes it to move.

The direction of the force acting on the coil is determined by the direction of the current flowing through it. When the current reverses direction, the force on the coil also reverses. This oscillatory motion of the coil drives the diaphragm, the cone-shaped component of the loudspeaker, to move in and out. As the diaphragm moves, it compresses and rarefies the air around it, generating sound waves that we can hear.

The extent of the coil's movement is influenced by both the strength of the magnetic field and the magnitude of the current flowing through the coil. A stronger magnetic field or a higher current will result in greater movement of the coil, leading to louder sounds. Conversely, a weaker magnetic field or lower current will yield quieter sounds.

This interaction between the magnetic field and the coil exemplifies the motor effect, where a conductor carrying an electric current experiences a force when placed within a magnetic field. By precisely controlling the electric current, loudspeakers can effectively reproduce a broad spectrum of sounds, ranging from the deep bass of a drum to the high pitch of a violin.
