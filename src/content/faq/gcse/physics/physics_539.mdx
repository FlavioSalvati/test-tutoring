Electromagnetic waves are categorized by their wavelength into several distinct types: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, X-rays, and gamma rays.

Electromagnetic waves represent a form of energy that propagates through space at the speed of light, denoted as $c$. Their classification is based on wavelength, which is defined as the distance between consecutive peaks of the wave. The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all possible wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and is divided into various regions based on these wavelengths.

**Radio Waves**  
Radio waves possess the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, typically ranging from about $1 \, \text{mm}$ to over $100 \, \text{km}$. These waves are primarily utilized for communication, including the broadcasting of radio and television signals, as well as in radar technology.

**Microwaves**  
Microwaves have shorter wavelengths than radio waves, generally falling within the range of $1 \, \text{mm}$ to $1 \, \text{m}$. They are commonly employed in microwave ovens for heating food, in mobile phone networks, and in certain radar applications.

**Infrared Radiation**  
Infrared radiation encompasses wavelengths from approximately $700 \, \text{nm}$ to $1 \, \text{mm}$. This type of radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperature, making it useful in various technologies such as night-vision equipment, remote controls, and thermal imaging.

**Visible Light**  
Visible light refers to the range of electromagnetic waves that can be detected by the human eye, with wavelengths spanning from about $400 \, \text{nm}$ to $700 \, \text{nm}$. This range includes all the colors of the rainbow and represents the light that we perceive in our daily lives.

**Ultraviolet (UV) Light**  
Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths than visible light, ranging from about $10 \, \text{nm}$ to $400 \, \text{nm}$. UV light is known for its ability to cause sunburn and is also utilized in sterilization processes, as it can effectively eliminate bacteria and viruses.

**X-rays**  
X-rays feature even shorter wavelengths, approximately ranging from $0.01 \, \text{nm}$ to $10 \, \text{nm}$. They are widely used in medical imaging to visualize the internal structures of the body and are also employed in security scanners at airports.

**Gamma Rays**  
Gamma rays possess the shortest wavelengths, which are less than $0.01 \, \text{nm}$. These rays are generated by radioactive atoms and certain nuclear reactions. Gamma rays are applied in medical treatments, particularly in cancer therapy, and are also used for sterilizing medical equipment.

Understanding the classification of electromagnetic waves by wavelength is crucial, as it allows us to harness their unique properties across a range of applications, from communication technologies to advanced medical imaging.
