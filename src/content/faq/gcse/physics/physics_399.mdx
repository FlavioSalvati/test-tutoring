Gas pressure is typically measured using various units, including pascals (Pa), atmospheres (atm), and millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

Gas pressure refers to the force exerted by a gas on the walls of its container. The pascal (Pa) is the standard unit of pressure in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one newton per square meter. For everyday applications, we often use kilopascals (kPa), where $1 \text{ kPa} = 1,000 \text{ Pa}$.

Another widely-used unit is the atmosphere (atm). One atmosphere represents the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, which is approximately $101.3 \text{ kPa}$. This unit is particularly valuable in fields such as meteorology and scuba diving.

Millimeters of mercury (mmHg) is a unit that originated from the use of mercury in barometers and manometers. Specifically, one mmHg corresponds to the pressure exerted by a one-millimeter column of mercury at $0^\circ \text{C}$. This unit is also referred to as a torr, named after the Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli. Notably, $1 \text{ atm}$ is equivalent to $760 \text{ mmHg}$.

In certain contexts, especially in the United States, pounds per square inch (psi) is another common unit of pressure. This unit quantifies pressure as the force in pounds applied over an area of one square inch.

Understanding these units and the ability to convert between them is essential in various scientific and engineering applications. For instance, when examining the behavior of gases under different conditions, such as in Boyle's Law and Charles's Law, accurate measurement and conversion of gas pressure is critical.
