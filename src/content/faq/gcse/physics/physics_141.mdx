Work done on an object results in a change in its kinetic energy by transferring energy to or from that object.

When you exert a force on an object across a distance, you perform work, which facilitates an energy transfer to the object. This energy transfer can either increase or decrease the object's kinetic energy, depending on the direction of the force in relation to the object's motion. If the force is applied in the same direction as the object's motion, the kinetic energy increases. Conversely, if the force acts in the opposite direction, the kinetic energy decreases.

The work-energy principle encapsulates the relationship between work done and kinetic energy. This principle asserts that the work performed on an object is equivalent to the change in its kinetic energy. This relationship can be mathematically represented as:

$$ \text{Work Done} = \Delta KE = KE_{\text{final}} - KE_{\text{initial}} $$

In this equation, $ KE $ represents kinetic energy. The formula for kinetic energy itself is given by:

$$ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

where $ m $ denotes the mass of the object and $ v $ represents its velocity. Thus, when work is done on an object, it alters the object's velocity, leading to a change in its kinetic energy.

For instance, consider the scenario of pushing a stationary car. When you apply a force to move the car, you are performing work on it. This work results in an increase in the car's velocity and, consequently, its kinetic energy. On the other hand, if you engage the brakes, you are performing negative work, which slows the car down and reduces its kinetic energy.

Grasping this concept is fundamental in physics, as it elucidates how forces and energy interplay to affect the motion of objects. Whether a car accelerates on a highway or a ball is thrown, the work done on these objects directly influences their kinetic energy and, subsequently, their motion.
