Redshift plays a crucial role in our understanding of dark energy by demonstrating that the expansion of the universe is accelerating rather than merely continuing at a constant rate.

When we observe distant galaxies, we notice that their emitted light exhibits a redshift. This phenomenon indicates that the light waves are being stretched, causing them to appear redder than they would if the galaxies were stationary or moving toward us. The redshift occurs due to the galaxies moving away from us; intriguingly, the farther a galaxy is located, the faster it appears to be receding. This observation serves as a vital piece of evidence supporting the concept of an expanding universe.

In the late 1990s, astronomers investigating supernovae—exploding stars—in distant galaxies made an unexpected discovery. They observed that these supernovae appeared dimmer than anticipated, suggesting that they were actually farther away than previously believed. This finding indicated that the expansion of the universe was not merely ongoing but accelerating. Such acceleration could not be accounted for by the known forces and matter present in the universe, prompting scientists to propose the existence of a mysterious force termed dark energy.

Dark energy is estimated to comprise approximately $68\%$ of the universe and behaves like a form of anti-gravity, driving galaxies apart at an increasing rate. By examining the redshift of light from distant galaxies, scientists can gauge the rate of expansion of the universe at various epochs, thereby enhancing our understanding of dark energy's influence on this expansion.

In summary, redshift provides critical evidence that the universe's expansion is accelerating, which in turn supports the existence of dark energy. Through the analysis of the redshift in light from distant galaxies, scientists can glean insights into the nature and effects of dark energy, thereby deepening our comprehension of the fundamental forces that shape our universe.
