Increasing the temperature of a gas leads to an increase in its pressure, provided that the volume and the amount of gas remain constant.

When the temperature of a gas rises, the kinetic energy of its particles also increases. This results in the gas particles moving more rapidly and colliding with the walls of their container more frequently and with greater force. These collisions generate pressure on the container walls. Consequently, with more energetic collisions occurring at a higher frequency, the pressure of the gas increases.

This relationship between temperature and pressure is articulated by Gay-Lussac's Law. This law states that the pressure of a fixed amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, as long as the volume remains constant. Mathematically, this can be represented as 

$$
P \propto T 
$$ 

or 

$$
\frac{P}{T} = \text{constant} 
$$ 

where $ P $ denotes the pressure and $ T $ represents the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin.

For instance, consider a sealed container filled with gas that is heated. As the temperature increases, the gas particles inside the container gain energy and begin to move more quickly. This increased motion results in more frequent and forceful collisions with the container walls, thereby raising the pressure within the container. This phenomenon is why a balloon may burst when exposed to excessive heat; the internal pressure becomes too great for the balloon to withstand.

It is crucial to note that this relationship is valid only when the volume of the gas and the quantity of gas (i.e., the number of particles) remain constant. If the volume can change, such as in a flexible container, the gas may expand instead of increasing in pressure. Similarly, if gas is allowed to escape or if additional gas is introduced, the pressure will also change due to the alteration in the number of particles present.
