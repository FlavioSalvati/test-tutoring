The visible spectrum refers to the range of electromagnetic waves that the human eye can detect.

This spectrum encompasses light with wavelengths between approximately $400$ and $700$ nanometers (nm). Within this range, we can observe all the colors visible to us, starting from violet at the shortest wavelengths to red at the longest. When white light, such as sunlight, passes through a prism, it separates into its constituent colors, producing a rainbow effect. This phenomenon occurs because different wavelengths of light are refracted, or bent, by varying degrees as they traverse the prism.

Each color in the visible spectrum is associated with a specific wavelength. For instance, violet light has the shortest wavelength, around $400$ nm, while red light has the longest, approximately $700$ nm. The spectrum also includes blue, green, yellow, and orange light, each corresponding to its own defined range of wavelengths. The human eye contains specialized cells known as cones, which are sensitive to these different wavelengths, enabling us to perceive a broad array of colors.

It is important to note that the visible spectrum is merely a small segment of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. This broader spectrum includes other types of electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These other forms of electromagnetic radiation possess wavelengths that are either longer or shorter than those of visible light, rendering them undetectable by the human eye. Nevertheless, they serve various purposes in fields such as science, medicine, and technology.

Understanding the visible spectrum is crucial in numerous domains of physics and in our daily lives. For instance, it enhances our comprehension of color perception, the functionality of different light sources, and the design of technologies like cameras and optical instruments. By studying the visible spectrum, we also gain insights into the nature of light and its interactions with matter.
