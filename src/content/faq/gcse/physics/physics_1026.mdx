Momentum is closely linked to Newton's Third Law, which asserts that action and reaction forces lead to equal and opposite changes in momentum.

Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that when one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first object. When we analyze momentum—defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity—this law has profound implications.

Consider two ice skaters pushing off from each other. When Skater A exerts a force on Skater B, Skater B responds by exerting an equal force in the opposite direction. According to Newton's Third Law, these forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Consequently, both skaters will experience changes in their momentum. The momentum gained by Skater A will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the momentum gained by Skater B. This interaction ensures that the total momentum of the system (comprising both skaters) remains constant, provided that no external forces are acting on them.

More generally, Newton's Third Law guarantees the conservation of momentum in isolated systems. When two objects interact, the total momentum before the interaction must equal the total momentum after the interaction. This principle is essential for understanding collisions, whether they are elastic (where objects bounce off each other) or inelastic (where objects stick together). For instance, in a car crash, the momentum lost by one car is gained by another, ensuring that the total momentum of the system remains unchanged.

By grasping the relationship between momentum and Newton's Third Law, we can more effectively analyze and predict the outcomes of various physical interactions, ranging from everyday events to intricate scientific phenomena.
