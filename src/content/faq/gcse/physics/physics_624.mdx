Energy within a closed system can transition between various forms, but it is neither created nor destroyed. 

In such a system, the total energy remains constant, even as it shifts from one form to another. This concept is encapsulated in the principle of conservation of energy. For example, consider a pendulum: its energy continuously oscillates between kinetic energy (the energy of motion) and potential energy (the stored energy due to its position). At the highest point of its swing, the pendulum possesses maximum potential energy and minimal kinetic energy. As it descends, potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy, causing the pendulum to accelerate and move more rapidly.

Another illustrative example involves a sealed gas container. When the container is heated, thermal energy (heat) is imparted to the gas particles, resulting in an increase in their kinetic energy. This heightened energy causes the particles to move more vigorously and collide more frequently, thereby raising both the temperature and pressure inside the container. In this scenario, thermal energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the gas particles.

In the realm of electrical circuits, energy is transferred from a power source, such as a battery, to electrical energy, which subsequently powers devices like light bulbs or motors. This electrical energy can be transformed into various other forms of energy, including light energy, thermal energy, or mechanical energy, depending on the specific device being utilized.

Similarly, in chemical reactions occurring within a closed system, the chemical energy stored in molecular bonds is converted into different forms of energy. For instance, in a battery, the chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy, which can then be harnessed to power electronic devices.

Understanding these energy transformations is crucial for analyzing and predicting the behavior of various systems. This knowledge enables us to design more efficient machines and processes. It is important to remember that in a closed system, although the form of energy may change, the total amount of energy remains unchanged.
