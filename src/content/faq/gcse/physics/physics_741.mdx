The strength of an electric field is defined by the force that a unit positive charge experiences within that field.

To elaborate, the electric field strength, denoted as $E$, quantifies the force $F$ acting on a charge $q$ at a specific point in the field. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{F}{q}
$$

This equation indicates that when a small positive test charge is placed in the electric field, the strength of the electric field is equal to the force experienced by the charge divided by the magnitude of the charge itself.

Electric field strength is measured in newtons per coulomb (N/C). For instance, if a charge of $1 \, \text{C}$ experiences a force of $10 \, \text{N}$, the electric field strength at that location would be $10 \, \text{N/C}$.

An electric field can be produced by either a single charge or by a system of multiple charges. For a point charge, the strength of the electric field decreases with the square of the distance from the charge. This relationship is described by Coulomb's law, which states:

$$
E = \frac{k \cdot |Q|}{r^2}
$$

In this equation, $k$ represents Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2$), $Q$ is the charge generating the electric field, and $r$ is the distance from the charge.

In scenarios involving a uniform electric field, such as that created between two parallel plates with opposite charges, the electric field strength remains constant. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
E = \frac{V}{d}
$$

Here, $V$ denotes the potential difference between the plates, and $d$ is the separation distance between them.

Understanding electric field strength is essential in various fields of physics and engineering. It enables us to predict the movement of charges in different contexts, which is crucial for designing electrical circuits, comprehending electromagnetic waves, and much more.
