Elastic potential energy increases with the square of the extension.

When you stretch or compress an elastic object, such as a spring, it stores energy. This stored energy is referred to as elastic potential energy. The relationship between the extension (or compression) of the spring and the elastic potential energy is described by the formula:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$

In this equation, $ E $ represents the elastic potential energy, $ k $ is the spring constant (which measures the stiffness of the spring), and $ x $ denotes the extension or compression from the spring's natural length.

A crucial aspect of this formula is the $ x^2 $ term, indicating that the elastic potential energy is proportional to the square of the extension. This means that if you double the extension of the spring, the elastic potential energy increases by a factor of four, since $ 2^2 = 4 $. Similarly, if you triple the extension, the energy increases by a factor of nine, as $ 3^2 = 9 $.

This quadratic relationship is significant because it illustrates that even small increases in extension can lead to substantial increases in stored energy. For instance, stretching a spring just a little more can result in a considerable rise in the energy stored within it. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution when stretching or compressing springs and other elastic objects, as they can store considerable amounts of energy and release it suddenly.

In summary, the elastic potential energy stored in a spring or other elastic object increases with the square of the extension. This implies that even minor changes in extension can lead to significant variations in the amount of energy stored.
