Planets maintain their stable orbits due to the delicate balance between gravitational forces and their forward motion.

To elaborate, the gravitational pull exerted by the Sun is the primary force that keeps planets in their orbits. This gravitational force acts as a centripetal force, constantly pulling the planets toward the Sun. Simultaneously, the planets possess forward motion, which stems from the initial momentum they acquired during the formation of the solar system. This forward motion tends to propel the planets in a straight line away from the Sun.

The equilibrium between these two forces—the gravitational attraction and the planets' forward velocity—results in a stable orbit. If the gravitational force were to increase, the planet would spiral inward toward the Sun. Conversely, if the forward motion were to dominate, the planet would escape into space. The precise balance of these forces allows each planet to follow a curved trajectory around the Sun, which we refer to as an orbit.

The paths of these orbits are typically elliptical, meaning they are slightly oval rather than perfectly circular. This concept was first articulated by Johannes Kepler in his laws of planetary motion. Kepler's First Law states that planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun located at one of the two foci. Consequently, the distance between a planet and the Sun varies as the planet travels along its orbital path.

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation further elucidates this phenomenon. It asserts that every mass attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This law clarifies why the gravitational force diminishes as the distance between a planet and the Sun increases, explaining why planets travel faster when they are closer to the Sun and slower when they are farther away.

In summary, the stable orbits of planets arise from the intricate balance between the gravitational pull of the Sun and the planets' forward motion, all governed by fundamental laws of physics.
