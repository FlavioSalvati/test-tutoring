Atomic models have undergone significant evolution, transitioning from the idea of indivisible particles to complex structures composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons organized within specific regions.

The concept of the atom originated with ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Democritus, who theorized that matter was made up of tiny, indivisible particles called "atomos." This notion was primarily philosophical and lacked empirical support.

In the early $19^{th}$ century, John Dalton rejuvenated the concept of atoms through his atomic theory. Dalton proposed that atoms are solid spheres and that each element is composed of identical atoms. His model provided a framework to understand chemical reactions and the principle of conservation of mass.

As the $19^{th}$ century drew to a close, J.J. Thomson made a groundbreaking discovery by identifying the electron through his cathode ray experiments. He introduced the "plum pudding" model, which depicted the atom as a positively charged sphere embedded with negatively charged electrons, akin to plums within a pudding.

In $1911$, Ernest Rutherford conducted his renowned gold foil experiment, leading to the identification of the atomic nucleus. He proposed a new model in which the atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. This model revealed that a majority of the atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus, while the remainder of the atom is predominantly empty space.

Niels Bohr further refined Rutherford's model in $1913$ by introducing the concept of electron orbits. Bohr suggested that electrons move in fixed orbits around the nucleus, with each orbit corresponding to a specific energy level. This model successfully explained the emission spectra of hydrogen and introduced the notion of quantized energy levels.

The modern quantum mechanical model, developed in the $20^{th}$ century by scientists such as Schr√∂dinger and Heisenberg, describes electrons as existing in probability clouds or orbitals rather than following fixed paths. This model incorporates the principles of quantum mechanics, offering a more precise representation of atomic structure.

Throughout history, atomic models have become increasingly sophisticated, reflecting our deepening understanding of the fundamental nature of matter.
