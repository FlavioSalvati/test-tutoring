The Stefan-Boltzmann law describes the relationship between the temperature of a black body and the total energy it radiates per unit surface area. Specifically, this law states that the energy emitted is proportional to the fourth power of the body's absolute temperature.

More precisely, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is a fundamental concept in physics that elucidates how objects emit thermal radiation based on their temperature. A black body is an idealized physical entity that absorbs all incident radiation and re-emits it perfectly without any reflection. The law is mathematically represented as:

$$
E = \sigma T^4
$$

In this equation, $ E $ denotes the energy radiated per unit area, $ T $ is the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin, and $ \sigma $ (the Stefan-Boltzmann constant) has a value of approximately $ 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{W m}^{-2} \text{K}^{-4} $.

This relationship implies that if the temperature of a black body is doubled, the energy it radiates increases by a factor of 16, since $ 2^4 = 16 $. This principle helps clarify why hotter objects, such as stars, emit significantly more energy compared to cooler objects. For instance, the Sun, which has a surface temperature of about $5,500 \, \text{K}$, radiates vastly more energy than a human body, which has a surface temperature of approximately $310 \, \text{K}$.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law plays a vital role in various scientific disciplines, including astrophysics, climate science, and engineering. It enables scientists to analyze the energy output of stars, comprehend the Earth's radiation balance, and design efficient thermal systems. By understanding this law, we gain valuable insights into how temperature influences the radiation emitted by different objects, which is crucial for a wide array of practical applications and scientific investigations.
