The formula for calculating energy transfer using specific heat capacity is given by:

$$ Q = mc\Delta T $$

In this equation, $ Q $ represents the energy transferred, measured in joules (J). The variable $ m $ denotes the mass of the substance being heated or cooled, expressed in kilograms (kg). The specific heat capacity, symbolized by $ c $, is a characteristic property of the material, indicating the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of $ 1 \, \text{kg} $ of the substance by $ 1 \, \text{°C} $ or $ 1 \, \text{K} $. This property is measured in joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg°C). Lastly, $ \Delta T $ signifies the change in temperature, calculated as the difference between the final and initial temperatures, and is also measured in degrees Celsius (°C) or Kelvin (K).

To effectively use this formula, you must know three key values: the mass of the substance, its specific heat capacity, and the temperature change it experiences. For instance, consider a scenario where you have $ 2 \, \text{kg} $ of water, which has a specific heat capacity of $ 4,200 \, \text{J/kg°C} $, and you wish to heat it from $ 20 \, \text{°C} $ to $ 30 \, \text{°C} $. The energy transfer can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify the mass ($ m $): $ 2 \, \text{kg} $
2. Determine the specific heat capacity ($ c $): $ 4,200 \, \text{J/kg°C} $
3. Calculate the temperature change ($ \Delta T $): 
   $$ \Delta T = 30 \, \text{°C} - 20 \, \text{°C} = 10 \, \text{°C} $$

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

$$ Q = mc\Delta T $$
$$ Q = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 4,200 \, \text{J/kg°C} \times 10 \, \text{°C} $$
$$ Q = 84,000 \, \text{J} $$

Thus, a total of $ 84,000 \, \text{J} $ of energy is required to heat the $ 2 \, \text{kg} $ of water by $ 10 \, \text{°C} $. This formula is fundamental in understanding energy transfer during heating and cooling processes, and it aids in analyzing the efficiency of various materials in storing and transferring heat.
