To calculate the energy savings from insulation, you need to compare the energy consumption before and after the installation of the insulation.

When you insulate a building, you reduce the amount of heat that escapes during the winter and the amount of heat that enters during the summer. This reduction means that your heating and cooling systems do not have to work as hard, resulting in energy savings. To determine these savings, you must first gather data on energy consumption before and after insulation installation.

### Step 1: Measure Pre-Installation Energy Consumption

Begin by measuring the energy consumption over a specific period before adding insulation. You can achieve this by reviewing your energy bills, which typically display the amount of energy consumed each month. It is advisable to record this data over several months to obtain an average figure.

### Step 2: Install Insulation and Measure Post-Installation Energy Consumption

After the insulation has been installed, measure the energy consumption over the same period of time. Again, consult your energy bills to ascertain the monthly energy usage and calculate the average for this post-installation period.

### Step 3: Calculate Energy Savings

Once you have both averages, subtract the average energy consumption after insulation from the average energy consumption before insulation. The result will indicate the energy savings attributed to the insulation. For instance, if your average monthly energy consumption was $500 \, \text{kWh}$ before insulation and $300 \, \text{kWh}$ afterward, your energy savings would be:

$$
500 \, \text{kWh} - 300 \, \text{kWh} = 200 \, \text{kWh}
$$

### Step 4: Convert Energy Savings to Cost Savings

To translate these energy savings into cost savings, multiply the amount of energy saved by the cost per unit of energy (e.g., cost per kWh). For example, if your energy rate is $0.15 \, \text{pounds per kWh}$, then saving $200 \, \text{kWh}$ per month would result in:

$$
200 \, \text{kWh} \times 0.15 \, \text{pounds/kWh} = 30 \, \text{pounds}
$$

### Additional Considerations

It's important to note that the effectiveness of insulation can vary based on several factors, including the type of insulation used, the climate, and the condition of the building. Nonetheless, by following these steps, you can obtain a reliable estimate of both the energy and cost savings associated with adding insulation to your home.
