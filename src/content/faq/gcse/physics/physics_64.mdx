Electric field lines are used to visually represent the direction and strength of an electric field surrounding charges.

These lines originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges, illustrating the pathway that a positive test charge would follow. The density of the electric field lines indicates the strength of the electric field; specifically, lines that are closer together signify a stronger field. For a solitary positive charge, the lines radiate outward, while for a solitary negative charge, they converge inward.

When depicting electric field lines between two opposite charges, the lines begin at the positive charge and curve toward the negative charge. In contrast, when dealing with like charges, the lines repel each other, demonstrating the repulsive force between them. It is crucial to note that electric field lines never intersect.

In these diagrams, arrows along the lines indicate the direction of the electric field. The number of lines drawn is proportional to the magnitude of the charge; thus, a larger charge will have more lines extending from or converging toward it. This visual representation is instrumental in understanding how electric fields interact with charges and how forces are exerted within the field.
