To calculate the net force acting on an object, you need to sum all the individual forces while taking their directions into account.

The net force represents the total force exerted on an object when all contributing forces are combined. Since forces are vector quantities, they possess both magnitude (size) and direction. To determine the net force, it is essential to consider both of these characteristics. Begin by identifying all the forces acting on the object, which may include gravitational force, frictional force, applied force, normal force, and any other relevant forces.

After identifying all the forces, break them down into their components, typically along the x-axis and y-axis. For instance, if a force acts at an angle, you can apply trigonometric principles to calculate its horizontal and vertical components. Once all the forces are resolved into their components, sum the forces acting in the x-direction to find the net force in that direction, and do the same for the y-direction.

The net force in each direction can be calculated using the following formulas:

$$ F_{\text{net, x}} = \sum F_{\text{x}} $$

$$ F_{\text{net, y}} = \sum F_{\text{y}} $$

To find the overall net force, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to combine the net forces in the x and y directions:

$$ F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{(F_{\text{net, x}})^2 + (F_{\text{net, y}})^2} $$

It is also crucial to determine the direction of the net force. You can calculate this direction using trigonometry, specifically the tangent function:

$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{F_{\text{net, y}}}{F_{\text{net, x}}}\right) $$

By carefully analyzing all the forces and their respective directions, you will be able to accurately ascertain the net force acting on the object.
