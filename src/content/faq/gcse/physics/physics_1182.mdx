Gravity serves as the centripetal force that maintains the orbits of objects around larger celestial bodies, such as planets and stars.

To elaborate, gravity is the attractive force between two masses. According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, every mass attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

where $F$ is the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers. This principle implies that the closer two objects are to each other, and the greater their masses, the stronger the gravitational attraction between them.

When an object, such as a satellite, orbits a planet, it is effectively in a state of free fall towards the planet due to gravity. However, it also possesses a tangential velocity, which means it is moving sideways at a speed that allows it to continually miss the planet. This delicate balance between the gravitational pull and the object's tangential velocity results in a stable orbit. The object is perpetually drawn towards the planet, yet its lateral motion prevents it from colliding with the planet, creating a continuous curved trajectory around it.

For instance, the Moon orbits the Earth due to the gravitational force acting between the two bodies. The Moon's tangential velocity ensures that it does not spiral into the Earth; instead, it follows a nearly circular path. Similarly, the Earth orbits the Sun as a result of the Sun's gravitational pull, coupled with the Earth's tangential velocity.

In summary, gravity acts as the centripetal force that keeps objects on their orbital paths. Without gravity, these objects would travel in straight lines into space. Understanding this balance is essential for predicting and analyzing the motion of planets, moons, and artificial satellites within our solar system and beyond.
