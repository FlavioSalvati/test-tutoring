You can identify live, neutral, and earth wires by their respective colors: brown for live, blue for neutral, and green/yellow for earth.

In household electrical systems, each wire serves a specific purpose and is color-coded for easy identification. The live wire, which carries current to the appliance, is brown. It is essential to handle this wire with care, as it can cause electric shocks if touched while live. The neutral wire, colored blue, completes the circuit by returning current to the power source. The earth wire, which has a green and yellow striped pattern, acts as a safety feature. It provides a path for current to flow to the ground in the event of a fault, helping to prevent electric shocks.

When wiring a plug, for example, you would connect the brown live wire to the terminal marked 'L', the blue neutral wire to the terminal marked 'N', and the green/yellow earth wire to the terminal marked 'E' or the earth symbol. It is crucial to ensure that these connections are made correctly to avoid any electrical hazards.

In older wiring systems, you may encounter different color codes. For instance, the live wire could be red, the neutral wire black, and the earth wire green. Always double-check the wiring if you come across these older systems.

Using a multimeter can also assist in identifying the wires if the colors are unclear. By measuring the voltage between the wires, you can determine which is live (it will show a voltage relative to the earth), which is neutral (it will show little to no voltage relative to the earth), and which is earth (it will show continuity to the ground).

Understanding these fundamental concepts is vital for working safely with electrical systems and ensuring that appliances and circuits operate correctly.
