Charles's Law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature, provided the pressure remains constant.

Mathematically, Charles's Law can be expressed as:

$$ 
V \propto T 
$$ 

or 

$$ 
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} 
$$ 

where $ V $ represents the volume of the gas and $ T $ denotes its temperature in Kelvin. This relationship indicates that an increase in the temperature of a gas will result in an increase in its volume, assuming the pressure does not change. Conversely, a decrease in temperature will lead to a decrease in volume.

To illustrate this concept, consider a balloon filled with air. When you heat the balloon, the air particles inside gain energy and move more rapidly. This increased kinetic activity causes the particles to exert greater outward pressure, leading to an expansion of the balloon. Conversely, when the balloon is cooled, the particles lose energy and their movement slows down, which results in the balloon contracting.

It is crucial to note that temperature must be measured in Kelvin for Charles's Law to be applicable. The Kelvin scale begins at absolute zero, the temperature at which particles exhibit minimal thermal motion. To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, simply add $273.15$ to the Celsius value.

For instance, if a gas has a volume of $2$ liters at a temperature of $300 \, K$ and you wish to determine its volume at $350 \, K$, you can utilize the formula:

$$ 
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} 
$$ 

By substituting the known values, you have:

$$ 
\frac{2}{300} = \frac{V_2}{350} 
$$ 

Solving for $ V_2 $, you find that the new volume is approximately $2.33$ liters.

Understanding Charles's Law provides insight into everyday occurrences, such as why a football left outside on a cold day appears deflated. The lower temperature reduces the volume of the air inside the ball, making it look less inflated.
