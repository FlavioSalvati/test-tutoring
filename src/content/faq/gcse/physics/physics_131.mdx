Nuclear fusion generates significantly less radioactive waste compared to nuclear fission due to its reliance on lighter elements and the production of fewer long-lived isotopes.

In the process of nuclear fusion, light atomic nuclei, such as hydrogen isotopes (deuterium and tritium), come together to form a heavier nucleus, typically helium. This reaction releases an enormous amount of energy. The primary by-products of fusion include helium, which is a non-radioactive gas, and a small amount of neutron radiation. Although these neutrons can activate surrounding materials, leading to some radioactivity, the overall level and duration of this radioactivity are considerably lower than those associated with fission.

Conversely, nuclear fission involves the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, such as uranium or plutonium, into smaller fragments. This process also releases a substantial amount of energy, but it results in a wide range of radioactive isotopes as by-products. These fission products include isotopes like iodine-131, caesium-137, and strontium-90, which possess long half-lives and can be hazardous for thousands of years. Consequently, managing and storing this high-level radioactive waste presents a significant challenge.

The waste products from fusion are less problematic for several reasons. First, the primary fuel, deuterium, is abundant and non-radioactive. Second, tritium, while radioactive, has a relatively short half-life of approximately $12$ years. Additionally, the materials that become activated by neutron radiation in a fusion reactor can be selected to minimize long-term radioactivity, and their radioactivity typically decays to safe levels within just a few decades.

In summary, the fundamental difference between fusion and fission lies in the nature of the reactions and the materials involved. Fusion utilizes lighter elements and results in fewer and less hazardous radioactive by-products, making it a cleaner alternative to fission in terms of radioactive waste management.
