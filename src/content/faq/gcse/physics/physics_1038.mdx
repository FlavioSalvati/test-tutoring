Wavelength and frequency exhibit an inverse relationship; as one increases, the other decreases.

In the field of physics, wavelength and frequency are fundamental characteristics of waves, including both light and sound waves. The wavelength, denoted as $ \lambda $, is defined as the distance between two consecutive points on a wave that are in phase, such as the distance between two peaks or two troughs. In contrast, frequency, represented as $ f $, refers to the number of complete waves that pass a given point in one second, measured in hertz (Hz).

The relationship between wavelength $ \lambda $ and frequency $ f $ is articulated by the wave equation:

$$
v = f \times \lambda
$$

where $ v $ is the speed of the wave. For electromagnetic waves, such as light, the speed in a vacuum is constant at approximately $ 3 \times 10^8 $ meters per second (m/s). This constancy implies that if the frequency of a wave increases, the wavelength must decrease to maintain a constant wave speed, and vice versa.

For instance, visible light spans a range of wavelengths from about $ 400 \, \text{nm} $ to $ 700 \, \text{nm} $. Blue light, which has a shorter wavelength (approximately $ 400 \, \text{nm} $), consequently possesses a higher frequency compared to red light, which has a longer wavelength (around $ 700 \, \text{nm} $) and a lower frequency. This inverse relationship is key to understanding the distinct properties of different colors of light.

In terms of sound waves, the speed of sound in air is roughly $ 343 \, \text{m/s} $. For a sound wave with a high frequency, such as a high-pitched note, the wavelength will be shorter. Conversely, a low-frequency sound wave, like a bass note, will exhibit a longer wavelength.

Grasping the relationship between wavelength and frequency is essential for a variety of applications, from tuning musical instruments to designing communication systems. This understanding allows us to analyze how waves behave and interact with different media, enhancing our capacity to manipulate and utilize waves effectively in both technology and everyday life.
