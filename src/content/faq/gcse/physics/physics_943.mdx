Atmospheric pressure plays a significant role in determining the boiling points of liquids by influencing the temperature at which a liquid's vapor pressure matches the surrounding pressure.

When a liquid is heated, its molecules absorb energy and begin to move more rapidly. The boiling point of a liquid is defined as the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure surrounding it. At this critical temperature, vapor bubbles form within the liquid and rise to the surface, resulting in boiling.

At higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure decreases due to the reduced weight of the air above. Consequently, liquids boil at lower temperatures since their vapor pressure can more readily equal the diminished atmospheric pressure. For instance, at sea level where the atmospheric pressure is $1$ atmosphere (atm), water boils at $100^\circ C$. However, at higher elevations, such as on a mountaintop, water may boil at approximately $90^\circ C$ or even lower.

Conversely, when the atmospheric pressure is increased, such as in a pressure cooker, the boiling point of the liquid rises. This occurs because the liquid must achieve a higher temperature for its vapor pressure to equal the elevated surrounding pressure. In a pressure cooker, water can boil at temperatures significantly exceeding $100^\circ C$, which facilitates faster cooking of food.

Understanding the relationship between atmospheric pressure and boiling points is essential in various applications, ranging from culinary practices to industrial processes. For example, recognizing that water boils at lower temperatures at high altitudes helps in adjusting cooking times and methods. Similarly, industries utilize this principle to regulate boiling points for chemical reactions and distillation processes.

In summary, atmospheric pressure directly affects the boiling point of liquids by altering the temperature at which their vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure.
