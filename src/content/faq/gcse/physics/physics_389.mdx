Energy changes in heating curves are illustrated using sloped lines to depict temperature changes and flat lines to indicate phase changes.

In a typical heating curve, the x-axis represents time or the amount of heat added, while the y-axis represents temperature. As a substance is heated, its temperature rises, which is represented by a sloped line on the graph. The slope of this line indicates that the substance is absorbing energy, resulting in an increase in temperature. A steeper slope signifies a faster temperature increase for a given amount of heat added.

Conversely, during a phase change—such as melting or boiling—the temperature remains constant even though energy continues to be added. This is depicted by a flat, horizontal line on the heating curve. During these flat segments, the energy supplied is utilized to break intermolecular bonds instead of raising the temperature. For instance, when ice melts into water, the temperature remains at $0^\circ C$ until all the ice has transformed into water, despite the continuous application of heat.

The heating curve of water serves as a classic example. Starting from ice at a temperature below $0^\circ C$, the curve initially displays a sloped line as the ice warms up to $0^\circ C$. At this temperature, the line flattens as the ice melts into water. Once all the ice has melted, the temperature of the water begins to rise again, represented by another sloped line. When the water reaches $100^\circ C$, the line flattens once more as the water boils and converts into steam. After all the water has evaporated, any additional heating results in a sloped line again, as the temperature of the steam increases.

By analyzing these sloped and flat sections of the heating curve, one can gain insights into how energy is utilized either to elevate temperature or to facilitate a phase change in a substance.
