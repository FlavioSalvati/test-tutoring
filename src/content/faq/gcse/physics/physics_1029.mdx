Frequency and wavelength are inversely related; as one increases, the other decreases, assuming a constant wave speed.

In physics, frequency is defined as the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in one second, measured in hertz (Hz). Wavelength, on the other hand, is the distance between consecutive crests (or troughs) of a wave, measured in meters (m). The relationship between frequency $ f $ and wavelength $ \lambda $ is expressed by the wave equation:

$$ 
v = f \times \lambda 
$$

where $ v $ represents the wave speed. For electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, this speed is the speed of light, which is approximately $ 3 \times 10^8 $ meters per second (m/s).

To clarify this relationship, consider a wave traveling at a constant speed. If the frequency of the wave increases—indicating that more waves are passing a point each second—the distance between each wave (the wavelength) must decrease in order to accommodate more waves within the same space. Conversely, if the frequency decreases, the wavelength increases because fewer waves are passing by per second, allowing them to be spaced further apart.

This inverse relationship is vital in various fields of physics and technology. For instance, in radio communications, different frequencies are utilized to transmit distinct channels. Higher frequency waves possess shorter wavelengths and can convey more information but may not propagate as far. In contrast, lower frequency waves have longer wavelengths, can travel longer distances, but carry less information.

Understanding the interaction between frequency and wavelength is also essential for analyzing the behavior of various types of waves, including sound waves, light waves, and water waves. For example, in sound waves, higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds, while lower frequencies relate to lower-pitched sounds. In the case of light waves, different frequencies (or wavelengths) correspond to various colors of light.

By mastering this fundamental concept, you will gain a deeper insight into how waves interact with the environment and how they are applied across multiple technologies.
