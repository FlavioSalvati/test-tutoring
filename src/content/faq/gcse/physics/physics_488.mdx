To identify the input and output forces in a lever system, it is essential to locate where the effort and load are applied.

In a lever, the input force refers to the effort you exert to move the lever, while the output force is the force that the lever applies to lift or move the load. To determine these forces, start by identifying the three key components of the lever: the fulcrum (the pivot point), the effort (the point where you apply force), and the load (the object you wish to move).

For instance, consider a seesaw. The fulcrum is located at the central pivot. When you push down on one end of the seesaw, that point is where the input force (effort) is applied. Conversely, the other end, which rises, is where the output force acts on the load.

In the case of a wheelbarrow, the wheel serves as the fulcrum. When you lift the handles, you are applying the input force. The load located in the wheelbarrow's bucket is moved by the output force generated by the lever.

To analyze these forces effectively, it is crucial to understand the type of lever you are working with. There are three distinct classes of levers:

1. **First-Class Lever**: The fulcrum is positioned between the effort and the load (e.g., seesaw, crowbar).
2. **Second-Class Lever**: The load is located between the fulcrum and the effort (e.g., wheelbarrow, nutcracker).
3. **Third-Class Lever**: The effort is situated between the fulcrum and the load (e.g., tweezers, fishing rod).

By identifying the positions of the fulcrum, effort, and load, you can easily ascertain the input and output forces in any lever system.
