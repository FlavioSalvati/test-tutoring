Redshift serves as a crucial indicator of the expanding universe, enabling scientists to estimate its age by measuring the rate of this expansion.

Redshift occurs when light emitted from distant galaxies shifts towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon results from these galaxies moving away from us, causing the light waves to stretch and appear redder. The first observations of redshift were made by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s, leading to the groundbreaking realization that the universe is indeed expanding.

By analyzing the redshift of light from various galaxies, scientists can determine the speed at which these galaxies are receding from us. This rate of expansion is quantified by the Hubble constant, which allows astronomers to calculate the time it has taken for the universe to reach its current size. Consequently, this provides an estimate of the universe's age.

To visualize this concept, imagine the universe as a balloon with dots on its surface representing galaxies. As the balloon inflates, the dots move away from each other. The greater the distance between the dots, the faster they recede from one another. By measuring the velocity at which the dots (galaxies) are separating, we can infer how long the balloon (universe) has been expanding.

Using redshift data, scientists have estimated the age of the universe to be approximately $13.8$ billion years. This estimation is derived by calculating the time it would take for galaxies to move from a common origin to their current positions, given the observed rates of expansion. This method, when combined with other observations—such as the cosmic microwave background radiation—provides a more comprehensive understanding of the universe's age.
