Recent observations have confirmed that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, as demonstrated by redshift measurements.

Redshift occurs when the light emitted from distant galaxies shifts towards the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon arises because these galaxies are moving away from us, which stretches the light waves and causes them to appear redder. The concept of redshift was first articulated by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s, leading to the revolutionary discovery that the universe is indeed expanding.

Contemporary observations utilizing advanced telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the more recent James Webb Space Telescope, have yielded even more accurate measurements of redshift. These studies have revealed not only that the universe is expanding, but also that the rate of this expansion is increasing. This finding was unexpected, as it was initially anticipated that gravitational forces would cause the expansion to slow over time.

Scientists attribute this accelerated expansion to a mysterious force known as dark energy, which constitutes approximately $68\%$ of the total energy density of the universe. While dark energy remains poorly understood, it appears to be driving galaxies apart at an accelerating pace. By analyzing redshift data, astronomers can estimate the rate of expansion, referred to as the Hubble constant. However, there is ongoing debate within the scientific community regarding the precise value of the Hubble constant, as different measurement techniques have produced slightly varying results.

In summary, redshift measurements serve as an essential tool for understanding the expanding universe. They provide compelling evidence that not only is the universe expanding, but it is doing so at an accelerating rate, propelled by the enigmatic force of dark energy.
