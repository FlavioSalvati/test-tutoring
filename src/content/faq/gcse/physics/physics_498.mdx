Velocity represents the speed of an object in a specific direction, while acceleration refers to the rate at which that velocity changes over time.

To clarify these concepts, let's break them down further. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it possesses both magnitude (the speed or how fast an object is moving) and direction (the path along which it is moving). For instance, if a car is traveling north at a speed of $60$ miles per hour, we express its velocity as $60 \text{ mph north}$. If the car alters its direction while maintaining the same speed, its velocity changes due to the change in direction.

Conversely, acceleration is also a vector quantity, but it describes how an object's velocity changes over time. When the aforementioned car speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it is said to be accelerating. Acceleration can be positive (indicating an increase in speed), negative (indicating a decrease in speed, which is also referred to as deceleration), or zero if the velocity remains constant.

Mathematically, velocity ($v$) is defined as the change in displacement ($\Delta s$) divided by the time interval ($t$):

$$
v = \frac{\Delta s}{t}
$$

Similarly, acceleration ($a$) is defined as the change in velocity ($\Delta v$) over the same time interval ($t$):

$$
a = \frac{\Delta v}{t}
$$

Consider the scenario of riding a bicycle. If you pedal faster, increasing your speed from $5 \, \text{m/s}$ to $10 \, \text{m/s}$ in $5 \, \text{s}$, your acceleration can be calculated as follows:

$$
a = \frac{10 \, \text{m/s} - 5 \, \text{m/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = 1 \, \text{m/s}^2
$$

If you then descend a hill and your speed increases further, your acceleration will change accordingly.

In summary, velocity informs you of how fast and in which direction you are moving, while acceleration indicates how your velocity changes over time. Grasping these concepts is essential for analyzing motion within the realm of physics.
