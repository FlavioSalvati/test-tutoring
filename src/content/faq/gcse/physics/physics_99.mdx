The ratio of protons to neutrons plays a crucial role in determining the stability of an isotope.

To elaborate, the stability of an isotope is significantly influenced by the ratio of protons to neutrons within its nucleus. Protons are positively charged particles, while neutrons are neutral. Both types of particles reside in the nucleus of an atom. The strong nuclear force binds the nucleus together, counteracting the repulsive forces that arise between the positively charged protons. Neutrons contribute to nuclear stability by providing attractive forces without introducing additional repulsion, given their neutral charge.

In lighter elements, a roughly equal number of protons and neutrons typically leads to a stable nucleus. For instance, carbon-12, which contains $6$ protons and $6$ neutrons, is stable. However, as elements increase in mass, a greater number of neutrons is required to mitigate the growing repulsive forces due to the larger number of protons. This explains why heavier elements, such as uranium-238, which comprises $92$ protons and $146$ neutrons, have a higher neutron-to-proton ratio.

When the proton-neutron ratio deviates significantly from the ideal range, the isotope becomes unstable and may undergo radioactive decay in an attempt to achieve a more stable configuration. This decay process can involve the emission of alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays, depending on the specific type of instability present. For example, carbon-14, which has $6$ protons and $8$ neutrons, is unstable and undergoes beta decay to transform into nitrogen-14.

Understanding the proton-neutron ratio is essential in fields such as nuclear physics and chemistry, as it aids scientists in predicting the behavior of various isotopes, along with their potential applications or risks. For GCSE Physics students, grasping this concept is fundamental to comprehending why certain elements are radioactive and how nuclear reactions occur.
