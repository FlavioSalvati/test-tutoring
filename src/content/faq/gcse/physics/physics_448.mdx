To calculate the weight of an object, you multiply its mass by the strength of the gravitational field. This relationship can be expressed with the formula:

$$ 
\text{Weight} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Gravitational Field Strength} 
$$

In this equation, weight is measured in newtons (N), mass is measured in kilograms (kg), and gravitational field strength is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg). On Earth, the average gravitational field strength is approximately $9.8 \, \text{N/kg}$; however, this value can vary slightly depending on your specific location.

For instance, if you have an object with a mass of $10 \, \text{kg}$, you can calculate its weight using the following calculation:

$$ 
\text{Weight} = 10 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{N/kg} = 98 \, \text{N} 
$$

This indicates that the object has a weight of $98 \, \text{N}$ when measured on Earth. 

If we consider the same object on the Moon, where the gravitational field strength is about $1.6 \, \text{N/kg}$, its weight would be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\text{Weight} = 10 \, \text{kg} \times 1.6 \, \text{N/kg} = 16 \, \text{N} 
$$

This example illustrates that weight is dependent on both the mass of the object and the gravitational field strength of the environment. It is important to note that mass is a measure of the amount of matter contained in an object and remains constant regardless of location. In contrast, weight is the force exerted by gravity on that mass and can vary based on where the object is in the universe.
