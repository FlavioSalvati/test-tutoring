Black body radiation refers to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an idealized object that perfectly absorbs all incident radiation.

A black body is a theoretical construct that acts as both a perfect absorber and emitter of electromagnetic radiation across all wavelengths. When a black body is heated, it emits radiation across a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. The distribution of this emitted radiation is determined solely by the temperature of the black body. This concept is fundamental for understanding the processes by which objects absorb and emit energy.

The radiation produced by a black body is termed black body radiation, and it adheres to a specific distribution described by Planck's law. As the temperature of the black body increases, the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation shifts towards shorter wavelengths. This indicates that hotter objects emit more radiation at higher frequencies. For instance, a red-hot object primarily emits radiation in the infrared and visible red region of the spectrum, whereas a white-hot object emits radiation across the entire visible spectrum, appearing white to the human eye.

The exploration of black body radiation led to significant advancements in physics, including the emergence of quantum mechanics. Classical physics struggled to explain the observed spectrum of black body radiation, culminating in the phenomenon known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe." Max Planck addressed this issue by proposing that energy is quantized, meaning it can only be emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts called quanta. This groundbreaking idea laid the foundation for modern quantum theory.

Understanding black body radiation is vital across various disciplines, including astrophysics, where it enables scientists to determine the temperature and characteristics of stars and other celestial bodies. Additionally, it has practical applications in the development of thermal cameras and the enhancement of heating and lighting systems.
