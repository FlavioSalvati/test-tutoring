Changing magnetic fields generate an electric field, which in turn drives a current in a conductor.

When the magnetic field surrounding a conductor varies, it leads to a change in the magnetic flux through that conductor. Magnetic flux quantifies the number of magnetic field lines that pass through a specific area. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction states that a change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) or potential difference in the conductor. This principle underlies the operation of generators and transformers.

Faraday's Law asserts that the induced EMF in a circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit. This relationship can be mathematically represented as:

$$
\text{EMF} = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}
$$

In this expression, $\Phi$ denotes the magnetic flux, and $t$ signifies time. The negative sign indicates the direction of the induced EMF, in accordance with Lenz's Law, which states that the induced EMF will always oppose the change in magnetic flux that produced it.

Consider a scenario with a coil of wire and a magnet. When you move the magnet closer to the coil, the magnetic field through the coil changes, leading to an increase in magnetic flux. This alteration induces a potential difference across the terminals of the coil, resulting in a current flow if the circuit is closed. Conversely, if you pull the magnet away, the magnetic flux decreases, inducing a potential difference in the opposite direction.

This phenomenon is essential in various applications. For instance, in power stations, large generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy by rotating coils within magnetic fields, which continuously change the magnetic flux and induce a current. Similarly, transformers utilize changing magnetic fields to transfer electrical energy between circuits, enabling efficient electricity transmission over long distances.
