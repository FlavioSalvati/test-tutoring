You can determine the radiation emitted by a black body using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, expressed as:

$$
P = \sigma A T^4
$$

A black body is an idealized object that perfectly absorbs all incident radiation and re-emits it without any loss. The Stefan-Boltzmann law provides a way to calculate the power radiated by such a body. In the formula, $ P $ represents the total power emitted, $ \sigma $ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which has a value of $ 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{W m}^{-2} \text{K}^{-4} $, $ A $ denotes the surface area of the black body, and $ T $ indicates the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin.

To apply this formula, you first need to ascertain the temperature of the black body. For instance, if you have a black body at a temperature of $300 \, \text{K}$, you can substitute this value into the equation. The surface area $ A $ will depend on the shape and dimensions of the object. For a spherical black body, the surface area can be calculated using the formula:

$$
A = 4 \pi r^2
$$

where $ r $ is the radius of the sphere.

Let’s consider a black body sphere with a radius of $0.5 \, \text{m}$ at a temperature of $300 \, \text{K}$. First, we calculate the surface area:

$$
A = 4 \pi (0.5)^2 = 4 \pi \times 0.25 = \pi \, \text{m}^2
$$

Next, we will use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find the power emitted:

$$
P = \sigma A T^4 = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \times \pi \times (300)^4
$$

Now, let’s compute $ (300)^4 $:

$$
300^4 = 8.1 \times 10^9
$$

Finally, we multiply all the components together to find the total power:

$$
P = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \times \pi \times 8.1 \times 10^9 \approx 1445 \, \text{W}
$$

Thus, the black body sphere emits approximately $1445 \, \text{W}$ of power. This method allows you to analyze the energy radiated by a black body based on its temperature and surface area.
