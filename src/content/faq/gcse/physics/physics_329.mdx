A parallel circuit provides multiple pathways for electric current to flow, with components connected across common nodes.

In a parallel circuit, each component is directly connected to the power supply, forming several branches. As a result, the voltage across each component is equal to the supply voltage. Therefore, if you were to measure the voltage across any component in a parallel circuit, you would find it to be identical to the voltage of the power source.

A defining feature of a parallel circuit is that the total current flowing from the power source is the sum of the currents in each individual branch. Since the current can travel through multiple paths, it divides among the branches based on the resistance of each one. For instance, if there are three resistors connected in parallel, the total current can be expressed as:

$$
I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3
$$

where $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ are the currents through each resistor.

Another distinguishing aspect of a parallel circuit is the way the components are interconnected. Each component connects to the same two points, resulting in a network of branches. This contrasts with a series circuit, where components are arranged end-to-end in a single linear path.

Importantly, if one component in a parallel circuit fails or is disconnected, the remaining components will continue to operate normally. This is due to each component having its own direct connection to the power source. This feature makes parallel circuits especially advantageous in household wiring, where it is essential for lights and appliances to function independently.

In summary, a parallel circuit is characterized by multiple current paths, equal voltage across its components, and the total current being the sum of the currents in each branch. Understanding these characteristics will enable you to analyze and work with parallel circuits more effectively.
