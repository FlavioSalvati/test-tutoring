The formula for current in a series circuit is given by 

$$ I = \frac{V}{R} $$

In a series circuit, the current ($I$) remains constant at every point along the circuit. This uniformity occurs because there is only one pathway for the current to travel. The equation $I = \frac{V}{R}$ is derived from Ohm's Law, where $V$ denotes the total voltage supplied by the power source, and $R$ represents the total resistance of the circuit.

To clarify this concept further, letâ€™s break it down. Voltage ($V$) is the electrical potential difference between two points in the circuit and is provided by the power source, such as a battery. Resistance ($R$) is the opposition to the flow of current, measured in ohms ($\Omega$). In a series circuit, the total resistance is simply the sum of the individual resistances of all components connected in series.

For instance, consider a series circuit powered by a $9V$ battery with three resistors having resistances of $2\Omega$, $3\Omega$, and $4\Omega$. The total resistance ($R$) can be calculated as follows:

$$ R = 2\Omega + 3\Omega + 4\Omega = 9\Omega $$

Using the formula $I = \frac{V}{R}$, we can determine the current ($I$):

$$ I = \frac{9V}{9\Omega} = 1A $$

It is crucial to note that in a series circuit, if one component fails or is disconnected, the entire circuit becomes open, and current ceases to flow. This behavior is distinct from a parallel circuit, where multiple pathways allow the current to continue flowing even if one path is interrupted.

Grasping the formula for current in a series circuit is essential for analyzing and predicting the circuit's behavior under various conditions. This knowledge is a fundamental skill in GCSE Physics and aids in understanding the principles of electrical circuits.
