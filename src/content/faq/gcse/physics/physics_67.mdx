Density is defined as the measure of mass per unit volume of a substance.

In more detail, density is a fundamental property of matter that provides insight into how much mass is concentrated within a specific volume. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$ 
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} 
$$

The most commonly used units for density are kilograms per cubic meter ($\text{kg/m}^3$) and grams per cubic centimeter ($\text{g/cm}^3$). For instance, the density of water is approximately $1 \text{ g/cm}^3$, indicating that $1 \text{ cm}^3$ of water has a mass of $1 \text{ g}$.

Understanding density is essential for a variety of scientific and practical applications. For example, it allows us to predict whether an object will float or sink when placed in a fluid. Objects with a density lower than that of the fluid will float, while those with a higher density will sink. This principle explains why ice floats on water. Similarly, ships, despite being constructed from dense materials like steel, can float because their overall density—including the air inside—is less than that of water.

In GCSE Physics, you may encounter problems requiring the calculation of an object's density based on its mass and volume. For example, consider a metal block with a mass of $200 \text{ g}$ and a volume of $50 \text{ cm}^3$. You can determine its density by dividing the mass by the volume:

$$ 
\text{Density} = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{50 \text{ cm}^3} = 4 \text{ g/cm}^3 
$$

This calculation reveals that the metal block has a density of $4 \text{ g/cm}^3$.

Density also influences the behavior of gases and liquids under varying conditions, such as changes in temperature and pressure. By studying density, we can gain valuable insights into the composition and properties of different materials, which is crucial in fields ranging from engineering to environmental science.
