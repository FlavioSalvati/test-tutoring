The formula for calculating potential difference is given by:

$$ V = I \times R $$

where:
- \( V \) is the potential difference (voltage) measured in volts (V),
- \( I \) is the current measured in amperes (A),
- \( R \) is the resistance measured in ohms (Ω).

Potential difference, commonly referred to as voltage, quantifies the work required to move a charge between two points in an electric circuit. This relationship is derived from Ohm's Law, which states that the current (\( I \)) flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference (\( V \)) across those points and inversely proportional to the resistance (\( R \)) of the conductor.

To effectively use this formula, you need to know at least two of the three variables: current, resistance, and potential difference. For instance, if you know the current flowing through a resistor and the resistor's resistance, you can easily calculate the potential difference across it.

Consider a scenario where a circuit has a current of \( 2 \, \text{A} \) flowing through a resistor with a resistance of \( 5 \, \Omega \). You can calculate the potential difference as follows:

$$ V = I \times R $$
$$ V = 2 \, \text{A} \times 5 \, \Omega $$
$$ V = 10 \, \text{V} $$

This result indicates that the potential difference across the resistor is \( 10 \, \text{V} \). Understanding this relationship is essential for analyzing and designing electrical circuits, as it enables you to determine the necessary voltage to achieve a desired current flow through a specific resistance.
