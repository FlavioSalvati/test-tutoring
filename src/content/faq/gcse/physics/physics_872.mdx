Equilibrium in a free-body diagram is characterized by the condition that all forces acting on an object balance each other out, resulting in a net force of zero.

In the context of a free-body diagram, equilibrium indicates that the object is either stationary or moving with a constant velocity. To demonstrate this state, it is essential to ensure that the vector sum of all forces acting on the object is equal to zero. This can be illustrated by drawing arrows that represent each force, where the length of each arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the force, and the arrows point in the appropriate directions.

For instance, consider a book resting on a table. In this scenario, you would depict an arrow pointing downwards to represent the gravitational force (weight) acting on the book, and another arrow pointing upwards to represent the normal force exerted by the table. These two arrows should be of equal length, signifying that they cancel each other out, thereby indicating that the book is in equilibrium.

In more complex situations, such as an object positioned on an inclined plane, it is necessary to account for additional forces like friction and the component of the gravitational force acting parallel to the plane. For the object to remain in equilibrium, the total of all these forces must again equal zero. This implies that the vector sum of the forces must be zero in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

To verify equilibrium, you can apply the principle of resolving forces. This involves decomposing the forces into their horizontal and vertical components and ensuring that the sum of the forces in each direction equals zero. For example, if an object is suspended by two ropes, you would resolve the tension forces in the ropes into their horizontal and vertical components, confirming that these components effectively counterbalance the weight of the object.

By meticulously analyzing and balancing all the forces depicted in a free-body diagram, you can accurately represent and comprehend the conditions necessary for equilibrium.
