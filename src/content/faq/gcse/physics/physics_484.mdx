The gear ratio plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical advantage of a gear system by comparing the number of teeth on the driving and driven gears.

To elaborate, the gear ratio quantifies the relationship between the number of teeth on two meshing gears. It is calculated by dividing the number of teeth on the driven gear (the gear being turned) by the number of teeth on the driving gear (the gear providing the input motion). For instance, if the driving gear has $10$ teeth and the driven gear has $20$ teeth, the gear ratio can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Gear Ratio} = \frac{\text{Teeth on Driven Gear}}{\text{Teeth on Driving Gear}} = \frac{20}{10} = 2:1.
$$

Mechanical advantage, in contrast, indicates the extent to which a machine amplifies the input force. In the context of gears, it reflects how much easier it is to rotate the driven gear compared to the driving gear. A higher gear ratio corresponds to a greater mechanical advantage, facilitating the turning of the driven gear but resulting in a decrease in speed. Conversely, a lower gear ratio indicates less mechanical advantage, making it more challenging to turn the driven gear while enabling it to rotate more quickly.

For example, with a gear ratio of $2:1$, the driving gear must complete two full rotations to turn the driven gear once. This configuration allows the driven gear to turn more slowly but with increased force. Such arrangements are particularly beneficial in applications like bicycles, where lower gears (indicating higher mechanical advantage) make pedaling uphill easier, while higher gears (indicating lower mechanical advantage) enable faster speeds on level ground.

Understanding the interplay between gear ratio and mechanical advantage is essential for designing systems that require specific force and speed characteristics, as seen in vehicles, machinery, and even simple tools like can openers.
