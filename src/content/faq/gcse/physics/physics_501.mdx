Terminal velocity is influenced by several factors, including an object's mass, surface area, shape, and the density of the fluid it traverses.

When an object falls through a fluid, such as air or water, it initially accelerates due to the force of gravity. As the object's speed increases, the drag force exerted by the fluid also rises. Eventually, this drag force becomes equal to the gravitational force acting on the object, at which point the object ceases to accelerate and attains a constant speed known as terminal velocity.

The mass of the object is a critical factor in determining terminal velocity. Heavier objects experience a greater gravitational force, requiring a correspondingly larger drag force to achieve equilibrium. This results in a higher terminal velocity for more massive objects. For instance, a heavy rock will fall faster than a feather because the rock's greater mass necessitates a higher speed to generate enough drag force to counterbalance its weight.

Surface area and shape are equally significant in this context. A larger surface area increases the drag force, which in turn reduces terminal velocity. This principle explains why a parachute effectively slows down a skydiver; the parachute's extensive surface area creates substantial air resistance. Additionally, the shape of the object influences how efficiently it moves through the fluid. Streamlined shapes, such as those of birds diving or racing cars, minimize drag and enhance terminal velocity. In contrast, irregular or flat shapes generate more drag, resulting in a lower terminal velocity.

Lastly, the density of the fluid plays a vital role in determining terminal velocity. In denser fluids, such as water, objects encounter greater resistance than in less dense fluids like air. Consequently, an object will achieve a lower terminal velocity in water compared to air. For example, a coin will descend much more slowly in water than in air due to the increased resistance from the denser fluid.
