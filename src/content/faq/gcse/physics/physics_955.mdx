A distance-time graph effectively illustrates how the distance traveled by an object varies over time.

In such a graph, the horizontal axis (the $x$-axis) typically represents time, while the vertical axis (the $y$-axis) represents distance. By plotting various points on this graph, one can visualize the motion of an object. If the object is stationary, the graph will display a horizontal line, indicating that the distance remains constant over time. Conversely, if the object is moving at a constant speed, the graph will be represented by a straight, diagonal line. The steeper the line, the faster the object is moving.

To analyze the graph in more detail, consider the slope or gradient of the line. The gradient of a distance-time graph indicates the speed of the object. A steeper gradient corresponds to a higher speed, while a shallower gradient signifies a lower speed. If the line curves, it suggests that the object's speed is changing. A curve that becomes steeper over time indicates acceleration, whereas a curve that flattens out indicates deceleration.

For instance, if you observe a straight line sloping upwards from left to right, it indicates that the object is moving at a constant speed. If the line is horizontal, the object is stationary. An upward curve signifies that the object is accelerating, while a downward curve indicates that the object is decelerating.

Grasping the concept of distance-time graphs is essential for interpreting motion in physics. These graphs provide a clear and visual representation of how an object's position changes over time, facilitating the understanding of concepts such as speed, velocity, and acceleration. By practicing the skills of reading and interpreting these graphs, you will enhance your understanding of the fundamental principles of motion.
