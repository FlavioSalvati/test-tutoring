The redshift of light emitted by distant galaxies results from the expansion of the universe.

When we observe light from these far-off galaxies, we find that it appears to be shifted toward the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This phenomenon is referred to as redshift. The primary cause of this redshift is the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the light waves traveling through it are stretched, leading to an increase in their wavelength. Since red light has a longer wavelength than blue light, this stretching effect causes the observed light to shift toward the red spectrum.

To conceptualize this, think of the universe as a balloon with galaxies positioned on its surface. As the balloon inflates, the surface stretches, and the galaxies move further apart. In a similar manner, the space between galaxies is expanding, which stretches the light waves as they traverse this expanding space. This elongation of light waves is what we observe as redshift.

Redshift serves as a vital piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe originated from an extremely hot and dense state and has been expanding ever since. By measuring the redshift of light from various galaxies, astronomers can determine the rate at which these galaxies are receding from us. This information is crucial for understanding the rate of the universe's expansion and provides valuable insights into its age and future trajectory.

In conclusion, the redshift of light from distant galaxies is a direct consequence of the ongoing expansion of the universe, which stretches light waves and shifts them toward the red end of the spectrum. This phenomenon is a fundamental observation that underpins our current understanding of cosmology and the history of the universe.
