Gas particles exert pressure on the walls of their container by colliding with them and transferring momentum during these interactions.

In a gas, particles are in perpetual, random motion, moving in all directions and at various speeds. When these particles collide with the walls of their container, they apply a force on the walls. This force, distributed across the surface area of the walls, generates pressure. The frequency and intensity of these collisions directly influence the magnitude of the pressure exerted.

To illustrate this concept, consider a single gas particle approaching a wall. Upon impact, the particle bounces back, resulting in a change in its direction. This alteration signifies a change in momentum. According to Newton's third law of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, when the particle experiences a change in momentum, it exerts an equal and opposite force on the wall.

Now, envision a gas composed of an immense number of particles, all continuously moving and colliding with the walls of the container. Each individual collision imparts a small amount of force; however, due to the sheer volume of collisions occurring incessantly, the cumulative effect results in a measurable pressure.

Several factors can influence the pressure of a gas. For instance, increasing the temperature of the gas provides the particles with more energy, causing them to move more rapidly. As a result, these faster-moving particles collide with the walls more frequently and with greater force, thereby increasing the pressure. Likewise, if the volume of the container is decreased, the particles have less space to navigate, leading to more frequent collisions and an increase in pressure.

In summary, gas pressure arises from the countless collisions of gas particles with the walls of their container, with each collision transferring momentum and exerting force.
