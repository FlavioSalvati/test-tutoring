A series circuit consists of components connected end-to-end, creating a single pathway for current to flow.

In a series circuit, the current that passes through each component remains constant throughout the circuit. This is due to the fact that there is only one path available for the current to traverse. Consequently, if you measure the current at any point within the circuit, you will find the same value everywhere. This uniformity is a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes series circuits from parallel circuits, where the current can diverge and follow multiple paths.

Another significant feature of series circuits is that the total voltage across the entire circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltage drops across each component. For example, if you have three resistors connected in series and you know the voltage drop across each resistor, you can calculate the total voltage supplied by the power source by simply adding these voltages together. This relationship is articulated by Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, which states that the algebraic sum of all electrical potential differences around any closed loop in a circuit must equal zero.

Regarding resistance, the total or equivalent resistance of a series circuit is the cumulative sum of the resistances of each component. As a result, adding more resistors in series will lead to an increase in the overall resistance of the circuit. For instance, if you have three resistors with resistances of $2 \, \Omega$, $3 \, \Omega$, and $5 \, \Omega$, the total resistance in the series circuit would be:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = 2 \, \Omega + 3 \, \Omega + 5 \, \Omega = 10 \, \Omega
$$

However, one potential drawback of series circuits is that if any single component fails or becomes disconnected, the entire circuit is disrupted, and current will cease to flow. This is because the interruption of the single pathway for current results in an open circuit. Consequently, this characteristic renders series circuits less reliable for applications where uninterrupted operation is essential, such as in household wiring.

In summary, comprehending the characteristics of series circuits is crucial for analyzing and designing electrical systems, particularly when evaluating how current, voltage, and resistance interact within the circuit.
