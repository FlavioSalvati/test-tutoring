As altitude increases, the pressure of the gas decreases due to a reduced number of air molecules exerting force at higher elevations.

When you ascend, such as when climbing a mountain or flying in an airplane, the surrounding air pressure diminishes. This phenomenon occurs because the Earth's atmosphere is densest at sea level, where the weight of all the air above compresses the air molecules, resulting in a higher concentration. As you rise, there are fewer air molecules above you, leading to a decrease in the weight of the air and consequently a reduction in pressure.

You can visualize this concept using the analogy of a stack of books. The book at the bottom of the stack must support the weight of all the books above it, experiencing significant pressure. In contrast, the book at the top only needs to support its own weight, resulting in much less pressure. Similarly, at greater altitudes, the "stack" of air molecules is shorter, leading to lower air pressure.

The relationship between altitude and pressure can be described by the barometric formula, which illustrates that pressure decreases exponentially with height. Specifically, for every increase of approximately $5.5$ kilometers in altitude, the air pressure roughly halves. This is why mountaineers often require supplemental oxygen when climbing extremely high peaks, such as Mount Everest; at such altitudes, the air pressure is so low that there is insufficient oxygen for comfortable breathing.

Furthermore, the lower air pressure at high altitudes results in less dense air. This reduction in air density can have various effects, including on the flight of airplanes and the physiological function of your body. For instance, with diminished oxygen availability, your body must exert more effort to obtain the oxygen it requires, which is why you may feel out of breath more quickly at higher elevations.

Understanding how altitude influences gas pressure is essential in several fields, including aviation, meteorology, and sports science. Athletes, for example, often train at high altitudes to enhance their performance.
