The angle of reflection is defined as the angle between the reflected ray and the normal to the surface.

To elaborate, when a light ray strikes a reflective surface, such as a mirror, it reflects off that surface. The angle at which the light ray approaches the surface is referred to as the angle of incidence. This angle is measured between the incident ray (the incoming light ray) and the normal, which is an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence.

According to the law of reflection, the angle of reflection is always equal to the angle of incidence. In mathematical terms, if a light ray strikes a mirror at an angle of $30^\circ$ to the normal, it will reflect off the mirror at the same angle of $30^\circ$ on the opposite side of the normal. This principle is fundamental to understanding the behavior of light when it interacts with reflective surfaces.

To visualize this concept, consider shining a flashlight at a flat mirror. When the flashlight is pointed at an angle, you can observe the light beam reflecting off the mirror. By measuring the angle between the incoming light beam and the normal, and then measuring the angle between the reflected light beam and the normal, you will find that these two angles are equal.

This principle is not only important in physics but also has practical applications in everyday life. For instance, it explains the operation of periscopes, which allow submarines to observe above the water's surface. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in the design of optical devices such as cameras and telescopes, where precise control of light reflection is vital.

Understanding the angle of reflection is essential for analyzing and predicting the behavior of light in various contexts, making it a key concept in the study of optics.
