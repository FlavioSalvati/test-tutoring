Stars produce energy through the process of nuclear fusion, which involves fusing hydrogen nuclei into helium and releasing immense amounts of energy in the process.

To elaborate, nuclear fusion occurs when two light atomic nuclei merge to create a heavier nucleus. Within a star's core, where temperatures soar to millions of degrees Celsius, hydrogen atoms move at such high velocities that they can overcome their inherent repulsive forces and collide. Upon collision, these hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of light and heat.

The predominant fusion mechanism in stars like our Sun is known as the proton-proton chain reaction. This process begins with the collision of two protons (hydrogen nuclei), resulting in the formation of a heavier hydrogen isotope called deuterium, along with the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The deuterium nucleus subsequently fuses with another proton to create helium-3, which releases additional energy. Finally, two helium-3 nuclei collide to form helium-4 and release two protons, allowing the cycle to repeat itself.

The energy produced during these reactions arises because the mass of the resultant helium nucleus is slightly less than the total mass of the original hydrogen nuclei. According to Einstein's renowned equation, $E=mc^2$, this lost mass is transformed into energy. This energy radiates from the star's core, eventually reaching its surface and shining into space as the light and heat we observe.

Nuclear fusion is remarkably efficient and can sustain a star for billions of years. It is the fundamental reason why stars shine and why they can support life on planets like Earth. A deeper understanding of this process provides valuable insights into essential concepts in physics and the lifecycle of stars.
