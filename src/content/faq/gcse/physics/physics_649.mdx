Hydroelectric power harnesses the energy from flowing or falling water to generate electricity by turning turbines.

Typically, hydroelectric power plants are situated near large water sources, such as rivers or reservoirs. The process begins with water being stored in a dam. When this water is released, it flows through large pipes known as penstocks. The force of the moving water spins the blades of a turbine connected to a generator. As the turbine blades rotate, they drive the generator to produce electricity.

The generator operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction. Within the generator, there are coils of wire positioned within a magnetic field. When the turbine spins the rotor of the generator, it causes the magnetic field to move past the coils of wire. This relative motion induces an electric current in the wires, thereby generating electricity.

A significant advantage of hydroelectric power is that it is a renewable energy source. As long as water flows in rivers, electricity can be produced. Furthermore, hydroelectric power plants do not emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants, making them environmentally friendly compared to fossil fuel power plants.

Hydroelectric power also offers the flexibility to adjust output according to demand. During periods of high electricity consumption, more water can be released to generate additional power. Conversely, during low demand periods, the water flow can be decreased. This adaptability makes hydroelectric power a reliable energy source.

However, the construction of dams and reservoirs can lead to considerable environmental and social consequences. Such projects can disrupt local ecosystems, hinder fish migration, and displace communities. Therefore, it is essential to plan and manage hydroelectric projects carefully to minimize these impacts.
