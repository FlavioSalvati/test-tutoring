Wien's displacement law describes the relationship between the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a black body and its temperature, stating that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.

This law is essential for understanding how the color of light emitted by an object changes with temperature. A black body is an idealized object that perfectly absorbs all incident radiation and re-emits it without any loss. According to Wien's displacement law, as the temperature of a black body increases, the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation decreases. In simpler terms, hotter objects emit light at shorter wavelengths, which correspond to higher energy levels.

The mathematical expression for Wien's displacement law is represented by the formula:

$$
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
$$

In this equation, $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ represents the peak wavelength, $T$ is the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin, and $b$ is Wien's constant, approximately equal to $2.898 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m K}$. This formula indicates that if you double the temperature of a black body, the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation will be halved.

For instance, the Sun has a surface temperature of around $5,800 \, \text{K}$, which allows it to emit most of its radiation within the visible spectrum, giving it a white or yellow appearance. In contrast, a cooler object such as a red-hot piece of metal, which might have a temperature of about $1,000 \, \text{K}$, primarily emits radiation in the infrared spectrum, causing it to appear red.

Understanding Wien's displacement law is vital in various scientific fields, including astrophysics and climate science. It enables scientists to ascertain the temperatures of stars and other celestial bodies by analyzing the light they emit.
