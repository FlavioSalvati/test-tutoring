Energy can be stored in a system in various forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, and chemical energy.

To understand energy storage more clearly, we can look at the different types of energy:

1. **Kinetic Energy**: This is the energy associated with motion. For example, a moving car or a flowing river possesses kinetic energy. The relationship is straightforward: the faster an object moves, the greater its kinetic energy. Mathematically, kinetic energy ($KE$) can be expressed as:

   $$ KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 $$

   where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity.

2. **Potential Energy**: In contrast to kinetic energy, potential energy is stored energy that depends on an object's position or state. A common type is gravitational potential energy, which depends on an object's height and mass. For instance, a book resting on a shelf has gravitational potential energy due to its elevated position. This energy is calculated using the formula:

   $$ PE = mgh $$

   where $m$ is the mass, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height above a reference point. When the book falls, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

3. **Thermal Energy**: Thermal energy relates to the temperature of a system and is defined as the total kinetic energy of the particles within a substance. When water is heated, its thermal energy increases as the water molecules move more rapidly. This energy can be stored and transferred; for example, in a hot water bottle, the thermal energy can be released to warm a space.

4. **Chemical Energy**: This form of energy is stored within the bonds of chemical compounds. A prime example is batteries, which store chemical energy that can be converted into electrical energy to power devices. Additionally, food contains chemical energy, which our bodies metabolize into kinetic and thermal energy, enabling us to move and maintain body temperature.

5. **Elastic Potential Energy**: This energy is stored when objects such as springs or rubber bands are stretched or compressed. For instance, when you stretch a rubber band, it accumulates elastic potential energy, which is released when the band snaps back to its original shape.

By understanding these various forms of energy storage, we can better analyze how energy is conserved and transferred within different systems. This concept is fundamental to the field of physics.
