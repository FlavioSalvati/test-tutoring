When blood glucose levels fall, the body reacts by releasing the hormone glucagon to elevate glucose levels.

The human body requires a certain amount of glucose, a type of sugar, to operate effectively. Glucose serves as the primary energy source for the body's cells. When blood glucose levels decrease, this change is detected by alpha cells in the pancreas, which respond by secreting the hormone glucagon.

Glucagon acts in opposition to insulin, another hormone produced by the pancreas. While insulin lowers blood glucose levels when they are elevated, glucagon raises them when they are low. It accomplishes this by stimulating the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This process is referred to as glycogenolysis.

In addition to glycogenolysis, glucagon promotes the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as proteins and fats. This process is known as gluconeogenesis. Both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis work together to increase the concentration of glucose in the blood, thereby restoring balance.

If blood glucose levels remain low for an extended duration, the adrenal glands will secrete another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol further aids in raising blood glucose levels by enhancing gluconeogenesis and inhibiting the uptake of glucose by cells.

In summary, the body has a sophisticated system to maintain the appropriate balance of glucose in the bloodstream. When blood glucose levels drop, the body releases hormones that stimulate the production and release of additional glucose. This ensures that the cells of the body consistently have enough energy to function optimally.
