Oxygen production in photosynthesis experiments is commonly assessed using a technique known as the oxygen evolution method.

The oxygen evolution method is widely utilized in photosynthesis studies to quantify the rate of oxygen production. This technique involves placing a sample of plant or algae in a sealed container filled with water and exposing it to light. As the organism undergoes photosynthesis, it generates oxygen, which is subsequently collected and measured.

One prevalent device used for this purpose is the oxygen electrode chamber. This chamber is filled with water and contains a small aquatic plant. When exposed to light, the plant photosynthesizes and releases oxygen into the water. The oxygen electrode then measures the concentration of dissolved oxygen, which rises as photosynthesis occurs.

Another approach involves the use of a gas syringe or a manometer to capture the oxygen gas produced. In this method, the plant is placed in a sealed container with a small volume of water, which is connected to a gas syringe or manometer. As the plant photosynthesizes, the produced oxygen displaces the water, allowing it to be collected in the gas syringe or manometer. The volume of oxygen generated can then be quantified.

It's crucial to understand that these methods measure the net production of oxygen, defined as the total oxygen generated by photosynthesis minus the oxygen consumed by the plant during respiration. To determine the gross oxygen production (the total amount produced solely by photosynthesis), experiments must be conducted under both light and dark conditions. The difference in oxygen production between these two scenarios indicates the amount of oxygen utilized in respiration.

In all these methods, controlling variables such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration is vital, as these factors significantly influence the rate of photosynthesis and, consequently, oxygen production.
