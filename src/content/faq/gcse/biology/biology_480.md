The Linnaean system classifies organisms based on their physical and structural characteristics, organizing them into a hierarchical structure of ranks.

Also known as Linnaean taxonomy, this classification method was originally developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. The system employs a hierarchy of ranks to categorize species, with the main ranks listed in ascending order as follows: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum (or division for plants), and kingdom. As one moves up the hierarchy, each rank becomes increasingly general.

At the base of this hierarchy is the species, which represents the most specific rank. A species is defined as a group of organisms that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring. For instance, humans belong to the species Homo sapiens. The next rank is the genus, which encompasses a group of related species; in this case, humans are classified within the genus Homo.

The family rank groups together related genera (the plural form of genus). Above this level is the order, which includes related families. The class rank organizes related orders, while the phylum (or division for plants) groups together related classes. Finally, at the highest rank, the kingdom encompasses all related phyla. In the Linnaean system, there are five recognized kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, and Monera.

Each organism is assigned a two-part Latin name, known as binomial nomenclature, which identifies its genus and species. For example, the scientific name for humans is Homo sapiens, where "Homo" refers to the genus and "sapiens" indicates the species. This standardized naming convention is universally accepted, facilitating effective communication among scientists regarding different species.

In summary, the Linnaean system classifies organisms based on their physical and structural characteristics, organizing them into a hierarchy of ranks from species to kingdom. This system provides a universal framework for scientists to identify and discuss various species.
