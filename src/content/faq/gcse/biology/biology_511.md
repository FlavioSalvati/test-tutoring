Climate change significantly affects species distribution by altering the habitats and ecosystems that these species depend on for survival.

Primarily driven by global warming, climate change has profound effects on how species are distributed worldwide. As global temperatures rise, many species are compelled to migrate toward cooler regions, often moving poleward or to higher altitudes. Each species has a specific temperature range, known as its 'thermal tolerance,' within which it can survive and reproduce. When temperatures exceed this range, it may result in decreased population sizes and, in extreme cases, extinction.

In addition to rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change also influence species distribution. Some regions may become too arid for certain species, prompting them to migrate to wetter areas. Conversely, increased rainfall can lead to flooding, which can destroy habitats and necessitate the relocation of species.

Moreover, climate change can disrupt the timing of natural events, such as flowering and breeding seasons. This disruption can create mismatches between species and their food sources or breeding partners, adversely affecting their survival and distribution. For instance, if a bird species migrates based on daylight duration while its food sources, such as insects, emerge in response to temperature changes, warmer springs could lead to the insects appearing before the birds arrive, resulting in a food shortage.

Finally, climate change contributes to the loss of sea ice, which is vital for many Arctic species. As the ice diminishes, species such as polar bears and seals, which depend on sea ice for hunting and breeding, may lose their habitats. This loss could force them to relocate or face the threat of extinction.

In summary, climate change can profoundly alter species distribution by modifying their habitats and disrupting their life cycles. These changes can lead to shifts in biodiversity and potentially the loss of certain species.
