The determination of an individual's sex is governed by the presence of X and Y chromosomes.

In humans, sex is defined by two types of sex chromosomes: the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. Females possess two X chromosomes, denoted as $XX$, while males have one X and one Y chromosome, represented as $XY$. This chromosomal arrangement is referred to as the XY sex determination system.

The process of sex determination commences at fertilization, when a sperm cell from the father merges with an egg cell from the mother. Each of these gametes contains one set of chromosomes, which includes one sex chromosome. The egg cell invariably contains an X chromosome, while the sperm cell can carry either an X or a Y chromosome. If the sperm cell delivers an X chromosome, the resulting offspring will be female ($XX$). Conversely, if the sperm cell contributes a Y chromosome, the offspring will be male ($XY$).

The Y chromosome houses a critical gene known as the SRY gene, which initiates the development of male characteristics. When this gene is present, as it is on the Y chromosome, the embryo will typically develop into a male. In the absence of the SRY gene, as seen in individuals with two X chromosomes ($XX$), the embryo will usually develop as a female.

It is essential to recognize that while the presence of a Y chromosome generally promotes male development, there are notable exceptions due to variations in the genes involved in sex determination. For instance, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome possess an additional X chromosome ($XXY$) and are usually male, whereas individuals with Turner syndrome have only a single X chromosome ($XO$) and are typically female. These examples illustrate the complexity of sex determination and the influential role of other genes in this intricate process.
