Turgor pressure refers to the force exerted by water as it pushes against the cell wall of a plant cell. 

This pressure is a critical component of plant biology. It arises when water enters the cell through the process of osmosis, leading to cell swelling and making the cell turgid. The plant cell wall, which is rigid, resists this expansion and exerts an opposing force, thereby generating turgor pressure.

Turgor pressure is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of plant tissues. It helps support the plant's upright posture and prevents wilting. When a plant is adequately hydrated, its cells are full of water, allowing the plant to stand tall. Conversely, when a plant becomes dehydrated, the cells lose water, resulting in a decrease in turgor pressure, which can lead to wilting.

Moreover, turgor pressure is instrumental in the growth of plant cells. The pressure exerted on the cell wall can stimulate cell expansion and growth, which is particularly significant during the development of new plant tissues, such as those found in the tips of roots and shoots.

Additionally, turgor pressure plays a role in the regulation of stomata, the tiny pores located on the leaf surface. These pores facilitate gas exchange, allowing for the intake of carbon dioxide necessary for photosynthesis and the release of oxygen. When the guard cells surrounding the stomata are full of water and turgid, the stomata remain open. However, when these cells lose water and become flaccid, the stomata close.

In conclusion, turgor pressure is a fundamental aspect of plant physiology, contributing to the plant's structural stability, growth, and overall function. It is a dynamic process that responds to the plant's water availability and environmental conditions.
