Endocytosis is a cellular process in which cells absorb molecules or particles by engulfing them with their cell membrane.

This fundamental biological mechanism enables cells to intake substances from their surrounding environment. Endocytosis plays a vital role in various cellular functions, including nutrient uptake, immune responses, and cell signaling. The process begins when the cell membrane folds inward to create a pocket around the target substance. This pocket subsequently pinches off, resulting in the formation of a vesicle, which is a small, membrane-bound compartment within the cell.

There are three primary types of endocytosis: phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Phagocytosis, often termed "cell eating," is employed by cells to engulf large particles, such as bacteria or dead cells. Pinocytosis, commonly referred to as "cell drinking," involves the ingestion of small particles or liquids. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a more selective mechanism, wherein cells absorb specific molecules that bind to receptors located on the cell membrane.

The vesicles formed during endocytosis can fuse with various organelles within the cell, including lysosomes, which contain enzymes that degrade the absorbed substances. This fusion allows the cell to utilize the nutrients or other molecules it has taken in. Alternatively, the vesicles may be transported to the cell membrane, where their contents are expelled from the cell in a process known as exocytosis.

Endocytosis is a complex process that requires energy and is tightly regulated by the cell. It is essential for maintaining cellular health and function; disruptions in endocytosis can result in a range of diseases, including infections and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, understanding endocytosis is crucial for comprehending how cells operate and how they may be impacted by various diseases.
