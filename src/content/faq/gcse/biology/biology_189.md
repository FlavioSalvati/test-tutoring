Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the HTT gene, leading to the production of an abnormal protein.

This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that an individual only needs to inherit one defective copy of the gene from either parent to develop the disease. The gene responsible for Huntington's disease is the HTT gene, which provides the instructions for synthesizing a protein called huntingtin. Although the precise function of huntingtin is not completely understood, it is known to play a crucial role in the health and function of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.

The mutation associated with Huntington's disease involves an abnormal expansion of a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This sequence consists of three DNA building blocks—cytosine (C), adenine (A), and guanine (G)—that are repeated multiple times. In the general population, the CAG repeat occurs between $10$ and $35$ times within the gene. However, in individuals with Huntington's disease, this segment is repeated $36$ times or more, often exceeding $120$ repeats. Notably, the length of the CAG repeat correlates with the age of onset of symptoms; longer repeats tend to result in earlier onset.

The mutated huntingtin protein, which is produced as a consequence of this genetic alteration, is fragmented into smaller, toxic pieces that accumulate within neurons. This accumulation disrupts neuronal function and ultimately leads to cell death. The striatum, a region of the brain that plays a vital role in movement control, is particularly affected by this process. As neurons in the striatum degenerate over time, individuals with Huntington's disease begin to exhibit characteristic signs and symptoms, including involuntary movements, emotional disturbances, and cognitive decline.
