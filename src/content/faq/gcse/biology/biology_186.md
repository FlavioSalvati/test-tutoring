Abscisic acid (ABA) is a vital plant hormone that primarily regulates seed dormancy and aids in the plant's response to stress conditions.

ABA plays an essential role in various processes of plant growth and development. One of its key functions is to induce seed dormancy, keeping seeds in a resting state and preventing them from germinating under unfavorable conditions. When conditions become favorable for growth—such as optimal temperature and moisture levels—the concentration of ABA decreases. This reduction allows the seed to break dormancy and initiate germination.

In addition to regulating seed dormancy, ABA is crucial for the plant’s response to stress, particularly drought stress. When a plant experiences water scarcity, ABA levels rise, leading to the closure of stomata, which are small openings on the leaf surface. This closure reduces water loss through transpiration, enabling the plant to conserve water. This mechanism is especially important for plants that thrive in arid or drought-prone environments.

Furthermore, ABA is involved in the synthesis of storage proteins during seed maturation, ensuring that seeds have the necessary nutrients for successful germination and early growth. It also regulates various growth and developmental processes, including cell division and elongation, as well as the transition from vegetative growth to flowering.

In summary, abscisic acid is an essential plant hormone that helps plants adapt to environmental stresses and regulates critical growth and development processes. Its role in managing water stress and seed dormancy is particularly important for the survival and reproduction of plants.
