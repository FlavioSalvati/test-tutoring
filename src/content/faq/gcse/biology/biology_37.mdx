Amylase is an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the digestion of carbohydrates by catalyzing the hydrolysis of starch into simpler sugars.

As a type of protein, amylase accelerates chemical reactions within the body, which is particularly important for breaking down carbohydrates—one of the primary sources of energy for our cells. This enzyme is produced primarily in the salivary glands and the pancreas, beginning its action on carbohydrates the moment food enters the mouth.

Carbohydrates, such as starch, consist of large molecules formed by chains of glucose units. These chains can be either straight or branched and are too large for the body's cells to absorb directly. Amylase facilitates the breakdown of these extensive chains into smaller, more manageable units. This process occurs through a reaction known as hydrolysis, where a water molecule is added to sever the bonds between the glucose units.

The hydrolysis process begins when amylase binds to a starch molecule. The enzyme's active site—a specially shaped region with distinct chemical properties—interacts with the starch, forming what is known as an "enzyme-substrate complex." This binding alters the shape of the enzyme, creating stress on the bonds within the starch molecule, thereby making them easier to break.

Once the bonds are cleaved, the smaller sugar molecules—such as maltose and dextrin—are released. These sugars are small enough to be absorbed by the body's cells and utilized for energy. After this action, the amylase enzyme is free to attach to another starch molecule, repeating the breakdown process. Through this mechanism, amylase effectively converts complex carbohydrates into simple sugars that the body can readily use.
