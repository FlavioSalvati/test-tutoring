To thoroughly investigate the effects of exercise, you will need several essential pieces of equipment: a heart rate monitor, a stopwatch, and a method for measuring breathing rate.

Firstly, a heart rate monitor is crucial for this investigation. This device tracks your heart rate before, during, and after exercise. Monitoring the heart rate is vital because it reflects how hard the heart is working to circulate blood and oxygen throughout the body. It is normal for the heart rate to increase during exercise, as the body requires additional oxygen to fuel the muscles.

Additionally, a stopwatch is indispensable for timing the duration of both the exercise and the subsequent recovery period. The recovery period refers to the time it takes for the heart rate to return to its resting level after physical activity. By accurately timing these intervals, you can evaluate how quickly the body recovers from exercise, which serves as an important indicator of overall fitness level.

You will also need a method to measure the breathing rate. This can be done by simply counting the number of breaths taken per minute, or by using a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. Similar to heart rate, the breathing rate tends to increase during exercise, as the body requires more oxygen and must expel additional carbon dioxide.

Moreover, you may want to consider incorporating a blood pressure monitor to observe changes in blood pressure during exercise, as well as a thermometer to track variations in body temperature. These additional measurements can offer deeper insights into how the body responds to physical activity.

When conducting this investigation, it is essential to consider various factors such as the type, intensity, and duration of the exercise, along with individual characteristics like age, fitness level, and health status. All of these elements can significantly influence the physiological effects of exercise on the body.
