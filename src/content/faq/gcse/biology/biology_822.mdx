Hormonal contraceptives can lead to several side effects, including nausea, weight gain, mood fluctuations, and irregular menstrual bleeding.

These contraceptives, which include options such as the pill, patch, injection, or implant, function by modifying the levels of specific hormones in the body to prevent pregnancy. While these hormonal adjustments are effective, they may also result in various side effects. It is crucial to note that not everyone will experience these effects, and for many individuals, they may diminish or completely subside after a few months of use.

One of the most common side effects is nausea. This can often be alleviated by taking the contraceptive with food or before bedtime. Additionally, some individuals may notice slight weight gain; however, this is typically minor and can often be managed through a balanced diet and regular physical activity.

Mood changes are another potential side effect. Some users may become more emotional or experience mood swings upon starting hormonal contraceptives. This is due to the impact of hormones on brain chemistry. If these mood changes are significant or persist for an extended period, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional.

Irregular menstrual bleeding is also a common occurrence. This may manifest as spotting between periods, variations in menstrual flow (either heavier or lighter), or even missed periods. Generally, these irregularities are not a cause for concern and tend to stabilize after a few months. However, if bleeding is excessively heavy or prolonged, it is wise to seek medical advice.

Less common side effects may include headaches, breast tenderness, and decreased libido. It's also important to highlight that while hormonal contraceptives are highly effective in preventing pregnancy, they do not provide protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Therefore, the use of condoms remains essential for safeguarding against STIs.
