Urbanization significantly impacts ecosystems through habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and a decline in biodiversity.

Urbanization, the process of developing towns and cities, poses serious challenges to natural ecosystems. One of the most immediate consequences is habitat loss. As land is cleared to accommodate buildings, roads, and other infrastructure, the natural habitats of numerous species are destroyed. This destruction can lead to a decline in biodiversity, forcing species to relocate or face extinction. For instance, in the UK, urbanization has resulted in the loss of many wildflower meadows, which serve as crucial habitats for bees and other pollinators.

Another significant consequence of urbanization is pollution. Cities generate substantial amounts of waste, including sewage, garbage, and air pollution from vehicles and industries. This waste can adversely affect local ecosystems by contaminating water sources and harming the health of both plants and animals. For example, air pollution in urban areas can lead to acid rain, which can damage forests and freshwater ecosystems.

Urbanization also plays a role in climate change, which has extensive effects on ecosystems. Cities are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to energy consumption in buildings and transportation. Additionally, the "urban heat island" effect occurs when cities become warmer than surrounding rural areas due to the absorption and re-emission of heat by buildings and roads. This temperature increase can disrupt local climates, affecting species distribution and the timing of seasonal events, such as flowering and migration.

Finally, urbanization can facilitate the introduction of invasive species, which can outcompete native species and disrupt established ecosystems. This often happens when species are brought into urban areas as pets or ornamental plants and later escape or are released into the wild. A notable example is the ring-necked parakeet, originally from Asia, which has become a common sight in Londonâ€™s parks and gardens, raising concerns about its potential impact on native bird populations.
