Cell differentiation is a fundamental biological process that involves three key stages: commitment, specification, and terminal differentiation.

This process refers to the transformation of a cell from a more generic state to a specialized cell type. It plays a vital role in an organism's development, enabling it to progress from a single fertilized egg into a complex assembly of diverse cell types, tissues, and organs.

The first stage, known as commitment, marks the point at which a cell becomes 'committed' to differentiating into a specific cell type. This commitment is often triggered by signals from surrounding cells. Importantly, once a cell has committed to a particular lineage, it cannot revert to its previous state. However, during this stage, the cell remains a 'blank slate' in terms of visible characteristics, having not yet undergone any observable changes, but it has made a definitive decision regarding its future identity.

The second stage is specification. Here, the cell begins to adopt the properties associated with the cell type it is destined to become. This involves alterations in gene expression, leading to changes in the proteins synthesized by the cell. Although these changes are still reversible at this point, the cell gradually becomes more specialized. As differentiation progresses, the cell's ability to change its developmental path diminishes.

The final stage is terminal differentiation. At this stage, the cell has fully attained the characteristics of its designated cell type and can no longer transition into another cell type. This is the phase when the cell starts to perform its specialized functions within the organism.

In summary, cell differentiation encompasses the stages of commitment, specification, and terminal differentiation. Each of these stages is essential for the proper development and functioning of an organism.
