Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution that promotes the survival and reproduction of organisms with advantageous traits, leading to gradual changes in species over time.

At its core, natural selection is the process that fosters the incredible diversity and complexity of life on Earth. It operates under the principle known as "survival of the fittest," a term popularized by Charles Darwin. Importantly, "fittest" does not necessarily refer to the strongest or fastest individuals; rather, it describes those organisms best adapted to their specific environments.

Within any population of organisms, there exists variation in traits such as size, color, speed, and disease resistance. These variations stem from genetic differences, which can arise from mutations or the recombination of genes during sexual reproduction. Certain traits may confer advantages that enhance an individual's chances of survival and reproduction in a given environment. For instance, a rabbit with fur that closely matches its surroundings is less likely to be detected by predators, increasing its likelihood of survival and ability to pass its genes on to the next generation.

Over generations, these advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population as they are inherited by offspring. This process is known as natural selection. As environmental conditions evolve, different traits may emerge as advantageous, perpetuating the cycle of selection.

The cumulative effect of these changes in the genetic composition of a population over time is termed evolution. If populations diverge sufficiently, they may eventually become unable to interbreed, leading to the emergence of new species, a process known as speciation. Thus, natural selection, by favoring certain traits over others, drives the evolutionary process and contributes to the remarkable diversity of life we observe on Earth today.
