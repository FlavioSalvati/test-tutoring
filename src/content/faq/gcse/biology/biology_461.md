Genetic variation refers to the differences in DNA among individuals, whereas environmental variation encompasses the differences caused by external factors.

Genetic variation signifies the diversity in the genetic composition of individuals within a species. This variation arises from differences in the sequences of DNA within each individual's genome. Such differences can occur naturally through processes such as mutation, gene flow, or sexual reproduction. Genetic variation is crucial for natural selection, as it enables species to adapt to changing environments. For instance, if a mutation occurs that confers a survival advantage to an individual, that advantageous trait can be passed down to future generations, contributing to the process of evolution.

Conversely, environmental variation pertains to the differences in traits among individuals that arise from environmental influences. These influences may include factors such as diet, climate, exposure to chemicals, or lifestyle choices. For example, two identical twins, who possess the same genetic material, may exhibit different heights if one has access to a nutritious diet while the other does not. Additionally, environmental variation can affect gene expression. For instance, exposure to sunlight can influence skin color, demonstrating that this characteristic is not solely determined by genetics.

In summary, genetic variation results from differences in DNA sequences, while environmental variation arises from external influences. Both forms of variation contribute to the diversity observed within species. Understanding the interplay between genetic and environmental variation is essential in the field of biology, as it enhances our comprehension of how species adapt and evolve over time.
