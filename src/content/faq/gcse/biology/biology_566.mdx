The primary types of tissues found in animals are epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissues.

**Epithelial Tissue**  
Epithelial tissue, commonly referred to as epithelium, forms the outermost layer of the body and lines various cavities, organs, and blood vessels. This tissue serves as a protective barrier and plays crucial roles in several functions, including secretion, absorption, and the transport of substances. Epithelial tissue can be further categorized based on the number of cell layers and cell shape. It is classified into two main types based on cell layers: simple epithelium, which consists of a single layer of cells, and stratified epithelium, which consists of multiple layers. Additionally, epithelial cells can be categorized by their shape into three types: squamous (flat), cuboidal (cube-shaped), and columnar (column-shaped).

**Connective Tissue**  
As its name suggests, connective tissue connects, supports, and binds various parts of the body. This broad category encompasses various types, including bone, cartilage, adipose (fat), blood, and lymphatic tissues. A defining characteristic of connective tissue is the presence of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix, which can vary in consistency: it may be liquid (as seen in blood), semi-solid (as in cartilage), or solid (as in bone).

**Muscle Tissue**  
Muscle tissue is responsible for facilitating movement within the body. It can be divided into three distinct types: skeletal muscle, which is attached to bones and allows for voluntary movement; cardiac muscle, which comprises the heart and enables involuntary heart contractions; and smooth muscle, found in the walls of organs and blood vessels, which facilitates involuntary movement and the flow of substances.

**Nervous Tissue**  
Nervous tissue is primarily located in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Its main function is to receive, transmit, and process information throughout the body. Nervous tissue comprises two main types of cells: neurons, which are responsible for transmitting electrical signals, and glial cells, which provide essential support and protection for neurons.
