When blood glucose levels become excessively high, a condition known as hyperglycaemia can arise, leading to various health issues.

Hyperglycaemia, characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, occurs when there is an accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream. This situation may develop if the body does not produce sufficient insulin—a hormone secreted by the pancreas that facilitates the entry of glucose into cells—or if the body is unable to utilize insulin effectively. Hyperglycaemia is commonly associated with diabetes, a chronic condition that disrupts the body's ability to manage blood sugar.

When blood glucose levels increase, the pancreas responds by secreting insulin. Insulin enables the cells in the body to absorb glucose and utilize it as an energy source. However, if the pancreas fails to produce adequate insulin, or if the cells become resistant to insulin's effects, glucose can accumulate in the bloodstream, resulting in hyperglycaemia.

Symptoms of hyperglycaemia include frequent urination, heightened thirst, headaches, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. If left untreated, elevated blood glucose levels can lead to severe complications, such as damage to blood vessels, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, and vision problems.

Moreover, extremely high blood glucose levels can precipitate a life-threatening condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This occurs when the body begins to break down fat for energy due to its inability to utilize glucose effectively. This metabolic process generates a byproduct called ketones, which can accumulate in the bloodstream and result in a dangerously acidic pH.

Consequently, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, and, if necessary, take medications to help regulate blood glucose levels and avoid hyperglycaemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is also vital for individuals with diabetes to ensure their levels remain within a safe range.
