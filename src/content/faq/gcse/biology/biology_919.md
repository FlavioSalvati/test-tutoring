Invasive species pose a significant threat to ecosystems by outcompeting native species, altering habitats, and disrupting food chains.

Invasive species are non-native organisms that have been introduced—either intentionally or accidentally—into ecosystems where they do not naturally exist. Their impact on these ecosystems can be profound and multifaceted. One of the primary ways in which invasive species affect ecosystems is through competition for resources. Because these invaders often lack natural predators in their new environments, their populations can expand unchecked, resulting in a decline in the diversity and abundance of native species.

In addition to competition, invasive species can modify the physical characteristics of an ecosystem. Certain invasive plants, for instance, may alter soil chemistry, making it less conducive to the growth of native plants. Aquatic invasive species, such as the zebra mussel, can significantly transform aquatic habitats by filtering large amounts of nutrients from the water, which can change water clarity and impact other aquatic organisms.

Moreover, invasive species can disrupt food chains. They may become dominant predators, preying on native species that have not evolved defenses against them. Alternatively, they can serve as a new food source for native predators, potentially leading to population booms followed by crashes. A notable example is the introduction of the cane toad in Australia, which has had devastating effects on native predators like the quokka, who suffer fatal consequences from consuming the toxic toads.

Invasive species can also introduce diseases to which native species lack immunity, leading to widespread illness or mortality. For example, the American grey squirrel has contributed to the decline of the native red squirrel in the UK by spreading squirrel pox, a disease against which the red squirrel has no resistance.

In summary, invasive species can significantly impact ecosystems by outcompeting native species, altering habitats, disrupting food chains, and introducing new diseases. These effects can lead to a decrease in biodiversity and changes in ecosystem function, often resulting in negative consequences for the affected environments.
