The magnification of a microscope can be determined by multiplying the magnification of the eyepiece lens by that of the objective lens.

A typical microscope consists of two main lenses: the eyepiece lens (the lens you look through) and the objective lens (the lens closest to the specimen). Each lens has a specific magnification power. For instance, the eyepiece lens may have a magnification of $10\times$, while the objective lens may have a magnification of $40\times$.

To calculate the total magnification of the microscope, you simply multiply the magnification of the eyepiece lens by the magnification of the objective lens. In this case, the total magnification would be:

$$
\text{Total Magnification} = \text{Eyepiece Magnification} \times \text{Objective Magnification} = 10\times \times 40\times = 400\times.
$$

This means that the image observed through the microscope appears $400$ times larger than the actual size of the specimen.

It's important to note that magnification alone does not provide a complete picture of a microscope's capabilities. The resolution, which refers to the microscope's ability to distinguish between two points that are very close together, is also crucial. A microscope may offer high magnification, but if its resolution is inadequate, the resulting image may be blurry, obscuring important details.

In summary, to calculate the magnification of a microscope, you need to know the magnifications of both the eyepiece and objective lenses and then multiply them together. This calculation yields the total magnification, which indicates how much larger the image is compared to the actual size of the specimen.
