White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, play a vital role in the immune system by combating infections and producing antibodies. They are a crucial component of the body's defense mechanisms, responsible for protecting against infectious diseases and foreign substances. Various types of white blood cells exist, each with distinct functions in the immune response.

Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell, constituting about $60-70\%$ of the total leukocyte count. They are the first responders to the site of infection, where their primary function is to ingest and destroy bacteria and fungi through a process known as phagocytosis.

Eosinophils, another type of white blood cell, are primarily involved in combating parasitic infections and play a significant role in allergic reactions. While they are less numerous than neutrophils, their functions are critical in the immune response to larger invaders.

Basophils are the least common white blood cells, making up only about $0.5-1\%$ of the total leukocyte population. Despite their rarity, they play an essential role in inflammatory reactions, particularly in conditions such as asthma, where they release histamine and other mediators that contribute to the inflammatory response.

Lymphocytes represent another key category of white blood cells and are further divided into B cells and T cells. B cells are responsible for producing antibodiesâ€”specialized proteins that bind to pathogens, neutralizing them and marking them for destruction. T cells have diverse roles; some are cytotoxic T cells that kill virus-infected or cancerous cells, while others, known as helper T cells, help regulate the immune response to ensure it does not become excessive.

Monocytes, the largest type of white blood cell, transform into macrophages upon entering body tissues. Macrophages are crucial for phagocytosis, where they engulf and digest microbes and cellular debris, thus playing a vital role in maintaining tissue health and orchestrating the immune response.

In conclusion, white blood cells are indispensable to the immune system. They protect the body from harmful pathogens, respond to allergic reactions, and contribute to the body's defense against cancer. Each type of white blood cell has a specific function, yet they all collaborate to maintain the overall health and well-being of the body.
