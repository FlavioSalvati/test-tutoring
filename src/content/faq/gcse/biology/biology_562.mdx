DNA replication occurs during the synthesis phase (S phase) of the cell cycle through a mechanism known as semi-conservative replication.

In detail, DNA replication is a crucial process that takes place during the S phase, as the cell prepares for division by duplicating its genetic material. The term "semi-conservative" refers to the fact that each newly formed DNA molecule contains one original (conserved) strand and one newly synthesized strand.

The replication process begins with the unwinding of the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. This unwinding is facilitated by an enzyme called DNA helicase, which breaks the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs, allowing the two strands to separate. This separation creates a 'replication fork', a Y-shaped structure where the actual DNA replication occurs.

Following this, another enzyme, DNA polymerase, attaches to each of the separated strands. As it moves along the strand, it reads the sequence of nucleotidesâ€”the building blocks of DNA. For each nucleotide it reads, DNA polymerase adds the complementary nucleotide to the growing new strand. For example, if it encounters an adenine ($A$), it will add a thymine ($T$) to the new strand, and vice versa. Similarly, if it reads a cytosine ($C$), it will add a guanine ($G$), and vice versa.

It is important to note that DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides in one direction, which leads to a difference in the replication of the two strands. The strand that is synthesized continuously is known as the leading strand, while the other strand, which is replicated in short segments called Okazaki fragments, is referred to as the lagging strand. These Okazaki fragments are subsequently joined together by another enzyme known as DNA ligase.

As a result of this intricate process, two identical DNA molecules are formed, each comprising one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. This mechanism ensures that, when the cell divides, each daughter cell inherits a complete set of DNA.
