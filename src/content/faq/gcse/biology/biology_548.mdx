Vacuoles are essential membrane-bound organelles found in both plant and animal cells, but they exhibit notable differences in size, quantity, and functionality.

In plant cells, there is typically one large central vacuole that can occupy up to $90\%$ of the cell's volume. This vacuole is primarily filled with water and various solutes, playing a crucial role in maintaining turgor pressure. Turgor pressure is vital for preserving the cell's shape and rigidity, which in turn supports the overall structure of the plant. Additionally, the central vacuole serves as a storage site for waste products and other essential substances that contribute to the plant cell's survival.

Conversely, animal cells generally contain multiple smaller vacuoles, which serve a variety of functions. These vacuoles are involved in processes such as nutrient digestion, waste removal, and the regulation of the cell's pH levels. Unlike plant cells, animal cells do not depend on vacuoles for turgor pressure or structural support; instead, they rely on a cytoskeletonâ€”a network of protein fibers that provides the necessary structural integrity.

Moreover, the vacuoles in plant cells have unique functions beyond storage. They can accumulate pigments that give flowers and fruits their vibrant colors. Additionally, these vacuoles store vital nutrients, such as proteins and sugars, as well as defensive compounds that help protect the plant against herbivores and pathogens.

In summary, while vacuoles are present in both plant and animal cells, their characteristics differ significantly. In plant cells, one large central vacuole is crucial for maintaining turgor pressure and storing various substances. In contrast, animal cells have several smaller vacuoles that perform diverse tasks, including nutrient digestion and waste management.
