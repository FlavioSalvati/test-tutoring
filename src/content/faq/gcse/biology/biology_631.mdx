The primary types of plant pathogens include fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and protozoa.

Fungi are among the most prevalent plant pathogens. They are known to cause a wide range of diseases in plants, including powdery mildew, rusts, and smuts. Fungi reproduce by releasing spores, which can be dispersed by wind or water to infect new host plants. They typically enter plants through wounds or natural openings, and they can inflict damage by producing toxins or by invading plant tissues physically.

Bacteria represent another significant category of plant pathogens. These microscopic, single-celled organisms can lead to diseases such as fire blight and bacterial leaf spot. Bacteria can infiltrate plants through natural openings or wounds, and once inside, they reproduce rapidly. They can cause damage through toxin production, by disrupting the plant's metabolic processes, or by obstructing the plant's vascular system.

Viruses are much smaller than bacteria and can only replicate within living cells. They are responsible for diseases such as mosaic disease and leaf roll. Viruses are typically spread by insects or other animals, as well as through direct contact between plants. Their damage manifests through interference with the plant's metabolism, abnormal growth patterns, or cell death.

Nematodes are microscopic worms that can lead to diseases like root-knot and cyst nematode disease. They infect plants by penetrating the roots and feeding on the plant's tissues. Nematodes can cause significant harm by physically damaging plant tissues, disrupting the plant's metabolic functions, or introducing other pathogens.

Protozoa, which are also single-celled organisms, can cause diseases such as root rot and damping-off. Similar to nematodes, they infect plants by entering the roots and feeding on the plant's tissues. Protozoa can inflict damage through physical harm to the plant tissues, disruption of the plant's metabolism, or by introducing additional pathogens.
