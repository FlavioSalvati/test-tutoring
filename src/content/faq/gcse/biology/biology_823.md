In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a medical procedure designed to assist individuals experiencing infertility by fertilizing eggs outside the body. 

IVF is a form of assisted reproductive technology (ART) commonly employed when other methods of assisted reproduction have proven unsuccessful. The process involves several key steps: first, monitoring and stimulating the woman's ovulatory cycle; second, retrieving eggs from her ovaries; and finally, allowing sperm to fertilize these eggs in a controlled laboratory environment. Once fertilization occurs, the resulting entity, now referred to as an embryo, is subsequently implanted back into the woman's uterus.

The term "in vitro" originates from Latin, meaning "in glass," which refers to the glass test tubes that were initially utilized in the procedure. Although modern IVF employs more sophisticated technologies, the original terminology has remained in use. IVF represents a significant treatment option for infertility, particularly after other assisted reproductive techniques have failed.

The IVF process commences with hormonal therapy aimed at stimulating the development of multiple follicles in the ovaries. These follicles are then accessed to collect the eggs. Concurrently, the male partner's sperm is prepared for the fertilization process. Following this, the eggs and sperm are combined in a laboratory dish, which is subsequently placed in an incubator to facilitate fertilization, resulting in one or more embryos. After a few days of development, one or two of these embryos are transferred into the woman's uterus, where they may implant and develop, mirroring a typical pregnancy.

IVF can be an effective solution for various types of infertility. It is particularly beneficial in cases where the woman's fallopian tubes are damaged or if the male partner has poor-quality sperm. Additionally, IVF is often employed when the underlying cause of infertility is unknown or when previous treatments have not yielded results. However, it is important to understand that while IVF can assist many couples in achieving pregnancy, it does not guarantee a successful outcome. The success rates of IVF can vary significantly based on several factors, including the age and overall health of the woman.
