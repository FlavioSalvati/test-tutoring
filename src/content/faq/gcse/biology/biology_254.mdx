Biotic factors that influence population growth include competition, predation, symbiosis, disease, and food availability.

Biotic factors consist of living or previously living organisms within an ecosystem that can affect population dynamics. Among these, competition is one of the most significant contributors. This can manifest as intraspecific competition, where individuals of the same species compete for resources, or interspecific competition, where different species vie for similar needs. For instance, two bird species may compete for identical food sources or suitable nesting sites. The species that is better adapted to these conditions is likely to experience a higher growth rate in its population.

Predation is another critical biotic factor. Predators play a vital role in regulating the population of their prey, preventing it from exceeding sustainable levels. A decrease in predator numbers can lead to a rapid increase in the prey population, while an overabundance of predators may cause a decline in prey numbers. This predator-prey relationship is a delicate equilibrium that can profoundly affect population growth.

Symbiosis, which refers to the interactions between two different organisms living in close physical proximity, also impacts population dynamics. This includes various forms of interaction: mutualism, where both organisms benefit; commensalism, where one organism benefits while the other remains unaffected; and parasitism, where one organism gains at the expense of another. For example, parasites can severely limit population growth by causing illness or death among their hosts.

Disease represents another significant biotic factor. Pathogens can spread rapidly through populations, particularly when individuals are in close contact. This can lead to a swift decrease in population size. Conversely, populations that possess a robust immune response to specific diseases may gain a competitive edge, resulting in increased growth rates.

Finally, food availability is a crucial biotic factor influencing population growth. When a population has access to abundant food sources, it is likely to expand. However, a reduction in food availability can lead to population declines due to starvation. This dynamic is often evident in predator-prey relationships, where a decline in prey populations can subsequently affect predator populations, leading to a cycle of population fluctuations.
