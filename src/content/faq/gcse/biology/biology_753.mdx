Abscisic acid (ABA) is a vital plant hormone that primarily regulates seed dormancy and facilitates the plant's response to stress conditions.

One of the key functions of ABA is to induce seed dormancy. This process keeps seeds in a quiescent state, preventing them from germinating under unfavorable conditions. When the environment becomes suitable for growth—characterized by optimal temperature and moisture levels—the concentration of ABA decreases. This reduction allows the seeds to overcome dormancy and initiate germination.

In addition to its role in seed dormancy, ABA is crucial for the plant's response to stress, particularly during drought conditions. When a plant experiences water stress, ABA levels rise. This increase triggers the closure of stomata, which are small openings on the leaf surface. By closing these stomata, the plant significantly reduces water loss through transpiration, thereby conserving vital moisture. This mechanism is especially important for plants that inhabit arid or drought-prone regions.

ABA also contributes to the synthesis of storage proteins during seed maturation, ensuring that seeds are equipped with essential nutrients for germination and early growth. Furthermore, it is involved in regulating various plant growth and developmental processes, including cell division, elongation, and the transition from vegetative growth to flowering.

In summary, abscisic acid plays an essential role as a plant hormone, enabling plants to adapt to environmental stresses while regulating critical growth and developmental processes. Its functions in managing water stress and controlling seed dormancy are particularly significant for the survival and reproduction of plants.
