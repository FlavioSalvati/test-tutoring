Gibberellins are a group of plant hormones that significantly influence various growth and developmental processes in plants. One of their primary functions is to enhance fruit size by stimulating both cell division and elongation.

When gibberellins are applied to fruits—either through natural means or artificial methods—they bind to specific receptors located in the plant cells. This binding initiates a cascade of biochemical reactions that activate particular genes responsible for regulating cell division and elongation. Consequently, the cells within the fruit undergo division and elongation at an accelerated rate, resulting in a noticeable increase in fruit size.

In addition to promoting cell division and elongation, gibberellins facilitate the synthesis of proteins and other essential substances necessary for plant growth. This further aids in the expansion of fruit size. For instance, gibberellins can stimulate the production of enzymes that degrade cell walls, making them more pliable and enabling the cells to expand more freely.

Furthermore, gibberellins impact the transport of nutrients and water throughout the plant. This ensures that the rapidly dividing and elongating cells receive the necessary resources for growth. This aspect is particularly critical for fruit development, as fruits require substantial amounts of nutrients and water to grow effectively.

In summary, gibberellins are vital for increasing fruit size by stimulating both cell division and elongation, promoting the synthesis of growth-enhancing substances, and facilitating the transportation of nutrients and water within the plant.
