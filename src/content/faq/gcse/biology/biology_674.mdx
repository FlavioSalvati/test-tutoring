Glucagon is a hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas that plays a vital role in regulating blood glucose levels and maintaining the body's energy balance. When blood glucose levels decrease—such as during fasting or intense physical exertion—the pancreas secretes glucagon into the bloodstream.

Once released, glucagon travels to the liver, where it stimulates the conversion of stored glycogen into glucose. Glycogen serves as a reserve of glucose, providing the body with quick energy when needed. This conversion process is known as glycogenolysis. The glucose that is generated is subsequently released into the bloodstream, resulting in an increase in blood glucose levels.

In addition to promoting glycogenolysis, glucagon also facilitates gluconeogenesis, the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. This process occurs primarily in the liver and kidneys and involves the transformation of amino acids and various substrates into glucose.

The action of glucagon in elevating blood glucose levels is fundamental to the body's homeostatic mechanisms—ensuring stable internal conditions essential for survival. Glucagon works in concert with insulin, another hormone produced by the pancreas, which lowers blood glucose levels when they are elevated. Together, insulin and glucagon maintain a steady supply of energy for the body, regardless of external factors or meal timing.

Understanding glucagon's role in regulating blood glucose levels is crucial not only for grasping basic human physiology but also for comprehending conditions like diabetes, where this regulation is impaired. In type 1 diabetes, for instance, the body is unable to produce insulin, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Conversely, in type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to insulin, resulting in similarly high blood glucose levels. In both scenarios, knowledge of glucagon's function can aid in the effective management of the condition.
