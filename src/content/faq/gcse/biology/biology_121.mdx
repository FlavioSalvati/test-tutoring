Hormonal contraception encompasses various methods, including the contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch, contraceptive injection, and contraceptive implant.

Hormonal contraception works by modifying the body's natural hormonal balance to prevent pregnancy. The most widely used form is the contraceptive pill, which contains synthetic versions of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones inhibit ovulationâ€”the process in which an egg is released from the ovaries. If no egg is released, there is nothing for sperm to fertilize, thereby preventing pregnancy.

The contraceptive patch functions similarly to the pill but is applied externally as a small adhesive patch on the skin. Hormones are absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream. This method requires a patch change on a weekly basis, making it a convenient alternative for individuals who may find it challenging to remember to take a daily pill.

Another method is the contraceptive injection, commonly referred to as Depo-Provera. This involves a healthcare professional administering a shot of progesterone every $12$ weeks. The injection not only prevents ovulation but also thickens the cervical mucus, which hinders sperm from reaching an egg.

The contraceptive implant, known as Nexplanon, is a small, flexible rod inserted under the skin of the upper arm by a healthcare professional. It releases a consistent dose of progesterone into the bloodstream over a duration of three years. Like other hormonal contraceptives, it effectively prevents ovulation and thickens cervical mucus to obstruct sperm from fertilizing an egg.

Each of these methods comes with its own advantages and potential side effects. The most suitable option varies based on individual health considerations and lifestyle factors. It is crucial to consult a healthcare provider to explore these options and make an informed decision regarding contraceptive choices.
