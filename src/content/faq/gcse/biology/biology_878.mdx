Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution through extensive research, meticulous observations, and the formulation of the concept of natural selection.

In 1831, Charles Darwin, a British naturalist, embarked on a transformative five-year voyage around the world aboard the HMS Beagle. This journey was pivotal in shaping his theory of evolution. During his travels, Darwin collected a diverse array of specimens and made detailed observations of the natural world, with a particular focus on the Galapagos Islands. There, he noticed subtle variations in the physical characteristics of similar species that inhabited different islands.

These observations prompted Darwin to challenge the prevailing belief of his time, which held that species were immutable and created in their current forms. Instead, he began to entertain the idea that species could undergo changes over time and adapt to their environments. This revolutionary concept marked the initial stages of his development of the theory of evolution.

Over the next two decades, Darwin articulated his theory of natural selection. This theory posits that individuals within a species exhibit a wide range of variations, and those individuals with traits best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. This process, often summarized by the phrase "survival of the fittest," leads to gradual changes in species over many generations.

Darwin's groundbreaking theory of evolution was first published in his seminal work, *On the Origin of Species*, in 1859. The book sparked significant controversy, as it contradicted the religious views prevalent at the time. Nevertheless, it has since established itself as the cornerstone of modern evolutionary biology and an essential concept in the field.

In summary, Charles Darwin's development of the theory of evolution was greatly influenced by his observations of natural variations among species during his voyage on the HMS Beagle, which ultimately led to his formulation of natural selection.
