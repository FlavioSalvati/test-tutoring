Cloning an organism is a sophisticated process that entails several critical steps. The initial step involves obtaining a cell from the organism intended for cloning. Typically, this cell is a somatic cell, which refers to any cell in the body that is not a sperm or egg cell. The nucleus of this somatic cell, which houses the organism's DNA, is then meticulously extracted.

Following this, an egg cell is sourced from a donor organism of the same species. The nucleus of this egg cell is also removed, resulting in what is referred to as an 'enucleated' egg cell. This procedure is known as enucleation.

Next, the nucleus from the somatic cell is implanted into the enucleated egg cell. This can be accomplished using a fine needle or through a technique called fusion, where an electric current is employed to merge the two cells. The outcome of this step is an egg cell that contains the DNA of the organism being cloned.

Afterward, the egg cell is stimulated to initiate division and develop into an embryo. This stimulation is typically achieved by applying either an electric current or a chemical solution. Once the embryo reaches a certain developmental stage, it is implanted into the uterus of a surrogate mother.

The surrogate mother then carries the embryo to term and ultimately gives birth to the clone. It is crucial to understand that the clone is genetically identical to the organism from which the original somatic cell was derived. However, despite sharing the same genetic material, variations in appearance and behavior may arise due to environmental factors.
