The by-products of aerobic respiration are carbon dioxide, water, and energy in the form of ATP.

Aerobic respiration is a crucial metabolic process that occurs in the mitochondria of cells. It utilizes glucose and oxygen to generate energy, which is essential for the survival of all living organisms. The main by-products of this process are carbon dioxide, water, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

Aerobic respiration can be divided into four distinct stages: glycolysis, the link reaction, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. 

1. **Glycolysis**: In this initial stage, glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate. This conversion produces a small amount of ATP and releases hydrogen. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell and does not require oxygen, allowing it to also be classified as part of anaerobic respiration.

2. **Link Reaction**: Following glycolysis, the pyruvate enters the mitochondria, where it is further broken down in the link reaction. This process generates carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and a two-carbon molecule known as acetyl CoA.

3. **Krebs Cycle**: The acetyl CoA then enters the Krebs cycle, where it undergoes a series of reactions that result in the release of additional carbon dioxide and hydrogen. 

4. **Electron Transport Chain**: The hydrogen produced in the previous stages is utilized in the electron transport chain, which is responsible for generating a significant amount of ATP.

The carbon dioxide formed during the link reaction and the Krebs cycle serves as a waste product. It is expelled from the body through the lungs when we exhale. Water is produced in the electron transport chain when hydrogen combines with oxygen. This water can be utilized by the body for various functions or excreted as sweat or urine. The ATP generated during aerobic respiration powers numerous cellular activities, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and the synthesis of biomolecules.
