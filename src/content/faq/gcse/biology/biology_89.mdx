Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor in the process of aerobic respiration, a critical pathway for energy production in cells.

Aerobic respiration consists of three primary stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Oxygen is particularly significant in the final stage, the electron transport chain, where it accepts electrons to facilitate energy production.

In the first stage, glycolysis, glucose is enzymatically broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, resulting in a modest yield of energy. This process occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen. Subsequently, the pyruvate molecules are transported into the mitochondria, where they enter the Krebs cycle. During this cycle, pyruvate undergoes further degradation, releasing additional energy and producing carbon dioxide as a metabolic waste product.

The electron transport chain represents the concluding stage of aerobic respiration, where the role of oxygen becomes paramount. The energy harvested from the previous stages is utilized to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, establishing a proton gradient. This gradient is essential for the synthesis of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. Electrons are sequentially transferred through a series of protein complexes embedded in the membrane. Ultimately, these electrons are accepted by oxygen, which combines with protons and electrons to form water, a benign end product.

In the absence of oxygen, the electron transport chain cannot operate effectively, preventing the cell from generating the substantial amounts of ATP necessary for survival. This underscores the vital importance of oxygen for aerobic organisms. This necessity is also reflected in our respiratory process: we inhale oxygen to provide the final electron acceptor for cellular energy production, while exhaling carbon dioxide, the byproduct of this metabolic process.
