The human eye focuses light through the cornea and lens, which refract light to produce a clear image on the retina.

The process of focusing light in the eye is intricate and involves several components. Initially, when light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea, the transparent front surface. The cornea refracts, or bends, the incoming light, initiating the focusing process.

Once the light has traversed the cornea, it continues through the pupil, the small black opening at the center of the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. The size of the pupil is adjustable, controlled by the iris, to regulate the amount of light entering the eye. In bright conditions, the iris contracts, making the pupil smaller to limit light intake. Conversely, in dim lighting, the iris relaxes, enlarging the pupil to allow more light to enter.

Subsequently, the light reaches the lens, a transparent structure positioned behind the iris and pupil. The lens further refracts the light, concentrating it onto the retina, the light-sensitive layer located at the back of the eye. The lens has the ability to change its shape; it can become thinner or thicker to adjust the focus, enabling us to see objects clearly at varying distances. This adjustment process is known as accommodation.

The shape of the lens is controlled by the ciliary muscles, which are attached to it. When these muscles contract, they cause the lens to thicken, increasing its refractive power to focus on nearby objects. When the ciliary muscles relax, the lens becomes thinner, decreasing its refractive power to focus on distant objects.

Ultimately, the light that has been focused by both the cornea and lens forms an image on the retina. This image is transformed into electrical signals by the photoreceptor cells located in the retina. These signals are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve, allowing us to perceive the image.
