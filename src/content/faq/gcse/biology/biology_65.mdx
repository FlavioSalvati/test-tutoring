Monoclonal antibodies are generated through a process that begins with the injection of a mouse with a specific antigen. This antigen is a substance that activates the mouse's immune response. In reaction, the mouse's immune system produces B cells, each capable of generating a unique antibody that can bind to the antigen. These B cells are subsequently harvested from the mouse's spleen.

The next phase involves fusing the extracted B cells with myeloma cells, which are a type of cancerous cell known for their ability to replicate indefinitely. This fusion results in the formation of hybridoma cells, which combine the antibody-producing properties of the B cells with the longevity of the myeloma cells. This fusion process is typically facilitated by exposing the cells to a virus or a chemical agent, such as polyethylene glycol, which promotes the merging of their cell membranes.

After the hybridoma cells are successfully created, they are cultured in a suitable medium, where they proliferate and produce antibodies. Since all the antibodies produced by these cells are identical, they are referred to as 'monoclonal' antibodies. The antibodies are then collected and purified for various applications.

The primary advantage of this method lies in its ability to yield large quantities of identical antibodies, which can be utilized for a wide range of purposes, including medical treatments, diagnostic tests, and research initiatives. However, it is important to note that the process is complex and time-consuming, and it raises ethical considerations regarding the use of animals in research.
