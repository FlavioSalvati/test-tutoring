The SRY gene is essential for initiating male sex determination in mammals.

The SRY gene, which stands for Sex-determining Region Y, is located on the Y chromosome in mammals, including humans. This gene plays a pivotal role in triggering the development of male physical characteristics, marking the onset of male phenotype differentiation.

The SRY gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcription factor. Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of other genes by binding to specific regions of DNA, thereby facilitating the activation or repression of those genes. In the case of the SRY gene, the protein it produces attaches to DNA and activates other genes that are crucial for the development of male characteristics.

During early embryonic development, the SRY gene is actively expressed. It initiates the formation of testes, which would otherwise develop into ovaries. Once the testes are established, they begin to secrete male hormones, including testosterone. These hormones are responsible for driving the development of additional male characteristics, such as the penis and scrotum.

If the SRY gene is absent or malfunctioning, various conditions related to sex and gender may arise. For instance, an individual who is genetically male (possessing one $X$ and one $Y$ chromosome) may develop as female if the SRY gene is not functioning properly. Conversely, a genetically female individual (with two $X$ chromosomes) may develop as male if one of their $X$ chromosomes carries a functional copy of the SRY gene.

In conclusion, the SRY gene is a critical factor in sex determination in mammals. It initiates the cascade of events leading to the development of male characteristics, and its absence or dysfunction typically results in female development.
