The principle of light microscopy revolves around the magnification of images through the use of visible light and a series of lenses.

Light microscopy, often referred to as optical microscopy, is a technique employed to magnify small objects, such as cells, by utilizing visible light along with a system of lenses. The fundamental principle of this method is based on the refraction—meaning the bending—of light waves. When light travels through a lens, it bends, and this bending, or refraction, results in a magnified image of the object under observation.

A light microscope consists of several key components: the eyepiece (or ocular lens), the objective lenses, the stage (where the specimen is placed), and the light source. Light emitted from the source passes through the specimen positioned on the stage. The objective lens collects this light and magnifies the image, while the eyepiece provides an additional level of magnification, allowing the observer to see the enlarged image.

The magnification power of a light microscope is determined by the combination of the eyepiece and the objective lens. For instance, if the eyepiece has a magnification of $10\times$ and the objective lens has a magnification of $40\times$, the total magnification would be:

$$
10\times \times 40\times = 400\times
$$

Light microscopes are invaluable tools in biology, as they enable us to observe the structure and details of cells and tissues that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. However, these microscopes have inherent limitations. The resolution—defined as the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced points—of a light microscope is constrained by the wavelength of light. This implies that there is a maximum level of detail we can achieve, even at the highest magnifications.

In summary, the principle of light microscopy harnesses the power of light and lenses to magnify images, allowing us to perceive small details that would otherwise remain unseen. This technique is essential in the field of biology, facilitating in-depth studies of cells and tissues.
