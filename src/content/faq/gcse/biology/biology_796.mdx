When blood glucose levels become excessively high, it can lead to a condition known as hyperglycaemia, which may result in various health complications.

Hyperglycaemia, characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, occurs when there is an overabundance of glucose in the bloodstream. This situation can arise if the body does not produce enough insulin—a hormone secreted by the pancreas that facilitates the entry of glucose into cells—or if the body is unable to utilize insulin effectively. Hyperglycaemia is often associated with diabetes, a chronic condition that impairs the body's ability to process blood sugar.

In response to rising blood glucose levels, the pancreas increases the secretion of insulin. Insulin plays a vital role in enabling the body's cells to absorb glucose and utilize it for energy. However, if the body fails to produce sufficient insulin, or if the cells develop resistance to insulin's effects, glucose can accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to hyperglycaemia.

Symptoms of hyperglycaemia may include frequent urination, heightened thirst, headaches, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. If left unmanaged, elevated blood glucose levels can result in serious complications, such as damage to blood vessels, which can contribute to heart disease and stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, and vision problems.

Moreover, extremely high blood glucose levels can precipitate a life-threatening condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis. This occurs when the body resorts to breaking down fat for energy due to its inability to utilize glucose effectively. This metabolic process generates byproducts called ketones, which can accumulate in the bloodstream and lead to a dangerous decrease in the body's pH, making it overly acidic.

Thus, it is crucial to maintain a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, and, if necessary, use medications to manage blood glucose levels and prevent hyperglycaemia. For individuals with diabetes, regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to ensure they remain within a safe range.
