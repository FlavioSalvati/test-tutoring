Anaerobic respiration is distinct from aerobic respiration in that it occurs in the absence of oxygen, resulting in the production of less energy.

To elaborate, both aerobic and anaerobic respiration are cellular processes designed to generate energy. However, they differ significantly in their mechanisms. Aerobic respiration, as indicated by its name, requires oxygen to proceed. This process consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. It is highly efficient, yielding up to $38$ molecules of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which serves as the primary energy currency of the cell, from a single molecule of glucose.

Conversely, anaerobic respiration does not utilize oxygen. It also initiates with glycolysis but diverges from aerobic pathways by undergoing either lactic acid fermentation or alcoholic fermentation instead of proceeding to the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. These anaerobic processes help regenerate the essential NAD$^+$ required for glycolysis but produce significantly less ATP. Specifically, anaerobic respiration results in the generation of only $2$ ATP molecules per glucose molecule, making it far less efficient than its aerobic counterpart.

Another important distinction lies in the by-products produced by each type of respiration. Aerobic respiration yields carbon dioxide and water, which can be readily expelled from the body. In contrast, anaerobic respiration can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid in muscles, contributing to discomfort and fatigue. In the case of yeast cells, anaerobic respiration results in the production of alcohol and carbon dioxide, which is why this process is exploited in brewing and bread-making.

In summary, while both aerobic and anaerobic respiration are vital for sustaining life, aerobic respiration is generally favored due to its higher efficiency. Nonetheless, anaerobic respiration serves as a crucial alternative for energy production in scenarios where oxygen availability is limited, such as during intense physical exercise or within certain microorganisms.
