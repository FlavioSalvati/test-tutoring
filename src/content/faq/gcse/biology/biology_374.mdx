Plants convert light energy into chemical energy through a vital process known as photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is fundamental to the survival of plants and certain other organisms, allowing them to transform light energy—primarily from the sun—into chemical energy. This energy is stored in the form of glucose, which serves as a crucial resource for plant growth and reproduction.

The photosynthesis process occurs in specialized cellular structures called chloroplasts, which are predominantly found in the cells of green plants. These chloroplasts contain a pigment known as chlorophyll, which plays a key role in absorbing light energy. The light energy captured by chlorophyll is utilized to combine carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) from the atmosphere with water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) from the soil, resulting in the production of glucose ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$) and oxygen ($\text{O}_2$). This process can be summarized with the following chemical equation:

$$
6\text{CO}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{light energy} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\text{O}_2.
$$

Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (commonly referred to as the Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which is then used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen produced is released as a byproduct, while the hydrogen is utilized in the subsequent stage of photosynthesis.

In the Calvin cycle, the hydrogen combines with carbon dioxide to synthesize glucose. Although this phase does not directly require light, it depends on the products generated from the light-dependent reactions. The glucose produced can be used by the plant as an energy source or converted into other compounds, such as starch, for later storage.

In summary, photosynthesis allows plants to convert light energy into chemical energy. This complex process involves the absorption of light by chlorophyll and the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide and water, underscoring its significance in the life cycle of plants.
