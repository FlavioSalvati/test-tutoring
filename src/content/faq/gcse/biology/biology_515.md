The primary greenhouse gases responsible for global warming are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases.

**Carbon Dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$)** is the most significant greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. The primary source of $\text{CO}_2$ emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas for electricity generation, heating, and transportation. Additionally, deforestation contributes to rising $\text{CO}_2$ levels, as trees absorb this gas. When trees are removed, the capacity of the environment to sequester $\text{CO}_2$ diminishes.

**Methane ($\text{CH}_4$)** is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas. It originates from various natural and anthropogenic sources. Natural sources include wetlands, termites, and oceans. Human activities that enhance methane emissions encompass fossil fuel extraction and livestock farming. Methane is particularly potent; its heat-trapping ability is significantly greater than that of $\text{CO}_2$.

**Nitrous Oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$)** is generated from agricultural and industrial processes, as well as from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. It is also produced during specific solid waste management practices. Although $\text{N}_2\text{O}$ is less abundant in the atmosphere compared to $\text{CO}_2$, it is approximately 300 times more effective at trapping heat.

**Fluorinated Gases** are synthetic greenhouse gases emitted from a range of industrial applications. While these gases are less common, they are extremely potent when released into the atmosphere. They are primarily used in electronics manufacturing, air conditioning, refrigeration, and aerosol production.

Each of these greenhouse gases has a different atmospheric lifespan, ranging from a few years to several thousand years. They remain in the atmosphere long enough to become well mixed, resulting in a relatively uniform concentration globally, regardless of the emissions source.
