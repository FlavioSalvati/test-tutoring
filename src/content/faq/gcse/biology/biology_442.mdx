Gibberellins are a group of plant hormones that play a critical role in various growth and developmental processes, particularly in seed germination. During this process, a dormant seed must 'awaken' and initiate growth, which requires energy stored within the seed, primarily in the form of starch. However, seedlings cannot utilize starch directly; it must first be broken down into simpler sugars for energy use.

This is where gibberellins become essential. They stimulate the synthesis of specific enzymes, such as amylase. Amylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of starch into maltose, a disaccharide sugar, through a process known as hydrolysis. The maltose is subsequently broken down into glucose, which the seedling can readily use for energy.

In addition to promoting enzyme synthesis, gibberellins also facilitate cell elongation and division in the developing seedling. This growth enhancement enables the seedling to push through the soil surface effectively. Furthermore, gibberellins can stimulate the production of other enzymes that degrade proteins and lipids stored in the seed, thereby providing additional nutrients necessary for the growing seedling.

In summary, gibberellins are vital for seed germination as they stimulate the synthesis of enzymes that break down stored food reserves in the seed. This process supplies the energy and nutrients required for the seedling to thrive.
