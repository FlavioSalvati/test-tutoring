A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure composed of DNA and proteins that carries genetic information in the form of genes.

Chromosomes are located in the nucleus of most living cells and serve as the primary carriers of genetic material. They consist of a complex of DNA and proteins known as chromatin, which is organized into a compact and efficient form through a series of folding and coiling processes.

The DNA within chromosomes is tightly coiled around proteins called histones. These histones play a crucial role in maintaining the shape of the chromosome and facilitating the tight packing of DNA. This DNA-protein complex is referred to as a nucleosome. A sequence of nucleosomes is then further coiled into a structure known as the 30 nm chromatin fiber, which is subsequently looped and folded to form the overall architecture of the chromosome.

Each chromosome features a constriction point known as the centromere, which divides the chromosome into two segments or "arms." The shorter arm is designated as the "p arm," while the longer arm is referred to as the "q arm." The position of the centromere on each chromosome gives it a distinctive shape, which can be utilized to describe the location of specific genes.

Chromosomes are not visible in the cell’s nucleus—not even under a microscope—when the cell is in interphase (not dividing). However, during cell division, the DNA that composes the chromosomes becomes more tightly packed, rendering them visible under a microscope. Much of what researchers know about chromosomes has been acquired through observations made during cell division.

Each species has a characteristic number of chromosomes. For instance, humans possess 23 pairs of chromosomes: 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes, known as autosomes, and one pair of sex chromosomes, designated as X and Y. Each parent contributes one chromosome to each pair, resulting in children inheriting half of their chromosomes from their mother and half from their father.
