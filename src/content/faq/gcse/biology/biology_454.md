Human sex determination is primarily governed by the combination of sex chromosomes, specifically the X and Y chromosomes.

In humans, each cell typically contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, totaling 46 chromosomes. Among these pairs, 22 are called autosomes and are identical in both males and females. The 23rd pair consists of the sex chromosomes, which differ between the sexes: females possess two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).

During reproduction, each parent contributes one chromosome from each pair. Consequently, a mother with the genotype XX can only pass on an X chromosome. In contrast, a father with the genotype XY can pass on either an X or a Y chromosome. If the father contributes his X chromosome, the offspring will be female (XX). If he contributes his Y chromosome, the offspring will be male (XY).

This mechanism of sex determination is referred to as XY sex-determination. The Y chromosome contains a crucial gene known as SRY (Sex-determining Region Y), which initiates male development. When the SRY gene is present, the embryo develops as male. Conversely, in the absence of this gene (as in XX individuals), the embryo will develop as female.

It is essential to recognize that while this is the standard pattern of sex determination, there are exceptions. Some individuals may possess atypical chromosomal configurations, such as XXY or XYY, or may have only one sex chromosome (X or Y). These variations can result in a diverse array of physical and developmental traits.

In summary, an individual's sex is predominantly determined by the combination of sex chromosomes inherited from their parents, particularly the presence or absence of the Y chromosome and the SRY gene it carries.
