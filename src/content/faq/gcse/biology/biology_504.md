To conduct a practical investigation into decay, you will need organic material, appropriate containers, and controlled environmental conditions.

First, determine the specific type of decay you wish to study. This could involve the decomposition of food, plant material, or other forms of organic matter. Once you have selected your subject, obtain a sample. Examples of samples include a piece of fruit, a leaf, or a piece of meat.

Next, set up your experiment by placing your sample in a container that allows you to control the environmental conditions. For instance, if you want to investigate how temperature affects decay, you should place your sample in both a warm environment and a cool environment, enabling you to compare the decay rates in each setting.

You will also need to decide how to measure decay. Possible methods include observing changes in the sample's appearance, measuring its weight, or employing more advanced techniques such as testing for the presence of specific gases.

It is crucial to keep all other variables constant so that any differences you observe can be directly linked to the variable you are testing. For example, if you are examining the effect of temperature, ensure that humidity and light levels remain unchanged in both environments.

Lastly, record your observations over a specified period, which could span days, weeks, or even months, depending on the nature of your investigation. Be diligent in documenting your observations regularly and accurately, as these records will form the foundation of your results.

Conducting a practical investigation into decay can be an enlightening way to explore the natural world and the processes that govern it. Always remember to handle all materials safely and dispose of them properly once your experiment is concluded.
