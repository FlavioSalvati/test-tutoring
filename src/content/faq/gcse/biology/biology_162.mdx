The brain comprises three primary components: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem.

The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is divided into two hemispheres. Each hemisphere is further segmented into four major lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe. The cerebrum is responsible for higher cognitive functions, including thinking, learning, and consciousness. It also governs voluntary actions and processes sensory information from the body. The outer layer of the cerebrum, known as the cerebral cortex, is highly folded, facilitating the majority of information processing.

Located at the rear of the brain, the cerebellum plays a crucial role in coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining balance, and ensuring muscle coordination. Additionally, it is involved in motor learning, which enhances the smoothness and accuracy of movements. The cerebellum receives input from sensory systems and the spinal cord, using this data to regulate and fine-tune motor activities.

The brainstem serves as the critical connection between the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord. It oversees many fundamental functions vital for survival, such as regulating heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure. The brainstem is also responsible for various reflexes and facilitates the transmission of information between the brain and the rest of the body. It consists of three parts: the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.

In addition to these major components, the brain houses several other important structures, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, and limbic system. The thalamus functions as a relay station for sensory information, while the hypothalamus is responsible for regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, and other homeostatic processes. The limbic system, which includes key structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala, plays a significant role in emotion, memory, and behavior.
