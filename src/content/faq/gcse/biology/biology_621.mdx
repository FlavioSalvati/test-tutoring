Monoclonal antibody treatments can lead to a range of side effects, including fever, nausea, headache, rash, and low blood pressure.

Monoclonal antibodies are artificially produced molecules that replicate the immune system's capacity to combat harmful pathogens such as viruses. They are utilized in the treatment of various conditions, including cancers, autoimmune disorders, and infections. However, similar to all medical therapies, monoclonal antibodies can induce side effects. The severity of these side effects can vary based on the individual and the specific monoclonal antibody treatment administered.

Among the most common side effects are fever, nausea, headache, rash, and low blood pressure. Typically, these reactions are mild and transient, although they may be uncomfortable. Fever and nausea represent the body's general responses to foreign substances. Headaches may arise due to fluctuations in blood pressure or other physiological changes resulting from the treatment. Rashes can indicate an allergic reaction to the therapy, while low blood pressure may occur if the treatment impacts the cardiovascular system.

In certain cases, more serious side effects may manifest. Infusion reactions, which are allergic responses that occur during or after administration of the treatment, are notable examples. Symptoms of infusion reactions can include fever, chills, nausea, headache, rash, shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and in severe instances, life-threatening anaphylaxis.

Another significant concern is the potential alteration of the immune system's function. Since monoclonal antibodies are engineered to target specific components of the immune system, they may sometimes provoke unexpected immune responses. This could result in autoimmune disorders, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells.

It is crucial to understand that not everyone undergoing monoclonal antibody treatment will experience these side effects. Healthcare providers carefully assess the potential benefits of treatment against the associated risks. If you have any concerns regarding your treatment, it is advisable to discuss them with your healthcare provider.
