Common plant diseases often exhibit symptoms such as leaf spots, wilting, stunted growth, mould, and discolouration.

Plant diseases can manifest in various ways, depending on the specific disease and the affected plant species. One of the most prevalent symptoms is the presence of leaf spots. These spots typically appear as small, dark areas on the leaves, often surrounded by yellow halos. Leaf spots are frequently caused by fungal or bacterial infections.

Wilting is another common symptom of plant diseases, characterized by drooping leaves and stems that lose their rigidity. While wilting can result from a lack of water, if adequate watering does not rectify the issue, it may indicate an underlying disease.

Stunted growth is a symptom that is often overlooked, as it can arise from several factors, such as poor soil quality or insufficient sunlight. However, if a plant is not growing as expected, it may be a sign of a disease affecting the roots or hindering the plant's ability to absorb essential nutrients.

Mould is a clear indicator of disease in plants, often appearing as a white, powdery substance on the leaves or stems. This condition is usually caused by fungal infections that thrive in damp and humid environments.

Discolouration is another widespread symptom of plant diseases. This may manifest as yellowing leaves, brown spots, or a general fading of the plant's typical coloration. Discolouration often indicates a nutrient deficiency, but it can also result from diseases that impair the plant's ability to photosynthesize effectively.

In conclusion, it is crucial to monitor these symptoms closely to identify and address plant diseases early on. Regular inspections, proper watering practices, and ensuring that plants receive the right nutrients can help prevent many common diseases.
