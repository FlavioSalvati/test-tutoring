Antibiotic resistance refers to the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of an antibiotic to which they were previously sensitive.

Antibiotics are medications designed to prevent and treat bacterial infections. They function by either killing bacteria or inhibiting their reproduction and spread. However, bacteria have the capacity to evolve and develop resistance to these medications, rendering them less effective. This phenomenon is termed antibiotic resistance.

The development of antibiotic resistance occurs through the process of natural selection. When a population of bacteria is exposed to an antibiotic, certain individuals may possess mutations that confer reduced susceptibility to the drug. These resistant bacteria are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing their resistance traits to their offspring. Over time, this can lead to a significant increase in the population of resistant bacteria, diminishing the effectiveness of the antibiotic.

The misuse and overuse of antibiotics exacerbate this issue. Inappropriate usage—such as not completing a prescribed course of antibiotics—creates opportunities for bacteria to survive and develop resistance. Furthermore, using antibiotics to treat viral infections, for which they are ineffective, also contributes to the rise of antibiotic resistance.

Antibiotic resistance poses a serious global health threat, as it complicates the treatment of bacterial infections. Infections caused by resistant bacteria can result in extended hospital stays, increased medical expenses, and higher mortality rates. Therefore, it is crucial to use antibiotics responsibly to mitigate the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.
