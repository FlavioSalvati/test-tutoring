Sensory neurons are responsible for conveying information from sensory receptors to the central nervous system (CNS).

Also known as afferent neurons, sensory neurons are essential for how our bodies interpret and interact with the surrounding environment. They convert external stimuli—such as changes in temperature, light, sound, or pressure—into internal electrical impulses. These impulses are subsequently transmitted to the brain or spinal cord, which constitute the central nervous system.

The process initiates when sensory receptors, located throughout various parts of the body, detect environmental changes. Upon detecting these stimuli, the sensory receptors generate electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted by sensory neurons, which function as messengers, carrying the information to the CNS.

Once the CNS receives these signals, it interprets them, enabling us to perceive and respond to our environment. For instance, if you touch a hot stove, sensory receptors in your skin detect the heat and generate an electrical signal. This signal is conveyed by sensory neurons to your brain, which interprets it as pain, prompting you to quickly withdraw your hand.

In addition to their crucial role in sensory perception, sensory neurons are also integral to reflex actions. Reflex actions are automatic and rapid responses to stimuli that help protect the body from harm. For example, if you step on a sharp object, sensory neurons transmit the pain signal to your spinal cord. In response, the spinal cord sends a signal back to your leg muscles, causing you to lift your foot. This entire process occurs before the brain has a chance to process the pain signal, highlighting the vital role of sensory neurons in ensuring our survival.
