The Linnaean system, also known as Linnaean taxonomy, is a hierarchical method for classifying living organisms, originally developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. This system organizes species into a series of increasingly specific categories. The primary taxonomic ranks, listed from the broadest to the most specific, are: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.

1. **Kingdom**: This is the highest and most general level of classification. There are five recognized kingdoms: 
   - $Animalia$ (animals)
   - $Plantae$ (plants)
   - $Fungi$ 
   - $Protista$ 
   - $Monera$ (bacteria)

2. **Phylum**: Each kingdom is subdivided into multiple phyla. For instance, the $Animalia$ kingdom includes phyla such as:
   - $Chordata$ (animals with backbones)
   - $Arthropoda$ (insects, spiders, and crustaceans)

3. **Class**: This is the third rank, where each phylum is divided into classes. For example, the $Chordata$ phylum includes classes such as:
   - $Mammalia$ (mammals)
   - $Aves$ (birds)

4. **Order**: The fourth rank involves the division of each class into orders. For example, the $Mammalia$ class is composed of orders like:
   - $Carnivora$ (carnivorous mammals)
   - $Primates$ (which includes humans)

5. **Family**: Each order is further divided into families. For instance, the $Carnivora$ order includes families such as:
   - $Felidae$ (cats)
   - $Canidae$ (dogs)

6. **Genus**: The sixth rank divides each family into genera. For example, the $Felidae$ family comprises genera like:
   - $Panthera$ (lions, tigers, leopards)
   - $Felis$ (domestic cats)

7. **Species**: The final rank is the species, where each genus is divided into species. For example, the genus $Panthera$ includes species such as:
   - $Panthera\;leo$ (lion)
   - $Panthera\;tigris$ (tiger)

Each of these ranks offers progressively more specific information about an organism, aiding scientists in classifying and understanding the relationships among various species.
