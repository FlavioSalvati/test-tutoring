Plants possess an innate immune system that enables them to detect and respond to pathogen attacks by recognizing specific molecules associated with these pathogens.

Similar to animals, plants have an immune system designed to protect them from pathogenic invasions. This immune system is innate, meaning it is present from the outset and does not require prior exposure to a pathogen for development. Central to the plant immune response is the identification of specific molecules known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These PAMPs are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) located on the surface of plant cells.

Upon invasion by a pathogen, the pathogen releases PAMPs, which are subsequently recognized by the PRRs. This recognition initiates a cascade of responses within the plant cell, including the production of defensive chemicals, the reinforcement of the cell wall, and the activation of programmed cell death in the affected region to prevent the pathogen's spread. This initial immune response is referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI).

However, some pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade PTI by producing effector molecules. These effectors can disrupt the plant's immune response, facilitating the pathogen's infection. In retaliation, plants have developed a secondary defense mechanism known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). In ETI, specific plant proteins are capable of recognizing these effector molecules, which triggers a more robust immune response.

In summary, plants employ a sophisticated two-tiered immune system to recognize and combat pathogen attacks. The first layer, PTI, identifies general pathogen-associated molecules, while the second layer, ETI, targets specific effector molecules produced by pathogens to undermine the plant's immune defenses. This intricate system equips plants to defend against a diverse array of pathogens and to adapt to emerging threats.
