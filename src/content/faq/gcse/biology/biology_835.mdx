Ethene, also known as ethylene, is a naturally occurring plant hormone that significantly influences the fruit industry by accelerating the ripening process of various fruits. This property is especially beneficial for fruits that are typically harvested before they fully ripen, such as bananas, tomatoes, and avocados. By exposing these fruits to ethene gas in a controlled environment, producers can ensure that they ripen uniformly and reach the desired level of ripeness just in time for sale.

The application of ethene in the fruit industry leverages the biological process of fruit ripening. As fruits ripen, they naturally emit ethene, which triggers the production of specific enzymes. These enzymes initiate various changes in the fruit's texture, color, flavor, and aroma. For instance, they can break down the cell walls of the fruit, resulting in a softer texture, and convert starches into sugars, enhancing sweetness.

In practice, the fruit industry often manipulates this natural ripening process to satisfy consumer demand. Fruits are usually harvested while they are still green and firm, making them easier to transport without damage. Upon reaching their destination, these fruits are exposed to ethene gas, which activates the ripening process, enabling them to become ripe and ready for consumption within a few days. This technique is commonly referred to as 'forced ripening' or 'artificial ripening'.

In summary, ethene is essential to the fruit industry as it allows producers to regulate the ripening process, ensuring that fruits arrive at the market at the ideal stage of ripeness. This not only enhances the quality and flavor of the fruits but also minimizes waste, as fewer fruits are damaged during transportation.
