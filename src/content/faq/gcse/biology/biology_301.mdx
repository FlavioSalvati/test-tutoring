The main stages of mitosis include prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis.

Mitosis is a fundamental process of cell division that results in the formation of two genetically identical daughter cells. This process is essential for growth and repair in multicellular organisms and is an integral part of the cell cycle. Mitosis consists of several distinct stages, each characterized by specific events and functions.

The first stage is prophase. During prophase, the chromatin within the cell's nucleus condenses to form visible chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids, which are connected at a region called the centromere. Concurrently, the nuclear envelope begins to disintegrate, and the mitotic spindle—a structure composed of microtubules—starts to assemble.

Following prophase is metaphase. In this stage, the chromosomes align along the center of the cell, a region known as the metaphase plate. The spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes, preparing to separate the sister chromatids.

Next is anaphase, during which the sister chromatids are pulled apart and moved toward opposite poles of the cell by the spindle fibers. This separation ensures that each daughter cell will receive one copy of each chromosome.

Telophase is the final stage of mitosis. During telophase, the chromosomes reach the poles of the cell and begin to decondense back into chromatin. A new nuclear envelope forms around each set of chromosomes, resulting in the creation of two distinct nuclei within the cell.

Cytokinesis, which often occurs concurrently with telophase, is the concluding step of cell division. This process involves the division of the cytoplasm to produce two separate cells. In animal cells, cytokinesis is achieved through a mechanism called cleavage, where the cell membrane pinches inward until the cell divides into two. In contrast, plant cells form a cell plate along the line of division, which eventually develops into a new cell wall.

Each of these stages is crucial for successful cell division, ensuring that each new cell inherits the correct number of chromosomes and is capable of functioning effectively.
