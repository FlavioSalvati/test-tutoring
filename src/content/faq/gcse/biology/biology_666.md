To assess the impact of exercise on heart rate, we compare the resting heart rate to the heart rate during and after physical activity.

First, it is essential to establish a baseline by measuring your resting heart rate. This value represents the number of times your heart beats per minute while you are at rest. To measure this, locate your pulse—commonly found on your wrist or neck—and count the number of beats within one minute.

Once you have determined your resting heart rate, you can begin your exercise routine and periodically monitor your heart rate. This can be done in a manner similar to measuring your resting heart rate, or you can utilize a heart rate monitor or fitness tracker. It is crucial to record your heart rate at various intervals: at the start of the exercise, during the activity, immediately after finishing, and during the recovery phase. This will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how your heart rate fluctuates in response to physical exertion.

The difference between your resting heart rate and your heart rate during and after exercise illustrates the effect of the exercise on your cardiovascular system. Typically, you will observe an increase in heart rate during exercise, as your heart works harder to circulate blood and deliver oxygen throughout your body. Following the activity, your heart rate should gradually return to its resting level as your body recovers.

It is important to recognize that several factors influence heart rate, including the type, intensity, and duration of exercise. For instance, high-intensity activities such as sprinting or weightlifting generally lead to a more significant increase in heart rate compared to low-intensity exercises like walking or gentle yoga. Additionally, prolonged exercise sessions usually result in a higher heart rate.

Keep in mind that individual heart rates can vary widely and are influenced by factors such as age, fitness level, and overall health. Therefore, it is vital to listen to your body and avoid overexerting yourself.
