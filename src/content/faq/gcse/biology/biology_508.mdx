Waste disposal methods encompass several techniques, including landfill, incineration, recycling, composting, and hazardous waste disposal.

**Landfill** is the most prevalent waste disposal method. In this approach, waste is buried underground in designated areas designed to minimize the risk of groundwater contamination and protect the surrounding environment. Over time, the buried waste decomposes, producing methane gas, which can be captured and utilized as a source of energy.

**Incineration** represents another waste disposal technique. This process involves burning waste at high temperatures, which can reduce the waste volume by as much as $90\%$. The heat generated during incineration can be harnessed to produce electricity. However, this method can release harmful emissions, making it crucial to conduct the process in controlled environments equipped with appropriate filtration systems.

**Recycling** involves reprocessing waste materials into new products, including paper, glass, metal, and certain types of plastic. By recycling, we can significantly decrease the volume of waste sent to landfills while conserving energy and natural resources.

**Composting** is a sustainable method specifically designed for organic waste, such as food scraps and garden debris. Microorganisms break down this waste, transforming it into nutrient-rich compost that enhances soil fertility. This environmentally friendly approach reduces the amount of organic waste that ends up in landfills.

**Hazardous waste disposal** is essential for managing waste that poses risks to human health or the environment. Examples of hazardous waste include chemicals, batteries, and specific types of electronic waste. Due to its potential dangers, hazardous waste must be handled and disposed of with care. This may involve specialized treatment processes, secure landfill sites, or incineration in facilities designed to manage such materials safely.
