Spindle fibers play an essential role in mitosis, the process of cell division that results in two daughter cells, each containing an identical set of chromosomes as the parent nucleus. These fibers are integral components of the cell's cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments that provides structural support and facilitates cell movement.

During the early stages of mitosis, spindle fibers begin to assemble. They originate from structures known as centrosomes, which migrate to opposite poles of the cell. As the cell prepares for division, the duplicated chromosomes align along the equatorial plane of the cell. Each chromosome is tethered to both spindle poles by spindle fibers.

In the subsequent phase of mitosis, the spindle fibers undergo contraction, effectively pulling the chromosomes apart. This movement directs each set of chromosomes toward a different pole of the cell, ensuring that each daughter cell receives one complete set of chromosomes.

The absence of spindle fibers would hinder the proper movement of chromosomes during cell division, potentially resulting in daughter cells with an incorrect number of chromosomes. This imbalance can lead to various genetic disorders. Thus, the function of spindle fibers in mitosis is crucial for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genetic stability in cells.
