Cell walls in plants serve a vital function in defense by acting as a physical barrier against pathogens.

The cell wall is the outermost layer of a plant cell and is primarily composed of cellulose, a complex carbohydrate. This rigid structure constitutes the first line of defense against potential threats such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. By forming a physical barrier, the cell wall prevents these pathogens from entering the cell and causing damage.

In addition to its physical protective role, the cell wall also employs chemical defenses. In response to an attack, it can enhance its strength by producing compounds such as lignin and suberin, which increase the wall's thickness and hardness, making it more difficult for pathogens to penetrate. Moreover, some plants can produce antimicrobial substances that actively kill or inhibit the growth of pathogens.

Furthermore, the cell wall is integral to the plant's immune response. If a pathogen successfully breaches the cell wall, the plant can detect this intrusion and initiate a series of defensive actions. These responses include the production of defensive proteins and the release of signaling molecules that alert other parts of the plant to the presence of the pathogen.

In summary, the cell wall is an essential component of a plant's defense system. It provides a physical barrier against pathogens, can chemically reinforce itself in response to threats, and plays a significant role in the plant's immune response.
