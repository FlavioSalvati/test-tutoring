Mitosis and meiosis are two fundamental biological processes that involve cell division, but they serve distinct purposes and yield different results. 

### Mitosis
Mitosis is a process that occurs in all living organisms, facilitating cell growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. It results in the formation of two daughter cells, each genetically identical to the parent cell, with the same number of chromosomes. Specifically, if the parent cell has $n$ chromosomes, each daughter cell will also have $n$ chromosomes.

### Meiosis
In contrast, meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that occurs only in organisms that reproduce sexually. This process takes place in gametes (sperm in males and eggs in females) and produces four daughter cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. Therefore, if the parent cell has $n$ chromosomes, each of the four daughter cells will have $\frac{n}{2}$ chromosomes. Importantly, these daughter cells are not genetically identical to the parent cell or to one another, contributing to genetic diversity in the offspring.

### Stages of Division
The stages of mitosis and meiosis also differ significantly. Mitosis comprises four main stages: 

1. Prophase
2. Metaphase
3. Anaphase
4. Telophase

In contrast, meiosis involves two rounds of division, known as meiosis I and meiosis II. Each of these rounds includes its own set of stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. This complexity is why meiosis results in four daughter cells, compared to the two produced by mitosis.

### Conclusion
In summary, while both mitosis and meiosis are crucial processes of cell division, they differ markedly in their purposes, outcomes, and stages. Mitosis primarily facilitates growth and repair by producing identical cells, whereas meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction and promotes genetic diversity by generating genetically distinct cells.
