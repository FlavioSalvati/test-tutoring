Reaction times can be measured in practical experiments using either a simple ruler drop test or digital software applications.

In a typical classroom setting, the ruler drop test is a widely adopted method for assessing reaction times. In this procedure, one individual holds a ruler vertically, ensuring that the $0 \, \text{cm}$ mark is at the top while the other end dangles downward. The person being tested positions their thumb and forefinger at the bottom of the ruler without making contact. The first person then drops the ruler unexpectedly, and the second individual must catch it as quickly as possible. The point at which the ruler is caught indicates their reaction time; the lower the catch point, the faster the reaction time.

Alternatively, digital software or online tools can be employed to measure reaction times. These applications typically present a visual or auditory stimulusâ€”such as a color change on the screen or a sound. The participant must respond as swiftly as possible by clicking a button or pressing a key. The software then calculates the elapsed time between the stimulus presentation and the participant's response.

In more advanced settings, such as laboratories, researchers can utilize sophisticated equipment to measure reaction times. For instance, a light sensor can detect a flash of light, while a pressure sensor can record the time taken for an individual to press a button in response. These methods yield highly accurate measurements of reaction times.

Regardless of the method chosen, it is essential to conduct multiple trials and calculate an average reaction time to ensure a reliable measurement. This approach helps to account for any anomalies or outliers in the data, leading to more robust results.
