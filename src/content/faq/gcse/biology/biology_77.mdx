Enzymes play a vital role in helping plants defend themselves against pathogens by producing defensive chemicals and enhancing their physical barriers.

These biological catalysts accelerate chemical reactions, including those integral to the plant's immune response. When a plant is invaded by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi, it mounts a defense by synthesizing a variety of defensive chemicals. These substances, which comprise antimicrobial compounds and toxins, are specifically designed to kill or inhibit the growth of the invading pathogens. The production of these defensive chemicals is regulated by enzymes.

One notable example is the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), which is crucial in the synthesis of phenolic compounds that form part of the plant's chemical defense system. Upon pathogen attack, the activity of PAL increases, leading to an elevated production of phenolic compounds. These compounds can directly eliminate pathogens or fortify the plant's cell walls, thereby making it more difficult for pathogens to infiltrate.

Furthermore, enzymes contribute to reinforcing the plant's physical barriers. The plant cell wall serves as a primary defense against pathogens. Enzymes such as peroxidases and laccases facilitate the cross-linking of cell wall components, enhancing the wall's strength and resistance to pathogen invasion.

In addition to these functions, certain enzymes can initiate a process known as 'programmed cell death' in the cells surrounding the infection site. This strategy, akin to a 'scorched earth' policy, involves the plant sacrificing some of its own cells to limit the pathogen's spread. Enzymes involved in this process include proteases, which degrade proteins, and nucleases, which break down nucleic acids.

In conclusion, enzymes are indispensable to the plant's defense mechanisms against pathogens. They regulate the production of defensive chemicals, strengthen physical barriers, and can even prompt the death of infected cells to curb the spread of pathogens.
