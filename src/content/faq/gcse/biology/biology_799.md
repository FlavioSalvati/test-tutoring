Nitrogen waste is eliminated from the body through the excretory system, primarily via the kidneys in the form of urine.

The removal of nitrogenous waste is a vital function of the excretory system. This process begins with the breakdown of proteins and nucleic acids, which contain nitrogen. During metabolism, these substances produce a toxic waste product known as ammonia. Since ammonia is harmful to the body, it must be converted into a less toxic compound. This conversion occurs in the liver through a process called the urea cycle, which transforms ammonia into urea.

Once formed, urea enters the bloodstream and is transported to the kidneys. The kidneys play a crucial role in filtering waste products from the blood, including urea. They accomplish this through a process known as filtration, where blood is forced through microscopic structures called nephrons. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus—a tiny cluster of capillaries—and a tubule. The glomerulus filters the blood, producing a liquid known as filtrate, which contains waste products and substances that the body does not need, such as urea.

The filtrate then moves down the tubule, where water and other essential substances are reabsorbed into the bloodstream. The remaining waste, including urea, is concentrated to form urine. The urine is subsequently transported to the bladder via the ureters, where it is stored until excretion occurs through the urethra.

In addition to the kidneys, both the skin and lungs contribute to the excretion of nitrogen waste. The skin releases small amounts of urea through sweat, while the lungs expel nitrogen in the form of nitrogen gas as part of the respiratory process. Nevertheless, the kidneys remain the primary organs responsible for the removal of nitrogen waste from the body.
