Photosynthesis plays a fundamental role in the carbon cycle by transforming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into organic compounds.

This process is primarily conducted by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, enabling them to convert light energy—most commonly from the sun—into chemical energy. Photosynthesis is essential to the carbon cycle, a biogeochemical process in which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of our planet.

During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) from the atmosphere. This $\text{CO}_2$, along with water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) absorbed from the soil, is utilized to synthesize glucose ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$), a type of sugar that serves as an energy source for the plants. Additionally, this process releases oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) back into the atmosphere. The glucose produced is not only used by the plant for growth and reproduction but is also stored in its tissues. When animals consume these plants, the carbon contained in the glucose is transferred to them.

The carbon stored in plants and animals eventually returns to the atmosphere through the process of respiration. During respiration, glucose is broken down to release energy, resulting in the production of $\text{CO}_2$ as a by-product. Furthermore, when plants and animals die, their bodies, along with their wastes and remains, are decomposed by bacteria and fungi in a process known as decomposition. This process also contributes to the release of carbon back into the atmosphere in the form of $\text{CO}_2$.

In this manner, photosynthesis helps to maintain the balance of carbon in the atmosphere. It is a critical component of the carbon cycle, ensuring that carbon is continuously cycled and recycled throughout Earth's ecosystems. Without photosynthesis, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide would rise significantly, potentially leading to an intensified greenhouse effect and global warming. Thus, photosynthesis not only contributes to the carbon cycle but also plays an essential role in regulating the Earth's climate.
