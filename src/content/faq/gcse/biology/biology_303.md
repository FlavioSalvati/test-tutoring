Embryonic stem cells possess the remarkable ability to differentiate into any cell type within the body, whereas adult stem cells exhibit a more restricted potential.

Embryonic stem cells are obtained from embryos that are approximately three to five days old, a stage referred to as the blastocyst. At this point, the embryo consists of around $150$ cells. These cells are classified as pluripotent stem cells, meaning they can either divide to produce more stem cells or differentiate into any cell type in the body. This unique versatility makes embryonic stem cells valuable for the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues and organs.

In contrast, adult stem cells are present in small quantities within various adult tissues, such as bone marrow and adipose (fat) tissue. While adult stem cells are typically multipotent—capable of developing into multiple cell types—their differentiation potential is usually confined to the specific types of cells found in the organ or tissue where they reside. For instance, hematopoietic stem cells located in the bone marrow can differentiate into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, but they cannot develop into liver or lung cells.

The primary distinctions between embryonic and adult stem cells revolve around their differentiation capabilities, abundance, and accessibility. Embryonic stem cells can transform into any cell type in the body due to their pluripotent nature, whereas adult stem cells are generally limited to differentiating into the cell types native to their tissue of origin. Additionally, embryonic stem cells can be harvested in larger quantities compared to adult stem cells; however, their use raises ethical concerns because they are sourced from human embryos.
