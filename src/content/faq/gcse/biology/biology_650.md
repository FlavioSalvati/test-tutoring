The by-products of photosynthesis are oxygen and glucose.

Photosynthesis is a process that takes place in the chloroplasts of green plants. It's a vital process for life on Earth as it is the primary source of all oxygen in the atmosphere. During photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. The glucose is used by the plant for energy and growth, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere.

The process of photosynthesis can be broken down into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is then released as a by-product.

In the light-independent reactions, which occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts, the hydrogen produced in the light-dependent reactions is combined with carbon dioxide to produce glucose. This glucose can then be used by the plant for energy or converted into other substances, such as cellulose or starch.

In summary, photosynthesis is a complex process that involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. The by-products of this process, oxygen and glucose, are essential for life on Earth. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere and used by animals for respiration, while glucose provides energy for the plant and can be stored for later use.
