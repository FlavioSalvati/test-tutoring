Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process that occurs in plants, algae, and certain bacteria. During this process, these organisms convert light energy—primarily from the sun—into chemical energy stored in the form of glucose. This transformation is essential for life on Earth, as it serves as the primary source of organic compounds and the majority of energy required by living organisms.

The reactants involved in photosynthesis are carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). These substances initiate the photosynthetic process. Plants absorb water through their roots, which is then transported to the leaves. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide is taken in from the atmosphere through tiny openings in the leaves known as stomata.

Photosynthesis occurs within specialized cell structures called chloroplasts, where chlorophyll—a green pigment found in the leaves—plays a key role. Chlorophyll captures light energy, which is utilized to combine carbon dioxide and water, resulting in the production of glucose ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$). This sugar serves as an energy source for the plant. Additionally, oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) is generated as a by-product and released into the atmosphere.

In summary, through the process of photosynthesis, the reactants (carbon dioxide and water) are transformed into products (glucose and oxygen). This process is vital not only for the survival of plants but also for all life on Earth. The oxygen produced is essential for respiration in most organisms, while the glucose provides a crucial energy source and serves as a building block for other important biomolecules.
