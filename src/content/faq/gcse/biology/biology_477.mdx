Examples of extinct species include the Dodo bird, the Tasmanian tiger, the Passenger pigeon, and the Woolly mammoth.

The Dodo bird, native to Mauritius, is one of the most renowned examples of extinction. This flightless bird stood approximately $1$ metre tall and weighed up to $23$ kilograms. It became extinct in the late $17^{th}$ century primarily due to hunting by sailors and the introduction of invasive species.

The Tasmanian tiger, also known as the Thylacine, was a carnivorous marsupial found in Tasmania, Australia, and New Guinea. It measured about the size of a large dog, with a head-body length ranging from $100$ to $130$ cm. The last known individual of this species died in captivity in $1936$, and it was declared extinct in $1986$. The primary factors contributing to its extinction included hunting, disease, the introduction of domestic dogs, and habitat destruction.

The Passenger pigeon was once the most populous bird in North America, with estimates suggesting a population of $3$ to $5$ billion individuals. However, due to rampant hunting and habitat loss, this species became extinct in the early $20^{th}$ century. The last known individual, a female named Martha, died in captivity in $1914$.

The Woolly mammoth, a species that roamed during the Pleistocene epoch, is another well-known example of extinction. These large mammals resembled modern elephants but were characterized by long, curved tusks and a thick covering of long hair. Woolly mammoths are believed to have become extinct around $4,000$ years ago. The causes of their extinction are still a subject of debate, but are likely attributed to climate change and overhunting by early humans.

These examples underscore the diverse causes of species extinction, including hunting, the introduction of invasive species, disease, habitat destruction, and climate change. They serve as a poignant reminder of the critical importance of conservation efforts aimed at protecting existing species from a similar fate.
