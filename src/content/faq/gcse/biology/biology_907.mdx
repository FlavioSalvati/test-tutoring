The Linnaean system classifies species based on shared physical characteristics, organizing them into a hierarchical structure of taxonomic ranks.

Named after the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, this classification method is also referred to as binomial nomenclature or binary nomenclature. The system is structured as a hierarchy, beginning with broad categories and narrowing down to more specific classifications. The primary taxonomic ranks, from the broadest to the most specific, are as follows: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.

Each organism is assigned a two-part scientific name consisting of the genus and the species. The genus name is always capitalized, while the species name is written in lowercase, and both are typically italicized. For instance, humans are classified as $Homo\ sapiens$, where $Homo$ represents the genus and $sapiens$ denotes the species.

The Linnaean system groups organisms based on shared physical traits. Organisms are classified as a species if they exhibit a high degree of similarity and are capable of interbreeding to produce fertile offspring. Subsequently, species are grouped into genera, genera into families, and so forth, based on these shared characteristics.

This classification system enables scientists to organize the immense diversity of life on Earth and to comprehend the relationships among different organisms. However, it is important to recognize the limitations of the Linnaean system. For example, it does not take into account genetic similarities and differences that may not be evident from physical characteristics alone. Despite these limitations, the Linnaean system remains a foundational tool in the field of biology.
