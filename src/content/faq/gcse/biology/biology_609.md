Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection against infectious diseases that arises when a substantial portion of a population becomes immune.

Also referred to as community immunity, herd immunity is a fundamental concept in epidemiologyâ€”the study of how diseases spread. It occurs when a significant percentage of the population gains immunity to an infectious disease, thereby providing a protective barrier for those who remain susceptible. Immunity can be achieved either through previous infection and subsequent recovery or through vaccination.

The significance of herd immunity lies in its capacity to control the transmission of contagious diseases. When a large segment of the population is immune, the disease encounters fewer potential hosts, which decreases its ability to spread. This is especially crucial for safeguarding individuals who cannot be vaccinated, such as newborns, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems.

For instance, if $80\%$ of a population is immune to a virus, then four out of every five individuals who come into contact with an infected person will not become ill and, consequently, will not transmit the disease further. This mechanism helps keep the spread of infectious diseases under control. Depending on the contagiousness of a particular infection, immunity levels of approximately $70\%$ to $90\%$ of the population are generally necessary to establish herd immunity.

It is important to recognize, however, that herd immunity does not guarantee protection for every individual, and it is not universally applicable to all diseases. It is most effective for infections that spread directly from person to person, such as measles or influenza. Conversely, for diseases transmitted through other vectors, such as mosquitoes or ticks, the concept of herd immunity is less impactful.

In conclusion, herd immunity is a crucial element of public health, as it limits the spread of infectious diseases, protects those who cannot be vaccinated, and may contribute to the eventual eradication of certain diseases.
