Gene therapy is an innovative approach used to treat diseases by replacing, inactivating, or introducing genes into cells to correct genetic disorders.

This rapidly evolving field of medicine holds tremendous potential for addressing a variety of diseases. The fundamental concept of gene therapy is to utilize DNA as a therapeutic agent. It operates by introducing, replacing, or inactivating specific genes, thereby assisting the body in combating or preventing disease.

Gene therapy can be categorized into two primary types: somatic and germline therapy. Somatic gene therapy involves modifying genes in somatic (body) cells, such as those found in bone marrow or blood. This approach can provide treatment to the individual patient, but the genetic alterations are not inherited by future generations. Conversely, germline gene therapy entails altering genes in reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in the cells that produce them. Changes made through germline therapy are passed down to subsequent generations.

Gene therapy has the potential to treat a broad spectrum of diseases, including inherited disorders, certain types of cancer, and specific viral infections. For instance, it is currently being explored as a treatment for conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and some cancers. In these scenarios, the defective gene is replaced with a healthy counterpart, enabling the body to function normally.

The gene therapy process begins with the creation of a DNA segment containing the appropriate, healthy version of the faulty gene. This segment is then inserted into a vector, typically a virus that has been genetically modified to carry human DNA. The vector serves to deliver the DNA into the patient's cells. If the procedure is successful, the new gene will produce a functional protein, effectively addressing the underlying issue and potentially curing the disease.

Despite its promise, gene therapy is still largely experimental and is currently employed only for diseases that lack alternative treatment options. The process is intricate and carries various risks and complications, including immune responses, inflammation, and the potential risk of oncogenesis (cancer development). Nevertheless, the prospective advantages of gene therapy render it a hopeful avenue for future medical treatments.
