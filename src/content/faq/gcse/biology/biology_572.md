The primary distinctions between diffusion and facilitated diffusion pertain to the involvement of proteins and the specific types of molecules being transported.

Both diffusion and facilitated diffusion are classified as passive transport processes, which means they do not require energy to move substances across cell membranes. However, they exhibit several key differences.

**Diffusion** is a straightforward process in which molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equilibrium is achieved. This movement is driven by the kinetic energy of the molecules themselves. Small, non-polar molecules, such as oxygen ($O_2$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), can easily traverse the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and, therefore, diffuse directly through it.

In contrast, **facilitated diffusion** utilizes protein channels or carriers embedded in the cell membrane to assist in the transport of larger, polar, or charged molecules, such as glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) and ions (e.g., $Na^+$, $K^+$). These molecules are unable to pass through the lipid bilayer directly; thus, the proteins facilitate or "assist" their movement across the membrane. Although the molecules still move down their concentration gradient during this process, the presence of transport proteins is essential.

Another significant difference lies in the rate of transport. In simple diffusion, the rate is directly proportional to the concentration gradient: the steeper the gradient, the faster the diffusion occurs. Conversely, in facilitated diffusion, the transport rate depends not only on the concentration gradient but also on the number and availability of carrier proteins. Once all the carrier proteins are occupied, the transport rate reaches a maximum, a phenomenon known as saturation.

In summary, while both diffusion and facilitated diffusion serve as passive transport mechanisms, they differ in the types of molecules they transport, the necessity of proteins for transport, and the factors influencing their transport rates.
