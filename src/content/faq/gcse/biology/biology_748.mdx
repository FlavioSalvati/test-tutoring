Ethene, commonly referred to as ethylene, is a gaseous plant hormone that significantly impacts various processes throughout a plant's life cycle, including growth regulation, fruit ripening, and responses to environmental stressors.

One of the most notable functions of ethene is its role in the ripening of fruits. It catalyzes the conversion of starches into sugars, leads to the softening of the fruit, and induces changes in color. This explains why fruits ripen more quickly when placed in a closed bag; the ethene gas they emit becomes trapped, thereby accelerating the ripening process.

In addition to its influence on fruit ripening, ethene plays a critical role in regulating plant growth. Depending on the species and developmental stage, ethene can either promote or inhibit growth. For instance, it encourages cell elongation in the stems while potentially inhibiting growth in the roots. Ethene is also essential in the process of abscission, which involves the shedding of leaves, flowers, and fruits from the plant.

Moreover, ethene is vital in a plant's response to environmental stresses, such as flooding, drought, injury, and infection. When a plant experiences injury, it produces ethene to activate the growth of new cells that facilitate healing and repair.

In summary, ethene is a multifaceted plant hormone that regulates an array of critical processes. From growth and development to fruit ripening and stress responses, it plays an integral role in the survival and reproductive success of plants.
