Deforestation significantly contributes to climate change by releasing stored carbon dioxide and diminishing the Earth's ability to absorb greenhouse gases.

Trees are vital components of the global carbon cycle. They absorb carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, a process that converts $CO_2$ and sunlight into oxygen and glucose. The carbon absorbed is stored in the tree's biomass, which includes its trunk, branches, leaves, and roots. When trees are cut down and either burned or allowed to decay, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This phenomenon is referred to as a carbon dioxide "source."

The impact of deforestation extends beyond merely increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels; it also reduces the number of trees available to absorb future emissions. Forests function as carbon "sinks," meaning they absorb more carbon dioxide than they release. The destruction of these forests eliminates this crucial carbon sink, disrupting the balance between carbon sources and sinks.

Moreover, forests have a cooling effect on the Earth's surface. They absorb sunlight and release water vapor into the atmosphere through a process known as transpiration. This process is essential for regulating the Earth's temperature. When forests are removed, this cooling effect is lost, contributing further to global warming.

Deforestation also often results in soil degradation and erosion. Without trees to anchor the soil and recycle nutrients through leaf litter, soils can become infertile and susceptible to being washed away by rain. This erosion can release additional carbon stored in the soil back into the atmosphere.

In conclusion, deforestation affects climate change in multiple ways: it releases stored carbon dioxide, reduces the planet's capacity to absorb future emissions, disrupts temperature regulation, and can lead to soil degradation that exacerbates carbon emissions.
