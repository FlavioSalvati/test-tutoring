Cancer cells exhibit distinct characteristics that set them apart from normal cells, primarily their uncontrolled division and failure to undergo programmed cell death at the appropriate stage of the cell cycle.

In a healthy organism, cells grow, divide, and die in a regulated manner. This meticulous process is governed by the cell cycleâ€”a sequence of phases that cells navigate to successfully replicate. Normal cells possess a predetermined lifespan and undergo a process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death, at a specific phase in the cell cycle. Apoptosis plays a vital role in maintaining the body's equilibrium by eliminating old, damaged, or unnecessary cells, thereby making room for new, healthy ones.

In contrast, cancer cells operate under a different paradigm. They possess the ability to bypass the body's regulatory mechanisms that govern cell division and death. Rather than undergoing apoptosis at the appropriate time, cancer cells persist in living and dividing. This unregulated proliferation results in the accumulation of cells, forming what is known as a tumor.

The root cause of this aberrant behavior can be traced back to the DNA of cancer cells. Mutations or alterations in the DNA can impact genes responsible for regulating cell division and death. Certain mutations can activate genes known as oncogenes, which encourage cell division, while others can inactivate tumor suppressor genes, which are responsible for decelerating cell division or initiating timely cell death.

Furthermore, cancer cells have developed strategies to evade the immune system, which typically identifies and eliminates abnormal cells. They can achieve this by altering the proteins present on their surface, effectively rendering themselves 'invisible' to immune cells.

In summary, the primary distinction between cancer cells and normal cells lies in their behavior during the cell cycle. Cancer cells exhibit uncontrolled division and fail to die when they should, leading to tumor formation. This abnormal behavior stems from genetic changes and their capacity to evade the immune response.
