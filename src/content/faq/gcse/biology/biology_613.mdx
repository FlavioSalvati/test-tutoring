Clinical trials typically consist of four distinct phases: Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and Phase IV.

**Phase I** is the initial stage of testing involving human subjects. The primary objectives of this phase are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the study of how the body processes the drug), and pharmacodynamics (the study of how the drug affects the body) of a new drug. Typically, this phase includes a small cohort of healthy volunteers, ranging from $20$ to $100$ individuals, who are often compensated for their participation. During this phase, the drug is administered for the first time to assess its safety profile, determine the appropriate dosage range, and identify any potential side effects.

**Phase II** trials expand the participant pool to larger groups, generally involving between $100$ and $300$ individuals. The focus of this phase is twofold: to evaluate the drug's efficacy and to continue safety assessments initiated in Phase I, now in a larger and more diverse population. It is during Phase II that many drug development efforts fail, often due to the identification of insufficient efficacy or adverse toxic effects.

**Phase III** trials are randomized controlled multicenter studies that involve substantial patient populations, typically ranging from $300$ to $3,000$ or more, depending on the specific disease or medical condition being studied. These trials are designed to provide a definitive evaluation of the drug's effectiveness compared to existing 'gold standard' treatments. Given their large scale and extended duration, Phase III trials tend to be the most expensive, time-consuming, and complex to design and conduct.

**Phase IV** trials, also known as post-marketing surveillance trials, occur after a drug or treatment has received regulatory approval and is available on the market. The primary aim of these studies is to monitor the drug's performance across a broad and diverse population. It is not uncommon for side effects to remain undetected until a larger number of individuals have used the drug over an extended period. Findings from Phase IV trials can lead to significant outcomes, including the withdrawal of a drug from the market or the imposition of usage restrictions based on safety and efficacy data collected during the study.
