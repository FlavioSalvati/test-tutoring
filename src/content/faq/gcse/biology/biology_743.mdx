Infertility can be addressed through hormonal treatments that aim to stimulate or regulate ovulation in women and enhance sperm production in men.

Hormonal therapies for infertility mainly target the hormones responsible for regulating reproductive functions. In women, infertility is frequently linked to irregular or absent ovulation. This is where hormonal interventions become crucial. The most commonly prescribed fertility medications for women include Clomiphene and Gonadotropins. Clomiphene works by stimulating the pituitary gland to secrete higher levels of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinising Hormone (LH), which subsequently encourage the ovaries to produce and release eggs. Conversely, Gonadotropins are administered through injections and directly stimulate the ovaries to generate multiple eggs.

In men, infertility is often associated with low sperm count or compromised sperm quality. Hormonal treatments for men typically involve the use of testosterone or gonadotropins. Testosterone therapy can increase sperm count, while gonadotropins enhance sperm quality by stimulating the testes to produce a greater quantity of healthy sperm.

Additionally, in certain situations, other hormones such as progesterone may be utilized in women to prepare the uterine lining for pregnancy or to support early stages of pregnancy. In men, hormones like human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) might be employed to stimulate the testes to produce more testosterone and sperm.

It is essential to recognize that while hormonal treatments can enhance fertility, they also carry potential side effects and risks. For instance, women may face an increased likelihood of multiple pregnancies, and men may experience a higher risk of prostate issues. Consequently, these treatments should always be conducted under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.
