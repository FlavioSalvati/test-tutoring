Symptoms of an overactive thyroid, medically known as hyperthyroidism, include a rapid heart rate, weight loss, nervousness, and excessive sweating.

Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces an excess of the hormones thyroxine ($T_4$) and triiodothyronine ($T_3$). These hormones are vital for regulating the body's metabolism, and an overproduction can accelerate bodily functions, resulting in various symptoms.

One of the most prevalent symptoms is a rapid heart rate. Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in regulating heart function, so when levels are elevated, the heart may beat faster than normal. This condition can also lead to palpitations, where individuals experience the sensation of their heart pounding, fluttering, or beating irregularly for brief periods, ranging from a few seconds to several minutes.

Another common symptom is weight loss. Thyroid hormones influence the metabolic rate, which is the process by which the body converts food into energy. An excess of these hormones can lead to an increased metabolic rate, causing weight loss even if food intake remains the same or increases.

Nervousness and irritability are also frequently reported symptoms. Elevated thyroid hormone levels can impact the nervous system, leading to feelings of anxiety or restlessness. Individuals may find it challenging to concentrate or relax.

Excessive sweating is another notable symptom. Thyroid hormones help regulate body temperature, and an overproduction can cause the body to overheat, resulting in increased perspiration. Additional symptoms may include fatigue, tremors (shaking hands), frequent bowel movements, and in women, alterations in the menstrual cycle.

It's important to recognize that these symptoms can vary significantly among individuals and may also be indicative of other health conditions. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
