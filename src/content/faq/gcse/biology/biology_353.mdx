Handwashing is a crucial practice for reducing the transmission of diseases by effectively removing pathogens from the skin. This simple yet powerful method helps prevent the spread of various disease-causing germs and bacteria.

When we come into contact with surfaces, objects, or other individuals, our hands can pick up a wide range of germs. If we subsequently touch our eyes, nose, or mouth, or handle food without washing our hands, these germs can enter our bodies and potentially lead to illness. Furthermore, germs can also be transmitted to others through direct contact or by touching contaminated surfaces.

By washing our hands frequently—especially before eating or preparing food and after using the toilet—we can significantly reduce the presence of these harmful germs and prevent their spread.

The effectiveness of handwashing lies in its ability to physically remove germs from the skin. The combination of soap and water initiates a chemical reaction that dislodges germs, allowing them to be rinsed away. Additionally, soap breaks down the outer membrane of many viruses and bacteria, thereby neutralizing them.

To ensure thorough germ removal, it is vital to wash hands correctly. This process involves the following steps:

1. Wet your hands with clean, running water.
2. Apply soap and rub your hands together to create a lather.
3. Scrub all surfaces of your hands, including the backs, between the fingers, and under the nails, for at least $20$ seconds.
4. Rinse your hands well under running water.
5. Dry your hands using a clean towel or allow them to air dry.

While hand sanitizer can be a convenient alternative when soap and water are not available, it is generally less effective at removing all types of germs. Moreover, hand sanitizer is not as effective on visibly dirty or greasy hands. Therefore, handwashing with soap and water remains the most effective method for reducing disease transmission.
