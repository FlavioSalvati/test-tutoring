Signs of fungal infections in plants can include discolouration, leaf spots, wilting, stunted growth, and mouldy coatings.

Fungal infections in plants can manifest in various ways, depending on the specific type of fungus and the plant species affected. One of the most prevalent indicators is discolouration, which can present as yellowing leaves or as brown or black spots and patches. These discolourations typically result from fungal damage to the plant's cells, which disrupts its ability to photosynthesise effectively.

Another common symptom of fungal infection is the appearance of spots on leaves or other plant parts. These spots can vary in size and colour, often appearing darker than the surrounding tissue. The fungus usually grows on the plant's surface, and such spots may be accompanied by a powdery or mouldy coating.

Wilting is another symptom that may indicate a fungal infection. Many fungi can impair a plant's water transport system, leading to a loss of turgor pressure and resultant wilting. Stunted growth is also a significant sign of fungal infection; fungi can hinder a plantâ€™s nutrient absorption, resulting in slower growth and smaller overall size.

Mouldy coatings, particularly on fruits or flowers, are clear indicators of specific types of fungal infections. These coatings are composed of fungal spores, which can be dispersed to other plants via wind, water, or insects.

In some instances, a plant suffering from a fungal infection may exhibit less obvious signs, such as a general decline in health or vigour. This decline may occur because the plant's resources are being redirected to combat the infection, leaving it with insufficient energy for growth and reproduction. Therefore, it is crucial to regularly inspect plants for any signs of disease, including those caused by fungi.
