Cytokinins are essential phytohormones that significantly influence plant growth and development by promoting cell division and differentiation. These processes are vital for the formation of new cells and tissues, thereby supporting overall plant growth.

One of the primary functions of cytokinins is to stimulate shoot development. They achieve this by encouraging the growth of buds, which are embryonic shoots located in the axils of leaves. By enhancing bud growth, cytokinins facilitate the development of new shoots, contributing to the vertical growth of the plant. This function is especially crucial for plants in dense environments, as it allows them to compete effectively for sunlight.

Moreover, cytokinins play a critical role in delaying leaf senescence, the aging process in plants. As leaves age, they typically lose chlorophyll and their ability to photosynthesize, which can hinder the plant's growth. Cytokinins can slow down this aging process by reducing the degradation of chlorophyll and other vital cellular components. This prolongs the functionality of the leaves, enhancing the plant's photosynthetic capacity and overall growth potential.

In addition to their direct effects, cytokinins also interact with other plant hormones to regulate various growth aspects. For instance, they collaborate with auxins—another class of plant hormones—to maintain a balance between shoot and root growth. This balance is crucial for the plant's health and survival, ensuring it has sufficient resources to support both above-ground and below-ground growth.
