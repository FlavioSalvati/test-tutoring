The normal range for blood glucose levels typically falls between $4.0$ to $5.4$ mmol/L when fasting and can rise to up to $7.8$ mmol/L two hours after eating.

Blood glucose levels, commonly referred to as blood sugar levels, represent the amount of glucose present in your bloodstream. Glucose is a type of sugar that serves as a vital source of energy for your body, originating from the foods you consume. When fasting—defined as not eating for at least eight hours—the normal range for blood glucose levels is generally between $4.0$ and $5.4$ mmol/L. Following a meal, it is expected that your blood glucose levels will increase; however, they should not exceed $7.8$ mmol/L two hours after eating.

These values may vary slightly depending on individual characteristics and the specific laboratory conducting the analysis. Nevertheless, these ranges are widely accepted as standard. It is important to recognize that blood glucose levels can fluctuate throughout the day, typically being lowest in the morning before breakfast and rising after meals due to the influx of glucose from digested food.

Consistently elevated blood glucose levels may indicate a condition such as diabetes, while persistently low levels could suggest hypoglycemia. Both of these conditions warrant medical attention.

The body maintains blood glucose levels through a process known as homeostasis, with the pancreas playing a critical role. When blood glucose levels increase, the pancreas secretes a hormone called insulin, which facilitates the absorption of glucose by cells, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. Conversely, if blood glucose levels drop, the pancreas releases another hormone called glucagon, which prompts the release of stored glucose to elevate blood sugar levels.

Understanding and maintaining your blood glucose levels within the normal range is essential for overall health, particularly for individuals with conditions like diabetes. These individuals must regularly monitor their blood glucose levels to avoid potential health complications.
