Stress hormones, primarily cortisol and adrenaline, initiate physical responses that prepare the body to react to perceived threats.

These hormones are produced by the adrenal glands, which are small organs situated atop each kidney. When the brain perceives a threat, the hypothalamus—a small region responsible for regulating many bodily functions—sends a signal to the adrenal glands, prompting them to release stress hormones. The key stress hormones involved are cortisol and adrenaline, also known as epinephrine.

Adrenaline is instrumental in preparing the body for a "fight or flight" response. It increases heart rate, elevates blood pressure, and boosts energy supplies. Additionally, adrenaline suppresses non-essential bodily functions, such as digestion, while enhancing sensory perception, including sight and hearing. This hormone also sharpens the body’s focus, priming it for immediate action.

Conversely, cortisol plays a vital role in maintaining fluid balance and regulating blood pressure. It also suppresses non-essential functions such as the immune response and digestion. Cortisol curbs activities that would be unnecessary in a fight or flight scenario and enhances the body’s ability to repair tissues. Furthermore, it increases the levels of glucose in the bloodstream, optimizes the brain's utilization of glucose, and makes substances available that aid in tissue repair.

However, prolonged exposure to these stress hormones can have detrimental effects on health. Chronic stress may lead to various health issues, including heart disease, sleep disturbances, digestive problems, depression, obesity, and memory impairment. It can also weaken the immune system, rendering the body more vulnerable to infections.

In summary, stress hormones play a crucial role in preparing the body to respond to perceived threats. Nevertheless, it is essential to manage stress effectively to mitigate the potential negative impacts of prolonged exposure to these hormones.
