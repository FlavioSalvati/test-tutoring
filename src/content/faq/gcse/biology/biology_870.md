The process of meiosis consists of ten distinct stages: Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I, Telophase I, Cytokinesis I, Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II, and Cytokinesis II.

Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that results in four daughter cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes found in the parent cell. This two-part cell division process is essential for organisms that reproduce sexually and is divided into two main phases: Meiosis I and Meiosis II, each comprising several stages.

In Meiosis I, the cell begins with Prophase I, during which chromosomes condense and pair up. The nuclear envelope disintegrates, and spindle fibers begin to form. Next, in Metaphase I, the paired chromosomes align along the equatorial plane of the cell. During Anaphase I, these pairs are separated and move toward opposite poles of the cell. Telophase I concludes this phase, as the chromosomes reach the poles and the cytoplasm divides through a process known as Cytokinesis I, resulting in the formation of two daughter cells.

Meiosis II closely resembles mitosis. It begins with Prophase II, where chromosomes condense again and the nuclear envelope breaks down once more. In Metaphase II, spindle fibers form, and the chromosomes align at the cell's equator. During Anaphase II, sister chromatids separate and migrate to opposite ends of the cell. Telophase II follows, where the chromosomes gather at the poles and the nuclear envelope reforms. Finally, Cytokinesis II occurs, leading to the production of four haploid daughter cells.

These stages are critical for sexual reproduction as they promote genetic diversity. Errors that occur during meiosis can result in genetic disorders, making the understanding of these stages fundamental to the study of genetics.
