Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to a state akin to embryonic stem cells.

iPSCs represent a transformative type of stem cell that can be derived directly from adult somatic cells. The term "pluripotent" signifies that these cells possess the capability to differentiate into any adult cell type. This characteristic is particularly remarkable, considering that most cells in the human body are specialized and can only generate cells of the same variety. For instance, a skin cell can only produce additional skin cells. In contrast, iPSCs have the potential to form any cell or tissue that the body requires for repair and regeneration.

The generation of iPSCs involves reprogramming adult cells by introducing specific genes that are typically active in embryonic stem cells. This is often accomplished using viral vectors to deliver the required genes into the cells. Once inside, these genes effectively "reset" the adult cells to a pluripotent state, resembling that of embryonic stem cells.

The advent of iPSCs is viewed as a significant advancement in the field of regenerative medicine. They provide a promising avenue for creating patient-specific cells for therapeutic applications, circumventing the ethical dilemmas associated with the use of embryonic stem cells. For example, iPSCs could be utilized to generate new cardiomyocytes for a patient suffering from heart disease or to produce new neurons for individuals with neurological disorders.

Despite the promise that iPSCs hold, several challenges remain before they can be widely implemented in clinical settings. A primary concern is that the reprogramming process may introduce mutations in the cells, potentially increasing the risk of oncogenesis. Consequently, further research is essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of therapies based on iPSCs.
