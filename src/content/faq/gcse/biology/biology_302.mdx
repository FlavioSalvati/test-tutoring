During prophase of mitosis, chromosomes condense and become visible, while the nuclear envelope begins to break down.

To elaborate, prophase is the first stage of mitosis—the process through which a cell divides its genetic material equally between two daughter cells. During this stage, the cell's chromatin condenses into a highly organized structure known as chromosomes, which can be observed under a microscope. Each chromosome consists of two identical copies called sister chromatids, which are joined together at a region known as the centromere.

At the same time, the nucleolus—a small, dense, spherical structure within the nucleus—disappears. The nuclear envelope, which surrounds the nucleus, also starts to disintegrate, allowing the chromosomes to move freely within the cell.

Concurrently, outside the nucleus, the mitotic spindle begins to form. The mitotic spindle is composed of microtubules and is essential for the separation of chromosomes. The spindle fibers extend from structures called centrosomes, which migrate to opposite poles of the cell during prophase.

In summary, prophase is a critical phase in mitosis, during which the cell prepares for division by condensing its chromosomes, dismantling the nuclear envelope, and initiating the formation of the mitotic spindle. This preparation sets the stage for the subsequent phase of mitosis, metaphase, where the chromosomes align at the cell's equatorial plane.
