Cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream through a mechanism known as facilitated diffusion, which involves glucose transporter proteins.

Facilitated diffusion is a specific type of passive transport that enables substances to traverse cell membranes with the assistance of carrier proteins. Glucose, a simple sugar, is vital for cellular function. However, due to its relatively large molecular size, glucose cannot freely diffuse across the cell membrane. Instead, it relies on specialized proteins known as glucose transporters.

Among the various glucose transporters, the most prevalent are GLUT1 and GLUT4. These proteins are embedded in the cell membrane, functioning like gates that open and close to permit glucose entry. When the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream exceeds that within the cell, glucose molecules will naturally move from the area of higher concentration (the blood) to the area of lower concentration (the cell), following the principle of diffusion.

Despite this concentration gradient, glucose cannot pass through the cell membrane without the aid of glucose transporters. When a glucose molecule approaches a cell, it binds to the transporter protein. This binding induces a conformational change in the protein, allowing the glucose molecule to be transported into the cell. Once the glucose is inside, the transporter protein reverts to its original shape, ready to facilitate the transport of additional glucose molecules.

This entire process is termed 'facilitated' diffusion because the glucose molecules are assisted by the transporter proteins in crossing the cell membrane. This mechanism is essential for maintaining the body's energy levels, as glucose serves as the primary energy source for cells. Without facilitated diffusion and the presence of glucose transporter proteins, cells would be unable to access the necessary glucose required for their metabolic functions.
