The mark-recapture technique is a widely used method among ecologists for estimating the size of an animal population within a specific area.

Also referred to as the Lincoln Index, this technique is both simple and effective. The process begins with capturing a sample of animals from the population, marking them in a non-harmful manner, and then releasing them back into their natural habitat. After allowing some time for the marked individuals to mix back into the population, a second sample is captured, and the number of marked individuals within this sample is recorded.

The underlying principle of the mark-recapture method is that the proportion of marked individuals in the second sample should reflect the proportion of marked individuals in the overall population. For instance, if $10\%$ of the animals in the second sample are found to be marked, it can be inferred that approximately $10\%$ of the entire population was marked during the first sampling.

This technique is particularly advantageous for studying mobile or elusive species that are challenging to count directly. Nevertheless, its effectiveness relies on several key assumptions. First, it assumes that the marked individuals have had sufficient time to re-integrate into the population before the second sample is collected. Second, it presumes that the marking process does not influence the survival or recapture likelihood of the individuals. Lastly, it assumes that the population size remains constant between the two sampling events, with no significant births, deaths, immigration, or emigration occurring.

Despite these assumptions, the mark-recapture technique serves as a valuable tool in ecological research, yielding critical data on animal populations. This information can inform conservation strategies and deepen our understanding of wildlife and ecosystems.
