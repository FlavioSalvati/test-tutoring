Organisms are less abundant at higher trophic levels due to the decreasing availability of energy as one ascends the food chain.

In an ecosystem, energy flows sequentially from one trophic level to another, beginning with producers, such as plants, and progressing to various levels of consumers, including herbivores and carnivores. This energy flow is often illustrated as a pyramid, where the broad base signifies the substantial amount of energy available at the producer level, while the narrowing apex reflects the diminishing energy as one moves up through the trophic levels.

The decline in energy availability can be explained by the second law of thermodynamics, which asserts that whenever energy is transferred or transformed, a considerable portion is lost as heat. In the context of ecosystems, this means that when a herbivore consumes a plant, it does not absorb all the energy stored in that plant; some energy is inevitably lost as heat. Similarly, when a carnivore preys on a herbivore, it only acquires a fraction of the energy that the herbivore had. This energy loss is a primary reason for the reduced number of organisms at higher trophic levels; there simply isn't enough energy to sustain large populations.

Moreover, not all parts of organisms at one trophic level are consumed or digestible by organisms at the next level. For instance, bones, scales, fur, and other indigestible materials are often left uneaten, leading to further energy loss.

This concept is commonly referred to as the '10% rule,' which posits that approximately 10% of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next. Consequently, this principle explains why the number of organisms tends to decrease as one ascends the food chain and why top predators are typically found in limited numbers.
