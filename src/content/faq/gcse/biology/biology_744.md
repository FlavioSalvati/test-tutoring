In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is a medical procedure designed to assist individuals facing infertility by fertilising eggs outside the body. This method falls under the category of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and is often employed when other infertility treatments have not been successful.

The IVF process begins with closely monitoring and stimulating a woman's ovulatory cycle. This stimulation encourages the development of multiple follicles in the ovaries. Once the follicles are mature, eggs are retrieved from the ovaries. Concurrently, sperm from a male partner is collected and prepared for fertilisation. The retrieved eggs and the prepared sperm are then combined in a laboratory dish, which is placed in an incubator to foster fertilisation. After a few days, one or two resulting embryos are selected and transferred into the womanâ€™s uterus, where they may implant and develop, similar to a natural pregnancy.

The term 'in vitro' is derived from Latin, meaning 'in glass', which reflects the glass test tubes that were historically used in this procedure. Although modern IVF employs advanced technologies, the original nomenclature remains in use. IVF serves as a prominent treatment option for infertility, especially when previous assisted reproductive techniques have not yielded results.

IVF can address various infertility issues, including cases where a woman's fallopian tubes are damaged or when a man has low-quality sperm. It is also beneficial in situations where the underlying cause of infertility remains unidentified or when other treatments have failed. However, it is crucial to understand that while IVF can assist many couples in achieving pregnancy, it does not guarantee success. The likelihood of a successful pregnancy is influenced by numerous factors, including the age and overall health of the woman.
