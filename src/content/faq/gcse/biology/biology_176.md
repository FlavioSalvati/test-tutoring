Estrogen and progesterone are essential hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle by managing the growth and shedding of the uterine lining.

The menstrual cycle is a monthly process that prepares the female body for potential pregnancy. It consists of several stages, each governed by different hormones, including estrogen and progesterone.

The cycle begins with the follicular phase, during which the pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This hormone stimulates the growth of multiple follicles in the ovaries, each containing an egg. As the follicles mature, they begin to produce estrogen. This hormone promotes the thickening of the uterine lining, known as the endometrium, in preparation for a possible pregnancy.

Approximately in the middle of the cycle, an increase in estrogen levels triggers a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. This surge causes the most mature follicle to rupture and release its egg, a process referred to as ovulation. Following ovulation, the ruptured follicle transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone.

Progesterone plays a vital role in preparing the endometrium for the implantation of a fertilized egg. It makes the uterine lining spongy and rich in nutrients, creating an ideal environment to receive and nourish an embryo. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum disintegrates, leading to a decrease in progesterone levels. This decline triggers the shedding of the uterine lining, known as menstruation, marking the beginning of a new cycle.

In summary, estrogen and progesterone collaborate to regulate the menstrual cycle. Estrogen governs the growth of the uterine lining in the first half of the cycle, while progesterone prepares it for potential pregnancy in the second half. If pregnancy does not take place, the reduction in progesterone levels results in menstruation and the commencement of a new cycle.
