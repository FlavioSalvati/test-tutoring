Plant hormones play an essential role in the growth and development of plants, with five primary types identified: auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene. Each of these hormones has unique functions that contribute to various physiological processes.

**Auxins** are a group of hormones critical for plant growth. They are primarily responsible for cell elongation, which allows plants to grow taller. Auxins also regulate apical dominance, where the growth of lateral buds is suppressed to prioritize the development of the main stem. Additionally, auxins are involved in phototropism, guiding plants to grow towards light, and gravitropism, which directs growth in response to gravity.

**Gibberellins** are another important class of hormones that promote stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering. They play a vital role in breaking dormancy, a resting stage that seeds and buds enter. Furthermore, gibberellins stimulate the growth of leaves and stems and can lead to an increase in both the size and quantity of fruits.

**Cytokinins** are hormones that facilitate cell division and differentiation. They are particularly effective in promoting the growth of lateral buds, delaying leaf senescence (the aging process), and enhancing the mobilization of nutrients. Cytokinins also collaborate with auxins to regulate the growth and development of both roots and shoots.

**Abscisic acid (ABA)** is a hormone that is crucial for plant responses to stress. It plays a significant role in closing stomata—small openings on the leaf surface—during drought conditions to minimize water loss. Additionally, ABA is involved in maintaining seed dormancy, ensuring that seeds do not germinate until environmental conditions are favorable.

**Ethylene** is a gaseous hormone that influences the ripening of fruits. It is also involved in processes such as leaf abscission (the shedding of leaves), flower wilting, and the plant's response to mechanical stress. Depending on the species and developmental stage, ethylene can either stimulate or inhibit growth and development.

In summary, plant hormones are indispensable for the growth, development, and survival of plants. They regulate a wide array of processes, including cell division, elongation, stress responses, and fruit ripening, ensuring that plants can adapt to their environment and thrive.
