Glucagon plays a vital role in regulating blood glucose levels by increasing the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. It achieves this by stimulating the conversion of stored glycogen into glucose within the liver.

Produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas, glucagon is an essential hormone for maintaining the body's energy balance. When blood glucose levels fall—such as during fasting periods or between meals—the pancreas secretes glucagon into the bloodstream.

Once in circulation, glucagon targets the liver, where it activates the process of glycogenolysis, which is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. This newly generated glucose is subsequently released into the bloodstream, leading to an increase in blood glucose concentration. This mechanism ensures that the body's cells have a continuous supply of glucose to use as energy, even when dietary intake is insufficient.

In addition to stimulating glycogenolysis, glucagon also encourages gluconeogenesis, the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as amino acids and fatty acids. This process further enhances the increase in blood glucose levels.

It is essential to understand that glucagon and insulin function in a complementary manner, akin to a 'see-saw', to maintain optimal blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels are elevated, the pancreas secretes insulin, facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells and reducing blood glucose concentration. Conversely, when blood glucose levels drop, glucagon is released to elevate blood glucose concentration. This delicate balance between insulin and glucagon ensures that the body's cells consistently have access to the energy required for proper functioning.
