For a photosynthesis light intensity experiment, you'll need a water plant, a light source, a ruler, and a gas syringe.

To conduct a photosynthesis light intensity experiment, you'll need several pieces of equipment. The first is a water plant, such as Elodea, which is commonly used in photosynthesis experiments. This plant will be the subject of your experiment, as you'll be observing how changes in light intensity affect its rate of photosynthesis.

Next, you'll need a light source. This could be a lamp or a torch, but it's important that the intensity of the light can be varied. This is because you'll be changing the light intensity to see how it affects the rate of photosynthesis. You'll also need a ruler to measure the distance between the light source and the plant, as this will allow you to control the light intensity.

A gas syringe is another crucial piece of equipment for this experiment. This is used to measure the volume of oxygen produced by the plant, which is an indicator of the rate of photosynthesis. The more oxygen the plant produces, the faster it is photosynthesising.

You'll also need a stopwatch to time your experiment, and a thermometer to monitor the temperature. It's important to keep the temperature constant, as changes in temperature can also affect the rate of photosynthesis. Lastly, you'll need a beaker or a test tube to hold the plant and some water.

Remember, safety is paramount when conducting any experiment. Always wear safety goggles and a lab coat to protect your eyes and clothing. Also, handle the light source carefully to avoid burns or electrical shocks.
