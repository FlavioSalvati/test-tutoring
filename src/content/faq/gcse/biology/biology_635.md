Nematodes inflict damage on plants primarily by feeding on their roots, which disrupts the plant's ability to absorb nutrients and water. This disruption ultimately leads to stunted growth and reduced yields.

Nematodes, commonly referred to as roundworms, are microscopic, worm-like organisms found in the soil. They rank among the most abundant multicellular organisms on Earth, with various species that consume bacteria, fungi, and even other nematodes. However, certain species are plant-parasitic and can inflict considerable harm on crops and other vegetation.

These plant-parasitic nematodes utilize a specialized, needle-like mouthpart called a stylet to penetrate plant root cells. Once inside, they extract the cell contents, including essential nutrients and water necessary for the plant's growth and development. This feeding behavior not only damages the roots physically but also creates entry points for additional pathogens, increasing the risk of further disease.

The symptoms resulting from nematode damage can vary widely, depending on the nematode species and the type of plant affected. Common symptoms include stunted growth, yellowing or wilting leaves, and diminished yields. In cases of severe infestation, the affected plants may ultimately die.

Controlling nematodes can be particularly challenging due to their resilience. They are shielded from pesticides by their tough outer cuticle and the protective soil environment. Additionally, nematodes can reproduce swiftly, with some species capable of laying hundreds of eggs in a single cycle.

In summary, nematodes can cause significant harm to plants by feeding on their roots, thereby disrupting nutrient and water uptake. This disruption can lead to a range of detrimental symptoms, such as stunted growth and reduced yield, while also making plants more vulnerable to other diseases.
