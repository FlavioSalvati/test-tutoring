Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone that prepares the body for the 'fight or flight' response during stressful situations.

Produced by the adrenal glands, which are situated atop the kidneys, adrenaline plays a critical role in the body's acute stress response. This physiological reaction occurs in response to perceived threats, danger, or harmful events that may jeopardize survival.

When confronted with a stressful situation, the nervous system prompts the release of adrenaline into the bloodstream. This surge of adrenaline triggers a series of physiological changes designed to prepare the body to either confront the threat or escape from it. Key changes include an increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, expanded air passages that enhance oxygen flow to the muscles, dilation of the pupils, and a slowdown in digestive processes.

Additionally, adrenaline facilitates the conversion of glycogen—a stored form of sugar in the liver—into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This process provides a rapid burst of energy to the muscles, enabling a swift physical response to danger.

Moreover, adrenaline boosts sweat production and heightens mental alertness and focus, making individuals more aware of their surroundings and better equipped to react promptly.

In summary, the primary function of adrenaline is to prime the body for immediate action. It acts as a natural alarm system, preparing both the body and mind to either confront threats directly or flee as quickly as possible. This response is crucial for survival, allowing for rapid reactions in life-threatening situations.
