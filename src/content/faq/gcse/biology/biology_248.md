Water circulates through an ecosystem via a process known as the water cycle, which encompasses evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and transpiration.

The water cycle, also referred to as the hydrological cycle, is a continuous process that transports water across the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and underground. It begins with evaporation, where water from oceans, lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water transforms into water vapor due to the sun's heat. Additionally, plants contribute to this process through transpiration, wherein water is released from their leaves into the atmosphere.

As the water vapor ascends into the atmosphere, it cools and condenses to form clouds, marking the condensation stage. When the water droplets within these clouds become too heavy, they return to the Earth's surface as precipitation, which can manifest as rain, snow, or hail. This precipitation can then be absorbed by plants, flow into rivers and seas, or infiltrate the ground, thereby replenishing the Earth's water sources.

Furthermore, there is a process known as infiltration, in which water on the Earth's surface seeps into the ground, becoming part of the underground water system. This groundwater can be stored for extended periods, sometimes for thousands of years, before eventually being released back into the oceans or utilized by plants.

The water cycle is vital for life on Earth, ensuring that water is continually recycled and made accessible to all living organisms. It also plays a significant role in regulating the Earth's climate by facilitating the distribution of heat across the planet. Understanding the water cycle is essential for comprehending how ecosystems function and how they are impacted by human activities, such as deforestation and climate change.
