The primary threats to biodiversity include habitat destruction, climate change, overexploitation, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species.

**Habitat Destruction**  
Habitat destruction represents a significant threat to biodiversity. This phenomenon can arise from activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion, which result in the loss of essential habitats for numerous species. When habitats are altered or destroyed, the species that inhabit these areas often struggle to survive in different environments, resulting in a decline in biodiversity. For instance, the clearing of rainforests for palm oil production has led to a dramatic reduction in orangutan populations, with this species now classified as critically endangered.

**Climate Change**  
Climate change is another critical threat to biodiversity. Alterations in temperature and weather patterns can disrupt ecosystems, making it increasingly challenging for certain species to thrive. For example, rising ocean temperatures have caused coral bleaching, which significantly diminishes the diversity of marine life. Furthermore, climate change can lead to more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts, which can also have catastrophic effects on biodiversity.

**Overexploitation**  
Overexploitation, defined as the unsustainable use of species by humans, poses yet another serious risk to biodiversity. This includes practices such as overfishing, hunting, and the illegal wildlife trade. Overexploitation can result in rapid population declines for various species and, in severe cases, can drive them to extinction. A notable example is the overfishing of Atlantic cod, which has led to a significant reduction in its population.

**Pollution**  
Pollution—whether it affects air, water, or soil—can severely harm biodiversity. Contaminants can damage habitats and pose serious health risks to wildlife, sometimes even leading to death. For instance, oil spills can devastate marine ecosystems, resulting in a marked decrease in biodiversity.

**Invasive Species**  
Finally, invasive species can significantly threaten biodiversity. These species, introduced to new environments, often outcompete native species for resources, leading to declines in biodiversity. An example of this is the introduction of the grey squirrel to the UK, which has contributed to the decline of the native red squirrel population.

In summary, these interconnected threats to biodiversity necessitate urgent action to protect and preserve the diverse forms of life on our planet.
