The primary plant hormones that regulate growth and development include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.

**Auxins** are a class of plant hormones essential for coordinating various growth and behavioral processes throughout a plant's life cycle. They are primarily responsible for promoting cell elongation, which is a fundamental aspect of plant growth. Additionally, auxins are involved in phototropism, the mechanism by which plants grow towards light, and gravitropism, which describes how plants respond to gravitational forces.

**Gibberellins** represent another group of plant hormones that facilitate stem elongation, initiate seed germination, break dormancy in buds, and stimulate flowering and fruit development. They work synergistically with auxins to regulate overall growth and development in plants.

**Cytokinins** are hormones that promote cell division and the formation of shoots. They play a critical role in cell growth and differentiation, collaborating with auxins to manage cell division and differentiation in both roots and shoots. Moreover, cytokinins contribute to delaying the aging process in plants, helping to maintain their freshness and vitality.

**Abscisic acid (ABA)** is a plant hormone vital for regulating seed dormancy and the closure of stomata. Often referred to as the "stress hormone," ABA aids plants in responding to environmental stressors such as drought and low temperatures. It also inhibits growth, counteracting the growth-promoting effects of hormones like auxins and gibberellins.

Finally, **ethylene** is a gaseous plant hormone involved in processes such as fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf abscission. Unique among plant hormones due to its gaseous state, ethylene can diffuse through the air. It also plays a role in how plants respond to mechanical stress, stimulating the opening of flowers, the shedding of leaves, and the ripening of fruit.

In summary, the five primary hormones—auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene—play crucial roles in plant growth and development. Each hormone has distinct functions, yet they work in concert to ensure the healthy growth and development of plants.
