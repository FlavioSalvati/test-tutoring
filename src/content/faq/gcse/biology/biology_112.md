The brain consists of three primary components: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem.

The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is divided into two hemispheres. Each hemisphere is further subdivided into four key lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe. The cerebrum is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as thinking, learning, and consciousness. It controls voluntary movements and processes sensory information received from the body. The outer layer of the cerebrum, known as the cerebral cortex, is highly folded and is the primary site for information processing.

The cerebellum, located at the posterior part of the brain, plays a crucial role in coordinating voluntary movements, balance, and muscle coordination. Additionally, it is involved in motor learning, which refers to the enhancement of movement smoothness and precision. The cerebellum receives sensory information from various systems and the spinal cord, utilizing this data to fine-tune motor activity.

The brainstem serves as a vital connection between the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord. It governs many essential functions necessary for survival, including heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure regulation. The brainstem also oversees several reflexes and facilitates communication between the brain and the rest of the body. It is divided into three main regions: the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.

In addition to these major components, the brain houses several other significant structures, such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, and limbic system. The thalamus functions as a relay station for sensory information, while the hypothalamus regulates vital homeostatic processes, including body temperature, hunger, and thirst. The limbic system, which encompasses structures like the hippocampus and amygdala, is integral to emotional regulation, memory formation, and behavioral responses.
