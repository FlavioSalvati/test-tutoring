Pregnancy tests utilize monoclonal antibodies to detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a woman's urine.

Monoclonal antibodies are uniform immune cells, all derived from a single parent cell and produced in a laboratory setting. They are engineered to bind specifically to particular substances. In the context of pregnancy tests, these antibodies are specifically designed to target human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone produced by the placenta shortly after fertilization.

When a woman becomes pregnant, her body begins to produce hCG, which can be detected in both blood and urine. The levels of this hormone increase significantly during the early stages of pregnancy. A typical pregnancy test features a strip or stick embedded with monoclonal antibodies that are sensitive to hCG.

When a woman urinates on the test stick, the urine ascends along the strip and interacts with these antibodies. If hCG is present in the urine, it will bind to the antibodies, resulting in a color change that signifies a positive result. Conversely, if hCG is absent, the antibodies will remain unbound, and no color change will occur, indicating a negative result.

The incorporation of monoclonal antibodies in pregnancy tests ensures high specificity and accuracy. Since these antibodies are tailored to exclusively bind to hCG, they will not react with other hormones or substances present in the urine. This specificity means that a positive result is a reliable indication of pregnancy. However, it is essential to consider that various factors, such as the timing of the test and the concentration of hCG in the urine, can influence the accuracy of the results.
