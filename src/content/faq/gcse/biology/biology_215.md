Modern genetics bolsters the theory of evolution by offering compelling evidence of common ancestry and genetic variation over time.

The theory of evolution, first articulated by Charles Darwin, posits that all species on Earth have developed from common ancestors through a process known as natural selection. Recent advancements in genetics have provided significant support for this theory.

One of the primary ways genetics reinforces the concept of evolution is through the analysis of DNA. All living organisms share a fundamental genetic material: DNA. The similarities in DNA sequences among different species can elucidate their degree of relatedness. For instance, humans share approximately $98\%$ of their DNA with chimpanzees, which suggests a relatively recent common ancestor. This finding supports the theory of evolution by illustrating that species have diverged from shared ancestral origins.

Additionally, genetics underscores evolution through the examination of genetic variation. Genetic variation refers to the differences in DNA sequences among individuals within a species. This variation is crucial for the mechanism of natural selection. Individuals with advantageous traits—determined by their genetic makeup—are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing these beneficial traits to their offspring. Over time, this process results in changes to the genetic composition of a population, a phenomenon known as evolution.

The study of mutations further supports the theory of evolution. Mutations are alterations in the DNA sequence that can give rise to new traits. When these traits confer advantages in a particular environment, they are likely to become more prevalent in the population over time, thereby contributing to evolutionary change.

Finally, the field of comparative genomics, which involves comparing the genomes of various species, provides additional evidence for evolution. Research has shown that species with closer evolutionary relationships exhibit greater similarities in their genomes, reinforcing the notion of common ancestry.

In summary, modern genetics offers a wealth of evidence supporting the theory of evolution, encompassing insights into common ancestry, the role of genetic variation, and the impact of mutations on evolutionary processes.
