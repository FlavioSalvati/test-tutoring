Large molecules traverse the cell membrane through processes known as endocytosis and exocytosis.

Endocytosis and exocytosis are two essential mechanisms that cells utilize to transport large molecules across their membranes. Both processes fall under the category of "active transport," which necessitates energy input. This energy is required because these mechanisms move substances against their concentration gradient, meaning they transport molecules from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration.

Endocytosis is the process by which cells absorb molecules by engulfing them. During this process, the cell membrane encircles the target molecule, forming a vesicle—a small, spherical compartment that is separated from the cytosol by at least one lipid bilayer. Once formed, the vesicle detaches from the membrane and migrates into the cell, where the molecule can be utilized.

Conversely, exocytosis is the process through which cells expel waste materials or secrete substances. In this process, vesicles containing the molecules to be expelled are transported to the cell membrane. The membrane of the vesicle then fuses with the cell membrane, creating an opening through which the molecules can be released into the extracellular space.

These processes are crucial for cellular function. They enable cells to intake nutrients, eliminate waste, and facilitate communication with other cells. For instance, neurotransmitters—the chemicals responsible for transmitting signals in the nervous system—are released from nerve cells via exocytosis. Similarly, immune cells utilize endocytosis to engulf and eliminate invading pathogens.

In summary, large molecules cannot simply diffuse through the cell membrane due to their size. Instead, they depend on the active transport mechanisms of endocytosis and exocytosis to move in and out of cells. These processes require energy and involve the formation and fusion of vesicles with the cell membrane.
