Hormones are essential chemical messengers that travel through the body via the bloodstream after being released from various glands within the endocrine system.

The endocrine system comprises a network of glands, including the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, ovaries, and testes. Each of these glands produces specific hormones, which are secreted directly into the bloodstream. The bloodstream functions as a transport system, delivering these hormones to different parts of the body.

The process begins when a gland receives a signal to produce a hormone. This signal may originate from the brain or be triggered by another hormone. Once a hormone is synthesized, it is released into the bloodstream. The circulatory system carries the hormone throughout the body. However, hormones do not impact all cells equally; they specifically target cells known as target cells. These target cells possess unique receptors that correspond to the shape of the hormone. When a hormone reaches a target cell, it binds to its receptor, analogous to a key fitting into a lock. This binding event triggers a specific response within the cell, which may include processes such as growth, division, or protein synthesis.

The rate at which hormones travel through the body is influenced by the speed of blood circulation. Typically, it takes just a few minutes for a hormone to travel from its gland of origin to its target cells. However, the effects of hormones can be long-lasting, ranging from several hours to days. This longevity is due to the fact that hormones are not depleted upon binding to their target cells; instead, they are released back into the bloodstream, where they can continue to circulate until they are metabolized by the liver or kidneys.

In summary, hormones navigate through the bloodstream from the glands that produce them to the target cells they influence. This intricate process is vital for regulating numerous bodily functions, including growth, development, metabolism, and mood.
