The three domains in the three-domain system are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.

The three-domain system is a biological classification framework introduced by Carl Woese in $1990$. This system categorizes cellular life forms into three main domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. It was developed based on the analysis of genetic sequences, which uncovered a previously unrecognized group of organisms known as Archaea.

The first domain, Bacteria, is composed of prokaryotic microorganisms. These organisms are unicellular and lack a nucleus as well as other membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria exhibit remarkable diversity and can be found in a variety of environments, ranging from soil to the human gut. They play essential roles in ecosystems, including the decomposition of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients.

The second domain, Archaea, also consists of prokaryotic organisms. However, Archaea differ from Bacteria in several significant ways. Notably, their cell walls have a distinct composition, and they possess unique metabolic pathways. Archaea are often found in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, but they are also capable of surviving in more typical habitats.

The third domain, Eukarya, encompasses all organisms that have eukaryotic cells. These cells are characterized by the presence of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. The Eukarya domain includes a vast range of organisms, from single-celled protists to complex multicellular organisms such as animals and plants. This domain is further divided into four kingdoms: Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.

In conclusion, the three-domain system serves as a classification method for life forms based on their cellular structure and genetic characteristics. It highlights the fundamental distinctions between Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, offering a more accurate representation of the diversity of life on Earth.
