When blood glucose levels fall below the necessary threshold, the body initiates a response by releasing the hormone glucagon to elevate glucose levels.

Glucose, a type of sugar, is essential for the proper functioning of the human body. It serves as the primary energy source for the body's cells. When blood glucose levels decrease, this change is sensed by the alpha cells in the pancreas, which then release glucagon.

Glucagon functions as a counter-regulatory hormone to insulin, another hormone produced by the pancreas. While insulin lowers blood glucose levels when they are elevated, glucagon raises them when they are low. It accomplishes this by signaling the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is subsequently released into the bloodstream. This metabolic process is referred to as glycogenolysis.

In addition to promoting glycogenolysis, glucagon also stimulates the creation of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as proteins and fats, in a process known as gluconeogenesis. Both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis contribute to increasing blood glucose levels, thereby helping to restore balance.

If blood glucose levels remain low for an extended period, the adrenal glands respond by releasing cortisol, another hormone that aids in elevating blood glucose levels. Cortisol facilitates gluconeogenesis and decreases glucose uptake by cells, further assisting in maintaining adequate glucose availability.

In summary, the human body employs a sophisticated system to regulate blood glucose levels effectively. When glucose levels drop, hormones are released to stimulate the production and release of additional glucose, ensuring that the body's cells consistently have sufficient energy to operate efficiently.
