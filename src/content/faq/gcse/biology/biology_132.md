Geotropism, also referred to as gravitropism, is a crucial growth response in plants that occurs in relation to gravity. In this process, roots exhibit positive geotropism by growing downward, while shoots demonstrate negative geotropism by growing upward.

This phenomenon is essential for a plant's survival and development, as it allows for optimal orientation and access to vital resources. The roots' downward growth enables them to anchor the plant securely in the soil, facilitating the absorption of water and nutrients. Conversely, the upward growth of the shoots allows them to reach sunlight, which is critical for photosynthesisâ€”a process that converts light energy into chemical energy necessary for the plant's growth.

The underlying mechanism of geotropism involves plant hormones known as auxins. When a plant is tilted, gravity causes these auxins to accumulate on the lower side. In the roots, the increased concentration of auxins inhibits growth, resulting in the roots bending and growing downward. In contrast, in the shoots, auxins promote growth, leading the shoots to bend and grow upward.

In summary, geotropism is a fundamental biological process that directs the growth of plants in response to gravitational forces. It involves differential growth patterns in different parts of the plant, regulated by the distribution of auxins. This ensures that roots grow downward into the soil while shoots grow upward toward light.
