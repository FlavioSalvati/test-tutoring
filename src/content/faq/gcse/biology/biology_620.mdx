Monoclonal antibodies are engineered molecules that specifically target cells by recognizing and binding to unique proteins, known as antigens, on the surface of those cells.

These laboratory-produced antibodies mimic the natural ability of the immune system to combat harmful pathogens, such as viruses. Each monoclonal antibody is designed to interact with a single type of antigen, enabling them to specifically target particular cell types.

The process of creating monoclonal antibodies begins with the identification of the specific antigen present on the target cell. Once the antigen is identified, scientists can develop an antibody that will recognize and bind to it. This is typically achieved by injecting a mouse with the antigen, prompting the mouse's immune system to produce antibodies against it. The resulting antibodies are then harvested and cloned to generate large quantities of identical antibodies, which is why they are referred to as "monoclonal."

After being introduced into the body, these monoclonal antibodies circulate until they encounter cells displaying the matching antigen. Upon binding to these cells, the antibodies mark them for destruction by the body's immune system. This process is similar to how the body naturally employs antibodies to identify and eliminate harmful cells or pathogens.

In addition to marking cells for destruction, monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered to inhibit specific cellular functions. For instance, they can block signals that prompt cancer cells to grow and divide, potentially slowing or halting the progression of the disease.

In summary, monoclonal antibodies effectively target specific cells by recognizing unique proteins on their surfaces. They bind to these proteins, either marking the cell for destruction or obstructing its functions. This capability makes monoclonal antibodies a powerful tool in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer.
