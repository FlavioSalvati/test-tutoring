Mitosis and meiosis are two distinct types of cell division essential for living organisms. These processes play crucial roles in growth, repair, and reproduction, yet they differ significantly in their purposes, stages, and the types of cells they generate.

**Mitosis** occurs in somatic cells, which are all body cells except for the reproductive (sex) cells. This process results in two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, each retaining the same number of chromosomes. Mitosis is vital for growth and tissue repair. The process is divided into five stages: 

1. **Prophase**
2. **Prometaphase**
3. **Metaphase**
4. **Anaphase**
5. **Telophase**

Each of these stages is characterized by specific changes in cell structure and function, ultimately leading to the division of both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

In contrast, **meiosis** takes place in the formation of gametes or sex cells and is crucial for sexual reproduction. This process yields four daughter cells, each possessing half the number of chromosomes compared to the parent cell. Importantly, these cells are genetically diverse, which is essential for evolution and adaptation. Meiosis involves two sequential rounds of cell division, termed meiosis I and meiosis II, each comprising stages of prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Notably, meiosis I includes unique processes such as crossing over during prophase I, which facilitates genetic recombination and increases genetic variation among the resulting gametes.

In summary, both mitosis and meiosis are indispensable for life, yet they fulfill different functions. Mitosis is primarily involved in growth and tissue repair, producing two identical daughter cells, whereas meiosis is responsible for sexual reproduction, yielding four genetically diverse gametes.
