When blood glucose levels become excessively high, a condition known as hyperglycaemia can develop, leading to a variety of health issues.

Hyperglycaemia, which refers to elevated blood glucose levels, occurs when there is an excess of glucose in the bloodstream. This situation can arise if the body does not produce sufficient insulin—a hormone secreted by the pancreas that facilitates the entry of glucose into cells—or if the body fails to utilize insulin effectively. Hyperglycaemia is often associated with diabetes, a chronic condition that disrupts the body's ability to regulate blood sugar.

In response to rising blood glucose levels, the pancreas releases insulin. This hormone enables the body's cells to absorb glucose and utilize it as a primary energy source. However, if the body does not generate enough insulin or if the cells become resistant to insulin's effects, glucose can accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to hyperglycaemia.

The symptoms of hyperglycaemia can include frequent urination, increased thirst, headaches, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. If left untreated, high blood glucose levels can result in severe complications, such as damage to blood vessels, which may lead to heart disease and stroke. Other potential complications include nerve damage, kidney disease, and vision problems.

Moreover, extremely high blood glucose levels can precipitate a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This occurs when the body begins to break down fat for energy due to its inability to properly utilize glucose. This metabolic process generates ketones, which can accumulate in the bloodstream and cause the body's pH to become excessively acidic.

To prevent hyperglycaemia and its associated risks, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, and, if necessary, take medications to manage blood glucose levels. Additionally, regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is vital for individuals with diabetes to ensure that their levels remain within a safe range.
