Commercial products leverage plant hormones to both stimulate and inhibit growth, regulate ripening, and manage plant diseases effectively.

Plant hormones, also referred to as phytohormones, are essential for the growth and development of plants. They are incorporated into various commercial products to manipulate these biological processes for advantageous outcomes. For example, auxins, a class of plant hormones, are commonly found in rooting powders and cloning gels, where they promote root development in cuttings. This application is particularly beneficial for gardeners and horticulturists aiming to propagate plants more successfully.

Another significant hormone, gibberellin, plays a vital role in the brewing industry. It stimulates the production of amylase, an enzyme responsible for converting starch into maltose, a critical step in the beer-making process. Additionally, gibberellins are utilized to enhance fruit size and accelerate the germination of certain seeds.

Ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, is commercially employed to regulate the ripening of fruits. By exposing fruits to ethylene gas, producers can synchronize the ripening process, ensuring that the fruits reach maturity and are ready for sale simultaneously. This technique is especially advantageous for fruits such as bananas and tomatoes, which are frequently harvested while still green and subsequently ripened in controlled environments.

Cytokinins, another category of plant hormones, find their application in the cosmetic industry. Known for their anti-aging properties, cytokinins are included in creams and lotions to stimulate cell division and prolong the youthful appearance of skin cells.

Lastly, certain plant hormones are utilized in agriculture to combat plant diseases. For instance, salicylic acid, a well-known plant hormone, is employed to induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants, enhancing their ability to fend off viral, bacterial, and fungal infections.

In summary, plant hormones play a pivotal role in a diverse array of commercial products, ranging from gardening supplies to cosmetics, enhancing plant growth, regulating ripening, and assisting in disease management.
