In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), while cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G) through hydrogen bonds.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule responsible for carrying the genetic instructions essential for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known living organisms. It is structured as a double helix, formed by two strands that twist around one another. Each strand comprises a sequence of nucleotides, the fundamental building blocks of DNA. These nucleotides consist of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. It is the nitrogenous bases that connect the two strands of DNA through complementary pairing.

The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). These bases pair in a specific manner known as complementary base pairing: adenine pairs exclusively with thymine, and cytosine pairs exclusively with guanine. This pairing occurs due to the unique shapes and structures of the bases, which enable them to form hydrogen bonds with their complementary counterparts. Specifically, adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds, while cytosine and guanine form three.

This precise base pairing is vital for both the structure and function of DNA. It ensures that the DNA strands are held together securely, allowing for the accurate replication of genetic information during cell division. When a cell divides, the DNA strands separate, and new strands are synthesized based on the sequences of bases in the original strands. Thanks to the specific nature of base pairing, each new DNA molecule is an exact replica of the original. This mechanism facilitates the transmission of genetic information from one cell to another, as well as from one generation to the next.
