Genetic information is encoded in DNA through a sequence of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).

To elaborate, DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule that holds the essential instructions required for an organism's development, survival, and reproduction. These instructions reside in every cell and are inherited from parents to their offspring. DNA is composed of units called nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and one of the four nitrogen bases. The specific arrangement or sequence of these bases constitutes the genetic code.

The four nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The pairing of these bases is fundamental to the preservation of genetic information. Adenine pairs exclusively with thymine, while guanine pairs exclusively with cytosine. This concept is known as base pairing. The sequence of these base pairs encodes the information necessary for constructing and maintaining an organism, much like how letters of the alphabet combine in a specific order to form words and sentences.

DNA molecules are elongated and coiled into structures known as chromosomes. Humans possess $23$ pairs of chromosomes, totaling $46$. Each chromosome contains numerous genes, which are specific sequences of bases. These genes serve as templates for proteinsâ€”complex molecules that perform most of the essential functions in our bodies. Each gene provides the instructions for synthesizing a particular protein. Consequently, the genetic information encoded in DNA dictates the types of proteins produced, influencing various traits such as eye color and height.

In summary, genetic information is stored in DNA as a sequence of chemical bases. The arrangement of these bases forms the instructions that guide the development and functioning of an organism.
