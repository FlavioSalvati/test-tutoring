Roots play a crucial role in a plant's anatomy, serving as the primary source for absorbing water and essential mineral nutrients from the soil. This process occurs through two main mechanisms: active transport and osmosis.

Active transport involves the absorption of minerals against their concentration gradient. Specifically, this means that minerals move from an area of lower concentration in the soil to an area of higher concentration within the root cells. This process requires energy, which is provided by the plant's metabolic activities.

Conversely, osmosis is the mechanism by which water is absorbed. Unlike active transport, osmosis is a passive process that does not require energy. In osmosis, water moves from an area of higher concentration in the soil to an area of lower concentration inside the root cells, traversing a semi-permeable membrane. This movement generates a pressure known as root pressure, which assists in the upward movement of water and minerals throughout the plant.

The root system is specifically adapted to enhance these processes. The roots are equipped with fine, hair-like structures known as root hairs. These root hairs significantly increase the surface area available for absorption, allowing for more efficient uptake of water and minerals. Additionally, the root cells maintain a high concentration of salts and sugars, which aids in drawing water from the soil.

In summary, roots absorb water and minerals from the soil through the processes of active transport and osmosis, facilitated by the presence of root hairs and the elevated concentration of salts and sugars in the root cells. This absorption is vital for the plant's survival, as it provides the necessary nutrients and water essential for growth and development.
