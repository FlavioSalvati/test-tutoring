Ethene, also known as ethylene, is a naturally occurring plant hormone that plays a crucial role in the fruit industry by accelerating the ripening process of various fruits. This property is particularly beneficial for fruits that are often harvested before they reach full ripeness, such as bananas, tomatoes, and avocados. By exposing these fruits to ethene gas in a controlled environment, producers can ensure that they ripen uniformly and achieve the desired level of ripeness just in time for sale.

The application of ethene in the fruit industry is grounded in the biological processes associated with fruit ripening. As a fruit ripens, it naturally produces ethene, which then stimulates the production of specific enzymes within the fruit. These enzymes initiate various changes in the fruit's texture, color, flavor, and aroma. For instance, they can break down the cell walls of the fruit, resulting in a softer texture, and convert starches into sugars, enhancing the sweetness of the fruit.

To meet consumer demand, the natural ripening process is often manipulated in the fruit industry. Fruits are typically harvested while they are still green and firm, which facilitates easier and safer transportation. Upon arrival at their destination, these fruits are exposed to ethene gas, triggering the ripening process. This enables the fruits to become ripe and ready to eat within just a few days. This method is commonly referred to as 'forced ripening' or 'artificial ripening.'

In summary, ethene is essential in the fruit industry as it allows producers to control the ripening process. This ensures that fruits are delivered to consumers at the optimal stage of ripeness, enhancing their quality and taste while also minimizing waste by reducing the likelihood of damage during transport.
