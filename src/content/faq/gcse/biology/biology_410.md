Estrogen and progesterone play essential roles in regulating the menstrual cycle by overseeing the growth and shedding of the uterine lining.

These two hormones are pivotal in the menstrual cycle, a monthly process that prepares the female body for the possibility of pregnancy. The cycle consists of several stages, each influenced by various hormones, including estrogen and progesterone.

The menstrual cycle commences with the follicular phase. During this phase, the pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the growth of multiple follicles in the ovaries, each containing an immature egg. As the follicles develop, they begin to secrete estrogen. This hormone is responsible for thickening the uterine lining, known as the endometrium, in anticipation of a potential pregnancy.

Around the midpoint of the cycle, a peak in estrogen levels triggers the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. This surge causes the most mature follicle to rupture and release its egg, a process referred to as ovulation. Subsequently, the ruptured follicle transforms into a structure known as the corpus luteum, which is responsible for producing progesterone.

Progesterone's role is to prepare the endometrium for the implantation of a fertilized egg. It makes the uterine lining spongy and nutrient-rich, creating an optimal environment for an embryo to implant and develop. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a decrease in progesterone levels. This decline triggers the shedding of the uterine lining, known as menstruation, which marks the beginning of a new cycle.

In summary, estrogen and progesterone function in tandem to regulate the menstrual cycle. Estrogen governs the growth of the uterine lining during the first half of the cycle, while progesterone prepares it for potential pregnancy in the second half. If pregnancy does not take place, the reduction in progesterone levels results in menstruation and the initiation of a new cycle.
