Hormonal contraception methods include the contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch, contraceptive injection, and contraceptive implant.

Hormonal contraception is a technique for preventing pregnancy by modifying the body's natural hormonal balance. The most widely used form of hormonal contraception is the contraceptive pill, which contains synthetic versions of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones work to prevent ovulation, the process by which an egg is released from the ovaries. When no egg is released, there is nothing for sperm to fertilize, thereby preventing pregnancy.

The contraceptive patch operates similarly to the pill; however, instead of being ingested, it is a small patch that adheres to the skin. The hormones are absorbed transdermally into the bloodstream. This patch requires replacement on a weekly basis, making it a convenient option for individuals who may have difficulty remembering to take a daily pill.

The contraceptive injection, commonly referred to as Depo-Provera, is another form of hormonal contraception. This method involves receiving an injection of progesterone from a healthcare professional every $12$ weeks. The injection functions by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, which makes it more challenging for sperm to reach an egg.

The contraceptive implant, known as Nexplanon, is a small flexible rod that is inserted under the skin of the upper arm by a healthcare provider. It releases a consistent dose of progesterone into the bloodstream over a duration of three years. Similar to other hormonal contraceptives, the implant prevents ovulation and thickens cervical mucus to obstruct sperm from reaching an egg.

Each of these methods comes with its own set of advantages as well as potential side effects. The best choice of contraception will depend on individual health factors and lifestyle considerations. Therefore, it is essential to consult with a healthcare provider to make an informed decision regarding the most suitable option.
