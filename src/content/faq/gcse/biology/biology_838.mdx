Genes encode specific proteins by providing detailed instructions for assembling amino acids in a precise order.

Each gene in our DNA consists of a unique sequence of nucleotides, which are the fundamental building blocks of DNA. The arrangement of these nucleotides is critical, as it dictates the type of protein that the gene will produce. The conversion of genetic information from a gene into a protein occurs through a two-step process: transcription and translation.

In the first step, called transcription, DNA serves as a template to synthesize a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). This process occurs in the cell's nucleus. The resulting mRNA molecule is a copy of the gene, but it is composed of RNA rather than DNA, making it single-stranded and substituting uracil for thymine.

Once synthesized, the mRNA molecule exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it binds to a ribosome. This marks the beginning of the second step, known as translation. The ribosome interprets the nucleotide sequence in the mRNA, reading it in sets of three. Each set of three nucleotides, referred to as a codon, corresponds to a specific amino acid.

In the cytoplasm, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules transport the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA molecule features an anticodon that pairs with a corresponding codon on the mRNA. When a tRNA's anticodon aligns with a codon, it releases its attached amino acid. The ribosome then advances along the mRNA, reading the subsequent codon and adding the corresponding amino acid to the elongating protein chain.

This process continues until the ribosome encounters a stop codon on the mRNA. At this point, the newly synthesized protein is released, completing the process. The sequence of amino acids in the protein is crucial, as it determines the protein's shape and function. Consequently, the arrangement of nucleotides in a gene directly influences the structure and role of the protein it encodes.
