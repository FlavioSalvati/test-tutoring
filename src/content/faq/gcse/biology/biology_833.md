Ethene, also known as ethylene, is a gaseous plant hormone that plays a vital role in various aspects of plant growth and development, particularly in the process of leaf abscission. Leaf abscission refers to the shedding of leaves by plants, typically in response to environmental changes such as the onset of winter or periods of drought. This process is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones, with ethene being one of the primary contributors.

Ethene facilitates leaf abscission by stimulating the cells in the abscission layer, which is located at the base of the leaf stalk. This stimulation causes the cells to expand and eventually rupture, resulting in the separation of the leaf from the plant. The influence of ethene in this process is especially noticeable in deciduous trees, which lose their leaves in autumn. As the days grow shorter and temperatures decrease, the production of ethene increases, thereby triggering leaf abscission.

In addition to its role in promoting leaf abscission, ethene is also involved in the aging and death of plant tissues, a phenomenon known as senescence. This process is evident in the yellowing of leaves prior to their fall, serving as a visible sign of ethene's activity.

It is important to recognize that while ethene promotes leaf abscission, other hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid, also contribute to this process. For instance, auxin is known to inhibit leaf abscission, creating a hormonal balance with ethene's promoting effect. This interplay of hormones ensures that leaf abscission occurs at the appropriate time and in response to the right environmental cues.

In summary, ethene is a crucial hormone that promotes leaf abscission by stimulating the cells at the base of the leaf stalk, leading to the separation of the leaf from the plant.
