Species extinction is primarily driven by habitat destruction, overexploitation, climate change, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species.

The issue of species extinction is multifaceted, involving various interconnected factors. One of the most significant causes is habitat destruction, which can occur through deforestation, urbanization, and other forms of land development. When a species' habitat is destroyed or drastically altered, the species may struggle to adapt to the new conditions, potentially leading to its extinction. For instance, many species in tropical rainforests are at heightened risk of extinction due to extensive deforestation.

Another major factor contributing to species extinction is overexploitation. This term refers to the excessive hunting, fishing, or harvesting of specific species. Over time, such practices can deplete populations to unsustainable levels. A notable example is the dodo bird, which was hunted to extinction by sailors and faced additional threats from invasive species brought by humans.

Climate change also plays a crucial role in the extinction of species. Variations in temperature, precipitation, and sea levels can disrupt habitats and food sources. The polar bear serves as a prominent example of a species endangered by climate change, as the melting of sea ice diminishes their hunting grounds and impacts their survival.

Additionally, pollution significantly contributes to the decline of species. Contaminants in air, water, and soil can harm individual organisms and disrupt entire ecosystems. For example, water pollution from oil spills or plastic waste poses lethal threats to marine life.

Finally, the introduction of invasive species into new environments can lead to the decline or extinction of native species by outcompeting them for resources. A prime example of this is the brown tree snake, which was introduced to Guam and has caused the extinction of several bird species on the island.

In summary, species extinction results from a combination of factors, many of which are influenced by human activities. This pressing issue necessitates global attention and urgent action to mitigate its impacts.
