Commercial products utilize plant hormones to stimulate or inhibit growth, control ripening, and manage plant diseases effectively.

Plant hormones, also referred to as phytohormones, play an essential role in the growth and development of plants. These hormones are incorporated into various commercial products to manipulate plant processes for advantageous outcomes. For example, auxins, a category of plant hormones, are commonly found in rooting powders and cloning gels. They stimulate root growth in cuttings, enabling gardeners and horticulturists to propagate plants more efficiently.

Another significant hormone is gibberellin, which is widely used in the brewing industry. It promotes the production of amylase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down starch into maltoseâ€”an essential step in beer production. Additionally, gibberellins are employed to increase fruit size and expedite germination in certain seeds.

Ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone, is commercially utilized to regulate the ripening of fruits. By exposing fruits to ethylene gas, producers can synchronize the ripening process, ensuring that fruits reach maturity simultaneously and are ready for sale. This method is particularly beneficial for fruits such as bananas and tomatoes, which are often harvested while still green and then ripened under controlled conditions.

Cytokinins, another group of plant hormones, find application in the cosmetic industry due to their anti-aging properties. They are used in creams and lotions to promote cell division and help delay the aging process of skin cells.

Finally, certain plant hormones are employed in agriculture to manage plant diseases. For instance, salicylic acid, a well-known plant hormone, is utilized to induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants, enhancing their ability to resist viral, bacterial, and fungal infections.

In summary, plant hormones are integral to a diverse array of commercial products, ranging from gardening supplies to cosmetics. They enhance plant growth, control ripening, and help manage plant diseases, showcasing their versatility and importance in various industries.
