Plants employ various physical mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogens, utilizing barriers such as waxy cuticles, bark, and cell walls, along with the ability to close their stomata.

The primary line of defense is the plant's outer layer, known as the epidermis, which is often coated with a protective waxy cuticle. This cuticle serves as a formidable barrier, preventing pathogens from penetrating the plant's tissues. Additionally, it is water-repellent, which significantly reduces the likelihood of water-borne pathogens causing infection.

Another important physical barrier is the bark found on trees. Bark functions as a robust protective layer, safeguarding the plant from physical damage and disease. Composed of dead cells, bark is particularly challenging for pathogens to penetrate. In instances where a pathogen does breach the bark, the plant can respond by forming a layer of specialized cells to seal off the infected area, thus preventing further spread of the pathogen.

The cell walls of plants also play an essential role in their defense against pathogens. Upon an attack, plants can thicken and strengthen their cell walls by incorporating lignin, a complex organic polymer. This reinforcement makes it increasingly difficult for pathogens to breach the cell walls. Additionally, plant cells can synthesize antimicrobial chemicals that effectively kill pathogens or inhibit their growth.

Furthermore, plants possess the ability to close their stomataâ€”small openings on the leaf surface that facilitate gas exchange. Some pathogens can enter plants through these stomata, so by closing them, the plant can effectively block pathogen entry. However, this defensive action comes at a cost, as it also restricts the plant's capacity to conduct photosynthesis.

Beyond these physical defenses, plants employ a variety of chemical defenses. These include the production of toxins, antimicrobial compounds, and enzymes that target and degrade the pathogen's cell wall. Collectively, these defense mechanisms work in concert to enhance the plant's resilience against infections, promoting its overall health and survival.
