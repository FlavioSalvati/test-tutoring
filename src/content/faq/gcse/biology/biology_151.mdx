The primary components of automatic control systems include the controller, the actuator, the system itself, and the feedback mechanism.

An automatic control system is a prearranged, self-regulating system designed to achieve a desired output by utilizing feedback from the system's response. These four key components work in harmony to ensure stability and accuracy.

1. **Controller**: The controller acts as the brain of the system. It receives input from the user or the system's sensors, processes this information, and subsequently sends commands to the actuator. The controller may be a simple mechanical device or a sophisticated digital computer. It is programmed to respond to variations in the system's output to maintain the desired performance level.

2. **Actuator**: The actuator serves as the muscle of the system. It executes commands received from the controller and performs actions that influence the system's output. The actuator can be a mechanical device, such as a motor or valve, or an electrical device, such as a heater or light.

3. **System**: The system itself refers to the process or machine being controlled. This could be a physical system, like a car or heating unit, or a virtual system, such as a computer program or financial model. The system's output is the result of its operations, and the control system is designed to regulate this output effectively.

4. **Feedback Mechanism**: The feedback mechanism functions as the system's sense of touch. It measures the system's output and relays this information back to the controller. The feedback mechanism can range from a simple sensor, such as a thermometer or speedometer, to a complex network of sensors that monitor various aspects of the system's performance. This feedback enables the controller to adjust the system's operations in response to changes in output.

In summary, these components work together to form a cohesive automatic control system, ensuring that the system operates within the desired parameters.
