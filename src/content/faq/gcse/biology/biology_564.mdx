Passive transport and active transport are two fundamental processes that regulate the movement of substances across cell membranes, each operating under different principles and energy requirements.

**Passive Transport**  
Passive transport refers to the movement of substances along their concentration gradient, from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration, without the expenditure of energy. This process occurs naturally due to the random motion of particles. Common examples of passive transport include:

1. **Diffusion**: This is the process by which particles migrate from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.
   
2. **Osmosis**: A specialized form of diffusion that specifically involves water molecules. In osmosis, water moves across a semi-permeable membrane towards an area with a higher solute concentration, effectively balancing concentrations on both sides of the membrane.
   
3. **Facilitated Diffusion**: This process employs protein channels embedded in the cell membrane to assist the movement of substances that cannot freely pass through the lipid bilayer.

**Active Transport**  
In contrast, active transport is the mechanism by which substances are moved from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration, against their concentration gradient. This process requires energy, typically in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), as it defies the natural direction of flow. Active transport is crucial for maintaining ion balance (such as sodium and potassium) across the cell membrane, which is vital for processes like nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. 

Active transport can be classified into two main types:

1. **Primary Active Transport**: This type directly utilizes ATP to transport substances across the membrane.
   
2. **Secondary Active Transport**: This mechanism relies on the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport to move other substances.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, the primary distinction between passive and active transport lies in the direction of movement and energy requirements. Passive transport facilitates the movement of substances along their concentration gradient without energy expenditure, while active transport enables the movement of substances against their concentration gradient, necessitating energy.
