Nitrogen waste is eliminated from the body through the process of excretion, primarily via the kidneys in the form of urine.

The removal of nitrogenous waste is a vital function of the excretory system. This process initiates with the breakdown of proteins and nucleic acids within the body. These substances contain nitrogen, and when metabolized, they produce a waste product known as ammonia. Since ammonia is toxic to the body, it must be converted into a less harmful compound. This conversion occurs in the liver, where ammonia is transformed into urea through a biochemical pathway called the urea cycle.

Once formed, urea is transported through the bloodstream to the kidneys. The kidneys play a critical role in filtering out waste products from the blood, including urea. This filtration occurs within tiny structures called nephrons. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus—a small network of capillaries—and a tubule. The glomerulus filters the blood, and the resulting liquid, referred to as filtrate, contains waste products and other substances that the body does not require, including urea.

As the filtrate moves down the tubule, water and essential substances are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. The waste products that remain, including urea, ultimately form urine. This urine is then transported to the bladder via the ureters, where it is stored until it can be excreted from the body through the urethra.

In addition to the kidneys, the skin and lungs also contribute to the excretion of nitrogen waste. The skin eliminates small amounts of urea through sweat, while the lungs release nitrogen gas as part of the respiratory process. Nevertheless, the kidneys are the primary organs responsible for the removal of nitrogen waste from the body.
