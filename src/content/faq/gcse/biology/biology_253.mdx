The rate of decay in a practical setting can be effectively measured by monitoring the decrease in mass or volume over time.

In a typical experimental setup, the rate of decay is assessed by observing changes in the mass or volume of the decaying substance over a defined period. This often involves creating a controlled environment where the decay process can take place, and utilizing precise instruments to accurately measure the changes.

For instance, when measuring the decay of a piece of fruit, you might weigh the fruit at regular intervals and record the corresponding changes in mass. This would provide a clear indication of the rate at which the fruit is decaying. Similarly, if you are measuring the decay of a gas, you could use a gas syringe to measure the volume of the gas at consistent intervals.

In certain cases, you may also evaluate the rate of decay by observing variations in other properties of the decaying substance. For example, you could measure the decrease in light intensity from a luminescent material or the reduction in radioactivity from a radioactive sample.

It is crucial to recognize that the rate of decay can be influenced by various environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of specific chemicals or microorganisms. Consequently, in a practical experiment, it is essential to control these factors as much as possible to ensure the accuracy of your measurements.

After collecting your data, you would typically represent it graphically to visualize the rate of decay. A steeper slope on the graph indicates a faster rate of decay. This visual representation aids in comprehending and interpreting your results more effectively.
