The menstrual cycle is a complex physiological process regulated by a series of hormones, specifically oestrogen, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinising hormone (LH).

At the beginning of the cycle, the pituitary gland releases FSH, which plays a crucial role in stimulating the growth of ovarian follicles, each containing an egg. As these follicles mature, they begin to secrete oestrogen.

Oestrogen, produced by the ovaries, serves multiple functions during the menstrual cycle. Firstly, it promotes the thickening of the uterine lining in preparation for a possible pregnancy. Secondly, it inhibits the release of FSH, ensuring that only one egg matures during each cycle. Additionally, a significant increase in oestrogen levels triggers the release of LH.

LH is vital for initiating ovulation, which is the process of releasing the mature egg from the follicle. This event typically occurs around the midpoint of the menstrual cycle. Following ovulation, the follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, a structure that begins to produce progesterone.

Progesterone is essential for further preparing the uterus for potential pregnancy. It helps maintain the thickened uterine lining. If fertilization does not occur, progesterone levels decline, leading to the breakdown and shedding of the uterine lining, a process known as menstruation. This event signals the start of a new menstrual cycle.

In summary, the menstrual cycle is a finely tuned process governed by the interplay of four key hormones: FSH, oestrogen, LH, and progesterone. Each hormone has a distinct role in preparing the body for potential pregnancy and regulating the cycle.
