Pathogens are microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, that can lead to disease by invading the body, multiplying, and disrupting normal physiological functions. Their ability to cause illness stems from their diverse methods of interaction with their host, which can result in a wide range of symptoms.

For instance, bacteria may produce harmful toxins that damage host cells or directly invade cells to disrupt their normal operations. In contrast, viruses invade host cells and hijack the cell's machinery to replicate themselves, often causing the cell to burst and release new viruses that can infect neighboring cells. Fungi can also contribute to disease by releasing spores that invade tissues, leading to inflammation.

Pathogens can enter the body through various routes, such as the skin, respiratory tract, digestive tract, and urogenital tract. Once inside, they have several strategies to evade the immune system. Some pathogens can hide within host cells, providing them protection from immune responses, while others may alter their surface proteins to avoid detection by the immune system.

The body has multiple defense mechanisms against pathogens, including physical barriers like the skin and mucous membranes, as well as the immune system, which is capable of recognizing and eliminating pathogens. However, if a pathogen successfully evades these defenses and proliferates within the body, it can lead to disease.

In conclusion, pathogens cause disease through their invasion of the body, multiplication, and interference with normal bodily functions. The specific mechanisms by which different types of pathogens induce illness can vary significantly, depending on the pathogen and the resulting disease.
