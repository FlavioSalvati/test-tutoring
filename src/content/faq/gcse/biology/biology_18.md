Active transport in cells refers to the mechanism by which substances are moved against a concentration gradient, necessitating the use of energy.

This essential cellular process facilitates the movement of ions or molecules across the cell membrane from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration. In contrast to passive transport, which occurs along the concentration gradient, active transport works against it. The term "active" denotes the requirement for cellular energy, typically in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

Active transport is mediated by specialized proteins embedded within the cell membrane. These proteins, referred to as transport proteins or carrier proteins, bind to the specific molecule or ion that needs to be transported. The energy derived from ATP induces a conformational change in the protein, allowing the molecule or ion to traverse the membrane.

This process is critical for various cellular functions. For instance, active transport enables cells to absorb essential nutrients from their surroundings, even when the concentration of those nutrients outside the cell is lower than that inside. Additionally, it helps maintain optimal pH levels and ionic concentrations within the cell, and facilitates the removal of waste products.

Active transport can be categorized into two types: primary and secondary. Primary active transport directly utilizes energy to move molecules across a membrane, while secondary active transport leverages an electrochemical gradient to drive the transport of molecules.

In conclusion, active transport is a vital process that allows cells to move substances against their concentration gradients, thereby supporting homeostasis and enabling essential cellular functions. This process requires energy and is carried out by specific proteins located in the cell membrane.
