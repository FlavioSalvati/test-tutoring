Stress hormones, primarily cortisol and adrenaline, initiate physical responses that prepare the body to confront perceived threats.

These hormones are produced by the adrenal glands, which are small organs situated atop each kidney. When the body detects a threat, the hypothalamus—a small yet crucial region of the brain—signals the adrenal glands to release these hormones. The main stress hormones involved in this response are cortisol and adrenaline, which is also known as epinephrine.

Adrenaline is responsible for preparing the body for a 'fight or flight' response. It increases heart rate, elevates blood pressure, and boosts energy supplies. Additionally, adrenaline suppresses non-essential bodily functions, such as digestion, and sharpens sensory perceptions, including sight and hearing. This hormone also enhances focus, enabling the body to prepare for immediate action.

Conversely, cortisol helps the body maintain fluid balance and regulate blood pressure while also inhibiting non-essential functions like the immune response and digestion. It suppresses activities that are not critical in a fight or flight scenario and promotes the body's ability to repair tissues. Furthermore, cortisol increases the levels of glucose in the bloodstream, enhances the brain’s utilization of glucose, and improves the availability of substances necessary for tissue repair.

However, prolonged exposure to these stress hormones can have detrimental effects on health. Chronic stress may lead to various health issues, including heart disease, sleep disturbances, digestive problems, depression, obesity, and memory impairment. It can also weaken the immune system, making the body more vulnerable to infections.

In summary, stress hormones play a vital role in preparing the body to respond to perceived threats. Nonetheless, it is crucial to manage stress effectively to mitigate the potential adverse effects of prolonged exposure to these hormones.
