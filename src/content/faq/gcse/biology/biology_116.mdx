Hormones are essential chemical messengers produced by the endocrine system, which consists of a network of glands located throughout the body. Key glands in this system include the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, ovaries, and testes. Each gland is responsible for producing specific hormones that are released directly into the bloodstream, serving as a transport medium to deliver these hormones to various tissues and organs.

The process begins when a gland receives a signal to synthesize a hormone. This signal may originate from the brain or another hormone. Once a hormone is produced, it enters the bloodstream. Since the bloodstream functions as a circulatory system, it efficiently carries the hormone throughout the body. However, hormones do not affect every cell; they specifically target certain cells known as target cells. These target cells possess unique receptors designed to bind with the hormone, akin to how a key fits into a lock. When the hormone binds to its corresponding receptor on a target cell, it activates the cell, prompting it to perform specific functions such as growth, division, or protein synthesis.

The speed at which hormones travel in the bloodstream is influenced by the rate of blood circulation. Typically, it takes only a few minutes for a hormone to travel from the gland of origin to its target cells. Despite this rapid transit, the effects of hormones can be prolonged, lasting from several hours to even days. This extended duration occurs because hormones are not depleted when they bind to their target cells; instead, they are released back into the bloodstream and can continue to circulate until they are metabolized by the liver or kidneys.

In summary, hormones traverse the body through the bloodstream, moving from the glands that produce them to the target cells they influence. This intricate process plays a vital role in regulating numerous bodily functions, including growth, development, metabolism, and mood.
