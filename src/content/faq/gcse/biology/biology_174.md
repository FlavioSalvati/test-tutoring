When blood glucose levels fall below normal, the body initiates a response by releasing the hormone glucagon, which serves to elevate glucose levels.

Glucose, a simple sugar, is essential for the proper functioning of the human body, as it serves as the primary energy source for the body's cells. When blood glucose levels decrease, this change is detected by the alpha cells located in the pancreas. In response, these cells release glucagon.

Glucagon functions in opposition to insulin, another hormone produced by the pancreas. While insulin works to reduce blood glucose levels when they are elevated, glucagon aims to increase them when they are low. It accomplishes this by signaling the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is subsequently released into the bloodstream. This process is known as glycogenolysis.

In addition to glycogenolysis, glucagon also facilitates the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as proteins and fats, through a process called gluconeogenesis. Both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are critical for increasing blood glucose levels, thereby restoring equilibrium in the body's energy supply.

If blood glucose levels remain low for an extended period, the adrenal glands secrete another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol contributes to raising blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and inhibiting the uptake of glucose by cells.

In summary, the human body has a sophisticated system for regulating blood glucose levels. When these levels drop, the body responds by releasing hormones that stimulate the production and release of additional glucose. This mechanism ensures that the cells in the body have a consistent supply of energy to function effectively.
