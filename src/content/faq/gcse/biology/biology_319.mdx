Cells eliminate waste through a process known as exocytosis, which involves packaging waste materials into vesicles and expelling them from the cell membrane.

Exocytosis is a cellular mechanism used to remove waste products or to secrete various substances. This process is classified as active transport, meaning it requires energy to occur. Initially, the waste materials or secretory substances are enclosed within a vesicle, which is a small, spherical compartment that is separated from the cytosol by at least one lipid bilayer.

The formation of the vesicle occurs within the Golgi apparatus, an organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for transport. Within the Golgi apparatus, the waste or secretory substances are encapsulated into a vesicle, which then migrates toward the cell membrane. This movement is supported by the cytoskeleton, a network of protein fibers that maintain the cell's shape and facilitate intracellular transport.

Upon reaching the cell membrane, the vesicle undergoes fusion with it. This fusion process is mediated by proteins known as SNAREs (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors). The SNAREs located on the vesicle (referred to as v-SNAREs) interact with the SNAREs on the cell membrane (known as t-SNAREs). These proteins twist together, bringing the vesicle and cell membrane into close proximity, ultimately leading to their fusion.

When the vesicle and cell membrane fuse, the vesicle releases its contents into the extracellular space. The released materials may include waste products that the cell needs to eliminate, or secretory substances such as hormones or neurotransmitters. After the contents are expelled, the vesicle membrane integrates into the cell membrane.

In summary, exocytosis is a crucial process that cells utilize to remove waste or secrete substances. This involves the encapsulation of materials into a vesicle, the vesicle's movement toward the cell membrane, and the fusion of the vesicle with the cell membrane to expel its contents outside the cell.
