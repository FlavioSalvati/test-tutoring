Plant cells absorb water through a process known as osmosis, which involves the movement of water from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration.

Osmosis is classified as a type of passive transport, meaning it does not require any energy input. This process is essential for plant cells, as it enables them to take up water from the surrounding soil. The cell membrane of a plant cell is semi-permeable, allowing certain substances to pass through while restricting others. Notably, water molecules are small enough to traverse the membrane effortlessly.

Typically, the concentration of solutes—substances dissolved in water—inside a plant cell is greater than that in the surrounding soil. This difference creates a concentration gradient, prompting water molecules to move from the area of lower concentration (the soil) to the area of higher concentration (inside the cell) in an effort to equalize the concentrations. The movement of water molecules in this manner is what we refer to as osmosis.

Additionally, plant cells possess a rigid cell wall that provides structural support. When water enters the cell through osmosis, it fills the central vacuole, generating pressure against the cell wall known as turgor pressure. This pressure is crucial for maintaining the shape of the cell and the overall structure of the plant. Conversely, if a plant does not receive sufficient water, it can lose turgor pressure, leading to wilting.

In summary, plant cells absorb water via osmosis, a passive transport mechanism where water moves from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. This vital process is essential for sustaining the structure and function of plant cells.
