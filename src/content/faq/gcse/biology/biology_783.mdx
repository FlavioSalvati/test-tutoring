Neurons transmit electrical signals through a process known as action potential, which involves the movement of ions across the neuron's membrane.

Neurons, also referred to as nerve cells, are the fundamental units of the nervous system, specifically designed to transmit information throughout the body. This process of information transmission is electrical in nature and is referred to as an action potential. The action potential represents a sudden change in the electrical charge across the neuron's membrane, enabling the signal to propagate along the neuron.

The neuron's membrane serves as a barrier that separates the internal environment of the neuron from the external environment. It is semi-permeable, which means that certain substances can pass through while others cannot. The membrane is equipped with channels that facilitate the passage of specific ions (charged particles). Among these ions, sodium ($\text{Na}^+$) and potassium ($\text{K}^+$) play critical roles in the generation of the action potential.

In its resting state, the interior of a neuron is negatively charged compared to the exterior. This negative charge is primarily due to a higher concentration of $\text{K}^+$ ions inside the neuron and a higher concentration of $\text{Na}^+$ ions outside. When a neuron receives a signal, sodium channels open, allowing $\text{Na}^+$ ions to rush into the neuron. This influx of positively charged ions alters the internal charge of the neuron, making it more positive relative to the outside. This initial event marks the beginning of the action potential.

As the action potential propagates along the neuron, more sodium channels open in a wave-like manner. Following this wave of $\text{Na}^+$ influx, potassium channels open, allowing $\text{K}^+$ ions to exit the neuron. This efflux of potassium ions restores the negative charge within the neuron, bringing it back to its resting state in a process known as repolarization.

It is important to note that the action potential is an "all-or-nothing" event. This means that once the process is initiated, it must continue to completion without stopping. The intensity of the incoming signal does not influence the magnitude of the action potential; however, it does affect the frequency of action potentials. A stronger signal will result in a higher frequency of action potentials. This mechanism enables neurons to convey varying intensities of information effectively.
