Gibberellins are a group of plant hormones that significantly influence various growth and developmental processes in plants. One of their primary functions is to enhance fruit size by stimulating both cell division and elongation.

The process begins when gibberellins are applied to the fruit, whether through natural means or artificial application. Once introduced, these hormones bind to specific receptors located in the plant cells. This binding initiates a cascade of biochemical reactions that activate certain genes responsible for regulating cell division and elongation. Consequently, the cells within the fruit begin to divide and elongate at an accelerated rate, resulting in an increase in fruit size.

In addition to promoting cell division and elongation, gibberellins facilitate the synthesis of proteins and other essential substances vital for plant growth. This further contributes to the enlargement of the fruit. For instance, gibberellins can stimulate the production of enzymes that degrade cell walls, rendering them more flexible and enabling the cells to expand more easily.

Furthermore, gibberellins can influence the transport of nutrients and water throughout the plant. This ensures that the rapidly dividing and elongating cells receive the necessary resources for growth. This aspect is particularly critical for fruit development, as fruits require substantial amounts of nutrients and water to mature properly.

In summary, gibberellins play an essential role in increasing fruit size by stimulating cell division and elongation, promoting the synthesis of growth-enhancing substances, and modulating the transport of nutrients and water within the plant.
