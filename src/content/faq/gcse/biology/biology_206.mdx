Genetic engineering has the potential to significantly enhance crop yields by modifying plant genes to improve growth, increase resistance to pests, and boost tolerance to challenging environmental conditions.

Also referred to as genetic modification, genetic engineering involves the precise manipulation of an organism's genetic material using biotechnological techniques. In agriculture, this technology can be applied in several impactful ways. 

Firstly, scientists can alter plant genes to accelerate their growth rate or increase their size, leading to a greater yield per plant. This approach is especially advantageous for staple crops such as maize, wheat, and rice, which are essential food sources for many populations worldwide.

Secondly, genetic engineering can enhance a plant's ability to resist pests and diseases. By incorporating genes that produce toxins detrimental to specific pests or that provide immunity to certain diseases, researchers can mitigate crop losses, thereby boosting overall yield. For instance, Bt cotton is a genetically modified variety that produces a toxin lethal to many pests that threaten cotton crops, thus reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides and enhancing yield.

Lastly, genetic engineering can improve a plant's resilience to adverse environmental conditions, such as drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures. By introducing genes that help plants withstand these stresses, scientists can ensure that crops maintain their growth and productivity even in less-than-ideal circumstances. This ability is increasingly vital in light of climate change, which is projected to render many agricultural regions less suitable for conventional farming practices.

In conclusion, genetic engineering serves as a powerful tool for enhancing crop yields. Through the modification of plant genes, scientists can promote growth, bolster resistance to pests and diseases, and enhance tolerance to harsh environmental conditions. This technology holds the promise of significantly increasing global food production and ensuring food security in the face of a growing population and an evolving climate.
