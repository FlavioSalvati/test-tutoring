Genetic information is passed from parents to offspring through the transmission of DNA during sexual reproduction.

To elaborate, genetic information is encoded in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) located within the nucleus of every cell in an organism's body. DNA is organized into structures known as chromosomes. In humans, there are a total of $46$ chromosomes, with $23$ inherited from each parent. These chromosomes are arranged in pairs, where one chromosome in each pair comes from the mother and the other from the father.

During sexual reproduction, a specialized process called meiosis occurs in the reproductive cellsâ€”sperm in males and eggs in females. Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces four daughter cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes found in the parent cell. Consequently, each sperm or egg cell holds $23$ unpaired chromosomes.

When a sperm fertilizes an egg during conception, the $23$ chromosomes from the sperm pair with the $23$ chromosomes from the egg, resulting in a new cell containing $46$ chromosomes. This newly formed cell, referred to as a zygote, will undergo division and development into a new organism. The unique combination of chromosomes contributed by the mother and father establishes the genetic makeup of the offspring.

Each chromosome is composed of numerous genes, which are segments of DNA that encode for specific traits. These traits can encompass physical characteristics such as eye color and height, as well as predispositions to certain diseases. The specific version of a gene that an individual possesses is termed an allele. Some alleles are dominant, meaning they will always manifest if present, while others are recessive and require two copies to be expressed.

In summary, genetic information is inherited through the transfer of DNA from parents to offspring during sexual reproduction. This process involves the pairing of chromosomes from each parent in the offspring, ultimately determining their genetic composition.
