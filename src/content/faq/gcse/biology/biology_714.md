The human eye focuses light through two key structures: the cornea and the lens. Together, they refract light to produce a clear image on the retina.

The process of focusing light in the eye is intricate and involves several components. It begins when light enters the eye through the cornea, which is the transparent front surface of the eye. The cornea bends, or refracts, the incoming light, initiating the focusing process.

Once the light passes through the cornea, it travels through the pupil, which is the small black opening in the center of the iris—the colored part of the eye. The size of the pupil adjusts in response to lighting conditions, a function controlled by the iris. In bright environments, the iris contracts, making the pupil smaller to reduce the amount of light entering the eye. Conversely, in dim lighting, the iris relaxes, causing the pupil to enlarge and allow more light in.

Next, the light reaches the lens, a transparent structure located behind the iris and pupil. The lens further refracts the light, directing it onto the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. The lens has the unique ability to change shape—becoming either thinner or thicker—to adjust focus, enabling us to see objects clearly at varying distances. This adjustment process is known as accommodation.

The ciliary muscles, which are attached to the lens, play a crucial role in controlling its shape. When these muscles contract, they thicken the lens, increasing its refractive power to focus on nearby objects. When the ciliary muscles relax, the lens becomes thinner, reducing its refractive power to focus on distant objects.

Ultimately, the light that has been focused by the cornea and lens creates a clear image on the retina. This image is then converted into electrical signals by the photoreceptor cells located in the retina. These signals are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve, allowing us to perceive the visual information.
