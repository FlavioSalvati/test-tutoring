Muscles require energy during exercise by breaking down glucose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to facilitate muscle contractions.

When you engage in physical activity, your muscles need energy to contract and relax effectively. This energy is derived from ATP, a molecule commonly referred to as the "energy currency" of the cell, as it powers numerous cellular processes, including muscle contraction. However, the body has a limited storage capacity for ATP, necessitating its continuous production.

The primary source of ATP during exercise is glucose, which is a type of sugar derived from the food we consume. Glucose is stored in the muscles and liver in the form of glycogen, a larger polysaccharide that can be rapidly converted back into glucose when energy is required. During exercise, the body breaks down glycogen into glucose, which is then used to generate ATP.

The process of converting glucose into ATP is known as cellular respiration. This intricate process takes place in the mitochondria, often referred to as the "powerhouses" of the cell, and involves several stages. Initially, glucose undergoes glycolysis, where it is transformed into a molecule called pyruvate. This step yields a small amount of ATP and generates another molecule known as NADH.

If sufficient oxygen is available, which is typically the case during light to moderate exercise, pyruvate is further metabolized through the Krebs cycle. This cycle produces additional ATP and NADH. Ultimately, the NADH generated during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle is utilized in the electron transport chain, leading to the synthesis of even more ATP.

However, during high-intensity exercise, the body may not be able to supply enough oxygen to the muscles for the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain to function effectively. In such situations, the body resorts to anaerobic respiration, in which pyruvate is converted into lactic acid instead of entering the Krebs cycle. This anaerobic process allows for a faster production of ATP compared to aerobic respiration, but it also results in the accumulation of lactic acid, which can contribute to muscle fatigue.
