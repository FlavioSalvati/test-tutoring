When blood glucose levels fall, the body activates a response by releasing the hormone glucagon to elevate glucose levels.

Glucose, a type of sugar, is essential for the proper functioning of the human body. It serves as the primary energy source for the cells. When blood glucose levels decrease, this change is detected by the alpha cells in the pancreas, which then release glucagon.

Glucagon counteracts the effects of insulin, another hormone produced by the pancreas. While insulin lowers blood glucose levels when they are elevated, glucagon raises them when they are low. It achieves this by signaling the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is subsequently released into the bloodstream. This process is referred to as glycogenolysis.

In addition to glycogenolysis, glucagon also facilitates the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as proteins and fats. This process is known as gluconeogenesis. Both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis work together to increase the concentration of glucose in the blood, thereby restoring equilibrium.

If blood glucose levels remain low for an extended duration, the adrenal glands will secrete another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol further aids in raising blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and decreasing the uptake of glucose by the cells.

In summary, the body has a sophisticated system in place to maintain optimal glucose balance in the blood. When blood glucose levels drop, hormonal responses trigger the production and release of additional glucose, ensuring that the body's cells consistently have the energy they need to function effectively.
