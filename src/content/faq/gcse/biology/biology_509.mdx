Plastic pollution poses a substantial threat to marine life through various mechanisms, including entanglement, ingestion, habitat disruption, and the introduction of toxic chemicals.

When plastic waste enters the ocean, it does not biodegrade. Instead, it fragments into smaller pieces known as microplastics. These microplastics are often mistaken for food by marine animals. Ingesting them can lead to blockages in the digestive system, ultimately resulting in starvation and death. Additionally, larger plastic items can inflict physical injuries. Species such as turtles, seals, and birds frequently become entangled in plastic debris, which can lead to severe injury or mortality.

Moreover, plastic pollution disrupts marine habitats. Coral reefs, in particular, are highly susceptible to damage from plastic debris. When plastics come into contact with corals, they can inflict physical harm and increase the likelihood of disease. Furthermore, plastic waste can smother seafloor habitats, adversely affecting the organisms that reside there.

Another critical consequence of plastic pollution is the introduction of toxic chemicals into marine ecosystems. Plastics can absorb and concentrate harmful pollutants from seawater, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals. When marine animals consume these plastics, the absorbed toxins can enter their bodies, potentially resulting in serious health issues. These toxins can then ascend the food chain, impacting larger predators and even humans who consume contaminated seafood.

In summary, plastic pollution has a profound and multifaceted impact on marine life. It not only inflicts physical harm on individual animals but also disrupts entire ecosystems and introduces hazardous chemicals into the food chain. This complex issue demands urgent attention and decisive action.
