Nervous tissue plays a crucial role in transmitting and processing information throughout the body via electrical and chemical signals.

This specialized tissue constitutes the nervous system, which comprises the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Nervous tissue is responsible for detecting stimuli from both internal and external environments, interpreting these signals, and coordinating the body's responses accordingly.

Nervous tissue is primarily composed of two types of cells: neurons and neuroglia. Neurons, often referred to as nerve cells, are the main functional units of nervous tissue that facilitate the transmission of information. They possess a unique capability to send signals both rapidly and precisely to various target cells, including other neurons, muscle cells, and glandular cells. This signal transmission occurs through a combination of electrical impulses (nerve impulses) and chemical messengers (neurotransmitters).

On the other hand, neuroglia, or glial cells, serve as the supporting cells within nervous tissue. While they do not directly transmit signals like neurons, they perform numerous essential functions that support the proper functioning of neurons. These functions include providing structural support and insulation to neurons, supplying them with vital nutrients, and assisting in the maintenance of the extracellular environment.

In conclusion, the primary function of nervous tissue is to enable communication among different parts of the body. It accomplishes this by receiving information about environmental changes, processing that information, and coordinating appropriate responses. This intricate system allows the body to react swiftly to changes, maintain homeostasis, and engage in complex behaviors.
