Gregor Mendel is often referred to as the "Father of Genetics" due to his groundbreaking research on inheritance patterns in pea plants.

A 19th-century monk and scientist, Gregor Mendel made substantial contributions to genetics through his methodical experiments with pea plants. His pioneering work established the foundational principles of genetic inheritance, earning him the title of the "Father of Genetics." Mendel focused on seven distinct characteristics of pea plants, including traits such as plant height, seed shape, and flower color. By cross-breeding plants with varying traits, he meticulously observed the characteristics of their offspring across multiple generations.

From his observations, Mendel formulated two fundamental laws of inheritance. The first, known as the **Law of Segregation**, states that for each trait, an individual inherits one allele from each parent. The second, referred to as the **Law of Independent Assortment**, indicates that the alleles for different traits are transmitted to offspring independently of one another. These laws provide a framework for understanding how traits are transmitted from parents to offspring and remain essential to contemporary genetic studies.

Mendel's work was revolutionary because it challenged the dominant theory of **blending inheritance**, which posited that offspring are a mix of their parents' traits. Instead, Mendel demonstrated that traits are inherited as distinct units, now recognized as genes. Despite the significance of his findings, Mendel's work did not receive widespread acknowledgment during his lifetime. It was only in the early 20th century, long after his death, that other scientists rediscovered and confirmed his theories.

In summary, Gregor Mendel's experiments with pea plants led to the formulation of the laws of inheritance, which are foundational to modern genetics. His research transformed our understanding of how traits are passed from one generation to the next, marking a landmark advancement in the field of biology.
