Aquaporins are specialized proteins that create channels in cell membranes, facilitating the movement of water molecules into and out of cells.

Also referred to as water channels, aquaporins belong to a larger family known as major intrinsic proteins (MIPs). These integral membrane proteins form pores in the membranes of biological cells, playing a crucial role in osmosis and maintaining homeostasis. Their primary function is to enhance the transport of water between cells.

Typically, water molecules cross cell membranes slowly due to their polar nature, which imparts a slight electrical charge. This charge can lead to repulsion by the hydrophobic core of the cell membrane, which is composed of fatty acid molecules. However, aquaporins provide a specific pathway that allows water to traverse the cell membrane more efficiently.

Aquaporins exhibit selectivity for water, effectively blocking ions and other small molecules from passing through the membrane alongside water. This selectivity arises from the unique structure of the aquaporin channels. Each aquaporin molecule contains a narrow central channel that permits water molecules to pass through in a single file. The walls of this channel consist of amino acids that interact favorably with water, facilitating the movement of water molecules.

The presence and concentration of aquaporins in a cell membrane significantly influence the cell's water permeability and its capacity to absorb and release water. This characteristic is particularly vital in cells that must rapidly adjust their volume, such as red blood cells, as well as in cells involved in water transport, such as those found in the kidneys.

In conclusion, aquaporins are essential for maintaining water balance within cells, enabling them to function optimally. They serve as a remarkable example of how a protein's structure can be intricately aligned with its function.
