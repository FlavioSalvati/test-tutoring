Cytokinins are a group of plant growth substances, also known as phytohormones, that play a crucial role in various aspects of plant growth and development. They primarily influence cell division and differentiation, which are essential processes for promoting overall plant growth. By stimulating these processes, cytokinins facilitate the formation of new cells and tissues, thereby enhancing the plant's ability to grow.

One of the key functions of cytokinins is to stimulate shoot development. They achieve this by promoting the growth of buds, which are embryonic shoots located in the axils of leaves. By encouraging bud development, cytokinins contribute to the formation of new shoots, facilitating the vertical growth of the plant. This aspect is particularly significant in densely vegetated environments, where plants must compete for sunlight.

Additionally, cytokinins are instrumental in delaying leaf senescenceâ€”the aging process in plants. As leaves age, they typically lose chlorophyll and their capacity for photosynthesis, which can hinder the plant's growth. Cytokinins can slow down this aging process by inhibiting the degradation of chlorophyll and other vital cellular components. This action allows leaves to remain functional for a longer duration, thereby enhancing the plant's photosynthetic efficiency and overall growth.

Furthermore, cytokinins interact with other plant hormones to regulate various aspects of growth. For instance, they collaborate with auxins, another category of plant hormones, to maintain the balance between shoot and root development. This balance is critical for the plant's overall health and survival, ensuring that it has sufficient resources to support both above-ground and below-ground growth.
