Facilitated diffusion is a form of passive transport that enables substances to traverse cell membranes with the assistance of carrier proteins.

In detail, facilitated diffusion allows specific molecules that cannot directly penetrate the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane to enter or exit the cell. This process is classified as passive transport because it does not consume any cellular energy. Instead, it relies on the concentration gradient, facilitating the movement of substances from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.

The 'facilitation' aspect of this process is provided by specialized proteins embedded within the cell membrane, commonly referred to as carrier proteins or transport proteins. These proteins possess a distinct shape that enables them to bind with the molecule that needs to be transported. Upon binding, the protein undergoes a conformational change, which allows the molecule to pass through the membrane.

It is crucial to understand that each carrier protein is specific to a particular molecule. For instance, glucose molecules require a different carrier protein than amino acids. This specificity ensures that only the appropriate molecules are transported into or out of the cell.

Facilitated diffusion plays a vital role in biological systems, as it allows cells to maintain their internal environments and effectively respond to changes in external conditions. This process is especially important for the transport of larger, polar molecules such as glucose, which are essential for cellular function but cannot freely diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane.
