During anaphase of mitosis, sister chromatids separate and migrate towards opposite ends of the cell.

Anaphase is the fourth phase of mitosis, a process that divides the duplicated genetic material housed within the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells. During this phase, the paired chromosomes, known as sister chromatids, which were aligned along the cell's equatorial plane during metaphase, are pulled apart by spindle fibers. These fibers, which attach to a specific region of the chromosome called the centromere, shorten as they contract, effectively pulling the sister chromatids toward opposite poles of the cell.

This movement is assisted by motor proteins that "walk" along the microtubules, dragging the chromosomes along with them. As the centromeres split, the sister chromatids become individual chromosomes and move to opposite ends of the cell. Concurrently, the cell elongates in preparation for the subsequent stage of mitosis, known as telophase.

Anaphase is a critical stage in cell division. Any errors that occur during this phase, such as improper separation of chromosomes, can lead to genetic disorders due to the resulting cells having an abnormal number of chromosomes. Therefore, the precise and coordinated movement of chromosomes during anaphase is essential for the accurate inheritance of genetic material.

In summary, anaphase is a pivotal stage in mitosis where the genetic material of the cell is meticulously divided before the actual cell division occurs. This process ensures that each new cell receives the correct number of chromosomes.
