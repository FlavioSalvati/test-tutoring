Gibberellins are a class of plant hormones that play a pivotal role in regulating growth and influencing various developmental processes, such as stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering.

Often abbreviated as GAs, gibberellins constitute a large family of hormones essential for promoting plant growth and development. Their discovery dates back to the 1920s in Japan, when researchers were investigating a disease affecting rice plants caused by the fungus *Gibberella fujikuroi*, which led to the naming of these hormones.

One of the primary functions of gibberellins is to promote the growth of stems and internodes. They achieve this by stimulating both cell elongation and division, which enables the plant to grow taller. This process is particularly crucial for seedlings and young plants, as it allows them to grow rapidly and compete effectively for sunlight.

Gibberellins also play a vital role in seed germination. They assist in breaking seed dormancy—a state in which seeds are alive but inactive—by stimulating the production of enzymes that decompose the seed's food reserves. This breakdown provides the necessary energy for the seed to sprout and initiate growth.

Additionally, gibberellins are key regulators of flowering. They can affect both the timing and development of flowers. In certain plant species, the presence of gibberellins is essential for flower formation, while in others, they can induce flowering to occur earlier than it would naturally.

Beyond these critical functions, gibberellins are involved in a variety of other plant processes, including leaf growth, fruit development, and the transition from juvenile to adult phases. They also interact with other plant hormones, such as auxins and cytokinins, to synchronize growth and development effectively.

In summary, gibberellins are indispensable for numerous aspects of plant growth and development, from the germination of seeds to the growth of the plant, flowering, and even fruit development.
