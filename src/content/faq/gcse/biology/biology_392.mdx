The body regulates blood glucose levels through the actions of two key hormones: insulin and glucagon, both produced by the pancreas.

These hormones operate in a complementary manner, akin to a seesaw, to maintain glucose balance in the bloodstream. 

When you consume food, your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which enters the bloodstream, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. In response, the pancreas secretes insulin. Insulin functions like a key, facilitating the entry of glucose into the body's cells. This process lowers the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, returning it to a normal range.

Conversely, if blood glucose levels fall too low—perhaps due to an extended period without food—the pancreas releases glucagon. Glucagon signals the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This action elevates blood glucose levels back to a normal range.

In addition to insulin and glucagon, the body employs other hormones to regulate blood glucose levels. For instance, during periods of stress, the body releases stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones prompt the liver to release additional glucose into the bloodstream, providing the energy necessary to respond to the stressful situation.

In summary, the body utilizes a complex network of hormones to maintain glucose equilibrium in the bloodstream. This intricate system ensures that your body consistently has the energy it requires to function effectively.
