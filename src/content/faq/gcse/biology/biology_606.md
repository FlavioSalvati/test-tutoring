Sugars are transported through the phloem via a process known as translocation.

Translocation refers to the movement of organic compounds, primarily sugars such as sucrose, from the leaves—where they are synthesized during photosynthesis—to various other parts of the plant. This transport occurs within the phloem, a specialized type of vascular tissue found in plants.

The process initiates in the leaves, where photosynthesis generates sugars. These sugars are actively transported into the phloem cells, resulting in an influx of water from the xylem due to osmosis. This influx generates high pressure at the source, which is the leaves. Concurrently, sugars are either consumed or stored in other parts of the plant, such as the roots or fruits. The removal of sugars from the phloem cells leads to a decrease in water content, creating lower pressure at the sink, which may be the roots or fruits. This pressure differential drives the movement of sugars from the source to the sink.

It is important to note that this movement is not limited to a downward direction from leaves to roots; rather, it can occur in any direction depending on the plant's needs. For instance, during the spring, stored sugars in the roots can be transported upwards to the buds that are about to unfurl into leaves.

Translocation is crucial for the growth and development of the plant. It ensures that all parts of the plant, from the roots to the tips of the leaves, receive the essential nutrients required for proper functioning and growth. Without this efficient transport system, a plant would struggle to survive and thrive.
