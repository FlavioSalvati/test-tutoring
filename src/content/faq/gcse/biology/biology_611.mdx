Antiviral drugs can be categorized into several main classes, each with distinct mechanisms of action. The primary types include nucleoside analogues, protease inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors.

**Nucleoside Analogues**  
Nucleoside analogues are antiviral drugs that mimic the building blocks of DNA or RNA. When a virus attempts to replicate, it may incorporate these synthetic building blocks into its genetic material. This incorporation disrupts the replication process, ultimately hindering the virus's ability to spread. Notable examples of nucleoside analogues include acyclovir, which is used to treat herpes viruses, and ribavirin, commonly employed for hepatitis C treatment.

**Protease Inhibitors**  
Protease inhibitors represent another class of antiviral drugs. They function by blocking the activity of protease, an enzyme essential for viral replication. By inhibiting this enzyme, protease inhibitors prevent the virus from multiplying. These drugs are frequently prescribed for the treatment of HIV and hepatitis C. Examples of protease inhibitors include ritonavir and saquinavir.

**Fusion Inhibitors**  
Fusion inhibitors belong to a newer class of antiviral medications. They work by preventing viruses from fusing with host cells, a critical step in the viral life cycle. By blocking this fusion process, these drugs stop the virus from entering the cell and replicating. Fusion inhibitors are primarily utilized in the treatment of HIV, with enfuvirtide being a prominent example.

**Neuraminidase Inhibitors**  
Neuraminidase inhibitors are specifically used to combat influenza viruses. These drugs inhibit the action of neuraminidase, an enzyme that facilitates the release of newly formed virus particles from the host cell. By blocking this enzyme, neuraminidase inhibitors prevent the virus from spreading to other cells. Well-known examples include oseltamivir and zanamivir.

Each class of antiviral drug targets different stages of the viral replication process, thus helping to mitigate the spread of infections. The selection of an appropriate antiviral drug is influenced by factors such as the specific virus being treated, the severity of the infection, and the overall health of the patient.
