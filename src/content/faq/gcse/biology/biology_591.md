White blood cells play a crucial role in defending the body by identifying, attacking, and eliminating harmful bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances.

Also known as leukocytes, white blood cells are an essential component of the immune system. They are produced in the bone marrow and continuously circulate in the bloodstream, vigilant for any harmful invaders. Upon encountering a foreign substance, they promptly spring into action to protect the body.

There are several types of white blood cells, each with a specific function in the immune response:

- **Neutrophils** are the most common type and are typically the first to arrive at the site of an infection. They engage in a process called phagocytosis, where they engulf and destroy bacteria and fungi.

- **Lymphocytes** are another vital type of white blood cell responsible for orchestrating the immune response. They produce antibodies that specifically target and neutralize foreign invaders. Additionally, lymphocytes can remember previous threats, allowing the body to mount a faster response if the same invader attempts to attack again.

- **Monocytes** are larger white blood cells that also perform phagocytosis, but they have a longer lifespan compared to neutrophils. Upon migrating to tissues, monocytes can differentiate into macrophages, which are even more effective in engulfing and destroying bacteria.

- **Eosinophils** and **basophils**, while less abundant, play significant roles in the bodyâ€™s responses to allergies and parasitic infections.

In addition to combating foreign invaders, white blood cells assist in the repair of damaged tissues. They produce various substances that promote healing and regeneration, facilitating recovery from injuries and infections.

In summary, white blood cells serve as the primary defense mechanism against harmful invaders. They identify, attack, and eliminate foreign substances while also aiding in tissue repair. Their diverse functions and capabilities make them a vital component of the immune system.
