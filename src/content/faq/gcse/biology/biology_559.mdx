The primary ethical concerns surrounding stem cell research focus on the sources of stem cells and the methods used to obtain them.

Stem cell research has the potential to transform the medical field by offering treatments for diseases that currently lack cures. However, it also presents several ethical dilemmas. The foremost issue is the origin of stem cells. Embryonic stem cells, which are the most versatile type, are typically harvested from embryos that are only a few days old. These embryos often come from in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures and are usually surplus embryos that would otherwise be discarded. The extraction of stem cells leads to the destruction of the embryo, a process that some individuals equate with taking a human life. This perspective is rooted in the belief that life begins at conception, granting the embryo the same moral status as a fully developed human being.

Another significant ethical concern is the potential exploitation of women, especially those from low-income backgrounds. In certain instances, women may be pressured or incentivized to donate their eggs for research purposes. This process can be risky and involves the administration of hormones to induce egg production, which carries potential side effects and health risks.

Additionally, there are worries about the prospect of "designer babies." If scientists gain advanced capabilities in manipulating stem cells, it could become theoretically possible to select specific traits for a child. This raises profound questions about the essence of humanity and the potential emergence of a new form of eugenics.

Lastly, concerns about the equitable distribution of any treatments developed from stem cell research cannot be overlooked. There is a risk that these treatments may be prohibitively expensive, making them accessible only to the wealthy and thereby exacerbating existing health disparities.

In summary, while stem cell research offers significant promise for medical advancements, it also raises complex ethical issues that warrant thorough consideration.
