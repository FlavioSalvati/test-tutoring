Microorganisms are cultured in laboratory settings using nutrient-rich media, which are maintained under controlled environmental conditions to facilitate optimal growth.

In a laboratory, the cultivation of microorganisms typically involves the use of a nutrient-rich medium that supplies the essential resources for growth. This medium can take various forms, including solid media such as agar plates or liquid media like broth. The choice of medium is largely determined by the type of microorganism being cultured and the specific goals of the culture. For instance, bacteria generally thrive on agar plates, whereas yeasts and molds may exhibit better growth in liquid broths.

The culturing process begins by introducing the microorganism into the selected medium. This can be accomplished by streaking a sample across the surface of an agar plate or by inoculating a broth with the microorganism. The culture is then incubated at a designated temperature that is optimal for the growth of the microorganism, typically around $37^\circ C$ for human pathogens, although this can vary depending on the species.

During the incubation phase, the microorganisms multiply and form visible colonies. These colonies can be observed and counted to estimate the number of microorganisms present in the original sample. Furthermore, the characteristics of the colonies—such as shape, color, and size—can provide valuable insights into the identity of the microorganism.

To prevent contamination, all materials involved in the culturing process must be sterilized prior to use. This includes the medium, containers, and any tools utilized to handle the microorganisms. Additionally, the work area must be maintained in a clean state, free from extraneous microorganisms that could compromise the culture.

In certain situations, selective media are employed to promote the growth of specific microorganisms while suppressing others. This approach is particularly useful for isolating a distinct species from a mixed sample. Similarly, differential media can be utilized to differentiate between various species based on their metabolic activities.

Overall, the process of culturing microorganisms in a laboratory demands meticulous planning and execution to ensure the successful growth of the desired species while preventing contamination.
