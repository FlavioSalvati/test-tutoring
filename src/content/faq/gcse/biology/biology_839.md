In genetics, alleles are different versions of a gene that individuals inherit from their parents. The terms 'dominant' and 'recessive' describe the behavior of these alleles in determining traits. Each individual receives two alleles for each gene—one from each parent. These alleles can be either the same (homozygous) or different (heterozygous).

A **dominant allele** is one that expresses its associated trait even when only a single copy is present. This means that if an individual inherits a dominant allele from either parent, the trait linked to that allele will manifest. For example, when examining the gene for flower color in pea plants, the allele for purple flowers is dominant. Consequently, any plant with at least one purple allele will display purple flowers.

Conversely, a **recessive allele** only expresses its trait when two copies are present. Therefore, an individual must inherit the same recessive allele from both parents for the trait to be observable. Continuing with the previous example, the allele for white flowers in peas is recessive. A plant will exhibit white flowers only if it receives the white allele from both parents.

In individuals that are heterozygous—possessing one dominant and one recessive allele—the dominant allele effectively 'masks' the expression of the recessive allele. This phenomenon is referred to as **complete dominance**. However, it is important to recognize that not all genes conform to this straightforward dominant-recessive pattern. Some genes demonstrate **incomplete dominance**, where a heterozygous individual exhibits a blend of both traits, while others show **co-dominance**, where both alleles are fully expressed.

Understanding the distinctions between dominant and recessive alleles is crucial for studying genetics. This knowledge explains how traits are inherited from parents to offspring and sheds light on the prevalence of certain traits within populations.
