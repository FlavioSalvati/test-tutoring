Cytokinesis and mitosis are two critical but distinct stages of the cell division process. Mitosis specifically refers to the division of the cell's nucleus and its contents, ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic material. This process is essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome across generations of cells.

Mitosis is subdivided into several key phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, the chromosomes condense and become visible. In metaphase, the chromosomes align at the cell's equatorial plane. Anaphase follows, during which the sister chromatids are pulled apart toward opposite poles of the cell. Finally, during telophase, new nuclear membranes form around each set of separated chromosomes, culminating the nuclear division.

Cytokinesis, in contrast, is the process that follows mitosis and involves the division of the cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane, resulting in the formation of two distinct daughter cells. In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs via a mechanism known as cleavage furrow formation, where the cell membrane pinches inward until the cell is cleaved into two. In plant cells, cytokinesis is achieved through the formation of a cell plate that develops along the center of the cell, ultimately becoming a new cell wall that separates the two daughter cells.

Although both processes are essential for cell division, they serve different functions. Mitosis is responsible for ensuring accurate replication and separation of the cell's genetic material, while cytokinesis physically divides the cytoplasmic content of the cell. Together, they ensure that each new cell is a complete and independent entity, equipped with a full complement of genetic material and organelles.

In summary, while both mitosis and cytokinesis are vital components of cell division, they are distinct processes with unique roles. Mitosis focuses on the division of the nucleus and its genetic contents, whereas cytokinesis is the mechanism that divides the cell into two separate cells.
