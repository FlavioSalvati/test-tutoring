The procedure for conducting a geotropism experiment involves setting up a seedling in a clinostat and observing its growth direction.

### Materials Needed

To carry out the geotropism experiment, you will need the following materials:

1. **Clinostat**: This device counteracts the effects of gravity by slowly rotating the plant.
2. **Seedling**: Choose a fast-growing species, such as a bean or pea plant.
3. **Pot with Soil**: Ensure it is suitable for planting.
4. **Water**: For keeping the seedling hydrated.
5. **Light Source**: To provide consistent illumination.

### Experimental Setup

1. **Plant the Seedling**: Begin by planting the seedling in the pot filled with soil and thoroughly water it.
2. **Position the Pot**: Place the pot on the clinostat and set it to rotate slowly. This rotation will evenly distribute the gravitational effect around the plant, simulating a condition in which gravity is essentially absent.
3. **Light Exposure**: Position the entire setup in an area where it will receive consistent light. This step is crucial to ensure that the only variable influencing the plant's growth direction is gravity, eliminating the effects of phototropism.

### Observations

Over the following days, observe the growth direction of the seedling. Typically, roots exhibit positive geotropism, growing downwards, while shoots display negative geotropism, growing upwards. However, due to the clinostat's effect of negating gravity, the plant should grow in a direction that is independent of gravitational pull.

### Data Recording

Be diligent in recording your observations daily. Note the direction of the seedling's growth and any changes in its growth pattern. Additionally, measure the lengths of both the roots and shoots to determine if the absence of gravity influences their growth rates.

### Conclusion

This experiment will enhance your understanding of geotropism, defined as the directional growth of plants in response to gravity. This concept is a fundamental aspect of plant biology and is particularly relevant for understanding how plants might adapt and grow in zero-gravity environments, such as in space.
