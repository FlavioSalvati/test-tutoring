Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is assessed through various methods, including the disk diffusion test and the broth dilution test.

The disk diffusion test, commonly referred to as the Kirby-Bauer test, is a widely used technique for evaluating antibiotic resistance. In this procedure, a bacterial sample is evenly spread across a nutrient-rich agar plate. Small disks, each impregnated with a specific antibiotic, are then placed onto the agar surface. After incubating the plate to allow bacterial growth, a clear zone known as the zone of inhibition appears around the disk if the bacteria are sensitive to the antibiotic. The diameter of this zone is measured and compared to established standard tables to classify the bacteria as resistant, intermediate, or sensitive to the tested antibiotic.

The broth dilution test provides another approach to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevents visible growth of the bacterium. In this method, a series of test tubes containing equal volumes of nutrient broth and progressively increasing concentrations of the antibiotic are inoculated with a standardized amount of bacteria. After incubation, the MIC is identified as the concentration in the first tube of the series that exhibits no visible growth.

Additionally, the E-test is employed as a more precise method for determining antibiotic susceptibility. This test utilizes a strip that is impregnated with a gradient of an antibiotic. The strip is placed on an agar plate previously inoculated with the bacteria. Following incubation, the MIC can be determined where the edge of the bacterial growth intersects the strip.

These testing methods are essential in clinical environments, as they guide healthcare professionals in selecting appropriate antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. Furthermore, they play a critical role in monitoring the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, contributing to public health efforts.
