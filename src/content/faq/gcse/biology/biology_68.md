The principle underlying ELISA tests is the detection of specific antibodies or antigens in a sample through enzyme-mediated reactions.

ELISA, which stands for Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, is a widely utilized laboratory technique for identifying the presence of specific antibodies or antigens in various samples. This detection is accomplished through a sequence of enzyme reactions that generate a visible signal, typically in the form of a color change, indicating the presence of the target substance.

The procedure begins with a 'capture' phase, during which the sample is introduced to a plate that has been coated with a specific antigen or antibody. If the target substance exists within the sample, it will bind to these molecules on the plate. Subsequently, the plate undergoes a washing step to eliminate any unbound substances.

Following this, the 'detection' phase occurs. An enzyme-linked antibody or antigen, specifically designed to bind to the target substance, is added to the plate. Again, the plate is washed to remove any unbound molecules.

The final 'readout' phase involves the addition of a substrate that the enzyme can act upon. The enzyme catalyzes a reaction with this substrate, leading to the production of a visible signal. Typically, this signal manifests as a color change, with its intensity being directly proportional to the quantity of the target substance present in the sample.

In summary, ELISA tests leverage specific antigen-antibody interactions alongside enzyme reactions to identify and quantify a particular substance within a sample. This methodology makes ELISA an invaluable tool in diagnostics and research, facilitating the detection of a diverse array of substances, ranging from hormones and drugs to bacteria and viruses.
