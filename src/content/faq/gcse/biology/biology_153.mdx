The normal range for blood glucose levels is generally established as follows: fasting levels should be between $4.0$ and $5.4$ mmol/L, while levels should not exceed $7.8$ mmol/L two hours after eating.

Blood glucose levels, often referred to as blood sugar levels, represent the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Glucose, a type of sugar, serves as a primary energy source for the body and is derived from the foods we consume. When fasting—defined as not eating for at least eight hours—normal blood glucose levels typically fall within the range of $4.0$ to $5.4$ mmol/L. Following a meal, these levels will naturally increase but should remain below $7.8$ mmol/L two hours post-consumption.

It's important to recognize that these values can vary slightly based on individual differences and the laboratory conducting the analysis. However, the aforementioned ranges are widely accepted as standard. Blood glucose levels tend to fluctuate throughout the day, usually reaching their lowest point in the morning before breakfast and increasing after meals due to the glucose released from digested food.

Consistently elevated blood glucose levels may indicate a condition such as diabetes, while persistently low levels could suggest hypoglycemia, both of which necessitate medical attention.

The body maintains blood glucose levels through a homeostatic mechanism. The pancreas plays a vital role in this regulation. When blood glucose levels rise, the pancreas secretes a hormone known as insulin, which facilitates the absorption of glucose by cells, thereby reducing blood glucose levels. Conversely, if blood glucose levels drop, the pancreas releases glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the release of stored glucose, helping to elevate blood glucose levels.

For overall health, it is crucial to understand and maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range. This is especially important for individuals with conditions like diabetes, who must regularly monitor their blood glucose levels to prevent potential health complications.
