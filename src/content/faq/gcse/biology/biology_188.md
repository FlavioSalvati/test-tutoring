Inherited disorders encompass a range of genetic conditions, including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, Huntington's disease, and Down syndrome.

Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disorder that predominantly impacts the lungs and digestive system. It arises from a mutation in the CFTR gene, leading to the production of thick, sticky mucus that can obstruct the airways and hinder pancreatic function. This obstruction can result in severe respiratory and digestive complications. Cystic fibrosis follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, meaning that an individual must inherit two defective copies of the gene—one from each parent—to manifest the disease.

Sickle cell anemia is another genetic disorder, attributed to a mutation in the HBB gene. This gene encodes for beta-globin, a crucial component of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen throughout the bloodstream. The mutation causes red blood cells to adopt a sickle shape, impairing their ability to navigate small blood vessels. This can lead to painful episodes, increased susceptibility to infections, and various other complications. Like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia is also inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Hemophilia refers to a group of inherited bleeding disorders characterized by the blood's inability to clot properly. This deficiency can result in spontaneous bleeding as well as excessive bleeding following injuries or surgical procedures. Hemophilia is caused by mutations in genes responsible for producing essential blood-clotting proteins. It is classified as an X-linked recessive disorder, which means it is typically transmitted from mother to son.

Huntington's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to uncontrolled movements, emotional disturbances, and cognitive decline. This condition is caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. Huntington's disease is classified as an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning that an individual needs to inherit only one copy of the mutated gene to develop the condition.

Down syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Unlike the other disorders mentioned, Down syndrome is not directly inherited; rather, it typically results from an error in cell division during the formation of the egg, sperm, or embryo. Individuals with Down syndrome often experience physical growth delays, exhibit distinctive facial features, and may have mild to moderate intellectual disabilities.
