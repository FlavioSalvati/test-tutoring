Gibberellins are vital plant hormones that significantly influence various growth and developmental processes, particularly in seed germination. They play an essential role in breaking seed dormancy, which is a state where seeds are viable but do not germinate until specific environmental conditions are met.

Seed dormancy serves as a survival mechanism for many plant species, enabling seeds to endure unfavorable conditions until the environment becomes conducive for germination. Gibberellins facilitate the breaking of this dormancy by stimulating the production of enzymes that degrade the seed coat. This process allows the seed to absorb water and oxygen, both of which are critical for initiating germination.

In addition to breaking dormancy, gibberellins promote cell elongation and division, which are crucial for the growth of the emerging seedling. They achieve this by enhancing the synthesis of proteins involved in loosening the cell walls, thereby enabling the cells to expand. This function is especially significant during the initial stages of germination, as the embryonic root, known as the radicle, must penetrate the seed coat and establish itself in the soil.

Moreover, gibberellins interact with other plant hormones, such as abscisic acid, which is known to inhibit seed germination. The interplay between gibberellins and abscisic acid is believed to be a critical factor in determining whether a seed will germinate or remain dormant.

In summary, gibberellins are instrumental in seed germination by breaking dormancy, promoting cell elongation and division, and modulating interactions with other plant hormones. Without gibberellins, many seeds would remain dormant and fail to germinate, even in favorable conditions.
