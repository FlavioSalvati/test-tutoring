Osmosis and diffusion are fundamental processes involved in the transport of substances across membranes. While both are classified as passive transport mechanisms that do not require energy, they have distinct characteristics and functions.

**Osmosis** specifically refers to the movement of water molecules across a semi-permeable membrane. This process occurs when water moves from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. The semi-permeable membrane permits the passage of water molecules but restricts the movement of solute particles. Consequently, there is a net flow of water toward the side with the higher concentration of solutes, which helps to equilibrate the concentrations on both sides of the membrane.

In contrast, **diffusion** is a broader process that involves the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This can apply to various types of particles, including gases, liquids, or dissolved solids, and does not necessitate a semi-permeable membrane. The movement of particles during diffusion is random, as they spread out to achieve uniform distribution, ultimately reaching a state of equilibrium.

Both osmosis and diffusion play crucial roles in biological systems. Osmosis is vital for maintaining water balance within cells and facilitates the transport of water-soluble substances. On the other hand, diffusion is key for processes such as gas exchange in the lungs, where oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse across the thin walls of the alveoli.

In summary, while osmosis and diffusion share similarities as passive transport processes, they differ significantly in the substances they transport and the conditions under which they occur. Osmosis pertains specifically to the movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane, whereas diffusion encompasses the movement of various particles from regions of high concentration to those of low concentration.
