Glucagon is a hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas, and it plays a vital role in regulating blood glucose levels, thereby maintaining the body's energy balance. When blood glucose levels decrease—such as during fasting or intense physical activity—the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream.

Once in circulation, glucagon targets the liver, stimulating the conversion of stored glycogen into glucose. Glycogen, a polysaccharide form of glucose, serves as a reserve of energy for the body. The process by which glucagon facilitates the transformation of glycogen into glucose is called glycogenolysis. The glucose generated from this process is then released into the bloodstream, resulting in an increase in blood glucose levels.

In addition to promoting glycogenolysis, glucagon also enhances the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources through a process known as gluconeogenesis. This occurs primarily in the liver and kidneys and involves converting amino acids and other substrates into glucose.

Glucagon's function in elevating blood glucose levels is a crucial component of the body's homeostatic mechanisms—maintaining stable internal conditions necessary for survival. It works in conjunction with insulin, another hormone produced by the pancreas, which lowers blood glucose levels when they are elevated. Together, insulin and glucagon ensure that the body has a consistent energy supply, regardless of external conditions or meal timing.

Understanding the role of glucagon in regulating blood glucose levels is essential not only for grasping fundamental human physiology but also for comprehending medical conditions such as diabetes, in which this regulation is impaired. In type 1 diabetes, for example, the body's inability to produce insulin results in elevated blood glucose levels. In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells develop resistance to insulin, leading to similarly high blood glucose levels. In both scenarios, a thorough understanding of glucagon's role can be beneficial in managing these conditions.
