The primary criteria for classifying organisms within the three-domain system are cellular structure and ribosomal RNA sequences.

The three-domain system, introduced by Carl Woese in 1990, categorizes cellular life into three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. This classification is based on differences in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences, marking a significant shift from the traditional two-kingdom system that classified life forms solely into plants and animals based on their physical characteristics.

The first criterion, cellular structure, is essential for distinguishing between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotes, which include organisms such as bacteria and archaea, lack a nucleus and possess a simpler cell structure without organelles. In contrast, eukaryotes—comprising animals, plants, and fungi—have a more complex cellular architecture featuring various organelles, including a nucleus.

The second criterion, ribosomal RNA sequences, is crucial as rRNA is found in all organisms and is integral to the process of protein synthesis. By analyzing the sequences of rRNA, scientists can uncover the evolutionary relationships among different organisms. Research has revealed that Archaea and Eukarya share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than either does with Bacteria, which has been pivotal in establishing the three-domain framework.

Within this classification system, both Bacteria and Archaea are composed of single-celled organisms, while Eukarya can be either unicellular or multicellular. The Eukarya domain is further subdivided into four kingdoms: Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. These subdivisions are based on additional criteria, including the presence of a cell wall, modes of nutrition, and motility.

In conclusion, the three-domain system offers a comprehensive classification of organisms based on cellular structure and ribosomal RNA sequences. This approach provides a more accurate representation of the evolutionary relationships among various forms of life.
