Here are some examples of genetically modified organisms (GMOs): Bt cotton, Flavr Savr tomatoes, Golden Rice, and AquAdvantage salmon.

**Bt Cotton**  
Bt cotton is a genetically modified variety that produces a toxin lethal to bollworms, a prevalent pest in cotton cultivation. This toxin is derived from a gene obtained from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt), which has been integrated into the cotton's DNA. As a result, Bt cotton can effectively defend itself against pests, significantly reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides.

**Flavr Savr Tomatoes**  
Flavr Savr tomatoes hold the distinction of being the first genetically modified food approved for human consumption. Developed by scientists at Calgene, a biotechnology company, these tomatoes have been engineered to slow down the ripening process. This modification enables the tomatoes to remain firm for an extended period after harvest, which enhances their shelf life and diminishes food waste.

**Golden Rice**  
Golden Rice is a genetically modified rice variety designed to produce beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. This modification was specifically aimed at addressing vitamin A deficiency, a serious health issue in many developing countries where rice is a staple food. The presence of beta-carotene gives the rice its characteristic golden hue, which is the origin of its name, 'Golden Rice'.

**AquAdvantage Salmon**  
AquAdvantage salmon is a genetically modified salmon that grows at twice the rate of conventional salmon. This accelerated growth is achieved by inserting a growth hormone gene from the Chinook salmon, along with a promoter gene from the ocean pout, into the DNA of Atlantic salmon. This genetic modification enables the salmon to produce growth hormone continuously throughout the year, resulting in faster growth and potentially more efficient farming practices.

These examples highlight the diverse applications of genetic modification in agriculture and food production, ranging from pest resistance and prolonged shelf life to nutritional enhancement and accelerated growth.
