Therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning are two distinct processes with different objectives. 

**Therapeutic Cloning** 

Therapeutic cloning, also referred to as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), is a technique aimed at generating embryonic stem cells for medical treatment or disease cure. The stem cells produced are genetically identical to the patient's cells, which significantly minimizes the risk of rejection during medical therapies. The process begins by extracting the nucleus from an egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus from a somatic (body) cell of the patient. Following this, the egg cell is stimulated to divide, leading to the formation of an embryo from which stem cells can be harvested.

**Reproductive Cloning**

In contrast, reproductive cloning focuses on creating a complete organism that is genetically identical to another organism. A notable example of this is Dolly the sheep, the first mammal successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell. Similar to therapeutic cloning, reproductive cloning also involves transferring a nucleus from a somatic cell into an egg cell. However, instead of retrieving stem cells from the resulting embryo, this embryo is implanted into a surrogate mother, allowing it to develop into a fully formed organism.

**Key Differences**

Although both therapeutic and reproductive cloning involve the transfer of a nucleus from a somatic cell to an egg cell, their ultimate goals are fundamentally different. Therapeutic cloning is geared towards producing cells that can be utilized in medical treatments, whereas reproductive cloning aims to create an entire organism. 

It is essential to highlight that while therapeutic cloning presents promising avenues for research and potential applications in regenerative medicine, reproductive cloning is fraught with ethical and practical dilemmas. As a result, reproductive cloning is currently prohibited in many countries.
