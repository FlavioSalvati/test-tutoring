When blood glucose levels rise excessively, it can result in a condition known as hyperglycaemia, which can lead to a variety of health issues.

Hyperglycaemia, characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, occurs when there is an excess of glucose in the bloodstream. This situation may arise if the body does not produce sufficient insulin—a hormone secreted by the pancreas that facilitates the entry of glucose into cells—or if the body is unable to utilize insulin effectively. This condition is frequently associated with diabetes, a chronic disease that impairs the body's ability to process blood sugar.

In response to rising blood glucose levels, the pancreas releases insulin. Insulin enables the cells in the body to absorb glucose and utilize it as a source of energy. However, if the body produces inadequate insulin or if the cells develop resistance to insulin's effects, glucose accumulation occurs in the bloodstream, leading to hyperglycaemia.

The symptoms of hyperglycaemia may include frequent urination, increased thirst, headaches, fatigue, and difficulties with concentration. If left untreated, persistently high blood glucose levels can result in serious complications, including damage to blood vessels, which may lead to heart disease and stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, and vision impairment.

In addition to these long-term complications, extremely high blood glucose levels can precipitate a life-threatening condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis. This occurs when the body begins to break down fat for energy due to its inability to utilize glucose effectively. This metabolic process generates byproducts called ketones, which can accumulate in the blood, leading to a dangerously acidic pH level.

To prevent hyperglycaemia and maintain overall health, it is essential to adopt a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, and, when necessary, take medications to regulate blood glucose levels. Furthermore, individuals with diabetes must consistently monitor their blood glucose levels to ensure they remain within a safe range.
