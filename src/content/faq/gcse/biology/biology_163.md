Reaction times can be measured in practical experiments using simple techniques such as the ruler drop test or more advanced digital software.

In a typical classroom setting, the ruler drop test is a widely used method for assessing reaction times. In this procedure, one participant holds a ruler vertically with the $0 \, \text{cm}$ mark at the top and the other end hanging down. The participant being tested places their thumb and forefinger at the bottom of the ruler without making contact. The first person then drops the ruler without any warning, and the second participant must catch it as quickly as possible. The point on the ruler where they manage to catch it can be used to calculate their reaction time; the lower the catch point, the faster the reaction time.

Another approach involves using digital software or online tools designed specifically to measure reaction times. These tools typically present a visual or auditory stimulus, such as a color change on the screen or a sound. The participant must respond as quickly as possible by clicking a button or pressing a key. The software then records the time elapsed from the stimulus to the response.

In more advanced environments, such as laboratories, reaction times can be measured with sophisticated equipment. For instance, a light sensor can detect a flash of light, while a pressure sensor can measure the time it takes for a participant to press a button in response. These methods can yield highly accurate measurements of reaction times.

Regardless of the method employed, it is crucial to conduct multiple trials and calculate an average to obtain a reliable measure of reaction time. This practice helps to mitigate the effects of any anomalies or outliers in the data.
