The primary components of a hydrogen fuel cell include the anode, cathode, electrolyte, and catalyst.

A hydrogen fuel cell operates as a device that generates electricity through a chemical reaction. It comprises two electrodes: an anode and a cathode, which are separated by an electrolyte. While the anode and cathode may be constructed from different materials, both are typically coated with a catalyst—most commonly platinum—to accelerate the reactions occurring at each electrode.

The anode serves as the negative terminal of the fuel cell. When hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) is introduced to the anode, the catalyst facilitates its dissociation into two hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) and two electrons ($e^-$). The hydrogen ions migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode, while the electrons are compelled to flow through an external circuit, thereby generating electric current.

The electrolyte is a medium that permits the movement of ions between the anode and cathode. In a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell—one of the most prevalent types—the electrolyte is a specialized polymer that selectively allows only positive ions (protons) to pass through. This selective permeability ensures that the electrons must traverse the external circuit, contributing to the generation of electricity.

The cathode acts as the positive terminal of the fuel cell. At this electrode, oxygen gas ($\text{O}_2$) is introduced, where it reacts with the hydrogen ions that have traversed the electrolyte and the electrons that have traveled through the external circuit. This reaction results in the formation of water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), which is the sole waste product emitted by a hydrogen fuel cell.

The catalyst plays a crucial role in enhancing the rate of reactions at both the anode and cathode. Typically composed of platinum—a precious metal known for its effectiveness in catalyzing these reactions—it is also costly and scarce. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring more affordable and abundant alternatives to platinum for utilization in fuel cells.
