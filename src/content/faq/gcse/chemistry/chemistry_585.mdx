Greenhouse gases are compounds present in Earth's atmosphere that trap heat, contributing to the greenhouse effect and the phenomenon of global warming.

These gases consist of several key components, including carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), nitrous oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$), and various fluorinated gases. They play a vital role in maintaining the Earth's temperature by trapping heat from the sun, a process known as the greenhouse effect. This effect is essential for sustaining life on our planet; without it, the Earth would be too cold for most life forms to thrive.

However, human activities—such as the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes—have significantly increased the concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere. This escalation has led to an enhanced greenhouse effect, resulting in a rise in the Earth's average temperature, a phenomenon referred to as global warming.

Among these gases, carbon dioxide is the most prominent greenhouse gas emitted by human activities, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heating, and transportation. Methane is released during the extraction and transportation of coal, oil, and natural gas. It is also produced by livestock and certain agricultural practices, as well as from the decomposition of organic waste in municipal solid waste landfills. Nitrous oxide is emitted through agricultural and industrial activities, as well as from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Fluorinated gases, which are synthetic and highly potent, are released from a variety of industrial applications.

The ability of these gases to absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere varies and is referred to as their global warming potential (GWP). Gases with a higher GWP are more efficient at trapping heat per unit mass compared to those with a lower GWP, thereby contributing more significantly to global warming. For instance, methane has a GWP of $25$, indicating that it is $25$ times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.

Understanding the properties and impacts of greenhouse gases is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate their effects and combat climate change.
