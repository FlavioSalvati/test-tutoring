Transition metals display variable oxidation states primarily because they possess unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals.

Transition metals constitute a distinct group of elements located in the central region of the periodic table. Their unique property lies in the presence of unpaired electrons within their d-orbitals, which significantly contributes to their ability to exhibit a range of oxidation states. Oxidation states, or oxidation numbers, quantify the degree of oxidation of an atom within a chemical compound. These states can fluctuate during chemical reactions, and for transition metals, this variation can be substantial.

The energy levels of the d-orbitals in transition metals are closely aligned, allowing for the easy promotion of electrons between orbitals. This characteristic facilitates the occurrence of multiple oxidation states. For instance, iron ($\text{Fe}$) can exist in both the +2 and +3 oxidation states, while manganese ($\text{Mn}$) can exhibit oxidation states ranging from +2 to +7.

Furthermore, the variable oxidation states of transition metals arise from the availability of both 4s and 3d electrons for bonding. When forming chemical bonds, these metals can lose different numbers of electrons from their 4s and 3d orbitals, resulting in diverse oxidation states. For example, when iron forms iron(II) ions, it loses two electrons from the 4s orbital, leading to a +2 oxidation state. In contrast, when iron forms iron(III) ions, it loses two electrons from the 4s orbital and one electron from the 3d orbital, which results in a +3 oxidation state.

In conclusion, the capacity of transition metals to exhibit variable oxidation states is attributed to the presence of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals and the close energy levels of these orbitals. This characteristic is essential to their chemical behavior and is a key topic covered in GCSE Chemistry.
