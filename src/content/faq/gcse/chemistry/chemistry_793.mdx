Common examples of endothermic reactions include photosynthesis, the cooking of an egg, and the chemical reaction between barium hydroxide and ammonium chloride.

Photosynthesis is a well-known endothermic process that occurs in plants. During this process, plants absorb sunlight and utilize that energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The energy required for this transformation is derived from sunlight, which is absorbed, making photosynthesis an endothermic reaction. The energy captured in this process is stored within the glucose molecules, which can later be utilized by the plant when needed.

Cooking an egg serves as another familiar example of an endothermic reaction. When an egg is cooked, heat energy is supplied to it. This energy is absorbed by the proteins present in the egg, leading to their denaturation and alteration in structure. This structural change is responsible for the egg solidifying and cooking. Notably, the energy is not released back into the surrounding environment, thus classifying this process as endothermic.

The reaction between barium hydroxide and ammonium chloride is a classic example often demonstrated in chemistry. When these two substances are combined, they react to form barium chloride, ammonia, and water. This reaction absorbs heat from its surroundings, resulting in the mixture feeling cold to the touch. This phenomenon clearly illustrates an endothermic reaction, as energy in the form of heat is taken in from the environment.

In all of these examples, the reactions are considered endothermic because they absorb energy from their surroundings. This contrasts with exothermic reactions, which release energy. Understanding the distinction between these two types of reactions is fundamental to the study of chemistry.
