Alloys are generally stronger than pure metals due to their more intricate structures, which enhance resistance to deformation and fracture.

Pure metals consist of identical atoms that are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. This uniform arrangement allows the layers of atoms to slide easily over one another, resulting in softness and malleability. Consequently, pure metals are not particularly strong, making them susceptible to deformation and breakage.

In contrast, alloys are created by combining two or more different metals. The varying sizes of the atoms in these metals disrupt the regular atomic arrangement. This disruption makes it more challenging for the atomic layers to slide past each other, resulting in alloys that are significantly harder and stronger than the individual pure metals from which they are composed.

Moreover, the combination of different metals in an alloy can lead to the formation of a variety of structures, depending on the proportions of the metals and the specific conditions under which the alloy is synthesized. These diverse structures can exhibit distinct properties, allowing for customization to meet specific application requirements. For instance, steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, is considerably stronger than pure iron and is widely utilized in applications ranging from construction to automobile manufacturing.

Additionally, alloys may incorporate non-metal elements, such as carbon in the case of steel, which can further enhance their strength. These non-metal elements can form robust bonds with the metal atoms, contributing to the structural integrity of the alloy and increasing its hardness and strength.

In summary, alloys demonstrate greater strength than pure metals due to their complex structures, which consist of atoms of varying sizes and potentially include non-metal elements. This complexity enhances their resistance to deformation and breakage.
