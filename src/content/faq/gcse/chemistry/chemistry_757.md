The primary goal of titration is to ascertain the concentration of an unknown solution by utilizing a solution with a known concentration.

Titration is a widely used laboratory technique in quantitative chemical analysis. It enables the determination of the precise amount of a specific substance present in a sample. This is accomplished by incrementally adding a solution of known concentration, referred to as the titrant, to a solution of unknown concentration, known as the analyte, until the reaction between the two is complete. This completion point is identified as the equivalence point or end point.

The titration process involves the careful measurement of the addition of one solution to another. Specifically, the titrant is introduced to the analyte until the chemical reaction is fully realized. The completion of the reaction is typically signaled by a color change, which occurs due to the presence of an indicator. An indicator is a substance that alters its color at or near the equivalence point of the reaction.

Once the volume of titrant needed to reach the equivalence point is determined, this value is utilized to calculate the concentration of the analyte. This calculation is feasible because the stoichiometry of the reaction between the titrant and the analyte is well-established, allowing the moles of titrant to be directly related to the moles of analyte.

In summary, titration serves as an essential technique in analytical chemistry, employed to determine the concentration of an unknown solution. It is a precise and accurate method that enables chemists to quantify the exact amount of a substance within a sample.
