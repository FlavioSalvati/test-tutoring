Electrolysis of molten ionic compounds involves the application of an electric current to the liquid form of the compound.

To initiate electrolysis, the first step is to heat the ionic compound until it melts. This heating process breaks the ionic bonds that hold the compound together, allowing the ions to move freely within the liquid. This mobility of ions is crucial, as it enables the conduction of electricity during electrolysis.

Once the compound has melted, two electrodes are inserted into the liquid. These electrodes are typically made from materials that conduct electricity well, such as graphite or platinum. One electrode is connected to the positive terminal of a power source and is referred to as the anode, while the other electrode, connected to the negative terminal, is called the cathode.

When the power source is activated, an electric current flows through the molten compound, causing the ions to migrate toward the electrodes. Positively charged ions, known as cations, move toward the cathode, whereas negatively charged ions, or anions, move toward the anode.

At the electrodes, a process occurs where ions either gain or lose electrons; this is known as reduction and oxidation, respectively. Specifically, at the cathode, cations undergo reduction by gaining electrons, while at the anode, anions are oxidized by losing electrons. This transfer of electrons is responsible for the formation of new substances at the electrodes.

For instance, if electrolysis is conducted on molten sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$), sodium metal is produced at the cathode and chlorine gas at the anode. Sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$), being positively charged, travel to the cathode where they gain electrons to form sodium metal, while chlorine ions ($\text{Cl}^-$), which are negatively charged, move to the anode where they lose electrons and produce chlorine gas.

It is essential to remember that safety is of utmost importance when performing electrolysis, as this process involves high temperatures and the potential generation of hazardous substances. Always wear appropriate protective equipment and conduct experiments in a well-ventilated space.
