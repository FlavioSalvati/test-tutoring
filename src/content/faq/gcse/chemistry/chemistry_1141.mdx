NPK fertilizers are synthesized from ammonia through a series of intricate chemical reactions that involve nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and potassium chloride.

Ammonia serves as a fundamental ingredient in the production of NPK fertilizers. The process begins with the Haber process, in which nitrogen ($N_2$) and hydrogen ($H_2$) are combined under high pressure and elevated temperature to produce ammonia ($NH_3$). This ammonia is subsequently utilized in the Ostwald process, where it is oxidized to form nitric acid ($HNO_3$). Following this, the nitric acid is neutralized with ammonia to yield ammonium nitrate ($NH_4NO_3$), which supplies the nitrogen component of the NPK fertilizer.

The phosphorus component is sourced from phosphoric acid. Phosphate rock is treated with sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$) to produce phosphoric acid. This acid is then reacted with ammonia to generate ammonium phosphate ($NH_4H_2PO_4$).

The potassium component is derived from potassium chloride ($KCl$), which is extracted from the earth. The potassium chloride is dissolved in water and then reacted with both ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate to create the final NPK fertilizer.

The resulting NPK fertilizer is a well-balanced source of three essential plant nutrients: nitrogen ($N$), phosphorus ($P$), and potassium ($K$). Each of these nutrients plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. Specifically, nitrogen is vital for leaf and stem growth, phosphorus is necessary for root development and flowering, and potassium is important for overall plant health and disease resistance.

The production of NPK fertilizers from ammonia is a complex process that requires meticulous control of reaction conditions to ensure the correct balance of nutrients. Despite its intricacy, this process is essential for modern agriculture, providing a reliable and efficient means to supply vital nutrients to crops.
