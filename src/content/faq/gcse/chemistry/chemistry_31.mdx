Covalent bonding is a fundamental type of chemical bonding in which atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, typically characterized by a full outer shell of electrons. This configuration is generally the most stable state for an atom and is predominantly observed among non-metal atoms.

To illustrate covalent bonding, let's consider the example of a hydrogen molecule, denoted as $H_2$. Each hydrogen atom possesses one electron in its outer shell but requires two electrons to attain stability. By sharing their single electrons, the two hydrogen atoms form a covalent bond, allowing each atom to effectively complete its outer shell and thus stabilize the molecule.

Another illustrative example is the water molecule, represented as $H_2O$. In this case, the oxygen atom contains six electrons in its outer shell, yet it requires eight electrons to reach a stable configuration. Each hydrogen atom contributes one electron, and through the sharing of one electron with each hydrogen atom, the oxygen atom achieves a full outer shell. Simultaneously, both hydrogen atoms also complete their outer shells by sharing electrons with the oxygen atom.

In the context of covalent bonding, the electrons that are shared between atoms are commonly referred to as "shared pairs" or "bonding pairs." The strength of a covalent bond is influenced by the number of shared pairs: the greater the number of pairs, the stronger the bond. For instance, a single covalent bond consists of one shared pair of electrons, a double bond contains two shared pairs, and a triple bond comprises three shared pairs.

It is crucial to recognize that not all atoms possess the capability to form covalent bonds. The ability to engage in covalent bonding is determined by the atom's electronegativity, which quantifies its propensity to attract electrons. Atoms with similar electronegativities are more likely to form covalent bonds, facilitating the sharing of electrons to achieve stability.
