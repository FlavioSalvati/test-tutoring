Ionic compounds exhibit distinct properties in their solid and molten states. In the solid state, they are rigid and non-conductive, whereas in the molten state, they become fluid and conductive.

In their solid form, ionic compounds are arranged in a crystal lattice structure. This structure consists of a highly organized, repeating pattern of ions, where each positive ion is surrounded by negative ions, and vice versa. The crystal lattice is characterized by strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions, known as ionic bonds. These bonds firmly hold the ions in place, resulting in a compound that is hard and brittle. Since the ions are not free to move, solid ionic compounds do not conduct electricity.

When an ionic compound is heated to its melting point, it transitions from a solid to a liquid, or molten, state. During this process, the ionic bonds are broken, leading to the collapse of the rigid lattice structure. In the molten state, the ions gain the freedom to move around within the liquid. This increased mobility of ions enables molten ionic compounds to conduct electricity, as the movement of charged particles—specifically the ions themselves—is responsible for electrical conductivity.

Additionally, ionic compounds in the molten state exhibit increased fluidity. The strong ionic bonds that previously constrained the ions in the solid state are no longer present, allowing the ions to move past one another freely, which facilitates the flow of the compound.

In summary, the properties of ionic compounds differ significantly between the solid and molten states. The solid state is marked by a rigid, non-conductive crystal lattice structure, while the molten state is characterized by fluidity and conductivity due to the mobility of ions.
