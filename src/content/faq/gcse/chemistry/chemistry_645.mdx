Group 1 elements, commonly referred to as alkali metals, are a collection of elements on the periodic table that includes lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. The designation "alkali metals" stems from their shared characteristics, particularly their vigorous reactions with water. When alkali metals interact with water, they engage in a highly reactive process that produces hydrogen gas and a metal hydroxide compound. This metal hydroxide is classified as alkaline, indicating that it has a pH greater than $7$.

For instance, if a piece of sodium is introduced into water, it reacts to form sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas (Hâ‚‚). The resulting sodium hydroxide solution is alkaline, which is the origin of the term "alkali metals." This reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat, and can often be quite explosive, particularly with the heavier alkali metals.

The term "alkali" is derived from the Arabic word "al qali," which translates to "from the ashes," reflecting the historical method of obtaining many alkaline substances from plant ashes. Alkali metals are characterized by their shiny appearance, softness, and high reactivity at standard temperature and pressure. Due to their high reactivity, these metals are not found in nature in their elemental form; instead, they are typically found in various mineral compounds and must be isolated through chemical processes.

In summary, Group 1 elements are known as alkali metals because of their ability to form alkaline solutions upon reacting with water. This defining characteristic is a fundamental aspect of their chemical behavior.
