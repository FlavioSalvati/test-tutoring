The concentration of a solution is pivotal in titrations, as it enables us to accurately determine the amount of a substance present in that solution.

In a titration, we utilize a solution with a known concentration, referred to as the titrant, and add it to a solution with an unknown concentration, known as the analyte. The process continues until the reaction between the two solutions is complete, which is marked by the equivalence point.

At the equivalence point, the volume of the titrant used is measured, and since the concentration of the titrant is known, we can utilize these two pieces of information—along with the balanced chemical equation for the reaction—to calculate the concentration of the analyte. This principle forms the foundation of titration techniques.

For instance, consider the titration of a hydrochloric acid solution of unknown concentration with a sodium hydroxide solution of known concentration. You would gradually add the sodium hydroxide to the hydrochloric acid until the reaction is complete, which can be indicated by a color change in an indicator such as phenolphthalein, added to the acid solution prior to starting the titration.

The volume of the sodium hydroxide solution required to reach the equivalence point is recorded. Using this volume along with the known concentration of sodium hydroxide, the concentration of hydrochloric acid can be calculated using the formula:

$$ \text{Concentration (mol/dm}^3) = \frac{\text{Amount (mol)}}{\text{Volume (dm}^3)} $$

In this formula, the amount of sodium hydroxide is derived from the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, while the volume of sodium hydroxide corresponds to the measured volume during the titration.

Thus, concentration plays a crucial role in titrations, as it allows us to accurately determine the exact amount of a substance within a solution.
