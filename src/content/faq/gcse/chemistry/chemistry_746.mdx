Reduction refers to the process by which an atom, ion, or molecule gains electrons.

To elaborate, reduction is one half of a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction, which involves the transfer of electrons between two species. In a redox reaction, one species undergoes reduction (gains electrons) while the other undergoes oxidation (loses electrons). This electron transfer process is fundamental to a variety of chemical reactions, including those occurring in batteries, photosynthesis, and respiration.

The term 'reduction' is derived from the Latin word 'reducere', which means 'to lead back'. Historically, reduction referred to the process of extracting a metal from its ore, which was viewed as 'leading' the metal 'back' to its pure state. As our understanding of chemistry has evolved, the definition of reduction has been refined to specifically denote the gain of electrons.

To identify reduction in a chemical equation, look for the species that is gaining electrons. This can often be assessed by examining changes in oxidation state. If the oxidation state of a species decreases from one side of the equation to the other, that species has undergone reduction. For instance, in the reaction 

$$ 2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 $$ 

the hydrogen ions ($H^+$) are reduced to hydrogen gas ($H_2$) by gaining electrons.

It is important to remember that reduction and oxidation always occur together in a redox reaction; one cannot exist without the other. A useful mnemonic for recalling this concept is 'OIL RIG', which stands for 'Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain'â€”referring to the loss or gain of electrons.
