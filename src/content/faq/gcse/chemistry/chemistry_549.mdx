Limewater becomes milky upon the introduction of carbon dioxide due to the formation of calcium carbonate, a white precipitate.

When carbon dioxide gas is passed through limewater, a chemical reaction takes place. Limewater is essentially a solution of calcium hydroxide, which is a base, while carbon dioxide acts as a weak acid. The interaction between these two substances results in the production of calcium carbonate and water. Calcium carbonate is a white solid that is insoluble in water, meaning it does not dissolve but instead forms tiny solid particles that remain suspended in the liquid. This suspension gives the limewater its characteristic milky appearance.

The chemical equation representing this reaction is:

$$
\text{Ca(OH)}_2 \, (aq) + \text{CO}_2 \, (g) \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3 \, (s) + \text{H}_2\text{O} \, (l).
$$

In this equation, the notation $(aq)$ after calcium hydroxide indicates that it is dissolved in water, signifying a solution. The $(g)$ next to carbon dioxide indicates that it exists as a gas. The $(s)$ next to calcium carbonate denotes that it is a solid, while the $(l)$ next to water indicates that it is in liquid form.

This reaction serves as a reliable test for the presence of carbon dioxide. If there is suspicion that a gas is carbon dioxide, it can be bubbled through limewater. A milky appearance in the limewater confirms the presence of carbon dioxide, making this a simple yet effective method for identifying this specific gas.

In summary, the milky appearance of limewater when carbon dioxide is introduced is a result of a chemical reaction that produces calcium carbonate, a white solid that does not dissolve in water. Instead, it forms a suspension, imparting the water with a milky look.
