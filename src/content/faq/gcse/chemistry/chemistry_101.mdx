Dilution is the process of decreasing the concentration of a solution by increasing the volume of the solvent.

When a solution is diluted, additional solvent is added, which results in an increase in the total volume of the solution. However, the amount of solute—the substance that is dissolved—remains constant. Consequently, this leads to a decrease in the concentration of the solution. Concentration is defined as the amount of solute per unit volume of solution. Therefore, when the volume of the solution increases while the amount of solute stays the same, the concentration inevitably decreases.

For instance, consider a saltwater solution with a specific concentration. If you add more water to this solution, the quantity of salt does not change. However, the salt becomes distributed throughout a larger volume of water, resulting in a lower concentration of salt in the solution.

This concept is significant in numerous areas of chemistry, especially in analytical chemistry, where diluting solutions is often necessary to facilitate analysis. It is also relevant in everyday situations, such as when preparing a squash drink; you dilute the concentrated squash with water to achieve a more palatable flavor.

It is essential to remember that the process of dilution does not alter the total amount of solute present in the solution; it merely redistributes it over a greater volume. This redistribution is why the concentration decreases. Additionally, it is important to note that dilution is a physical change rather than a chemical one. The chemical properties of the solute remain unchanged during dilution; only its concentration is affected.
