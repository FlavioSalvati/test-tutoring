Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere primarily decrease through natural processes such as photosynthesis and ocean absorption.

Photosynthesis is a vital process that lowers atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Green plants, algae, and certain bacteria absorb carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) from the atmosphere, utilizing it in conjunction with sunlight and water to produce glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) and oxygen ($O_2$). This process is fundamental to life on Earth, as it not only provides nourishment for plants but also generates oxygen for animals. The glucose produced serves as an energy source for plant growth and reproduction, effectively sequestering carbon within the plant's biomass. When plants die and decompose, or when they are consumed by animals, some of this carbon can be released back into the atmosphere. However, a significant portion remains stored within the plant material, thereby contributing to a reduction in overall atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

The oceans also play an essential role in mitigating carbon dioxide levels. The surface layer of the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Once dissolved in seawater, carbon dioxide can be utilized by marine plants for photosynthesis or can react with seawater to form bicarbonate ions ($HCO_3^-$). These bicarbonate ions can subsequently combine with calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in the water to create calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$), a compound that constitutes the shells of many marine organisms. When these organisms die, their shells sink to the ocean floor, effectively sequestering carbon in the deep ocean.

In addition to these natural processes, human activities can also contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide levels. For example, reforestation and afforestation projects increase the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Furthermore, carbon capture and storage technologies are being developed to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it underground. However, it is important to note that these human efforts currently have a much smaller impact compared to the natural processes of photosynthesis and ocean absorption.
