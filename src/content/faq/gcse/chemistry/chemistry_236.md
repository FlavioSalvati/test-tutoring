Common examples of formulations include paints, medicines, cleaning products, fuels, alloys, and cosmetics.

Formulations are specialized mixtures designed to serve a specific purpose. Each formulation consists of various components, with each ingredient contributing unique characteristics to the final product. For instance, paint is a formulation that typically includes a pigment for color, a binder to secure the pigment once applied, and a solvent to thin the paint for easy application.

Medicines also exemplify formulations. They usually contain an active ingredient that provides the desired therapeutic effect, along with excipients such as binders, fillers, and coatings that facilitate the safe and effective delivery of the active ingredient. For example, tablets may feature a coating that enhances swallowability or a slow-release mechanism that allows for gradual medication delivery over time.

Cleaning products are another category of formulations. They generally contain an active ingredient responsible for cleaning, along with additional components that enhance the product's efficacy. These may include surfactants that help the product spread and adhere to surfaces, or fragrances that impart a pleasant scent.

Fuels, such as petrol and diesel, are also formulations. They consist of various hydrocarbons, each burning in slightly different ways. The specific composition of the fuel can be tailored to optimize performance for particular engine types.

Alloys represent a category of metallic formulations. They are combinations of different metals engineered to exhibit properties superior to those of any individual metal. For example, steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, is known for its strength, surpassing that of pure iron.

Lastly, cosmetics, including products like lipstick and mascara, are complex formulations. They contain a variety of ingredients, such as pigments for color, waxes for structural integrity, and oils for smooth application. Each component plays a crucial role in determining the product's performance, appearance, and tactile qualities.
