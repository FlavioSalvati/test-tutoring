In reversible reactions, energy is conserved and can be transferred back and forth between reactants and products.

In a reversible reaction, reactants combine to form products, which can subsequently decompose to regenerate the original reactants. This bidirectional process is why these reactions are termed 'reversible'. The energy involved in these reactions is conserved; it is neither lost nor gained but instead simply transferred between the reactants and products.

When the reactants combine to produce products, energy is either absorbed or released. This is referred to as the forward reaction. If the reaction absorbs energy, it is classified as endothermic, while if it releases energy, it is classified as exothermic. Importantly, the amount of energy involved in the forward reaction is precisely equal to the amount of energy involved in the reverse reaction, during which the products decompose back into the reactants.

For instance, consider the reversible reaction where nitrogen and hydrogen combine to form ammonia. In the forward reaction, energy is released, making this an exothermic process. Conversely, when ammonia decomposes to reform nitrogen and hydrogen, an equivalent amount of energy is absorbed, designating this as an endothermic process.

The conservation of energy in reversible reactions is a fundamental principle in chemistry, grounded in the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed or transferred. Understanding this principle is essential for comprehending how energy flows in chemical reactions and how it can be harnessed for various practical applications.

In summary, reversible reactions conserve energy, allowing for its transfer between reactants and products. Whether a reaction is endothermic or exothermic depends on its direction, but the total amount of energy involved remains constant.
