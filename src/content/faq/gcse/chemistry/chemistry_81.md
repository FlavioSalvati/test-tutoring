Percentage yield is determined by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and then multiplying the result by $100$.

More specifically, percentage yield serves as a metric for assessing the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It compares the amount of product that is actually produced (the actual yield) to the amount that could have been produced under ideal conditions (the theoretical yield). The formula for calculating percentage yield is expressed as:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100
$$

The actual yield refers to the quantity of product obtained from a reaction, which is typically less than the theoretical yield. This discrepancy often arises due to various losses during the process, or if the reaction does not proceed to completion. In contrast, the theoretical yield represents the maximum possible amount of product that could be formed from the reactants, based on the balanced chemical equation and stoichiometric calculations.

For instance, consider a reaction where the theoretical yield is calculated to be $10$ grams. If the actual amount of product obtained is only $8$ grams, the percentage yield can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100 = 80\%
$$

This indicates that the reaction achieved an efficiency of $80\%$, meaning that $80\%$ of the theoretical maximum product was successfully produced.

It's important to note that the percentage yield cannot exceed $100\%$ because it is impossible to generate more product than the theoretical maximum. If a percentage yield greater than $100\%$ is calculated, it suggests that there may be an error in the calculations or measurements.
