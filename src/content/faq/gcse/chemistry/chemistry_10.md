To write balanced half-equations, it is essential to ensure that both the atoms and charges are balanced on each side of the equation.

Balancing half-equations is a fundamental aspect of understanding redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions in chemistry. A half-equation represents either the oxidation or reduction process, illustrating what occurs to the reactant as it either loses or gains electrons. Below is a step-by-step guide for balancing half-equations:

1. **Write the unbalanced equation:** Begin by writing the unbalanced half-equation, which includes the reactant and the product.

2. **Balance the atoms (excluding O and H):** Start by balancing all atoms other than oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H). Ensure that if an atom appears on both sides of the equation, the number of atoms is equal.

3. **Balance the oxygen atoms:** If there are oxygen atoms present, balance them by adding water molecules ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) to the side that requires additional oxygen.

4. **Balance the hydrogen atoms:** If hydrogen atoms are involved, balance them by adding hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) to the side that needs more hydrogen.

5. **Balance the charge:** Finally, balance the electrical charges on both sides of the equation by adding electrons ($e^-$) to the side that has a higher positive charge.

### Example: Balancing the Half-Equation for the Reduction of Chlorine

Letâ€™s balance the half-equation for the reduction of chlorine gas ($\text{Cl}_2$) to chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$):

1. **Write the unbalanced equation:**  
   $$\text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{Cl}^-$$

2. **Balance the atoms:**  
   The chlorine atoms are already balanced.

3. **Balance the oxygen atoms:**  
   There are no oxygen atoms in this half-equation.

4. **Balance the hydrogen atoms:**  
   There are no hydrogen atoms in this half-equation.

5. **Balance the charge:**  
   The left side of the equation has no charge (neutral), while the right side has a total charge of $-2$. To balance the charges, we add $2$ electrons to the left side of the equation:  
   $$\text{Cl}_2 + 2e^- \rightarrow 2\text{Cl}^-$$

### Conclusion

Remember, practice is key to mastering the art of balancing half-equations. The more you engage with this process, the more proficient you will become.
