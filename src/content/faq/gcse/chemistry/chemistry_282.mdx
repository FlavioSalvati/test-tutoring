The Clean Air Act and the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) are pivotal regulations aimed at controlling atmospheric pollutants.

The Clean Air Act, enacted in the United States in 1970, serves as a federal law designed to regulate air pollution on a national scale. It is recognized as one of the most comprehensive air quality laws globally. The Act mandates the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to formulate and enforce regulations that safeguard the public from exposure to airborne contaminants known to be hazardous to human health. Key pollutants addressed by the Act include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and lead.

Similarly, the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) are U.S. regulations specifically developed to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from various industrial sources, including chemical plants, oil refineries, and steel mills. NESHAPs are established by the EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act, with the objective of minimizing emissions of hazardous air pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health issues.

In the United Kingdom, the Clean Air Act was introduced in 1956 in response to the Great Smog of London in 1952. This legislation implemented several measures to mitigate air pollution, notably by creating 'smoke control areas' in certain towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be used.

The European Union has also established several directives aimed at controlling and reducing air pollution. These include the Air Quality Directive, the Industrial Emissions Directive, and the National Emission Ceilings Directive. These directives set permissible limits on various pollutants in the atmosphere and require member states to take action to lower their emissions if these limits are exceeded.

In conclusion, a variety of regulations exist globally to manage atmospheric pollutants. These regulations are essential for protecting human health and the environment from the detrimental effects of air pollution.
