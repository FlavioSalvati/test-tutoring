The atomic number is defined as the number of protons present in an atom, whereas the mass number represents the total count of both protons and neutrons.

The atomic number, often referred to as the proton number, is a crucial characteristic of an atom. It determines the chemical element to which the atom belongs. For instance, atoms with an atomic number of $1$ are hydrogen, while those with an atomic number of $2$ are helium. The atomic number is always a whole number and is unique to each element. It is represented by the symbol $Z$.

Conversely, the mass number, denoted by the symbol $A$, is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom. Protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons, are located in the nucleus of the atom. The mass number provides an approximation of the atomic mass, which is measured in atomic mass units (amu).

It is essential to understand that while the atomic number is constant for a given element, the mass number can vary. This variation arises because an element can exist in different forms, each having different numbers of neutrons. These variants are known as isotopes. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon. Both isotopes have an atomic number of $6$ (indicating they each contain $6$ protons), but carbon-12 has a mass number of $12$ (which is the sum of $6$ protons and $6$ neutrons), whereas carbon-14 has a mass number of $14$ (comprising $6$ protons and $8$ neutrons).

In conclusion, the atomic number and mass number are fundamental properties of atoms that aid in identifying and characterizing different elements and their isotopes. The atomic number reveals the number of protons, thereby defining the element, while the mass number indicates the total count of protons and neutrons, offering an estimate of the atom's mass.
