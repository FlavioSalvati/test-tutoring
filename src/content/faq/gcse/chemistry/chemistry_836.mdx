A catalyst is a substance that accelerates a chemical reaction without being consumed or altered during the process.

More specifically, a catalyst increases the rate of a chemical reaction by offering an alternative reaction pathway that has a lower activation energy. The activation energy is defined as the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur. By reducing this energy barrier, a catalyst enables the reaction to proceed more rapidly.

Catalysts function by binding to the reactant molecules, positioning them in a manner that facilitates their interaction. This phenomenon is referred to as adsorption. After the reaction occurs, the catalyst releases the product molecules and is then available to catalyze additional reactions. This characteristic is why catalysts remain unchanged throughout the reaction.

It is essential to understand that while catalysts enhance the speed of reactions, they do not alter the products of the reaction or the overall energy change associated with it. Their primary role is to expedite the reaction process. This capability is particularly advantageous in industrial applications, where increasing the reaction rate can lead to significant savings in time and energy, ultimately making the process more efficient and cost-effective.

Catalysts can be categorized into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous catalysts exist in the same phase (solid, liquid, or gas) as the reactants, whereas heterogeneous catalysts are in a different phase. An example of a homogeneous catalyst is sulfuric acid, which is used in the production of esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols. Conversely, an example of a heterogeneous catalyst is iron, which is employed in the Haber process to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.

In summary, catalysts are vital in chemical reactions as they enhance the reaction rate, provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, and remain unchanged during the process.
