Alkenes undergo a reaction with water known as hydration, resulting in the formation of alcohols.

To elaborate, the hydration of alkenes is classified as an addition reaction. In this process, a water molecule ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) is added to the alkene molecule. The reaction is facilitated by a strong acid, typically sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$). During this reaction, the carbon-carbon double bond of the alkene is broken, and the atoms of the water molecule are incorporated across the double bond, ultimately yielding an alcohol.

For instance, when ethene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$) reacts with water, the resulting product is ethanol ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}$). This reaction can be represented by the equation:

$$
\text{C}_2\text{H}_4(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(g) \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}(l).
$$

This hydration reaction is particularly significant in the industrial synthesis of alcohols.

The mechanism behind this reaction involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Initially, the acid donates a proton ($\text{H}^+$) to the alkene, resulting in the formation of a carbocation. Subsequently, the water molecule attacks this carbocation, donating a pair of electrons to establish a new bond. Finally, another water molecule abstracts a proton from the newly formed intermediate, yielding the alcohol product.

It is also crucial to understand that this reaction is regioselective, meaning it preferentially leads to a specific product. In the case of asymmetrical alkenes, the predominant product adheres to Markovnikov's rule. This rule asserts that when a proton and a hydroxyl group ($\text{OH}^-$) are added to an alkene, the proton will bond with the carbon atom that has the most hydrogen atoms already attached, while the hydroxyl group will bond with the other carbon atom. This preference results in the formation of the most stable and, therefore, the most likely product.
