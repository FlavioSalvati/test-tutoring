Potable water is safe for drinking and cooking, whereas pure water is chemically pure, consisting solely of $H_2O$ molecules.

Potable water, commonly referred to as drinking water, is the type of water that is safe to consume or use for food preparation without posing any health risks. It is important to note that potable water is not necessarily pure; instead, it is free from contaminants at levels that could be harmful to our health. This type of water may contain beneficial minerals such as calcium and magnesium, which are not only safe but can also contribute positively to our health. Additionally, potable water can include trace amounts of other substances, like chlorine, which is used to eliminate bacteria and other harmful microbes.

In contrast, pure water—often known as deionized or distilled water—has had all impurities removed, including essential minerals and ions like calcium, magnesium, and sodium. This means that pure water is chemically pure, consisting exclusively of $H_2O$ molecules. Pure water is frequently utilized in laboratory settings, where the presence of impurities could compromise the accuracy of experimental results. However, it is generally not recommended for drinking, as it lacks the minerals necessary for our bodies.

In summary, while both potable water and pure water are considered safe for consumption, they have distinct differences in their composition. Potable water undergoes treatment to eliminate harmful contaminants but retains beneficial minerals, making it suitable for daily use. On the other hand, pure water is devoid of these minerals, rendering it less suitable for regular consumption, though it is ideal for specialized applications, such as laboratory experiments.
