Steel is classified as an alloy because it consists of a mixture of iron and various other elements, with carbon being the primary additive.

As a quintessential example of an alloy, steel is produced by melting together two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. In the case of steel, iron serves as the principal element, combined with a small percentage of carbon. This fusion of iron and carbon imparts strength and hardness to steel, making it an ideal material for a diverse array of applications, ranging from construction to automobile manufacturing.

The steel-making process begins by heating iron ore to elevated temperatures in a blast furnace, which allows for the extraction of pure iron. Following this, the iron is alloyed with carbon, a process known as alloying. The carbon content typically varies between $0.2\%$ and $2.1\%$ by weight. A higher carbon concentration enhances the hardness and strength of the steel; however, it also reduces ductility, making the steel less capable of being drawn into thin wires or flexed without fracturing.

In addition to carbon, other elements can be introduced to the iron-carbon mixture to produce different types of steel, each with unique properties. For instance, the addition of chromium and nickel results in stainless steel, which is resistant to rust and corrosion. Manganese can enhance the durability of the steel, while tungsten may be added to improve its heat resistance.

In conclusion, steel is an alloy due to its composition of iron and additional elements, primarily carbon. The alloying process modifies the properties of iron, resulting in a stronger and harder material suitable for a wide variety of applications.
