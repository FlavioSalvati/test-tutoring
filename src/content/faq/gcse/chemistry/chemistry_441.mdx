To accurately read a burette, it is essential to observe the bottom of the meniscus at eye level and record the volume to two decimal places.

Mastering the accurate reading of a burette is a fundamental skill in chemistry, particularly when performing titrations. A burette is a long, graduated glass tube equipped with a tap at one end, designed for precise measurement of liquids. In the burette, the liquid forms a curve known as the meniscus, and it is at the bottom of this curve that you should take your reading.

First, ensure that the burette is clean and devoid of any liquid droplets. Fill the burette with the solution you intend to measure, ensuring that the tap is closed to prevent any spillage. The initial reading is typically $0.00 \, \text{ml}$; however, if the initial volume differs, be sure to record that value.

When reading the burette, position your eye level so that it aligns with the bottom of the meniscus. This alignment helps to avoid parallax error, which can occur if the measurement is viewed from an angle. If your line of sight is above or below the meniscus, it may result in an inaccurate reading.

The burette is calibrated in increments of $0.1 \, \text{ml}$, so it is important to record the volume to two decimal places. The second decimal place is an estimation, yet it is crucial for maintaining precision. For instance, if the bottom of the meniscus falls between the $24.1 \, \text{ml}$ and $24.2 \, \text{ml}$ marks, you would record the volume as $24.15 \, \text{ml}$.

After dispensing the solution, make sure to record the final volume in the same manner. The volume of solution used can be determined by calculating the difference between the initial and final volumes. Always double-check your readings with a partner or instructor to ensure accuracy.
