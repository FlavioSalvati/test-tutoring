Cyanobacteria, commonly referred to as blue-green algae, are a group of bacteria that played a pivotal role in the production of oxygen on Earth.

These remarkable organisms obtain their energy through the process of photosynthesis. Although they are often called blue-green algae, it is important to note that they are not true algae. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that generates oxygen as a by-product.

Approximately $2.4$ billion years ago, during a significant geological event known as the Great Oxygenation Event, cyanobacteria began to release oxygen in substantial quantities. This event marked a critical turning point in Earth's history. Prior to this, the atmosphere contained very little oxygen. The oxygen produced by cyanobacteria reacted with methane in the atmosphere, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide and water. This transformative process led to a dramatic increase in atmospheric oxygen levels, allowing for the evolution of oxygen-breathing organisms.

Today, cyanobacteria continue to be a vital contributor to Earth's oxygen supply. They inhabit a wide range of environments, from oceans and freshwater bodies to bare rock and soil. They are particularly abundant in marine ecosystems, where they can form large, visible aggregates known as "cyanobacterial blooms." These blooms are significant contributors to global oxygen production.

In addition to cyanobacteria, plants and other photosynthetic organisms also play a role in oxygen production. However, it was cyanobacteria that initially enriched our atmosphere with oxygen, paving the way for the diverse array of life that thrives on Earth today.
