Activation energy is depicted on a reaction profile as the energy difference between the reactants and the peak of the energy curve.

In a reaction profile, the x-axis represents the progress of the reaction, while the y-axis indicates the energy levels. The positions of the reactants and products are shown on the y-axis at their respective energy states. In an exothermic reaction, the reactants are typically at a lower energy level than the products, whereas in an endothermic reaction, the reactants usually occupy a higher energy level than the products.

The activation energy is defined as the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to occur. On the reaction profile, it is illustrated as the energy difference between the reactants and the highest point of the energy curve, known as the transition state or activated complex. This peak represents the point at which the reactants have absorbed sufficient energy to initiate the process of breaking old bonds and forming new ones.

To visualize this concept, consider the analogy of climbing a hill. The height of the hill corresponds to the activation energy. You start at the base (the energy level of the reactants) and must exert effort (energy) to reach the summit (the transition state). Once you successfully navigate over the top, you can easily descend towards the other side (the energy level of the products).

In summary, the activation energy on a reaction profile is represented as the 'hill' that must be 'climbed' for the reaction to proceed. It reflects the energy difference between the reactants and the peak of the energy curve. This visual representation enhances our understanding of the energy changes that occur during a chemical reaction and clarifies why some reactions necessitate an initial input of energy to initiate the process.
