Fuel cells are generally more efficient than combustion engines.

Fuel cells convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy, which inherently makes them more efficient compared to combustion engines. In vehicles equipped with combustion engines, such as traditional cars, the process involves converting chemical energy into mechanical energy. This conversion occurs in several stages, each of which contributes to energy loss, predominantly in the form of heat. In contrast, fuel cells streamline this process by directly converting chemical energy into electrical energy, resulting in significantly less energy loss.

The efficiency of a fuel cell typically ranges from $40\%$ to $60\%$, but it can soar up to $85\%$ if waste heat is captured and utilized effectively. This efficiency is markedly higher than that of a conventional internal combustion engine, which generally operates at an efficiency of around $25\%$ to $30\%$. This means that fuel cells can perform more work with the same quantity of fuel, making them a more efficient option.

In addition to their superior efficiency, fuel cells produce fewer emissions. While combustion engines burn fuel and release carbon dioxide along with other harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, fuel cells primarily generate water and heat as by-products. This makes them a cleaner alternative for energy production.

However, it is crucial to recognize that although fuel cells offer higher efficiency, they also come with increased production and maintenance costs. This is largely due to the use of expensive materials, such as platinum, in their construction, as well as the requirement for pure hydrogen as a fuel source. Despite these challenges, the potential advantages of fuel cells—including their high efficiency and low emissions—make them a promising area of research and development in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.
