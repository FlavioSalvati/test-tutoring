Long-chain hydrocarbons are characterized by their non-polar nature, elevated boiling points, lower volatility, and reduced flammability compared to their short-chain counterparts.

These hydrocarbons consist of carbon atoms connected in a chain that contains eight or more carbon atoms. Their non-polarity indicates that they lack distinct positive or negative ends, which results in poor solubility in polar substances such as water. This property is often described as hydrophobic, meaning they repel water.

A defining feature of long-chain hydrocarbons is their high boiling points. The boiling point is the temperature at which a substance transitions from a liquid to a gas. As the length of the carbon chain increases, so does the boiling point. This phenomenon occurs because longer chains provide more points of contact between molecules, resulting in stronger intermolecular forces. Consequently, more energy—in the form of heat—is required to break these forces, leading to higher boiling points.

In addition, long-chain hydrocarbons exhibit lower volatility than short-chain hydrocarbons. Volatility measures the tendency of a substance to evaporate or convert from a liquid to a gas. Due to their higher boiling points, long-chain hydrocarbons are less prone to evaporation, making them less volatile overall.

Furthermore, long-chain hydrocarbons are less flammable compared to shorter chains. Flammability refers to a substance's ability to ignite and sustain combustion. The reduced volatility of long-chain hydrocarbons means they are less likely to catch fire, enhancing their safety during handling and use in various applications. However, this lower flammability also limits their effectiveness as fuels, as they do not ignite as readily as shorter-chain hydrocarbons.
