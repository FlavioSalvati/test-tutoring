The percentage yield of a chemical reaction is defined as the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage.

To elaborate, percentage yield serves as a measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It compares the amount of product that is actually produced (referred to as the actual yield) to the amount that could theoretically be produced under ideal conditions (known as the theoretical yield). This comparison is typically presented as a percentage, which is why it is termed "percentage yield."

The formula for calculating percentage yield is given by:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

For instance, consider a reaction with a theoretical yield of $10$ grams. If only $8$ grams of product are produced, the percentage yield can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100\% = 80\%
$$

The theoretical yield is determined based on the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. It assumes that the reaction proceeds to completion without any side reactions or losses. However, in practice, many reactions do not reach completion; there may be unintended side reactions, and some product may be lost during purification. As a result, the actual yield is frequently less than the theoretical yield, leading to a percentage yield that is typically below $100\%$.

Understanding percentage yield is essential in both academic and industrial settings in chemistry. In educational contexts, it helps students grasp the efficiency of chemical reactions and the various factors that can influence this efficiency. In industrial applications, achieving a high percentage yield is critical for cost-effectiveness and sustainability; reactions with low percentage yields can waste valuable resources and generate unwanted by-products. Consequently, chemists often strive to maximize the percentage yield in their reactions.
