The practical investigation of temperature changes involves performing either an exothermic or an endothermic reaction while measuring the resultant temperature variation.

In this experiment, you will explore how temperature fluctuates during a chemical reaction, focusing specifically on exothermic and endothermic processes. An **exothermic reaction** is characterized by the release of heat into the surroundings, leading to an increase in temperature. Conversely, an **endothermic reaction** absorbs heat from the surroundings, resulting in a decrease in temperature.

To conduct this investigation, you will require the following materials: a thermometer, a polystyrene cup (which will serve as a calorimeter), a measuring cylinder, and the necessary chemicals for the reaction. The chemicals can be a combination of an acid and a base, or a metal and an acid, depending on the specific reaction you choose to investigate.

Begin by measuring a fixed volume of the first reactant using the measuring cylinder and pour it into the polystyrene cup. Next, use the thermometer to measure the initial temperature of the solution. After recording this temperature, add the second reactant to the mixture and stir it quickly while monitoring the temperature at regular intervals. Be sure to note the highest temperature reached for an exothermic reaction or the lowest temperature for an endothermic reaction.

You can calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction using the formula: 

$$
\Delta H = mc\Delta T
$$

where:
- $m$ is the mass of the reactants,
- $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and
- $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

Always remember to handle chemicals responsibly and wear appropriate safety gear, such as gloves and goggles, throughout the experiment. This practical experience will enhance your understanding of the energy changes that occur during chemical reactions, a fundamental concept in GCSE Chemistry.
