The general formula for alcohols is given by:

$$
C_nH_{2n+1}OH.
$$

Alcohols are a class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of one or more hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to a carbon atom. The formula $C_nH_{2n+1}OH$ encapsulates this structural feature, where $n$ denotes the number of carbon atoms in the alcohol molecule. In this formula, 'H' represents hydrogen atoms, while 'OH' signifies the hydroxyl group.

For instance, when $n$ equals $1$, the formula becomes:

$$
C_1H_{2(1)+1}OH,
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
CH_3OH.
$$

This compound is methanol, the simplest alcohol, composed of one carbon atom, three hydrogen atoms, and one hydroxyl group. Similarly, if $n$ is $2$, the formula transforms to:

$$
C_2H_{2(2)+1}OH,
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
C_2H_5OH.
$$

This represents ethanol, containing two carbon atoms, five hydrogen atoms, and one hydroxyl group.

The general formula $C_nH_{2n+1}OH$ serves as a valuable tool for understanding the structural characteristics of alcohols and for predicting the properties of various alcohols. Notably, as the number of carbon atoms ($n$) increases, the solubility of the alcohol in water tends to decrease, while its boiling point typically rises. This trend occurs because an increase in molecular size and mass results in stronger intermolecular forces, requiring more energy to overcome them.

It is important to note that $n$ in the formula can be any whole number starting from $1$. Consequently, there exists a wide variety of alcohols, each exhibiting unique properties. Nonetheless, they all share the defining characteristic of having at least one hydroxyl group attached to a carbon atom, as illustrated by the general formula.
