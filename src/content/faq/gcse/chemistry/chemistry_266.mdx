Deforestation significantly contributes to rising greenhouse gas levels by decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by trees and releasing previously stored carbon into the atmosphere.

Trees are vital components of the carbon cycle, a natural process that maintains the balance of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in the environment. During photosynthesis, trees absorb CO$_2$ and, utilizing sunlight, convert it into oxygen and glucose. This process is essential for lowering the concentration of CO$_2$, a key greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere. However, when trees are cut down, their ability to absorb CO$_2$ is interrupted, leading to increased atmospheric CO$_2$ levels.

Furthermore, the act of felling or burning trees releases the carbon that has been stored within them back into the atmosphere as CO$_2$. This release is particularly concerning in peat forest ecosystems, where the soil contains substantial amounts of stored carbon. Clearing these forests results in the emission of vast quantities of CO$_2$ from both the trees and the carbon-rich peat soil, further exacerbating greenhouse gas concentrations.

Deforestation also affects the albedo effect, which measures how much sunlight a surface reflects back into space without being absorbed. Forests, characterized by their dark surfaces, have a low albedo and effectively absorb significant amounts of sunlight, which facilitates photosynthesis. When these forests are replaced by lighter surfaces, such as agricultural fields or bare soil, the albedo increases, causing more sunlight to be reflected back into the atmosphere instead of being absorbed. This alteration can contribute to global warming, which in turn may lead to further increases in greenhouse gas levels.

In summary, deforestation has a profound impact on greenhouse gas levels. It diminishes the capacity of trees to absorb and store CO$_2$, releases stored carbon into the atmosphere, and can exacerbate global warming.
