The overall reaction in a hydrogen fuel cell involves the combination of hydrogen and oxygen to produce water and energy.

In a hydrogen fuel cell, the fuels used are hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) and oxygen gas ($\text{O}_2$). This process is classified as a redox reaction, which entails the transfer of electrons between substances. The operation of a hydrogen fuel cell is akin to that of a battery; however, unlike a battery, it does not deplete or require recharging. As long as hydrogen fuel is supplied, the fuel cell continues to produce electricity and heat.

The reaction occurs in two distinct stages. In the first stage, hydrogen molecules enter the fuel cell at the anode and are dissociated into electrons and protons. This splitting process is facilitated by a catalyst, typically platinum. The corresponding equation for this reaction is:

$$ 
2\text{H}_2 \rightarrow 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- 
$$

In the second stage, at the cathode, oxygen molecules react with the protons and electrons that have traveled through the external circuit to form water. The equation for this reaction is:

$$ 
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} 
$$

By combining these two half-reactions, we arrive at the overall reaction for a hydrogen fuel cell:

$$ 
2\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} 
$$

This reaction releases energy, which can be harnessed to perform work, such as powering vehicles or generating electricity.

One of the significant advantages of hydrogen fuel cells is their ability to generate electricity with minimal pollution; the only by-product is water. However, a major challenge lies in producing hydrogen in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. Presently, most hydrogen is derived from natural gas through a process that emits carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Researchers are exploring more sustainable hydrogen production methods, such as utilizing solar energy to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen.
