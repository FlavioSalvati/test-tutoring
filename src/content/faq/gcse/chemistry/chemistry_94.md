To prepare a solution with a specific concentration, you need to dissolve a precise amount of solute in a defined volume of solvent.

First, it's essential to grasp the concept of molarity, which is a measure of the concentration of a solution. Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The formula for calculating molarity is given by:

$$
M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}
$$

To prepare a solution of a desired concentration, you must calculate the amount of solute required using the molarity formula. For instance, if you aim to prepare $1$ liter of a $1M$ solution of sodium chloride (NaCl), you will need $1$ mole of NaCl. Given that the molar mass of NaCl is approximately $58.44 \, \text{g/mol}$, you would need to weigh out $58.44 \, \text{g}$ of NaCl.

Once you have measured the correct amount of solute, the next step is to add it to the solvent. While the solvent is typically water, it can be any liquid in which the solute is soluble. It is advisable to use a volumetric flask for this purpose, as it allows for precise measurement of the solution's volume. After adding the solute, fill the flask with the solvent up to the designated volume mark.

A crucial point to remember is to add the solute before the solvent. If you add the solvent first, you might inadvertently create a solution that is more dilute than intended.

Finally, ensure that you mix the solution thoroughly to confirm that the solute is completely dissolved. This can be achieved by either shaking or stirring the mixture. Once the solute is fully dissolved, you will have a solution with the desired concentration.

Always prioritize safety when handling chemicals. Be sure to wear appropriate protective equipment and work in a well-ventilated area.
