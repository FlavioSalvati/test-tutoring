Examples of condensation polymers include polyesters, polyamides, and polycarbonates.

**Polyesters** are a type of condensation polymer widely used in clothing, packaging, and plastic bottles. They are synthesized through a condensation reaction between a dicarboxylic acid and a diol. This reaction results in the formation of an ester linkage while simultaneously releasing a water molecule. The most prevalent polyester is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is commonly employed in the production of plastic bottles and fiber for clothing.

**Polyamides** represent another category of condensation polymers. These are produced via a condensation reaction between a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine, leading to the formation of an amide linkage and the release of a water molecule. Polyamides are notably used in the manufacturing of nylon, a material found in clothing, carpets, and ropes.

**Polycarbonates** are also condensation polymers, frequently utilized in the production of safety glasses, CDs, and DVDs. They are formed through a condensation reaction between a diol and phosgene, which results in the formation of a carbonate linkage and the release of a hydrochloric acid molecule. Polycarbonates are renowned for their high impact resistance and optical clarity, making them ideal for applications such as safety glasses and optical discs.

In all these examples, the condensation reaction leads to the creation of a new polymer chain and a specific type of linkage—either ester, amide, or carbonate—while releasing a small molecule, such as water or hydrochloric acid. This characteristic distinguishes condensation polymers from addition polymers, which do not release small molecules during the polymerization process.
