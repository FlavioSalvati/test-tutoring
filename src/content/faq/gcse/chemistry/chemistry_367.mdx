Small molecular compounds are characterized by their low melting and boiling points, and they are typically found in gaseous or liquid states. Notably, these compounds do not conduct electricity.

These compounds consist of a limited number of atoms bonded together, predominantly non-metals. They can be classified into simple molecules, such as oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) and nitrogen ($\text{N}_2$), or more complex molecules like water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) and carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$). Due to their small size, small molecular compounds exhibit relatively weak intermolecular forcesâ€”the attractions between different molecules. This results in low melting and boiling points, as only a small amount of energy is required to overcome these forces and induce a change in the state of the compound.

Another significant property of small molecular compounds is their tendency to exist as gases or liquids at room temperature, which again stems from their weak intermolecular forces. For example, both oxygen and nitrogen, which constitute a large portion of Earth's atmosphere, are gases at room temperature. Water, while a small molecular compound, is a liquid at room temperature; however, it can easily transition to a gas (steam) or a solid (ice) with relatively minor fluctuations in temperature.

Furthermore, small molecular compounds do not conduct electricity. This lack of conductivity arises from the absence of free electrons or ions that can move and carry an electric charge. In the solid state, the electrons are tightly bound within the molecules, preventing free movement. In liquid or gaseous states, the molecules are spaced too far apart for electrons to transfer from one molecule to another, thus inhibiting the flow of electricity.

In summary, small molecular compounds possess distinct properties due to their size and the nature of their intermolecular forces. These characteristics differentiate them from other classes of compounds, such as ionic or metallic compounds.
