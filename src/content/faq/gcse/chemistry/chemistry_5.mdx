Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, introduced a revolutionary atomic model in 1913 to address the limitations of the existing atomic theory proposed by J.J. Thomson. Thomson's 'plum pudding' model depicted atoms as a diffuse cloud of positive charge with electrons scattered throughout, resembling plums in a pudding. However, this model failed to explain the stability of atoms and the specific patterns of light emitted and absorbed by them.

In contrast, Bohr's model, commonly known as the Bohr model, conceptualized electrons as moving in fixed orbits around the nucleus, much like planets orbiting the sun. This marked a significant shift from the 'plum pudding' model. Bohr proposed that electrons could only inhabit specific energy levels, and they could transition between these levels by absorbing or emitting energy. This energy release or absorption is manifested as light, and it is the distinct energy levels of the electrons that account for the unique emission and absorption spectra of each element.

Bohr's model was particularly effective in describing the behavior of the hydrogen atom, which is the simplest atom with just one electron. It successfully predicted the wavelengths of light emitted by hydrogen, a feat that the 'plum pudding' model could not achieve. This marked a pivotal advancement in atomic theory and laid the groundwork for the development of quantum mechanics.

However, it is essential to recognize that while Bohr's model represented a significant improvement, it had its limitations. Although it effectively described hydrogen, it was less successful in accounting for the properties of larger atoms. Nonetheless, Bohr's model was a vital step in the evolution of modern atomic theory, ultimately paving the way for the quantum mechanical model that we rely on today.
