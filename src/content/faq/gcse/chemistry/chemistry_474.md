Exothermic reactions are chemical processes that transfer energy to the surrounding environment, primarily as heat, resulting in an increase in temperature.

To elaborate, an exothermic reaction is characterized by the release of energy from the reactants to the surroundings. This energy is typically emitted in the form of heat, although it can also manifest as light or sound. The term "exothermic" is derived from the Greek words "exo," meaning "out," and "thermic," meaning "heat," which together signify a "heat-out" reaction.

The energy transfer in exothermic reactions is readily observable. For instance, when wood is burned in a fireplace, the wood (acting as the fuel) reacts with oxygen from the air (the oxidizer), leading to the production of heat and light. This process is a classic example of an exothermic reaction, where the energy generated warms the surrounding area.

Another familiar example is the reaction between vinegar and baking soda. When these two substances are combined, they chemically react to produce carbon dioxide, water, and sodium acetate. This reaction is also exothermic, and the heat released can be felt if you touch the container during the reaction.

From an energy perspective, exothermic reactions are represented in energy diagrams as having a lower energy level for the products compared to the reactants. The difference in energy levels corresponds to the energy released during the reaction. This energy transfer typically occurs by increasing the kinetic energy of the surrounding molecules (such as those in air or water), causing them to move more rapidly and thereby raising the temperature.

In summary, exothermic reactions are defined by their ability to release energy to the surroundings, primarily in the form of heat, which results in a noticeable increase in temperature.
