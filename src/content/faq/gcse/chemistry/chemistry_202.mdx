The general formula for alkenes is given by \( C_nH_{2n} \).

Alkenes are a specific class of hydrocarbons, which are compounds composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. In this formula, the variable \( n \) represents the number of carbon atoms present in the molecule. For alkenes, the number of hydrogen atoms is always twice the number of carbon atoms, which is why we express this relationship as \( C_nH_{2n} \).

This formula arises from the fact that alkenes are classified as unsaturated hydrocarbons. This classification indicates that they contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, reducing the total number of hydrogen atoms that can bond with the carbon atoms. For instance, ethene, the simplest alkene, consists of two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms, conforming to the formula \( C_nH_{2n} \).

The presence of the double bond imparts distinctive chemical properties to alkenes, such as their capacity to engage in addition reactions. The double bond is relatively reactive, enabling other atoms or groups of atoms to attach across it.

In summary, the general formula \( C_nH_{2n} \) provides a straightforward representation of the relationship between the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in any alkene molecule. It highlights the unsaturated nature of alkenes, characterized by the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond.
