Polyethylene, also referred to as polythene, is one of the most extensively used polymers globally. It is synthesized through a process known as addition polymerization, which involves the combination of numerous small molecules, called monomers, to create a large chain-like molecule known as a polymer. In the case of polyethylene, the monomer utilized is ethene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$), a simple hydrocarbon.

Addition polymerization is classified as a type of chain-growth polymerization. The process commences with an initiator, which is a compound capable of readily forming a free radical. This free radical reacts with the double bond present in an ethene molecule, resulting in the breakage of the bond and the attachment of the ethene molecule to the initiator. This reaction continues, with each subsequent ethene molecule linking to the end of the growing polymer chain until the desired polymer length is achieved.

Polyethylene is a highly versatile material with a vast array of applications. It is commonly used in the production of plastic bags, bottles, toys, and even bulletproof vests. Its desirable properties, such as flexibility, durability, and resistance to moisture, make it an ideal choice for these applications. Furthermore, the characteristics of polyethylene can be modified by altering the conditions of the polymerization process—such as temperature and pressure—or by incorporating additional substances into the polymer.

In conclusion, polyethylene serves as a prime example of a polymer created through addition polymerization. Formed from the monomer ethene, its properties can be tailored to accommodate a diverse range of applications.
