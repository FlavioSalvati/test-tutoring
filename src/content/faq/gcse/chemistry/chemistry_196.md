Steam cracking, also referred to as pyrolysis, is a crucial process in the petrochemical industry used to decompose hydrocarbons into smaller, more valuable molecules.

This process involves the application of high-temperature steam, typically at temperatures around $850^\circ C$ or higher, to break down various hydrocarbons, including ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha. The primary products of steam cracking are ethylene and propylene, which serve as fundamental building blocks for a wide array of plastics and chemicals.

The steam cracking process begins by heating the hydrocarbon feedstock in a furnace alongside high-temperature steam. The extreme heat initiates a reaction known as thermal cracking, in which hydrocarbon molecules are broken apart. To halt these reactions, the resulting mixture is rapidly cooled through a process called quenching.

Following quenching, the mixture undergoes compression and distillation to isolate its various components. Ethylene and propylene are extracted and further processed into a diverse range of products, including plastics, solvents, and detergents. Additionally, by-products such as hydrogen and methane are often captured; these can be utilized as fuel in the cracking process itself or sold for other industrial applications.

Steam cracking plays an essential role in the petrochemical sector, providing the foundational materials required for countless everyday products. However, it is also an energy-intensive process that significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, ongoing research efforts are focused on developing more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for cracking hydrocarbons.
