The objective of a life cycle assessment (LCA) is to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product throughout its entire life cycle.

An LCA is a systematic method used to measure the environmental effects associated with a product from its creation to its eventual disposal. This assessment encompasses all phases of a product's life, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, usage, and disposal or recycling. The primary aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the environmental aspects of the product, which can help identify opportunities for enhancing its environmental performance.

The LCA process is structured into four main stages:

1. **Goal and Scope Definition**: This initial stage establishes the boundaries of the assessment and specifies the product under evaluation.
   
2. **Inventory Analysis**: During this stage, data is collected regarding the inputs and outputs of the product system.
   
3. **Impact Assessment**: This phase assesses the potential environmental impacts based on the data gathered in the previous stage.
   
4. **Interpretation**: The final stage analyzes the results and offers recommendations for improvement.

The overarching goal of an LCA is not only to identify the environmental impacts of a product but also to facilitate the reduction of these impacts. By understanding the environmental footprint of a product, companies can make informed decisions regarding product design, material selection, manufacturing processes, and end-of-life management. This approach can lead to significant environmental benefits, including reduced energy consumption, minimized waste, and lower emissions.

In summary, the goal of a life cycle assessment is to deliver a holistic view of the environmental impacts of a product, from its inception to its disposal. This information can be leveraged to implement improvements and reduce the product's overall environmental footprint.
