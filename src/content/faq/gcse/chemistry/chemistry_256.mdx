Photosynthesis is a fundamental process that enhances the level of atmospheric oxygen by transforming carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.

This process is primarily conducted by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria, all of which contain a pigment known as chlorophyll. Chlorophyll enables these organisms to absorb sunlight, harnessing its energy to synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water. This phenomenon, termed photosynthesis, plays a crucial role in elevating the levels of atmospheric oxygen.

The chemical equation representing photosynthesis is given by:

$$
6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{light energy} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6 \text{O}_2.
$$

This equation indicates that for every six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water utilized, one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen are produced. The glucose serves as an energy source for the plant, facilitating growth and metabolism, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere.

Before the evolution of photosynthetic organisms, the Earth's atmosphere contained very little oxygen. As these organisms began to thrive, they significantly converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, resulting in a dramatic increase in atmospheric oxygen levels. This shift led to the formation of an oxygen-rich atmosphere, which subsequently allowed for the evolution of aerobic organisms that utilize oxygen for energy production.

Moreover, photosynthesis is vital for maintaining the balance of atmospheric oxygen. It counteracts the process of respiration, which all living organisms perform. Respiration consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Without photosynthesis, atmospheric oxygen levels would gradually decline, while carbon dioxide levels would rise. Therefore, photosynthesis not only contributed to the emergence of our oxygen-rich atmosphere but also continues to sustain its balance.

In summary, photosynthesis has a profound impact on the levels of atmospheric oxygen. It not only increased the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere but also plays a critical role in maintaining its equilibrium.
