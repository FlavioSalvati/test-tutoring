Endothermic and exothermic reactions represent two distinct types of chemical processes characterized by their energy interactions with the surrounding environment.

**Endothermic Reactions**

In endothermic reactions, energy is absorbed from the surroundings. This energy is typically in the form of heat, but it can also manifest as light or electrical energy. The absorbed energy is utilized to break the chemical bonds in the reactants, enabling the rearrangement of atoms to form new products. Consequently, this energy absorption often leads to a decrease in the temperature of the surroundings. Common examples of endothermic reactions include photosynthesis and the melting of ice.

**Exothermic Reactions**

Conversely, exothermic reactions release energy into the surroundings, predominantly as heat. In these reactions, the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is less than the energy released when new bonds are formed in the products. This surplus energy is emitted, frequently resulting in an increase in the surrounding temperature. Typical examples of exothermic reactions include combustion processes, such as fires and explosions, as well as everyday reactions like the rusting of iron and the respiration processes in humans and animals.

**Energy Diagrams**

When illustrated through energy diagrams, endothermic reactions display a higher energy level for the products compared to the reactants, indicating that energy has been absorbed during the reaction. In contrast, exothermic reactions show a lower energy level for the products than for the reactants, signifying that energy has been released.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the primary distinction between endothermic and exothermic reactions lies in the direction of energy transfer. Endothermic reactions absorb energy from their surroundings, while exothermic reactions release energy into their surroundings.
