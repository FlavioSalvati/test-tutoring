The actual yield of a chemical reaction may fall short of the theoretical yield due to several factors, including incomplete reactions, side reactions, and product loss during recovery.

In the context of a chemical reaction, the theoretical yield is defined as the maximum quantity of product that can be generated from a specified amount of reactants, assuming perfect conditions. However, in practice, the actual yield is frequently lower than the theoretical yield. This difference can be attributed to several reasons.

Firstly, reactions may not proceed to completion. This means that not all reactants are converted into the desired product. The reaction might reach equilibrium before all reactants have reacted, or some reactants may be consumed in side reactions.

Secondly, side reactions can take place. These are unintended reactions that compete with the primary reaction for the available reactants. The occurrence of side reactions often results in the formation of unwanted products, which in turn reduces the quantity of reactants available for the main reaction, thereby diminishing the actual yield.

Lastly, there can be a loss of product during the recovery phase. After the reaction, it is typically necessary to isolate the desired product from the reaction mixture. This separation process can be intricate and may lead to some loss of product, such as through evaporation or residue adhering to the walls of the container.

Additionally, other factors—such as measurement errors, the presence of impure reactants, or inaccuracies in stoichiometric calculations—can also contribute to a lower actual yield. Thus, while the theoretical yield represents an ideal scenario based on stoichiometric calculations, the actual yield provides a more realistic assessment of what can be achieved in a laboratory setting.
