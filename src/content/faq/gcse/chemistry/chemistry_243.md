To set up a chromatography experiment, you will need four key components: a stationary phase, a mobile phase, a sample, and chromatography apparatus.

Firstly, it is essential to understand the two primary components of chromatography: the stationary phase and the mobile phase. The stationary phase can be either a solid or a liquid that is supported on a solid substrate. In contrast, the mobile phase consists of a liquid or a gas that moves over or through the stationary phase. Typically, the stationary phase can be chromatography paper or a thin layer of a substance applied to a glass plate. The mobile phase is generally a suitable solvent or a mixture of solvents.

Next, you need to prepare your sample. This sample could consist of a mixture of colored substances, such as food coloring or ink, or it may involve other types of mixtures. The sample is usually dissolved in a suitable solvent to create a solution, which is then applied to the stationary phase. This application is often performed using a capillary tube to deposit a small spot of the solution onto the stationary phase.

Once the sample is applied, the stationary phase is placed in a sealed container along with a small amount of the mobile phase. The mobile phase is absorbed into the stationary phase and begins to ascend. As it moves, it carries the sample components with it. Different components of the sample travel at varying rates, influenced by their solubility in the mobile phase and their affinity for the stationary phase. This differential movement results in the separation of the sample's components.

The chromatography apparatus is typically a straightforward setup. For example, in paper chromatography, you may require a beaker with a lid, a piece of chromatography paper, a pencil for marking the starting line and the positions of the spots, and an appropriate solvent. The chromatography paper is suspended in the beaker such that the bottom edge is immersed in the solvent while the sample spots remain above the solvent level. The beaker is then sealed and left undisturbed for a specified period to allow the chromatography process to occur.

Finally, it is crucial to prioritize safety when conducting any experiment. Always wear protective gear, including gloves and goggles, and ensure that you work in a well-ventilated area.
