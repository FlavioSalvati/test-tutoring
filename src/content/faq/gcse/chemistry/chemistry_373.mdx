Metals are excellent conductors of heat and electricity primarily due to the mobility of their delocalised electrons.

The unique structure of metals contributes to their conductive properties. They consist of a lattice framework of positive ions, surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. These electrons are not bound to any specific atom, allowing them to move freely throughout the metal. This phenomenon is often described by the 'sea of electrons' model.

When heat is applied to one end of a metal, the process of heat conduction can be likened to a game of dominoes. The atoms at the heated end begin to vibrate more vigorously. These vibrations are then transmitted to adjacent atoms, which continue to pass the energy along to their neighbours. This sequential transfer of energy is how heat flows from one end of the metal to the other.

In terms of electrical conduction, the free electrons play a crucial role. When a voltage is applied to the metal, these free electrons begin to move in response to the electric field. They drift from the negatively charged end towards the positively charged end, thereby generating an electric current. The greater the number of free electrons present in a metal, the more effective it is at conducting electricity. This is why metals such as copper and silver, which possess a high density of free electrons, are commonly used in electrical wiring.

In conclusion, the capacity of metals to conduct heat and electricity can be attributed to their structural characteristics, particularly the presence of delocalised electrons. These mobile electrons facilitate the rapid and efficient transfer of energy through the metal, whether in the form of thermal energy or electric current.
