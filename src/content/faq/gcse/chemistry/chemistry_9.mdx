Electrons are organized into energy levels, also known as shells, surrounding the nucleus of an atom. Each of these levels has a defined capacity for holding electrons.

To elaborate, the electron arrangement within an atom adheres to a specific pattern referred to as the 'electron configuration'. This configuration is determined by energy levels, which can also be called shells or orbits. These levels categorize the regions around an atom where electrons are most likely to be located. Each energy level has a maximum number of electrons it can accommodate. Specifically, the first energy level, which is closest to the nucleus, can hold up to $2$ electrons. The second energy level can contain up to $8$ electrons, while the third energy level can also hold up to $8$ electrons.

Electrons fill these energy levels in a particular sequence, beginning with the lowest energy level (the one nearest to the nucleus) and progressing to higher energy levels as additional electrons are added. This process is governed by the 'Aufbau Principle'. For example, in an atom with $6$ electrons, $2$ would occupy the first energy level, and the remaining $4$ would be in the second energy level.

Understanding the arrangement of electrons in energy levels is essential for comprehending how atoms interact to form chemical bonds. Atoms strive for stability, which is often achieved when their outermost energy level is filled. This tendency drives atoms to gain, lose, or share electrons in order to complete their outer shell, forming the basis of chemical reactions.

In conclusion, the arrangement of electrons in energy levels is a fundamental concept in chemistry. It provides a framework for understanding atomic behavior and the formation of chemical bonds.
