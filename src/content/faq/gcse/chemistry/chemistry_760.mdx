In a titration experiment, you systematically add a solution of known concentration, called the titrant, to a solution of unknown concentration, referred to as the analyte, until the chemical reaction between the two is complete.

To begin a titration, it is crucial to prepare your workspace meticulously. This preparation includes thoroughly cleaning all your equipment, such as the burette, pipette, and conical flask, to ensure accurate results. Next, fill the burette with the titrant solution. The analyte is measured using a pipette and transferred to the conical flask. To facilitate the observation of the endpoint, add a few drops of an appropriate indicator, such as phenolphthalein or methyl orange, to the analyte.

The titration process starts by slowly dispensing the titrant from the burette into the conical flask containing the analyte. As you add the titrant, it is essential to swirl the conical flask gently to mix the solutions thoroughly. The indicator will change color once the reaction reaches completion, signaling the endpoint of the titration.

It is important to record both the initial and final readings on the burette to determine the volume of titrant used. Repeat the titration multiple times until you achieve consistent results, typically within $0.1 \, \text{cm}^3$ of each other. This repetition ensures the accuracy of your measurements.

Once you have determined the volume of titrant required to neutralize the analyte, you can calculate the concentration of the unknown solution using the formula:

$$
M_1 V_1 = M_2 V_2
$$

In this equation, $M_1$ and $V_1$ represent the molarity and volume of the titrant, while $M_2$ and $V_2$ denote the molarity and volume of the analyte.

Lastly, safety is of utmost importance during the titration process. Always wear safety goggles and a lab coat to protect yourself from any potential spills or splashes.
