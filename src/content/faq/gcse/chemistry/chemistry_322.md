Fertilisers play a crucial role in enhancing soil health by replenishing essential nutrient levels, but their excessive application can lead to detrimental effects on the soil.

Fertilisers are substances added to soil to improve its fertility and promote robust plant growth. They are typically high in key nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are vital for plant development. When applied correctly, fertilisers can greatly enhance soil vitality by replenishing nutrients that may have been depleted over time due to ongoing plant growth and harvesting. This results in healthier and more productive crops.

However, the overuse of fertilisers can negatively impact soil health. Excessive fertilisation can lead to soil degradation, a process in which the quality of the soil deteriorates. This occurs when the elevated nutrient levels from the fertilisers disrupt the natural nutrient balance within the soil. Such imbalances can compromise soil structure, reducing its ability to retain water and support healthy plant growth.

Additionally, the over-application of fertilisers can result in nutrient runoff. This phenomenon occurs when rainfall or irrigation washes excess nutrients away from the soil and into nearby water bodies, leading to water pollution and negatively affecting aquatic ecosystems. This process is known as eutrophication.

Furthermore, the excessive use of fertilisers can contribute to soil acidification. Soil acidification happens when fertilisers break down and increase the soil's acidity. Acidic soils can be detrimental to various plant species and can also lead to the leaching of essential nutrients.

In summary, while fertilisers can significantly benefit soil health by replenishing nutrient levels, their overuse can result in soil degradation, nutrient runoff, and soil acidification. Therefore, it is crucial to apply fertilisers judiciously in order to maintain the health and sustainability of soil ecosystems.
