In electrolysis of aqueous solutions, the cathode serves as the electrode where the process of reduction occurs.

During electrolysis, an electric current is passed through an aqueous solution or a molten salt, causing it to decompose into its elemental components. This process involves two electrodes: the anode and the cathode. The cathode is specifically the electrode at which reduction takes placeâ€”a chemical reaction characterized by a substance gaining electrons.

Conventionally, the cathode is denoted with a minus (-) sign and is connected to the negative terminal of the power supply. As electrolysis proceeds, positive ions in the solution are drawn toward the cathode. At this electrode, these ions gain electrons and undergo reduction. For example, when electrolyzing a copper sulfate solution, the copper ions, denoted as $Cu^{2+}$, migrate toward the cathode. Here, they gain two electrons, transforming into neutral copper atoms, which are subsequently deposited on the cathode's surface.

It's crucial to note that the identity of the cathode can vary based on the specific electrolysis setup. In the case of a rechargeable battery during charging, the cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs. Conversely, when the battery is discharging, the cathode becomes the electrode where oxidation takes place.

In summary, the cathode in the electrolysis of aqueous solutions is the electrode where reduction occurs. It is the site where positive ions gain electrons and convert into neutral atoms. The specific reactions occurring at the cathode depend on the nature of the solution being electrolyzed and the configuration of the electrolysis apparatus.
