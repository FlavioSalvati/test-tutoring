Molarity is a key measure of the concentration of a solute within a solution, expressed in terms of moles per litre.

In chemistry, molarity, commonly represented by the symbol $M$, quantifies the concentration of a solute (the substance being dissolved) in a solution. Specifically, molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute divided by the volume of the solution in litres. This concept is crucial for understanding chemical reactions that occur in solution, as it helps to determine the amounts of reactants and products involved.

To calculate the molarity of a solution, you need two pieces of information: the amount of solute in moles and the volume of the solution in litres. The formula for calculating molarity is given by:

$$
M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{litres of solution}}
$$

For instance, if you dissolve $1$ mole of sodium chloride in $1$ litre of water, the molarity of the resulting solution is $1 \, M$. Similarly, if you have $0.5$ moles of sodium chloride in $1$ litre of water, the molarity would be $0.5 \, M$.

Molarity is particularly useful in laboratory settings because it establishes a direct relationship between the quantity of solute and the volume of solution. For example, if a chemical reaction requires a specific molarity of a reactant, you can easily prepare the solution by dissolving the correct amount of solute in a known volume of solvent.

It is important to distinguish molarity from molality, which measures the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. While both molarity and molality serve as measures of concentration, they are used in different contexts and are not interchangeable. Molarity is typically applied in the context of reactions occurring in solution, whereas molality is more commonly used in physical chemistry and thermodynamics.
