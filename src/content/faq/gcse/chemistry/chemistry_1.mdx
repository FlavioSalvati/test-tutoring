An element is defined as a pure substance that consists of only one type of atom, whereas a compound is made up of two or more different types of atoms.

An element represents the simplest form of matter that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances by ordinary chemical processes. Each element is comprised of atoms that are identical in type, characterized by having the same number of protons in their nuclei. This number, referred to as the atomic number, uniquely identifies the element. For instance, all atoms with one proton are classified as hydrogen, while those with two protons are identified as helium, and so forth. Elements can also exist in various forms known as allotropes; for example, carbon manifests as graphite, diamond, or fullerene. Despite these differing forms, they are all still classified as carbon because they consist solely of carbon atoms.

Conversely, a compound is a substance formed from two or more different elements that are chemically bonded together. The atoms within a compound are interconnected by chemical bonds, which can either be ionic (resulting from the transfer of electrons) or covalent (formed through the sharing of electrons). The properties of a compound are often distinct from those of the individual elements that comprise it. For instance, sodium is a highly reactive metal, and chlorine is a toxic gas. However, when these two elements react to form sodium chloride, the result is common table salt, which is safe for consumption.

In summary, the primary distinction between an element and a compound lies in their composition: an element is a pure substance made up of one type of atom, while a compound consists of two or more different atoms that are chemically combined. Understanding this fundamental difference is essential for the study of chemistry.
