To prepare a soluble salt in the required practical, you will perform an acid-base reaction followed by the crystallization of the salt.

### Detailed Procedure

1. **Choose Your Reactants**: Start by selecting an appropriate acid and base that will react to produce the desired salt. For instance, if you aim to synthesize copper sulfate, you can react sulfuric acid with copper oxide. The general chemical equation for this type of reaction can be represented as:
   $$
   \text{acid} + \text{base} \rightarrow \text{salt} + \text{water}
   $$

2. **Heating the Acid**: Begin by gently heating the acid in a beaker. 

3. **Adding the Base**: Gradually add the base to the heated acid, doing so a little at a time while stirring continuously. It is crucial to avoid adding too much base at once, as this could cause the mixture to overflow. Continue adding the base until no further dissolving occurs, indicating that the acid has been neutralized.

4. **Filtering the Mixture**: After neutralization, filter the mixture to eliminate any excess base. This step will leave you with a solution containing the dissolved salt in water.

5. **Crystallizing the Salt**: To crystallize the salt, gently heat the solution to evaporate some of the water. Afterward, allow the solution to cool. As it cools, salt crystals will begin to form.

6. **Collecting the Crystals**: Once the crystals have formed, filter them out of the solution. Rinse the crystals with a small amount of cold water to remove any residual impurities, then allow them to dry.

### Safety Precautions

Always wear safety goggles and gloves when handling acids and bases, and ensure that you work in a well-ventilated area. Additionally, be mindful that the crystallization process may take some time; it should not be rushed.

### Summary

In summary, the preparation of a soluble salt involves the reaction of an acid with a base, followed by the filtration of any unreacted base and the crystallization of the salt from the resulting solution. While the process is straightforward, it requires careful attention and patience.
