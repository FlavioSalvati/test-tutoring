Dynamic equilibrium refers to a specific state in a chemical reaction where the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction.

To elaborate, dynamic equilibrium is a crucial concept in chemistry that describes a condition of balance in reversible reactions. Importantly, this state does not imply that the reaction has ceased; rather, it indicates that the reaction continues to take place. However, the concentrations of the reactants and products remain constant over time because the rates of the forward and reverse reactions have reached equilibrium.

Consider a straightforward reversible reaction where substances $A$ and $B$ react to form products $C$ and $D$. Initially, $A$ and $B$ react to produce $C$ and $D$ at a certain rate. As the reaction progresses, the concentrations of $A$ and $B$ decrease, leading to a slowdown in the forward reaction. Conversely, as the concentrations of $C$ and $D$ increase, the reverse reaction speeds up. Eventually, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal, and the system achieves dynamic equilibrium.

It is essential to understand that dynamic equilibrium can only be established in a closed system, where no reactants or products can escape or enter. If the system is subjected to a disturbance—such as a change in temperature or pressure—the equilibrium will shift to counteract this change. This phenomenon is described by Le Chatelier's Principle.

In summary, dynamic equilibrium represents a balanced state in a reversible reaction, characterized by equal rates of the forward and reverse reactions, resulting in stable concentrations of both reactants and products. This fundamental concept in chemistry enhances our understanding of reaction mechanisms and their controllability.
