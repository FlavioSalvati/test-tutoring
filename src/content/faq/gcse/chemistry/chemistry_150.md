In half-equations, oxidation is characterized by a gain of oxygen or a loss of hydrogen, while reduction is identified by a loss of oxygen or a gain of hydrogen.

To elaborate, oxidation and reduction are fundamental concepts in the study of redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions. These reactions involve the transfer of electrons between different chemical species. Oxidation refers to the process by which a substance loses electrons, which can be represented in a half-equation by an increase in oxidation state. This process often occurs through the addition of oxygen or the removal of hydrogen. For instance, in the half-equation

$$
2H_2 \rightarrow 4H^+ + 4e^-
$$

hydrogen is being oxidized because it is losing electrons.

Conversely, reduction is the process in which a substance gains electrons, and this is reflected in a half-equation by a decrease in oxidation state. Reduction typically occurs through the removal of oxygen or the addition of hydrogen. For example, in the half-equation

$$
O_2 + 4e^- \rightarrow 2O^{2-}
$$

oxygen is being reduced since it is gaining electrons.

It is crucial to remember that in any redox reaction, one species is always oxidized while another is always reduced. This relationship is often summarized by the mnemonic 'OIL RIG', which stands for 'Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons), Reduction Is Gain (of electrons)'. By analyzing the changes in oxidation states within half-equations, you can effectively determine which species are undergoing oxidation and which are undergoing reduction.
