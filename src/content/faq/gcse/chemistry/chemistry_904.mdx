A double bond in alkenes is a type of chemical bond that occurs between two atoms, involving a total of four bonding electrons instead of the standard two.

To elaborate, alkenes are a specific category of hydrocarbons, which are compounds composed solely of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The defining characteristic of alkenes, distinguishing them from other types of hydrocarbons, is the presence of a double bond. This double bond forms when two pairs of electrons are shared between two carbon atoms.

In a conventional covalent bond, only one pair of electrons is shared. However, in a double bond, two pairs of electrons are shared, which is why it is referred to as a "double bond." This unique bonding structure imparts distinctive chemical properties to alkenes, particularly their reactivity.

Moreover, the double bond in alkenes plays a significant role in geometric isomerism. The presence of the double bond restricts the rotation of the bonded atoms, resulting in different spatial arrangements known as isomers.

From an electron configuration perspective, a double bond consists of one sigma bond ($\sigma$) and one pi bond ($\pi$). The sigma bond is formed through the end-to-end overlap of atomic orbitals, while the pi bond arises from the side-to-side overlap of orbitals. Notably, the pi bond is weaker than the sigma bond, which contributes to the increased reactivity of double bonds compared to single bonds.

Grasping the nature of double bonds in alkenes is essential for understanding their chemical behavior and reactivity. This concept is a fundamental principle in organic chemistry, the branch of chemistry that focuses on carbon-containing compounds.
