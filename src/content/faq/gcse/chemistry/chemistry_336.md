Non-metals are a distinct group of elements characterized by their brittle nature, poor conductivity of heat and electricity, and relatively low melting and boiling points.

Typically located on the right side of the periodic table, non-metals include elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and selenium. They are primarily defined by their lack of metallic luster; unlike metals, non-metals do not shine or reflect light. Instead, they often appear dull or colorless.

One of the most significant properties of non-metals is their poor conductivity. In contrast to metals, which are excellent conductors of heat and electricity, non-metals generally exhibit low conductivity. This difference arises from the absence of free electrons in non-metals, which are crucial for efficient electrical conduction in metals. As a result, non-metals are particularly valuable in applications requiring insulation, such as in electrical wiring and heat-resistant materials.

Moreover, non-metals are typically brittle, meaning they tend to break or shatter easily when subjected to stress or force. This property stands in stark contrast to metals, which are malleable and can be bent or shaped without fracturing. The brittleness of non-metals is attributed to the type of bonding that occurs between their atoms, which is primarily covalent bonding. Covalent bonds are generally not as strong or flexible as the metallic bonds found in metals.

In terms of physical state, non-metals can exist in all three states of matter at room temperature: solid, liquid, and gas. This versatility contrasts with metals, which are predominantly solid at room temperature. The melting and boiling points of non-metals are generally lower than those of metals, with many non-metals transitioning to gaseous states at relatively low temperatures.

Finally, non-metals have a tendency to gain electrons and form negative ions during chemical reactions. This behavior is due to their high electronegativity, which indicates a strong inclination to attract electrons. This property plays a crucial role in the chemical reactions involving non-metals, including the formation of compounds with metals.
