In redox reactions, electron transfers are represented through half-reactions that illustrate the loss or gain of electrons by different substances.

In these reactions, one substance undergoes reduction, meaning it gains electrons, while another substance is oxidized, indicating it loses electrons. Each of these processes is clearly defined by half-reactions, which detail the specific electron transfers involved. By including electrons in the equations, half-reactions clarify which species is losing electrons and which is gaining them.

For example, letâ€™s examine the reaction between magnesium and oxygen to produce magnesium oxide. The overall reaction can be expressed as:

$$
2 \text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO}.
$$

This reaction can be decomposed into two distinct half-reactions. The oxidation half-reaction, which depicts the loss of electrons, is:

$$
\text{Mg} \rightarrow \text{Mg}^{2+} + 2e^{-}.
$$

Conversely, the reduction half-reaction, which illustrates the gain of electrons, is:

$$
\text{O}_2 + 4e^{-} \rightarrow 2\text{O}^{2-}.
$$

In these half-reactions, the symbol $e^{-}$ denotes an electron. It is crucial to note that the number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction must equal the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction. This concept is referred to as the principle of charge balance.

Half-reactions serve as an invaluable tool for understanding the dynamics of redox reactions, as they provide a clear view of the changes occurring for each species involved. They also facilitate the balancing of redox equations, allowing us to adjust the coefficients in the half-reactions to ensure that the total number of transferred electrons remains consistent in both the oxidation and reduction processes.

In every redox reaction, there is a definitive transfer of electrons from one species to another. The species that loses electrons is termed oxidized, while the species that gains electrons is referred to as reduced. These electron transfers are fundamental to the progression of the reaction and are encapsulated in the half-reactions that compose the overall redox equation.
