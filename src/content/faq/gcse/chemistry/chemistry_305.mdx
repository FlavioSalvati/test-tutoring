Iron undergoes rusting when it comes into contact with both water and oxygen, particularly in the presence of an electrolyte.

Rusting, scientifically known as iron oxidation, is a chemical reaction that occurs when iron or iron-containing alloys, such as steel, are exposed to moisture and oxygen over an extended period. The essential elements involved in this process are water and oxygen, which react with iron to produce hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly recognized as rust.

The presence of an electrolyte can significantly accelerate the rusting process. An electrolyte is a substance that, when dissolved in water, creates a solution that conducts electricity. Common electrolytes that contribute to rusting include salt and acid rain. These electrolytes enhance the movement of electrons during the rusting process, thereby increasing the rate and extent of rust formation.

The rusting process leads to the formation of iron(III) oxide, a reddish-brown compound known as rust. This occurs when iron reacts with oxygen from the air or water, and the chemical reaction can be represented by the equation:

$$
4 \, \text{Fe}(s) + 3 \, \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \, \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)
$$

This reaction involves both oxidation (where iron loses electrons) and reduction (where oxygen gains electrons).

In summary, for iron to rust, it must be exposed to both water and oxygen, with the presence of an electrolyte significantly speeding up this process. The rusting mechanism consists of a redox reaction, in which iron is oxidized to form iron(III) oxide, which we commonly refer to as rust.
