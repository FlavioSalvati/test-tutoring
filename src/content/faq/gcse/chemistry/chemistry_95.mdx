To convert between different concentration units, one must utilize conversion factors that are derived from the definitions of these units.

Concentration units are essential for expressing the amount of solute present in a specific quantity of solvent or solution. The most commonly used units include molarity ($M$), molality ($m$), mass percent, volume percent, and parts per million (ppm). Each of these units has a specific definition that can serve as a conversion factor.

Molarity ($M$) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. To convert from molarity to molality, the density of the solution must be known. Molality ($m$), on the other hand, is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The conversion from molarity to molality can be achieved by using the formula:

$$
m = \frac{M \cdot \rho}{1000}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the solution in grams per milliliter.

Mass percent is defined as the mass of the solute divided by the total mass of the solution, multiplied by $100$. To convert from molarity to mass percent, you will need to know the molar mass of the solute and the density of the solution. First, calculate the mass of the solute using the formula:

$$
\text{mass of solute} = M \cdot \text{molar mass} \cdot V
$$

where $V$ is the volume of the solution in liters. Then, determine the total mass of the solution by dividing the volume of the solution by its density:

$$
\text{mass of solution} = V \cdot \rho
$$

Consequently, the mass percent can be calculated as:

$$
\text{mass percent} = \left( \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \right) \times 100
$$

Volume percent is analogous to mass percent but focuses on the volumes of the solute and solution instead of their masses. To convert from molarity to volume percent, you need the volume of the solute and the total volume of the solution. The volume percent is computed as:

$$
\text{volume percent} = \left( \frac{\text{volume of solute}}{\text{total volume of solution}} \right) \times 100
$$

Parts per million (ppm) signifies the number of parts of solute per million parts of solution. To convert from molarity to ppm, knowledge of the molar mass of the solute and the density of the solution is essential. Similar to the mass percent calculation, you can find the mass of the solute using:

$$
\text{mass of solute} = M \cdot \text{molar mass} \cdot V
$$

Next, calculate the total mass of the solution:

$$
\text{mass of solution} = V \cdot \rho
$$

Finally, the ppm is given by:

$$
\text{ppm} = \left( \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \right) \times 1,000,000
$$

By understanding these definitions and relationships, you can effectively convert between various concentration units.
