For water purification experiments, you will require several essential materials: distilled water, a beaker, a heat source, a condenser, and a collection flask.

In a typical water purification experiment, distilled water serves as the "dirty" water that you intend to purify. The beaker is where you will place the water for heating. The heat source, which can be either a Bunsen burner or a hot plate, is employed to heat the water contained in the beaker.

The condenser is a critical component of this setup. It consists of a tube within a tube and functions to cool the steam generated from the heated water, converting it back into liquid form. The outer tube of the condenser circulates cold water, while the inner tube allows the steam from the heated water to pass through. As the steam contacts the cold walls of the inner tube, it cools and condenses back into liquid water.

The collection flask is where the purified water is gathered. It is typically connected to the output of the condenser. As steam condenses back into liquid in the condenser, it drips into the collection flask.

In addition to these primary materials, you may also require a stand to support the condenser, a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the heating water, and a clamp to secure the collection flask. To simulate "dirty" water, you might need to mix some impurities, such as salt or soil, with the distilled water. Always remember to wear safety equipment, such as gloves and goggles, throughout the experiment to ensure your safety.
