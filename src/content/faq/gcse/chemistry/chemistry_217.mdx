Polymerization is depicted in chemical equations by illustrating the reaction of monomers to form a polymer, often denoted by the variable $n$ to signify repetition.

To elaborate, polymerization is the process in which small molecules, referred to as monomers, chemically bond to create a large, chain-like molecule known as a polymer. This transformation is represented in chemical equations by showing how the monomer reacts to produce the polymer.

For instance, the polymerization of ethene, which results in poly(ethene), can be expressed as:

$$
n \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 \rightarrow (-\text{C}_2\text{H}_4-)_{n}
$$

In this equation, the variable $n$ indicates the number of repeating units in the polymer. The parentheses around $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$ on the product side signify that this is the repeating unit within the polymer. The $n$ outside the parentheses illustrates that this unit is repeated multiple times to create the polymer chain.

Another example is the polymerization of propene to form poly(propene), represented as:

$$
n \text{C}_3\text{H}_6 \rightarrow (-\text{C}_3\text{H}_6-)_{n}
$$

Once again, the variable $n$ is used to denote the number of repeating units in the polymer.

It is important to understand that in reality, the value of $n$ can be quite large, as polymers may consist of thousands or even millions of repeating units. Additionally, the actual polymerization process can be more intricate, often involving catalysts and specific temperature and pressure conditions. However, for the sake of simplicity in representing the process with a chemical equation, this additional detail is typically omitted.

In summary, the key to grasping polymerization equations lies in recognizing the monomer and understanding how it repeats to form the polymer.
