The bromine water test is a straightforward method for detecting the presence of alkenes in a substance by observing a color change.

To elaborate, the bromine water test is a chemical procedure designed to identify whether a substance contains an alkene functional group. Alkenes are hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. This double bond is responsible for the reactivity of alkenes, enabling them to participate in addition reactions, such as their reaction with bromine water.

To conduct the test, you simply add bromine water—a yellow-orange solution—to the substance being examined. If the substance contains an alkene, a reaction will occur, resulting in the decolorization of the solution from yellow-orange to colorless. This change occurs because bromine reacts with the double bond in the alkene, forming a colorless dibromo compound.

Conversely, if the bromine water retains its yellow-orange color, it indicates that the substance does not contain an alkene. This is due to the fact that substances lacking a carbon-carbon double bond, such as alkanes, do not react with bromine water in this manner.

It's crucial to note that while the bromine water test can suggest the presence of an alkene, it is not definitive proof. Other compounds can also decolorize bromine water, so additional tests may be necessary to confirm the presence of an alkene. Nevertheless, at the GCSE level of chemistry, the bromine water test serves as a useful and simple technique for identifying potential alkenes.
