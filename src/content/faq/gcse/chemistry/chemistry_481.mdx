Hydrogen fuel cells and conventional batteries are both important sources of electrical power, yet they operate on fundamentally different principles.

Conventional batteries, such as those found in mobile phones and laptops, serve primarily as storage devices. They consist of two electrodes—a positive electrode (cathode) and a negative electrode (anode)—immersed in an electrolyte. When a battery is charged, electricity from an external source initiates a chemical reaction that stores energy within the battery. When the device is in use, this reaction reverses, releasing the stored energy as electricity.

In contrast, hydrogen fuel cells do not store energy; instead, they generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. A hydrogen fuel cell operates by introducing hydrogen gas at one side of the cell (the anode) and oxygen at the opposite side (the cathode). Within the cell, hydrogen molecules are split into protons and electrons. The protons pass through a membrane to reach the cathode, while the electrons are directed along an external circuit, creating an electric current. When the protons, electrons, and oxygen converge at the cathode, they react to form water, which is the only byproduct of this process.

This fundamental distinction leads to different advantages and disadvantages for hydrogen fuel cells and batteries. Batteries excel in energy storage and can deliver high power outputs but eventually deplete and require recharging. Conversely, hydrogen fuel cells can produce electricity continuously as long as they receive a supply of hydrogen and oxygen. However, they are generally less efficient at delivering high power and face challenges related to the storage and transportation of hydrogen fuel.
