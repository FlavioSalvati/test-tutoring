In the temperature change experiment, you will collect data by measuring and recording the initial and final temperatures of the substances involved.

To systematically document your findings during the temperature change experiment, begin by setting up your apparatus. Ensure that you have all necessary materials ready, which typically include a thermometer, a beaker or test tube containing the substance whose temperature change you wish to measure, and a heat source.

Before initiating the experiment, take note of the initial temperature of the substance. This measurement serves as your baseline. It is crucial to record this value accurately, as any errors at this stage can significantly impact the reliability of your results.

After recording the initial temperature, apply the heat source to the substance and start your timer. It is important to monitor the temperature closely as the substance heats up. You can do this by checking the thermometer at regular intervals, such as every 30 seconds or every minute. Each time you take a reading, be sure to document the temperature along with the corresponding time.

Once the heating period is complete, measure and record the final temperature of the substance. This value represents the temperature achieved after heating for the designated duration.

The temperature change can be calculated by finding the difference between the initial and final temperatures. Specifically, this can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\text{Temperature Change} = T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial}}
$$

where $T_{\text{final}}$ is the final temperature and $T_{\text{initial}}$ is the initial temperature.

It is essential to record all data in a clear and organized manner. Utilizing a table to track the temperatures at various time intervals can facilitate the analysis of your results and help in drawing conclusions from your experiment. Lastly, always double-check your recordings to ensure accuracy and consistency.
