Common examples of metal oxides include iron(III) oxide, aluminium oxide, magnesium oxide, and copper(II) oxide.

**Iron(III) oxide**, commonly referred to as rust, is a reddish-brown compound that forms when iron reacts with oxygen in the air. This well-known metal oxide is frequently utilized in the production of paints, cosmetics, and various pigments. Additionally, iron(III) oxide plays a critical role in the manufacturing of iron and steel.

**Aluminium oxide** is a white or colorless crystalline compound that naturally occurs in several forms of bauxite. It is primarily used in the production of aluminium metal and serves as an abrasive due to its hardness. Furthermore, aluminium oxide is valued for its high melting point, making it an excellent refractory material. It is also employed in the manufacture of ceramics and glass.

**Magnesium oxide** appears as a white solid and occurs naturally as the mineral periclase. Its applications are diverse: it is used to produce refractory bricks for furnaces, to enhance acidic soils in agriculture, and in medicine as both a laxative and antacid. Additionally, magnesium oxide is utilized in the production of rubber, plastics, and ceramics.

**Copper(II) oxide** is a black solid that occurs naturally as the mineral tenorite. This compound is important in the production of copper and is used in the manufacture of batteries. It also serves as a pigment in ceramics and is involved in the creation of glass and enamels.

These examples illustrate the diversity of metal oxides, which are compounds formed when metals react with oxygen. They have a wide range of applications across various industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, and medicine.
