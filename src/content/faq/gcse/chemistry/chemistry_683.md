Carbon nanotubes are minute cylindrical structures composed of carbon atoms, celebrated for their remarkable strength, flexibility, and electrical conductivity.

Carbon nanotubes, commonly referred to as CNTs, represent a distinctive class of nanoparticles characterized by their unique shape, size, and physical properties. Essentially, they are formed by rolling up sheets of graphene, which consists of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. This rolling process gives rise to their cylindrical shape, hence the term "nanotubes." Typically, CNTs have diameters in the nanometer range ($1$ billionth of a meter), while their lengths can extend to several millimeters.

One of the most notable features of carbon nanotubes is their extraordinary strength and flexibility. They rank among the strongest and stiffest materials known, yet they remain remarkably lightweight. This combination of properties arises from the robust covalent bonds between the carbon atoms and the unique cylindrical architecture of the nanotubes. As a result, CNTs can be bent and twisted without fracturing, which enhances their versatility in various applications.

Moreover, carbon nanotubes exhibit exceptional electrical and thermal conductivity. They are proficient conductors of both heat and electricity, primarily because the electrons within the carbon atoms can move freely along the length of the tube, facilitating the flow of electrical current. Certain types of CNTs even display superconductivity, meaning they can conduct electricity without any resistance under specific conditions.

Due to these advantageous properties, carbon nanotubes have a wide array of potential applications. They could revolutionize the electronics industry by enabling the creation of smaller and faster circuits. In materials science, they hold promise for developing stronger and lighter materials. Additionally, in the field of medicine, CNTs may be utilized for drug delivery systems and tissue engineering. However, the high cost of production and the challenges associated with handling these materials currently limit their widespread practical use.
