To calculate the number of moles from a given mass, you simply divide the mass of the substance by its molar mass.

The concept of moles is fundamental in chemistry, serving as a method for counting atoms or molecules in a substance. The mole is the SI unit for the amount of a substance and is defined as the quantity that contains as many entities (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) as there are in $12$ grams of carbon-12. This quantity is known as Avogadro's number, which is approximately $6.022 \times 10^{23}$.

To determine the number of moles from the mass of a substance, you first need to know the substance's molar mass. The molar mass represents the mass of one mole of a substance and is typically expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). You can find the molar mass of an element on the periodic table, where it is indicated as the atomic weight of the element in g/mol. For compounds, you can calculate the molar mass by summing the molar masses of all the constituent elements.

Once you have the molar mass, you can find the number of moles by dividing the mass of the substance by the molar mass. This relationship arises because the molar mass indicates the mass of one mole of that substance. Therefore, if you know the mass of the substance, you can determine how many moles it represents by performing the division of mass by molar mass.

For instance, consider $18$ grams of water (H$_2$O). The molar mass of water is approximately $18$ g/mol (calculated as $16$ g/mol for oxygen plus $1$ g/mol for each hydrogen). The calculation for the number of moles would be:

$$
\text{Number of moles} = \frac{18 \text{ g}}{18 \text{ g/mol}} = 1 \text{ mole}.
$$

This indicates that $18$ grams of water is equivalent to $1$ mole of water.
