Catalysts enhance atom economy by increasing the yield of desired products while minimizing waste production.

Catalysts are pivotal in chemical reactions because they provide an alternative reaction pathway characterized by a lower activation energy. This reduction in activation energy allows reactions to occur more readily, often resulting in an increased reaction rate. But how does this connect to atom economy? Atom economy is defined as the proportion of starting materials that are transformed into useful products. In an ideal scenario, every atom from the reactants would be converted into useful products, achieving a perfect atom economy of $100\%$.

When a catalyst is employed in a reaction, it can steer the reaction toward the formation of desired products and away from the generation of unwanted by-products. This is particularly crucial in industrial processes, where maximizing atom economy is essential for both economic and environmental sustainability. By enhancing the yield of the desired product, catalysts contribute to improved atom economy.

For instance, consider the Haber process for ammonia production. This reaction is reversible and, in the absence of a catalyst, does not favor ammonia synthesis. However, by introducing an iron catalyst, the rate of the forward reaction is significantly accelerated, resulting in a higher yield of ammonia. This enhancement improves the atom economy of the process, as a greater proportion of nitrogen and hydrogen is converted into ammonia instead of remaining as unreacted gases or forming undesirable by-products.

Moreover, catalysts are not consumed during the reaction, allowing them to be utilized repeatedly without depletion. This characteristic further boosts atom economy by reducing the need for additional materials in the reaction.

In summary, catalysts can substantially enhance the atom economy of a reaction by increasing the yield of desired products, decreasing waste production, and enabling reuse.
