The evolution of plants has significantly transformed the Earth's atmosphere by increasing oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide concentrations.

The first plants appeared approximately $500$ million years ago during the Cambrian explosion, a time marked by rapid evolutionary development. These primitive plants, resembling modern algae and mosses, initiated the process of photosynthesis. This vital process involves the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen, leading to profound changes in the Earth's atmospheric composition over time.

Prior to the emergence of plants, the Earth's atmosphere was predominantly composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with very little oxygen present. As plants evolved and proliferated across the planet, they began to alter this balance. Through photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide and sunlight to synthesize glucose, a type of sugar that serves as an energy source for their growth and reproduction. Oxygen is released as a by-product of this process, enriching the atmosphere.

Over millions of years, this continuous process has dramatically modified the composition of the Earth's atmosphere. The increase in oxygen levels enabled the evolution of more complex life forms that depend on oxygen for respiration, including all animal species. Concurrently, the decline in carbon dioxide levels has played a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate, as carbon dioxide is a potent greenhouse gas that can trap heat in the atmosphere.

Additionally, plants are essential to the nitrogen cycle. Certain plants, especially legumes, engage in a symbiotic relationship with bacteria that can convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants. This process, known as nitrogen fixation, is vital for maintaining the balance of nitrogen in the atmosphere.

In summary, the evolution of plants has profoundly influenced the Earth's atmosphere by increasing oxygen levels, decreasing carbon dioxide levels, and contributing to the nitrogen cycle.
