Oxygen gas can be identified through a simple yet effective method: relighting a glowing splint. When introduced to oxygen, a glowing splint will reignite, confirming the presence of this gas.

To perform this test, you will need a glowing splint. A glowing splint is typically a small piece of wood, like a matchstick, that has been ignited and then extinguished, leaving it glowing but without an active flame. This glowing splint is then placed into a test tube or another container that may contain oxygen. If the splint reignites, this indicates a positive result for the presence of oxygen.

This phenomenon occurs because oxygen acts as a supporter of combustion, meaning it facilitates the burning of other substances. When the glowing splint is introduced into an environment rich in pure oxygen, the oxygen molecules provide the necessary conditions for the splint to reignite.

It is crucial to understand that this test is specific to oxygen. Other gases, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen, will not cause the glowing splint to reignite. However, caution is required since certain gases, like hydrogen, can also lead to the splint reigniting, but this will be accompanied by a characteristic 'pop' sound.

In a laboratory setting, oxygen can be generated through the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using a catalyst such as manganese dioxide. The oxygen gas produced can then be collected and tested using the glowing splint method.

Always prioritize safety when conducting experiments. Ensure you use appropriate safety equipment and adhere to your teacher's instructions.
