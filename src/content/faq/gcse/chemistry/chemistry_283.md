Water treatment involves a series of well-defined processes designed to purify it, making it safe for consumption. The primary stages include coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection.

The first stage, coagulation, involves the addition of specific chemicals to the water. These chemicals, commonly aluminum or iron salts, serve to bind small particles of dirt and dissolved substances into larger aggregates known as 'flocs'. By neutralizing the charges on these particles, the chemicals facilitate their adhesion to one another.

Once coagulation is complete, the water is directed into sedimentation basins. Here, the heavier flocs settle to the bottom under the influence of gravity in a process known as sedimentation. The accumulation of settled flocs forms a layer of sludge, which is subsequently removed, allowing cleaner water to progress to the next treatment stage.

The following stage is filtration. During this process, the water passes through filters composed of layers of sand, gravel, and charcoal. These filters effectively trap smaller particles in the minute spaces between the grains. Filtration removes nearly all remaining particulates, significantly enhancing the clarity and quality of the water.

The final stage of water treatment is disinfection. In this crucial step, chemicals such as chlorine or methods like ultraviolet light are employed to eliminate any remaining bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms. This step is vital to ensuring that the water is not only clean but also safe for drinking, free from harmful pathogens.

Throughout the entire treatment process, the water is meticulously monitored and tested to ensure compliance with established safety standards. While the specific methods may vary based on the source of the water and the contaminants present, the overarching aim remains consistent: to produce clean and safe drinking water for all.
