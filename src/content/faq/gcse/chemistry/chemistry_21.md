Lithium, sodium, and potassium are all members of the alkali metals group in the periodic table, characterized by their high reactivity, softness, and low density.

The alkali metals are known for their vigorous reactions with water and air, with reactivity increasing as you move down the group. This pattern indicates that potassium is more reactive than sodium, and sodium is more reactive than lithium. Each of these metals possesses a single electron in their outermost shell, which contributes to their eagerness to donate this electron during chemical reactions.

Lithium, being the lightest of the alkali metals, also has the highest melting point among them. While lithium does react with water, its reaction is less vigorous compared to those of sodium and potassium. When lithium reacts with water, it produces lithium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Due to its high electrochemical potential, lithium is widely used in batteries.

Sodium is a soft, silvery-white metal that is highly reactive. It is slightly denser than lithium but less dense than potassium. Sodium undergoes an explosive reaction with water, forming sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. This reaction is notably more vigorous than that of lithium. Sodium is a common component in table salt (sodium chloride) and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate).

Potassium is also a soft, silvery-white metal, but it is heavier than both lithium and sodium. It reacts violently with water, even more so than sodium, producing potassium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. This reaction is often accompanied by a distinctive lilac flame. Potassium plays a vital role in plant growth and is a key ingredient in fertilizers.

All three of these metals are soft enough to be cut with a knife and possess low densities that allow them to float on water. Additionally, they have low melting and boiling points, which decrease as you descend the group. These unique properties make lithium, sodium, and potassium fascinating subjects for study in the field of chemistry.
