The primary sources of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions are the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes.

The combustion of fossil fuels stands as the largest contributor to CO₂ emissions. This category encompasses the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation and heating, which is responsible for approximately two-thirds of global CO₂ emissions. When fossil fuels are burned, they release CO₂ into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect and driving global warming. For instance, coal-fired power plants are significant contributors, as they consume substantial quantities of coal to generate electricity.

Deforestation is another major source of CO₂ emissions. When trees are felled, they release the carbon they have sequestered throughout their lifespan back into the atmosphere. Moreover, the subsequent use of this land for agricultural purposes—such as cattle ranching or crop cultivation—can lead to additional CO₂ emissions. This occurs because soil tilling often releases stored carbon, and livestock emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

Industrial processes also play a role in CO₂ emissions. These processes include the chemical reactions required to transform raw materials into finished goods. For example, the production of cement involves the calcination of limestone, which results in the release of CO₂. Similarly, the production of steel and aluminum requires the reduction of metal ores with carbon, generating CO₂ as a by-product.

Additionally, there are other, less significant sources of CO₂ emissions, such as waste disposal and treatment, energy consumption in residential and commercial settings, and transportation. For instance, vehicles that run on petrol or diesel fuel emit CO₂. However, these sources contribute relatively minor amounts of emissions compared to the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities.
