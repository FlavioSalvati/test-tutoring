To conduct an experiment that measures temperature changes, you will need three essential items: a thermometer, a heat source, and a substance to heat.

**Step 1: Select the Substance**

Begin by choosing the substance you wish to heat. This could be a liquid, such as water, or a solid, like a metal. It is important to ensure that the substance is safe to heat and that it exhibits temperature changes that are easy to measure. For instance, water is commonly used in experiments because it heats up and cools down relatively slowly, making it simpler to track changes in temperature.

**Step 2: Choose a Heat Source**

Next, select an appropriate heat source. Options include a Bunsen burner, an electric heater, or even sunlight. The heat source should be adjustable so that you can control the amount of heat applied to the substance. For example, a Bunsen burner features a valve that allows you to regulate the size of the flame.

**Step 3: Acquire a Thermometer**

You will also need a thermometer to accurately measure the temperature of the substance. Ensure that the thermometer is precise and has a range that encompasses the expected temperatures of the substance. For example, when heating water from room temperature to boiling, the thermometer should cover a range from approximately $20^\circ C$ to $100^\circ C$.

**Step 4: Set Up the Experiment**

To set up your experiment, place the chosen substance in a heat-safe container, such as a beaker or test tube. Insert the thermometer into the substance, ensuring that it does not touch the sides or bottom of the container. Begin applying heat from your chosen heat source and monitor the temperature displayed on the thermometer. Be sure to record the initial temperature and take measurements at regular intervals, such as every minute.

**Safety Precautions**

Always handle all equipment with care, especially those that are heated. Use tongs or heat-resistant gloves to manage hot containers safely. Additionally, conduct experiments under the supervision of a teacher or another responsible adult to ensure safety. 

By following these steps, you can effectively measure temperature changes in your chosen substance while prioritizing safety and accuracy.
