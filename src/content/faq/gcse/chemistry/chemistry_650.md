Transition metals are generally less reactive than Group 1 metals, also known as alkali metals, due to their more stable electron configurations.

Located in the center of the periodic table, transition metals have distinct electronic structures that influence their reactivity. The reactivity of an element is primarily determined by the arrangement of electrons in its atoms, known as its electron configuration.

Group 1 metals possess a single electron in their outermost energy level. This electron is situated far from the nucleus and is therefore held relatively weakly. As a result, these metals can easily lose their outer electron, forming a positive ion. This characteristic is fundamental to many chemical reactions. For example, when sodium (a Group 1 metal) interacts with water, it readily loses its outer electron, leading to a vigorous reaction.

In contrast, transition metals have more electrons in their outer energy levels. These electrons are closer to the nucleus and are held more tightly, making it more challenging for transition metals to lose them and form positive ions. Consequently, transition metals are generally less reactive than their Group 1 counterparts. For instance, iron (a transition metal) does not undergo a violent reaction with water as sodium does.

Additionally, transition metals can form positive ions with varying charges by losing different numbers of electrons. This capability, known as variable oxidation states, further contributes to their lower reactivity compared to Group 1 metals.

In summary, the reduced reactivity of transition metals in comparison to Group 1 metals can be attributed to their more stable electron configurations, stronger retention of outer electrons, and the ability to form ions with multiple charges.
