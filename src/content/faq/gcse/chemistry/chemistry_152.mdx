The required practical for the electrolysis of aqueous solutions involves setting up and utilizing an electrolytic cell to observe the products generated during the process.

### Detailed Procedure

To conduct this experiment, you will need to assemble an electrolytic cell using two inert electrodes, which are typically made of graphite. These electrodes must be connected to a power supply and then submerged in an aqueous solution containing an ionic compound. The power supply delivers the necessary energy to initiate the electrolysis reaction.

When the power supply is activated, the ions present in the solution will migrate towards the electrodes. Specifically, positive ions (cations) will travel towards the negative electrode, known as the cathode, while negative ions (anions) will move towards the positive electrode, referred to as the anode. At the electrodes, these ions will undergo either reduction or oxidation, depending on their charge, resulting in the formation of new substances.

### Observations and Recordings

During the practical, you will need to observe and document the products of the electrolysis. This can be achieved by noting any changes occurring at the electrodes or in the solution itself. Look for signs such as the formation of bubbles, alterations in color, or the deposition of a solid material on an electrode. Additionally, you may be required to test the produced gases to confirm their identity, for instance, by using a lit splint to check for the presence of hydrogen.

### Safety Considerations

Safety is a critical aspect of this practical. Always wear safety goggles to protect your eyes, and handle the power supply and electrodes with care to prevent electric shocks. Be mindful that the solutions used in electrolysis can be hazardous; therefore, avoid any skin contact and inhalation.

### Summary

In summary, the practical for the electrolysis of aqueous solutions involves the assembly of an electrolytic cell, the execution of an electrolysis reaction, and the observation and identification of the resulting products. This experiment is an excellent opportunity to witness the principles of electrolysis in action and to understand how ions in solution can be transformed into new substances.
