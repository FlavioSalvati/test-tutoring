The electrical charges of subatomic particles are essential in determining how atoms bond to form molecules and influence atomic structure.

Atoms are composed of three types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons possess a positive charge ($+1$), electrons carry a negative charge ($-1$), and neutrons are electrically neutral (charge $0$). The protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus of the atom, while electrons orbit around the nucleus in defined energy levels, commonly referred to as shells.

The atomic number of an element is defined by the number of protons in an atom. For instance, hydrogen, which has one proton, has an atomic number of $1$. The combined total of protons and neutrons within an atom gives its atomic mass. Typically, the number of electrons matches the number of protons, resulting in an overall electrically neutral atom. However, when an atom either gains or loses electrons, it transitions into an ion, acquiring a positive or negative charge.

The arrangement of electrons in the shells surrounding the nucleus primarily dictates how atoms bond to form molecules. The outermost shell is known as the valence shell, and the electrons residing in this shell are termed valence electrons. Atoms strive to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a full valence shell, which represents the most stable configuration. This behavior underpins the principles of chemical bonding.

For example, in a water molecule ($H_2O$), the oxygen atom shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms to complete its valence shell, resulting in covalent bonds. In contrast, sodium chloride (table salt, $NaCl$) involves a sodium atom transferring an electron to a chlorine atom, resulting in the formation of ions that are held together by ionic bonds. Therefore, the electrical charges of subatomic particles are fundamental to understanding the structure and behavior of atoms, as well as the compounds they create.
