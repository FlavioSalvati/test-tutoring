The three primary states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.

In the realm of chemistry, matter is defined as anything that possesses mass and occupies space. This matter can exist in three fundamental states: solid, liquid, and gas. Each state has unique characteristics and can transition from one form to another through processes known as phase transitions.

**Solids** are characterized by having a definite shape and volume. In a solid, the particles are tightly packed in a regular arrangement, which contributes to the material's rigid structure. These particles vibrate in place but do not move from their fixed positions. Common examples of solids include ice, wood, and metal.

**Liquids**, in contrast, have a definite volume but no fixed shape. They conform to the shape of their container. The particles in a liquid are closely packed but have the ability to move around one another, allowing liquids to flow. Examples of liquids include water, oil, and mercury.

**Gases** lack both a definite shape and volume. They expand to fill the entire space of their container, and the particles in a gas are widely spaced apart, moving freely in all directions. This high-energy movement results in particle collisions that create gas pressure. Common examples of gases include oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.

The transition between these states of matter occurs through phase changes. For instance, a solid can transform into a liquid through the process of melting, while a liquid can become a gas via evaporation. Conversely, a gas can condense into a liquid, and a liquid can freeze into a solid. These transitions are driven by changes in energy, typically in the form of heat, being added or removed. Understanding these states of matter and their transitions is essential to the study of chemistry.
