Studying energy changes in chemical reactions is essential for understanding their feasibility and efficiency.

Thermochemistry, the study of energy changes during reactions, is a fundamental aspect of chemistry. It allows us to predict whether a reaction will occur spontaneously. This prediction is based on the principle that reactions tend to progress toward a lower energy state. Typically, exothermic reactions, which release energy, are more likely to occur than endothermic reactions, which require energy input.

Furthermore, examining energy changes is crucial for calculating the energy efficiency of a reaction. This is particularly significant in industrial processes, where the goal is to maximize output while minimizing energy consumption to reduce costs and environmental impact. For instance, in the Haber process for ammonia synthesis, reaction conditions are meticulously controlled to optimize both yield and energy efficiency.

Understanding energy changes also aids in controlling reaction rates. Reactions that necessitate an energy input usually require an initial energy boost, known as the activation energy, to initiate the process. By comprehending this concept, we can employ catalysts to lower the activation energy, thereby accelerating the reaction.

Additionally, energy changes provide insights into the type of bonding within a substance. For example, ionic compounds typically exhibit high lattice energies, which represent the energy released when ions combine to form a solid. This information can be invaluable in predicting the properties of the substance, including its melting and boiling points.

In summary, the study of energy changes in reactions is a critical component of chemistry that enhances our ability to predict, control, and comprehend chemical processes. Its practical applications extend across various fields, from industrial manufacturing to environmental science.
