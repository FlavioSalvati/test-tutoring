The formation of oceans originated from the early atmosphere through a process known as outgassing, followed by condensation and precipitation.

In the initial stages of Earth's formation, the planet was characterized by extreme heat and volatility. This heat primarily stemmed from the decay of radioactive elements, as well as residual warmth from the planet's creation. The intense temperatures caused the rocks to melt, resulting in a molten surface. As the Earth gradually cooled, gases that were trapped within these rocks were released into the atmosphere in a process referred to as outgassing. The main gases emitted during this time included water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.

As the Earth continued to cool over time, the water vapor present in the atmosphere started to condense. This process can be likened to the formation of water droplets on the outside of a cold glass on a hot day. As the water vapor condensed, it gave rise to clouds. When the concentration of water in these clouds became sufficiently high, it precipitated as rain.

This rainwater subsequently pooled in the lowest regions of the Earth's surface, leading to the creation of the first oceans. Over millions of years, these bodies of water expanded, eventually evolving into the vast oceans we observe today. It is essential to understand that this process was not a singular event but rather a continuous cycle of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation that persists to this day.

The formation of oceans was a critical milestone in the development of life on Earth. These oceans served as a reservoir for carbon dioxide, playing a significant role in regulating the planet's climate. Furthermore, they provided the essential conditions required for the emergence of the first life forms, marking the beginning of life's evolutionary journey on our planet.
