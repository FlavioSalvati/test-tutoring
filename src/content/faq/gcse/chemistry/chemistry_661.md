Ionic bonds are formed when atoms transfer electrons in order to achieve a full outer electron shell. This transfer creates positively and negatively charged ions that attract one another due to their opposite charges.

Ionic bonding is a specific type of chemical bonding characterized by the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. These ions arise from atoms that have lost one or more electrons, becoming positively charged cations, and from atoms that have gained one or more electrons, becoming negatively charged anions. Atoms strive for stability, which they typically achieve by having a complete outer shell of electrons.

The process of ionic bonding typically begins with a metal atom, which usually has one or two electrons in its outer shell, coming into contact with a non-metal atom that requires one or two electrons to fill its outer shell. The metal atom donates its outer electrons to the non-metal atom. As a result, the metal atom transforms into a positively charged ion (cation), while the non-metal atom becomes a negatively charged ion (anion).

Once the electron transfer is complete, the resulting ions possess opposite charges. Due to the attractive nature of opposite charges, these ions are pulled together by electrostatic forces, resulting in the formation of an ionic bond. This bond is what holds the ions together in an ionic compound.

For instance, letâ€™s examine the formation of sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$), commonly known as table salt. Sodium ($\text{Na}$) has one electron in its outer shell, while chlorine ($\text{Cl}$) requires one electron to complete its own outer shell. When sodium donates its outer electron to chlorine, it becomes a sodium ion ($\text{Na}^+$), and chlorine becomes a chloride ion ($\text{Cl}^-$). The attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms an ionic bond, resulting in the creation of sodium chloride.

In conclusion, ionic bonds are established through the transfer of electrons from one atom to another. This process produces oppositely charged ions that are drawn to each other by electrostatic forces, ultimately leading to the formation of ionic compounds.
