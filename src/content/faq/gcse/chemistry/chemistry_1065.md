Distillation is a method used to purify water by transforming it into steam and subsequently condensing it back into liquid form in a separate container.

This purification process leverages the varying boiling points of different substances to achieve separation. It is particularly effective for water purification because most common impurities have boiling points that are higher than that of water, which is $100^\circ C$ (or $373.15 \, \text{K}$) at standard atmospheric pressure.

The procedure begins with heating the impure water. As the temperature increases, the water begins to evaporate, transitioning into steam. This steam rises, effectively leaving behind the impurities, as they do not evaporate at the same temperature as water. The steam is then channeled into a condenser, which is a cooled area designed to facilitate the condensation of steam back into liquid form.

The condensed water, now collected in a separate container, is free from the impurities that remained in the original vessel. As a result, this newly collected water is purified and no longer contains the contaminants present in the source water.

It is important to acknowledge that while distillation is a highly effective method for removing a wide range of impurities, it may not eliminate all contaminants. Certain substances, such as specific organic compounds, have boiling points lower than that of water and could evaporate alongside the steam. Nevertheless, distillation remains an excellent method for purifying water from the majority of common impurities.

In summary, distillation purifies water by exploiting the differences in boiling points between water and its impurities. The process involves boiling the water into steam, leaving most impurities behind, and then condensing the steam back into liquid in a separate container, resulting in purified water.
