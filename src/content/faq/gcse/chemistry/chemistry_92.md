The actual yield of a chemical reaction is often compared to the theoretical yield by calculating the percentage yield. The formula for percentage yield is given by:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

The theoretical yield represents the maximum amount of product that could be generated from a chemical reaction under ideal conditions. This value is determined using the balanced chemical equation and the quantities of the reactants involved. In contrast, the actual yield refers to the quantity of product that is produced in a real-world experiment or industrial process.

To assess the efficiency of a reaction, we calculate the percentage yield. This is achieved by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and then multiplying the result by $100$ to express it as a percentage. A high percentage yield, close to $100\%$, indicates that the reaction was highly efficient, with minimal waste or side reactions. Conversely, a low percentage yield, significantly below $100\%$, suggests that the reaction was less efficient, resulting in a considerable amount of waste or side reactions.

For instance, if the theoretical yield of a reaction is $10$ grams and the actual yield is $8$ grams, the percentage yield can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100\% = 80\%
$$

This outcome signifies that $80\%$ of the maximum possible product was successfully produced, while $20\%$ was lost due to waste or side reactions.

It is crucial to recognize that achieving a $100\%$ yield in practical scenarios is extremely rare. This rarity is often attributed to factors such as incomplete reactions, practical losses during experimentation, or unforeseen chemical reactions. Consequently, chemists strive to maximize the percentage yield while minimizing waste in their processes.
