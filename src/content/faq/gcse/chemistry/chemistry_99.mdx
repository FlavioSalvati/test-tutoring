To determine the concentration of a solution through titration, you gradually add a solution of known concentration, referred to as the titrant, to a solution of unknown concentration, known as the analyte, until the chemical reaction between them is complete. This completion point is referred to as the equivalence point or end point.

Titration is a widely used laboratory technique for quantitative chemical analysis, specifically designed to ascertain the concentration of an unknown solution. The process involves the careful addition of the titrant to the analyte until the reaction reaches completion.

Before beginning the titration, prepare your workspace with the essential equipment: a burette, a pipette, a conical flask, and the two solutions. The burette should be filled with the titrant, while the pipette is used to accurately measure a specific volume of the analyte, which is then placed in the conical flask.

The titration process starts by slowly adding the titrant from the burette into the conical flask containing the analyte. As the titrant is introduced, a reaction occurs between the two solutions. It is crucial to add the titrant gradually, particularly as you approach the end point, to maintain precision.

To determine when the end point is reached, an indicator is commonly employed. This substance changes color when the reaction is complete. The choice of indicator depends on the specific nature of the reaction; for example, phenolphthalein and methyl orange are frequently used in acid-base titrations.

Once the end point is achieved, record the volume of titrant dispensed from the burette. With this information, along with the known volume and concentration of the analyte, you can apply the formula 

$$ c_1 v_1 = c_2 v_2 $$ 

where $c$ represents concentration and $v$ denotes volume, to calculate the concentration of the unknown solution.

Accuracy is paramount in titration. It is advisable to perform the titration multiple times to ensure that your results are consistent and reliable.
