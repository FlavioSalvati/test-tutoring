Common methods for separating mixtures include filtration, evaporation, distillation, chromatography, and centrifugation.

**Filtration** is a straightforward technique employed to separate solid particles from a liquid or gas. This process involves passing the mixture through a filter, which captures the solid particles while allowing the liquid or gas to flow through. Filtration is a method frequently encountered in everyday situations, such as when brewing coffee or tea.

**Evaporation** serves as another effective method for separating a solid that is dissolved in a liquid. By applying heat to the mixture, the liquid evaporates, leaving the solid residue behind. This technique is often utilized in the production of salt, where seawater is evaporated to yield salt crystals.

**Distillation** is a specialized technique used to separate liquids based on their differing boiling points. The mixture is heated until the liquid with the lowest boiling point vaporizes. The resulting vapor is then condensed back into a liquid and collected separately. Distillation is commonly employed in the production of alcoholic beverages and in the petroleum industry to separate crude oil into its various components.

**Chromatography** is a method designed for separating and analyzing complex mixtures. It involves passing the mixture through a medium, such as a piece of paper or a column filled with liquid. The different components of the mixture move at varying rates, which results in their separation. Chromatography is widely used in laboratories for analyzing chemical, biological, and pharmaceutical samples.

**Centrifugation** is a technique used to separate mixtures that have different densities. The mixture is placed in a centrifuge, which spins at high speeds. The centrifugal force generated causes the denser particles to migrate towards the outer edges of the centrifuge, while the less dense particles remain closer to the center. This method is commonly utilized in medical laboratories to separate blood into its various components.
