The primary types of chemical bonds include ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds.

**Ionic Bonds**  
Ionic bonds are established when one atom transfers one or more electrons to another atom. This process typically occurs between metal and non-metal atoms. The atom that loses electrons becomes a positively charged ion, while the atom that gains electrons becomes a negatively charged ion. The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions leads to the formation of an ionic bond. For instance, in sodium chloride (table salt), sodium donates an electron to chlorine, resulting in the creation of an ionic bond.

**Covalent Bonds**  
In contrast, covalent bonds form when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. This type of bonding generally takes place between non-metal atoms. The shared electrons orbit the nuclei of both atoms, effectively holding them together. A classic example of this is found in water molecules, where oxygen and hydrogen atoms share electrons, resulting in a covalent bond.

**Metallic Bonds**  
Metallic bonds occur between metal atoms. In this bonding type, electrons are neither exchanged nor shared between specific atoms. Instead, they are free to move throughout the structure, creating a 'sea' of delocalized electrons. This unique arrangement endows metals with distinctive properties such as electrical conductivity and malleability. For example, in a piece of copper wire, the copper atoms are bonded together through metallic bonds.

Each type of bond imparts different characteristics to the resulting compound or element. Ionic compounds are generally brittle and exhibit high melting and boiling points, whereas covalent compounds can exist as gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature, often having lower melting and boiling points. Metallic bonds confer metals with essential properties, including the ability to conduct electricity and heat. A solid understanding of these bonds is crucial for grasping the properties of various substances in chemistry.
