Atom economy is a key metric in green chemistry that quantifies the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It measures the proportion of starting materials that are converted into the desired product, thereby highlighting how much is wasted in the process. A higher atom economy indicates less waste generation, thus making the reaction more sustainable.

The calculation of atom economy involves a specific formula:

$$
\text{Atom Economy (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Total molecular mass of desired products}}{\text{Total molecular mass of all reactants}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

To perform this calculation, you first need to determine the molecular masses of all reactants and products involved in the chemical reaction. The molecular mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses of all atoms present in a molecule, which can be obtained from the periodic table.

For instance, consider a reaction where the total molecular mass of the reactants is $200 \, \text{g/mol}$ and the molecular mass of the desired product is $150 \, \text{g/mol}$. The atom economy for this reaction can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Atom Economy} = \left( \frac{150 \, \text{g/mol}}{200 \, \text{g/mol}} \right) \times 100\% = 75\%
$$

In this example, $75\%$ of the mass of the reactants is successfully converted into the desired product, leaving $25\%$ as waste. The objective in green chemistry is to design reactions that maximize atom economy, thereby minimizing waste and enhancing sustainability in chemical processes.
