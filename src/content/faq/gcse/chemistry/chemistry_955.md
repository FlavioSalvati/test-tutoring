To perform a carbon dioxide test, you will need the following materials: limewater, a test tube, a delivery tube, and a source of carbon dioxide.

### Materials Required
1. **Limewater**: This is a solution of calcium hydroxide, which serves as the key reagent for the test.
2. **Test Tube**: This will be used to collect the carbon dioxide.
3. **Delivery Tube**: This piece of equipment allows you to direct the carbon dioxide from its source into the test tube.
4. **Source of Carbon Dioxide**: You can use a gas syringe filled with carbon dioxide or generate carbon dioxide through a chemical reaction, such as the reaction between hydrochloric acid and marble chips (calcium carbonate).

### Procedure
1. **Prepare the Limewater**: Fill the test tube with limewater.
2. **Direct the Carbon Dioxide**: Using the delivery tube, guide the carbon dioxide into the test tube containing limewater.
3. **Observe the Reaction**: As carbon dioxide is bubbled through the limewater, a reaction occurs, resulting in the formation of calcium carbonate, which appears as a white precipitate. This change, from a clear solution to a milky appearance, indicates a positive test for carbon dioxide.

### Safety Considerations
Always exercise caution when handling chemicals. Make sure to wear appropriate safety equipment, such as gloves and safety goggles, while conducting chemical tests. Additionally, ensure that you perform the experiment in a well-ventilated area, as carbon dioxide is a gas that can accumulate in enclosed spaces.

By following these steps and safety guidelines, you can effectively test for the presence of carbon dioxide.
