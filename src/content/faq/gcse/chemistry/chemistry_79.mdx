To calculate the concentration of a solution in moles per cubic decimetre ($\text{mol/dm}^3$), you divide the number of moles of the solute by the volume of the solution in cubic decimetres ($\text{dm}^3$).

Concentration is a quantitative measure indicating how much solute is dissolved in a specific volume of solution. In chemistry, this measurement is commonly referred to as molarity, expressed in $\text{mol/dm}^3$. To determine the concentration, you need two crucial pieces of information: the number of moles of the solute and the volume of the solution.

The number of moles of the solute can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}}
$$

Here, the mass refers to the weight of the solute you have added to the solution, while the molar mass is a characteristic constant for each substance, typically expressed in grams per mole ($\text{g/mol}$). You can find the molar mass on the periodic table, which lists the relative atomic mass of each element.

It's important to note that the volume of the solution represents the total volume, which includes both the solvent and the solute. If the volume is given in cubic centimetres ($\text{cm}^3$), it should be converted to cubic decimetres ($\text{dm}^3$) for the calculation. Remember that there are $1,000$ cubic centimetres in a cubic decimetre, so to convert from $\text{cm}^3$ to $\text{dm}^3$, you divide by $1,000$.

Once you have determined the number of moles of the solute and the volume of the solution in $\text{dm}^3$, you can calculate the concentration using the following formula:

$$
\text{Concentration (mol/dm}^3\text{)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{volume of solution (dm}^3\text{)}}
$$

The resulting value provides the concentration of the solution in $\text{mol/dm}^3$, indicating how many moles of solute are present in each cubic decimetre of the solution. This measure is essential for understanding the 'strength' or 'concentration' of the solution.
