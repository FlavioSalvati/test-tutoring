Unknown gases can be identified through a series of straightforward tests, including the lit splint test, limewater test, glowing splint test, and the damp litmus paper test. 

When identifying unknown gases, it is essential to perform these tests with caution, as each gas reacts uniquely to heat, light, and different substances. Always prioritize safety by wearing appropriate protective gear and conducting experiments in a well-ventilated environment.

### Lit Splint Test
The lit splint test is designed to identify hydrogen gas. When a lit splint is placed into a test tube containing hydrogen, it produces a distinctive 'pop' sound upon ignition. This sound occurs due to the rapid reaction of hydrogen with oxygen in the air, resulting in the formation of water:

$$ 2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O $$

### Limewater Test
To identify carbon dioxide, the limewater test is employed. When carbon dioxide is bubbled through limewater, which is a solution of calcium hydroxide ($Ca(OH)_2$), it reacts to form calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$). This reaction causes the limewater to become cloudy:

$$ CO_2 + Ca(OH)_2 \rightarrow CaCO_3 + H_2O $$

The cloudiness is a unique indicator of carbon dioxide's presence.

### Glowing Splint Test
The glowing splint test is utilized to confirm the presence of oxygen gas. If a glowing splint is inserted into a test tube filled with oxygen, it reignites. This phenomenon occurs because oxygen supports combustion, allowing the splint to continue burning:

$$ 2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O $$

### Damp Litmus Paper Test
The damp litmus paper test serves to identify chlorine gas. Chlorine has the property of bleaching damp litmus paper, turning it white. This characteristic reaction is exclusive to chlorine and can be used as a reliable confirmation of its presence.

### Conclusion
While these tests offer a practical approach to identifying some of the most common gases encountered in a chemistry laboratory, it is important to note that they are not exhaustive. There are numerous other gases that these tests may not detect. Nonetheless, these methods provide a solid foundation for gas identification in various experiments.
