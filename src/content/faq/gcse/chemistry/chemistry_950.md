A positive result for the hydrogen test is indicated by a characteristic 'pop' sound when a lit splint is introduced into the test tube.

The hydrogen test is a straightforward and effective method used in chemistry to identify the presence of hydrogen gas. Typically performed in a laboratory environment, the procedure begins by collecting the gas suspected to be hydrogen in a test tube. Once the gas is collected, a lit splint is carefully introduced into the test tube. If hydrogen gas is indeed present, it will react with the oxygen in the air, producing a distinctive 'pop' sound. This audible signal is the positive indication you are seeking.

The underlying science explains that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. When it encounters a flame or spark, it reacts swiftly with oxygen in the air to form water. This combustion reaction releases a substantial amount of energy, resulting in the characteristic 'pop' sound. This process is classified as an exothermic reaction, which is a type of reaction that releases energy. The chemical equation representing this reaction is:

$$
2H_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2H_2O(l)
$$

In this equation, 'g' denotes a gas, and 'l' denotes a liquid.

It is crucial to prioritize safety when conducting this test. Due to hydrogen's flammability, improper handling can lead to a larger explosion. Always ensure that you perform this test under the supervision of a trained professional to minimize risks.
