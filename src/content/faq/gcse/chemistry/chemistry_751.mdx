The reactivity of metals varies significantly among different elements, primarily due to differences in their atomic structure and their capacity to lose electrons.

To elaborate, a metal's reactivity is largely determined by its ability to lose electrons and form positive ions, a process referred to as oxidation. Metals tend to lose electrons easily because they possess relatively few electrons in their outermost energy level, also known as the valence shell. The fewer electrons present in this outer shell, the more readily the metal can part with them, resulting in higher reactivity.

The atomic structure of a metal is fundamental to its reactivity. Metals consist of atoms, which are composed of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons that occupy various energy levels or shells. The outermost shell is designated as the valence shell. Metals typically have one, two, or three electrons in their valence shell, which they can readily lose to attain a stable electron configuration.

The ease with which a metal can lose its valence electrons and form positive ions serves as an indicator of its reactivity. For example, alkali metals such as lithium ($Li$), sodium ($Na$), and potassium ($K$) are highly reactive because they possess only one electron in their outermost shell, making it simple for them to lose that electron. In contrast, transition metals, including gold ($Au$) and platinum ($Pt$), exhibit lower reactivity, as they have more electrons in their outer shell, complicating the process of electron loss.

Additionally, the reactivity of metals is influenced by the strength of the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons. The greater the distance between the nucleus and the outermost shell, the weaker the attraction, which facilitates the loss of valence electrons. This phenomenon explains why the elements in the first group of the periodic table (the alkali metals) are generally more reactive than those found in the middle sections (the transition metals).
