The by-products of condensation polymerization are typically small molecules, such as water, methanol, or hydrochloric acid.

Condensation polymerization is a chemical reaction in which monomers combine to form a polymer, releasing a small molecule as a by-product. This process differs from addition polymerization, where all the atoms in the monomers are utilized to create the polymer and no by-products are generated.

The specific by-product produced during condensation polymerization depends on the monomers involved in the reaction. For instance, when the monomers are carboxylic acids and alcohols, the by-product is water. This occurs because the hydroxyl (-OH) group from the alcohol and a hydrogen atom (-H) from the carboxylic acid combine to form water, represented as $H_2O$. Similarly, when amines and carboxylic acids react, water is also formed, derived from the hydrogen atom from the amine and the hydroxyl group from the carboxylic acid.

In other cases, the by-product may be methanol or hydrochloric acid. For example, when the monomers are esters and alcohols, the by-product is methanol, which is produced when the hydroxyl group from the alcohol and a hydrogen from the ester combine to form $CH_3OH$. Conversely, when amines react with acid chlorides, hydrochloric acid is produced as a by-product, resulting from the combination of a hydrogen atom from the amine and a chlorine atom (-Cl) from the acid chloride.

In all these reactions, the by-products are small molecules, which is why condensation polymerization is often referred to as step-growth polymerization. The polymer forms progressively, with each step in the reaction releasing a small molecule as a by-product. This characteristic is fundamental to condensation polymerization and serves to differentiate it from other types of polymerization reactions.
