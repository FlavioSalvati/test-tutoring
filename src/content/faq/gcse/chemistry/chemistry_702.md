Percentage yield can be influenced by several factors, including the completion of the reaction, the occurrence of side reactions, product loss during purification, and measurement errors.

To elaborate, the first factor impacting the percentage yield is whether the reaction has reached completion. In certain cases, a reaction may not proceed to completion, meaning that not all reactants have been converted into the desired product. This incomplete conversion can arise from various reasons, such as insufficient time allowed for the reaction to occur or an inadequate amount of a particular reactant. Consequently, this results in a lower percentage yield.

Another contributing factor is the presence of side reactions. Occasionally, reactants may engage in unintended reactions, leading to the formation of by-products. This diversion of reactants into side reactions can diminish the percentage yield of the desired product, as some of the reactants are consumed in these alternative pathways.

Additionally, product loss during the purification process can significantly affect the percentage yield. After the reaction is complete, the product typically undergoes purification to eliminate any unreacted reactants or undesirable by-products. However, during this purification process, some of the desired product may also be lost, thereby reducing the overall yield.

Lastly, measurement errors can also play a critical role in determining the percentage yield. Inaccuracies in measuring the amounts of reactants used or errors in quantifying the amount of product obtained can lead to either an overestimation or underestimation of the percentage yield.

In summary, various factors can influence the percentage yield of a chemical reaction. Understanding these factors is essential for effectively planning and conducting reactions, as well as for accurately interpreting the results obtained.
