To create a graph illustrating reaction rate data, you should plot time on the x-axis and the concentration or volume of reactants and products on the y-axis.

### Step 1: Data Collection

Begin by gathering your data. This data may originate from an experiment you've conducted or be provided in a problem set. Ensure that your dataset includes the times at which measurements were taken, along with the corresponding concentrations or volumes of the reactants or products at those specific times.

### Step 2: Plotting the Graph

With your data in hand, you can proceed to plot your graph. 

1. **X-Axis (Horizontal)**: Plot time along the x-axis. Time is considered the independent variable; it is not influenced by any other factors in the experiment. 
   
2. **Y-Axis (Vertical)**: Plot the concentration or volume of the reactants or products on the y-axis. This represents the dependent variable, which changes in response to the passage of time.

### Step 3: Scaling and Data Point Placement

Begin by establishing an appropriate scale for your axes. Ensure that the scale is suitable for your data, allowing you to utilize as much of the graph paper as possible. Once the scale is set, proceed to plot your data points. For each time value, locate the corresponding concentration or volume, and place a dot at that position on the graph.

### Step 4: Drawing the Line of Best Fit

After all your data points are plotted, you can draw a line of best fit. This line should be smooth and represent the overall trend of the data points, though it does not need to pass through every individual point.

### Step 5: Interpreting the Graph

Keep in mind that the steepness of the line conveys important information about the reaction rate. A steeper line indicates a faster reaction, while a horizontal line suggests that the reaction has ceased. This graph serves as a valuable tool for understanding how the rate of a reaction evolves over time and can be used to determine the rate of reaction at any particular moment. 

By following these steps, you will effectively visualize the relationship between time and the concentration or volume of reactants/products in your reaction.
