The molar mass of a compound is determined by summing the molar masses of all its constituent elements.

To calculate the molar mass of a compound, you must know its chemical formula and the atomic masses of the elements that comprise it. The atomic masses of all elements can be found on the periodic table. Notably, the molar mass of an element is numerically equivalent to its atomic weight, expressed in atomic mass units (amu).

For example, letâ€™s examine water (H$_2$O). The atomic mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately $1$ amu, and there are two hydrogen atoms in one molecule of water. The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is about $16$ amu, and there is one oxygen atom in water. Therefore, the molar mass of water can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Molar Mass of } \text{H}_2\text{O} = (2 \times 1) + 16 = 18 \text{ g/mol}.
$$

When dealing with more complex compounds, the process remains the same, but you must account for the number of each type of atom present in the formula. For instance, to find the molar mass of glucose (C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_6$), you would perform the following calculation:

$$
\text{Molar Mass of } \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 = (6 \times 12.01) + (12 \times 1.008) + (6 \times 16.00) = 180.18 \text{ g/mol}.
$$

Keep in mind that the molar mass of a compound is the total of the molar masses of its constituent elements, each multiplied by the number of times that element appears in the compound's formula. This fundamental concept in chemistry is essential, as it enables the conversion between the mass of a sample and the number of moles it contains, which is crucial for stoichiometric calculations.
