The combustion of fossil fuels results in the release of pollutants, producing harmful gases and particulates that pose risks to both human health and the environment.

Fossil fuels, which include coal, oil, and natural gas, are primarily composed of hydrocarbons. When these hydrocarbons are burned, they react with oxygen in the air, leading to the formation of carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). This process is known as combustion. However, the combustion of fossil fuels is seldom a clean operation; it typically generates a variety of pollutants with detrimental effects.

Among the primary pollutants released is carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in global warming. Additionally, the combustion process produces other harmful gases, including sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$) and nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$). Sulfur dioxide forms when sulfur present in fossil fuels reacts with oxygen. This gas can lead to acid rain, which damages buildings, harms vegetation, and disrupts aquatic ecosystems. Nitrogen oxides are generated when nitrogen and oxygen in the air react at the high temperatures produced during combustion. These gases are known to cause respiratory issues in humans and contribute to smog formation.

In addition to gaseous pollutants, the burning of fossil fuels generates particulatesâ€”tiny solid or liquid particles that can remain suspended in the air. These particulates can be particularly harmful to human health, especially when they are small enough to be inhaled into the lungs. They also contribute to the development of smog and haze.

Moreover, the combustion of fossil fuels can release heavy metals and other toxic substances, which can contaminate air, soil, and water, further exacerbating risks to human health and the environment. Thus, while fossil fuels have served as a major energy source for many years, their combustion carries significant environmental and health implications.
