Metallic bonding is characterized by the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of positively charged metal ions, distinguishing it from both ionic and covalent bonding.

Metallic bonding is a type of chemical bond that results from the electrostatic attraction between conduction electrons and positively charged metal ions. This bonding mechanism differs from ionic and covalent bonds in several fundamental ways. In ionic bonding, electrons are transferred from one atom to another, leading to the formation of positively and negatively charged ions. These ions are then attracted to one another due to their opposite charges. In contrast, covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms to achieve a stable electron configuration.

In metallic bonding, free electrons—often referred to as a "sea of electrons"—are shared among a lattice of positive ions. These delocalized electrons are not associated with any specific atom, allowing them to move freely throughout the metal. This unique electron distribution is responsible for many of the characteristic properties of metals, including high electrical conductivity, malleability, and ductility.

The strength of metallic bonds is influenced by two key factors: the number of electrons participating in the bond and the size of the positive ions. Generally, the greater the number of bonding electrons and the smaller the ions, the stronger the metallic bond. This is why some metals, such as iron, are harder than others, like sodium. Iron has more bonding electrons and smaller ions, resulting in a stronger bond.

In summary, while ionic and covalent bonds involve the transfer or sharing of electrons between specific atoms to form molecules, metallic bonding entails the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of positive ions. This distinct arrangement of electrons accounts for the unique properties exhibited by metals.
