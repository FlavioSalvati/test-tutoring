You can detect chlorine gas by exposing damp litmus paper to it, which will bleach the paper and turn it white.

Chlorine gas is characterized as a yellow-green gas with a strong, pungent odor. It is a potent oxidizing agent, capable of bleaching various substances. This bleaching property serves as the foundation for a straightforward test to confirm the presence of chlorine gas.

To conduct this test, you will need damp litmus paper. Litmus paper is a special type of paper that changes color in response to variations in pH: it turns red in acidic conditions and blue in alkaline conditions. However, upon exposure to chlorine gas, the litmus paper undergoes a more dramatic change—it gets bleached and turns white. This reaction occurs because chlorine gas is a sufficiently strong oxidizing agent to completely remove the color from the litmus paper.

Here’s how to perform the test: first, dampen the litmus paper—either red or blue—with distilled water. Next, expose the damp litmus paper to the suspected chlorine gas. If the paper turns white, this indicates the presence of chlorine gas.

It's crucial to prioritize safety when handling gases, particularly chlorine gas, which is toxic and can lead to respiratory issues. Always conduct such tests in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood. Additionally, be sure to wear appropriate safety gear, including gloves and safety glasses.

In summary, the test for chlorine gas relies on its bleaching effect on damp litmus paper. This simple yet effective method provides a reliable means to confirm the presence of chlorine gas.
