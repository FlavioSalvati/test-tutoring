Acid rain refers to precipitation that contains elevated levels of sulfuric and nitric acids, primarily resulting from industrial pollution.

The term "acid rain" encompasses any type of precipitation that contains acidic components, such as sulfuric acid or nitric acid, which falls to Earth from the atmosphere. This precipitation can take various forms, including rain, snow, fog, hail, or even acidic dust. The primary driver of acid rain is human activity, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels and various industrial processes that emit sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$) and nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$) into the atmosphere. These gases can ascend to significant altitudes, where they interact with water, oxygen, and other chemicals, resulting in the formation of acidic pollutants collectively known as acid rain.

Both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are highly soluble in water and can be transported over considerable distances by wind. Consequently, these compounds can eventually become incorporated into precipitation such as rain, sleet, snow, and fog. While a small fraction of the $\text{SO}_2$ and $\text{NO}_x$ responsible for acid rain originates from natural sources like volcanic eruptions, the majority is a result of human activities. The main sources of $\text{SO}_2$ and $\text{NO}_x$ emissions include the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants, automobiles, trucks, and other forms of heavy equipment, as well as manufacturing processes, oil refineries, and other industrial operations.

The implications of acid rain are profound, affecting both the environment and public health. It has the potential to damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, particularly those constructed from limestone and marble, which contain high levels of calcium carbonate. Environmentally, acid rain can impair forests and soils, harm aquatic life in rivers and oceans, and ultimately disrupt the food chain. Additionally, it contributes to air pollution, which can lead to health issues in both humans and animals.
