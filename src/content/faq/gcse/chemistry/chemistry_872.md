Alkenes, also referred to as olefins, are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of at least one carbon-carbon double bond. As unsaturated compounds, they possess the ability to react with various substances, which renders them highly valuable in industrial applications.

One of the primary applications of alkenes is in the production of plastics. For instance, polyethylene is synthesized from the alkene ethene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$). This versatile plastic is extensively utilized in packaging materials, bottles, and a variety of everyday items.

Another significant use of alkenes lies in the production of synthetic rubber. The alkene butadiene ($\text{C}_4\text{H}_6$) undergoes polymerization to form a type of rubber that mimics the properties of natural rubber while being more cost-effective and produced in larger quantities. This synthetic rubber finds application in numerous products, including tires, gloves, and adhesives.

Alkenes also play a crucial role in the manufacturing of detergents. The alkene propene ($\text{C}_3\text{H}_6$) is employed to produce linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, which serves as a key ingredient in many laundry and dishwashing detergents. This particular compound is favored due to its biodegradability and its minimal contribution to foam formation in aquatic environments.

Beyond these applications, alkenes function as intermediates in various chemical synthesis processes. For example, ethene is used to produce ethanol ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}$), a fundamental component in alcoholic beverages, as well as ethylene glycol ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6\text{O}_2$), which is commonly utilized in antifreeze formulations. Similarly, propene is used to synthesize propylene oxide, a precursor for the production of polyurethane foams.

These examples highlight just a few of the numerous ways in which alkenes are integral to industrial processes and product development.
