The carbon footprint refers to the total quantity of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$), emitted by an individual, event, or product.

More specifically, the carbon footprint serves as a metric for assessing the environmental impact of our activities. It encompasses the amount of greenhouse gases generated through our daily routines, primarily from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heating, transportation, and various other purposes. This concept is grounded in the principle of Global Warming Potential (GWP), which quantifies the heat-trapping ability of different greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$) and methane (CH₄), contribute to the greenhouse effect by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which results in rising global temperatures—a phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. Consequently, a larger carbon footprint signifies a more significant environmental impact.

Typically, the carbon footprint is quantified in tonnes of CO$_{2}$ equivalent (tCO$_{2}$e). The term "equivalent" indicates that the measurement encompasses not only CO$_{2}$ but also other greenhouse gases like methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N$_{2}$O). These gases are converted into CO$_{2}$ equivalents based on their respective warming potentials. For instance, methane is approximately 25 times more effective at trapping heat than CO$_{2}$, meaning that 1 tonne of methane is equivalent to 25 tonnes of CO$_{2}$.

There are two main categories of carbon footprints: primary and secondary. The primary footprint accounts for our direct CO$_{2}$ emissions resulting from fossil fuel combustion, which includes domestic energy use and transportation. In contrast, the secondary footprint considers the indirect CO$_{2}$ emissions associated with the entire lifecycle of the products we consume, from their production to their eventual disposal.

Understanding and calculating our carbon footprint is essential for mitigating our impact on the environment. By making conscious changes to our lifestyles and consumption patterns, we can effectively reduce our carbon footprint and play a vital role in the global effort to combat climate change.
