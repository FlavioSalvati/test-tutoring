Nanoparticles play a pivotal role in enhancing catalysis by offering a significantly larger surface area for chemical reactions to take place.

Nanoparticles are defined as extremely small particles with sizes less than $100$ nanometers. Their unique properties make them essential in the field of catalysis. One of the most notable advantages of using nanoparticles in catalytic processes is their ability to provide an increased surface area for reactions. This phenomenon occurs because, as particle size decreases, the surface area to volume ratio increases. Consequently, a greater number of particles are available on the surface to interact with reactants, resulting in an accelerated reaction rate.

In addition to their increased surface area, nanoparticles possess a high number of active sites. The active site of a catalyst is the specific area that engages with reactant molecules, facilitating chemical reactions. Due to their elevated surface area to volume ratio, nanoparticles have more active sites per unit mass compared to larger particles. This characteristic allows for the use of smaller quantities of nanoparticle catalysts to achieve the same catalytic effect as larger amounts of conventional catalysts.

Moreover, the distinctive electronic and structural properties of nanoparticles further enhance their catalytic capabilities. For example, the electronic characteristics of nanoparticles can be engineered to augment their reactivity or selectivity towards specific reactions. Similarly, the structural attributes of nanoparticles, including their shape and size, can be fine-tuned to optimize their catalytic performance.

In summary, nanoparticles have a profound impact on catalysis. Their diminutive size results in a larger surface area for reactions, an abundance of active sites, and the potential to manipulate their unique electronic and structural properties to improve catalytic performance.
