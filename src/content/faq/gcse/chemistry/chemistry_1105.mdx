Galvanisation is an effective method for protecting iron and steel from rusting by applying a coating of zinc. This zinc layer serves as a barrier, preventing exposure to oxygen and moisture, which are the primary contributors to corrosion.

Rusting is a chemical process that occurs when iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water or moisture. This reaction produces iron oxide, commonly known as rust, which appears as a reddish-brown substance. Over time, rust can cause significant damage to the metal. By applying a protective layer of zinc through galvanisation, the iron is shielded from the elements that initiate this corrosive reaction.

The zinc coating provides an additional layer of protection through a mechanism called "sacrificial protection." Since zinc is more reactive than iron, it will corrode preferentially when exposed to corrosive environments. Therefore, if the zinc layer becomes scratched or damaged, it will deteriorate before the underlying iron does, effectively preserving the iron from rusting. The zinc corrodes slowly, forming a protective layer of zinc salts that further safeguards the iron.

Moreover, the zinc layer exhibits resistance to scratches and abrasions, enhancing the overall durability of the iron. This makes galvanised iron particularly suitable for various applications, including construction, automotive components, and outdoor structures, where the metal is often subjected to harsh weather conditions.

In conclusion, galvanisation protects iron from rusting by creating a physical barrier of zinc that prevents contact with oxygen and moisture. Coupled with the sacrificial protection provided by the zinc coating, this process ensures that iron remains rust-free for an extended period.
