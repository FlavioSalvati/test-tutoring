Common examples of soluble salts include sodium chloride, potassium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate.

Soluble salts are a specific category of salts that dissolve readily in water. This solubility is primarily due to the polar nature of water molecules, which can attract and separate the positive and negative ions present in a salt. For instance, sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, exemplifies a soluble salt. It is composed of sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$), which are easily dissociated by water molecules, resulting in its high solubility.

Another noteworthy example of a soluble salt is potassium nitrate ($\text{KNO}_3$). This compound is frequently used in fertilizers because of its excellent solubility, which facilitates easy absorption by plants. In potassium nitrate, the potassium ions ($\text{K}^+$) and nitrate ions ($\text{NO}_3^-$) are effectively separated by water molecules, promoting dissolution.

Ammonium sulfate [$(\text{NH}_4)_2\text{SO}_4$] is also classified as a soluble salt. It is widely utilized in fertilizers and for treating alkaline soils. In ammonium sulfate, the ammonium ions ($\text{NH}_4^+$) and sulfate ions ($\text{SO}_4^{2-}$) are readily dissociated by water molecules, contributing to its high solubility.

It is important to note that the solubility of a salt can be influenced by various factors, including temperature and the presence of other substances. Generally, increasing the temperature tends to enhance the solubility of most salts. However, there are exceptions to this trend, so it is advisable to consult solubility charts or experimental data when investigating the solubility of different salts.
