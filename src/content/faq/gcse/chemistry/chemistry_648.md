As you descend Group 7 of the Periodic Table, the halogens exhibit notable changes in their properties: they become less reactive, their melting and boiling points rise, and their colors darken.

In the context of the Periodic Table, Group 7 elements are classified as halogens. As you move downward through this group, several significant transformations occur. Firstly, the reactivity of halogens diminishes. This decline in reactivity can be attributed to the outermost electrons—responsible for chemical reactions—being situated further from the nucleus. Consequently, these electrons experience a weaker attraction to the nucleus, making it more challenging for the atom to acquire an additional electron, which is essential for halogen reactivity.

Additionally, the physical properties of halogens change as you progress down Group 7. The melting and boiling points of these elements increase with each subsequent halogen. This trend is a result of the growing strength of van der Waals forces between the molecules. As the atomic size and relative atomic mass increase, these intermolecular forces become stronger. Therefore, more energy—manifested as heat—is necessary to overcome these forces, resulting in elevated melting and boiling points.

Furthermore, the color of halogens deepens as you descend the group. Fluorine appears as a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas, bromine is a reddish-brown liquid, and iodine presents as a dark grey solid or purple vapor. This progression in color is influenced by the increasing complexity of the electron arrangements within the atoms, which alters how they absorb and emit light.

In summary, as you move down Group 7 of the Periodic Table, the halogens exhibit decreased reactivity, rising melting and boiling points, and darker colors. These transformations are primarily due to the increasing number of electron shells in the atoms, which impacts both their chemical reactivity and their physical properties.
