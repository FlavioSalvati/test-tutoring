For a closed system to be in equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions must be equal.

In a closed system, equilibrium occurs when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. It's important to note that this does not imply the reactions have ceased; instead, they continue to occur at the same rate. This state is referred to as dynamic equilibrium. While the concentrations of the reactants and products remain constant, they are not necessarily equal.

The conditions for achieving equilibrium are governed by Le Chatelier's Principle. This principle asserts that if an external change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to counteract that change. For instance, if the concentration of a reactant is increased, the system will respond by accelerating the rate of the forward reaction to consume the added reactant and restore equilibrium.

Temperature also plays a significant role in influencing equilibrium. If the temperature is raised, the system will favor the endothermic reaction—the reaction that absorbs heat—in an effort to reduce the temperature. Conversely, if the temperature is lowered, the system will favor the exothermic reaction—the reaction that releases heat—in an attempt to increase the temperature.

Changes in pressure can also affect equilibrium in reactions involving gases. If the pressure is increased, the system will shift to favor the side of the reaction that has fewer gas molecules, thus working to decrease the pressure. On the other hand, if the pressure is decreased, the system will favor the side with more gas molecules to try and increase the pressure.

In summary, a closed system is in equilibrium when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. This equilibrium can be shifted by changes in concentration, temperature, and pressure.
