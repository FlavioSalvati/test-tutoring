Nanoparticles possess distinctive properties attributable to their diminutive size and elevated surface area-to-volume ratio.

Defined as particles ranging from $1$ to $100$ nanometers in size, nanoparticles are so minuscule that they exhibit behaviors that differ significantly from those of larger particles, leading to unique physical and chemical characteristics. This divergence is primarily due to two key factors: their small size and their high surface area-to-volume ratio.

The small dimensions of nanoparticles result in a considerably larger surface area relative to their volume. This aspect is crucial because many chemical reactions occur at the surface of particles. Consequently, a larger surface area provides more opportunities for reactions to take place, rendering nanoparticles more reactive than their larger counterparts made of the same material. This heightened reactivity is advantageous in numerous applications, particularly in catalysis, where it can enhance efficiency.

Moreover, the small size of nanoparticles enables them to display quantum effects that are absent in larger particles. These quantum phenomena can profoundly influence a material's properties, such as its electrical conductivity, optical characteristics, and magnetic behavior. For instance, gold nanoparticles exhibit a red or purple hue, in contrast to the yellow coloration of bulk gold. This color change is a result of quantum effects altering how the nanoparticles interact with light.

Additionally, the high surface area-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles can lead to increased strength and hardness compared to bulk materials. The substantial number of surface atoms allows for the formation of additional bonds, resulting in a stronger and harder material. This property is harnessed in the production of certain high-strength materials and coatings.

In summary, the distinctive properties of nanoparticles arise from their small size and high surface area-to-volume ratio. These characteristics render them invaluable in a diverse array of applications, ranging from catalysts to high-strength materials.
