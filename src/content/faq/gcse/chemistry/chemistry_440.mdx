The concentration of a solution can be calculated using the formula that relates mass and volume. Specifically, concentration is defined as the mass of the solute (in grams) divided by the volume of the solvent (in liters). 

To elaborate, concentration quantifies the amount of solute that is dissolved in a given volume of solvent. This concept is fundamental in chemistry, especially in the analysis of solutions and mixtures. The formula used for calculating concentration can be expressed as:

$$ C = \frac{m}{V} $$

where:
- $C$ represents the concentration,
- $m$ denotes the mass of the solute (measured in grams), and
- $V$ signifies the volume of the solvent (measured in liters).

To effectively use this formula, you first need to determine the mass of the solute, which is the substance being dissolved, typically measured in grams. Next, you must ascertain the volume of the solvent, which is the medium in which the solute is dissolved, usually measured in liters. Once you have both values, you can compute the concentration by dividing the mass of the solute by the volume of the solvent.

For instance, if you dissolve $20$ grams of salt in $1$ liter of water, the concentration can be calculated as follows:

$$ C = \frac{20 \text{ g}}{1 \text{ L}} = 20 \text{ g/L} $$

This result indicates that there are $20$ grams of salt in every liter of the resulting solution.

It is important to note that the units of concentration may vary. While grams per liter (g/L) is a common unit, concentrations might also be expressed in moles per liter (mol/L), especially in more advanced chemistry contexts. This latter measurement is referred to as molarity. To calculate molarity, you divide the number of moles of the solute by the volume of the solvent, also expressed in liters.
