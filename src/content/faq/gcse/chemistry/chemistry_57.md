Carbon nanotubes are remarkable cylindrical structures composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.

Often referred to as CNTs, carbon nanotubes are a fascinating advancement in nanotechnology. They can be conceptualized as a sheet of graphene—a single layer of carbon atoms—curled into a tube. The hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms resembles the honeycomb structure, which imparts distinctive properties to carbon nanotubes.

These nanotubes can be categorized as either single-walled or multi-walled. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) consist of a single layer of carbon atoms, whereas multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) consist of multiple concentric layers, akin to the layers of an onion. The diameter of a carbon nanotube can vary from less than $1 \, \text{nm}$ to several nanometers.

The unique structural characteristics of carbon nanotubes contribute to their exceptional strength and other remarkable properties. They exhibit extraordinary strength while remaining flexible, and they can efficiently conduct both electricity and heat. This efficiency stems from the robust carbon-carbon bonds within the hexagonal lattice, which allow electrons to move freely along the tube, facilitating electrical conductivity.

Moreover, the structure of carbon nanotubes influences their chirality, or twist, which in turn affects their electrical properties. Depending on how the graphene sheet is rolled, a nanotube may either be metallic, meaning it conducts electricity, or semiconducting, meaning it can switch between conducting and non-conducting states. This versatility makes carbon nanotubes highly valuable in the fields of electronics and other applications.

In summary, carbon nanotubes feature a cylindrical arrangement of carbon atoms in a hexagonal pattern. They can exist as single-walled or multi-walled structures, endowing them with unique properties such as exceptional strength, flexibility, and efficient electrical conductivity.
