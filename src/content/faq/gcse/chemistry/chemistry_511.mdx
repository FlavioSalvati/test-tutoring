Lowering the temperature favors exothermic reactions because these reactions release heat, making them more likely to occur at reduced temperatures.

To elaborate, chemical reactions can be classified as either exothermic or endothermic. Exothermic reactions release heat into their surroundings, whereas endothermic reactions absorb heat. The temperature of the surroundings plays a crucial role in determining the direction in which a reaction will proceed.

According to Le Chatelier's principle, when a system at equilibrium experiences a change in temperature, pressure, or concentration of its components, the system will adjust to counteract the effect of that change. Specifically, when the temperature is decreased, the system will attempt to generate more heat in order to compensate for the loss. Consequently, exothermic reactions, which produce heat, are favored in this scenario.

In this context, the heat generated by an exothermic reaction is treated as a product of the reaction. When the temperature drops, the system interprets this as a decrease in the amount of product (heat), prompting it to shift the equilibrium position to the right in order to generate more heat, thereby favoring the exothermic reaction.

Conversely, endothermic reactions, which absorb heat, are favored when the temperature increases. In these cases, the heat absorbed by an endothermic reaction is regarded as a reactant. When the temperature rises, the system perceives this as an increase in the amount of reactant (heat), leading it to shift the equilibrium position to the left to consume more heat, thus favoring the endothermic reaction.

In summary, reducing the temperature favors exothermic reactions because they release heat. The system reacts to the decrease in temperature by striving to produce more heat, thereby enhancing the likelihood of exothermic reactions occurring.
