To dilute a concentrated solution, you add more solvent—typically water—until the desired concentration is achieved.

The process of dilution reduces the concentration of solutes in a solution by incorporating additional solvent. The solvent is the substance in which the solute is dissolved, and in most cases, this solvent is water. Dilution is a fundamental technique in various fields, particularly in chemistry, where it is often necessary to lower the concentration of a chemical in a solution.

To perform a dilution, you must know both the initial concentration of the solution and the desired final concentration. The volume of solvent to be added can be calculated using the formula:

$$
C_1 V_1 = C_2 V_2
$$

In this equation, $C_1$ represents the initial concentration, $V_1$ is the initial volume, $C_2$ denotes the final concentration, and $V_2$ signifies the final volume.

For instance, consider a scenario where you have $100 \, \text{ml}$ of a solution with a concentration of $10 \, \text{M}$, and you wish to dilute it to a concentration of $1 \, \text{M}$. Using the formula, you would set it up as follows:

$$(10 \, \text{M}) \times (100 \, \text{ml}) = (1 \, \text{M}) \times V_2$$

Solving for $V_2$ gives:

$$
V_2 = \frac{(10 \, \text{M}) \times (100 \, \text{ml})}{1 \, \text{M}} = 1000 \, \text{ml}
$$

Since you already have $100 \, \text{ml}$ of the initial solution, you need to add $900 \, \text{ml}$ of solvent to reach the desired concentration.

It's crucial to remember the proper method of dilution: always add the solution to the solvent, not vice versa. This is especially important when working with concentrated acids, as adding water to a concentrated acid can lead to a violent reaction. Always take appropriate safety precautions, such as wearing gloves and goggles, when handling concentrated solutions.

In summary, diluting a concentrated solution entails adding more solvent to decrease the solute concentration. This process is widely used in chemistry and requires careful calculations along with proper safety measures.
