In titrations, a pH indicator plays a vital role in identifying the endpoint of the reaction by changing color when the solution reaches a neutral state.

During a titration, a solution with a known concentration, referred to as the titrant, is used to ascertain the concentration of an unknown solution, known as the analyte. At the beginning of the titration, a pH indicator is added to the analyte. The titrant is then gradually introduced to the analyte while the mixture is stirred. The endpoint is signaled by a color change of the indicator, indicating that the solution has reached a state of neutrality. This point signifies that the amount of titrant added is stoichiometrically equivalent to the amount of analyte present.

The selection of an appropriate pH indicator is crucial, as different indicators undergo color changes at varying pH levels. For instance, litmus paper transitions from red to blue at approximately $pH \, 7$, while phenolphthalein changes from colorless to pink around $pH \, 8.2$. Hence, the choice of indicator should align with the expected pH at the equivalence point of the titration.

It is essential to select an indicator that undergoes a color change at the pH corresponding to the equivalence point. For example, if the equivalence point is anticipated to be around $pH \, 7$, litmus would be an appropriate choice. Conversely, if the equivalence point is expected closer to $pH \, 8.2$, phenolphthalein would be the better option.

In certain situations, a pH meter may be employed instead of a visual indicator. This device provides a more precise measurement of the pH at the equivalence point; however, it is typically more time-consuming and requires more expensive equipment. Nevertheless, for most GCSE-level experiments, a suitable pH indicator will yield sufficiently accurate results.
