The endpoint of a titration is identified when the indicator undergoes a color change, signaling that the reaction has reached completion.

In a titration, a solution with a known concentration, referred to as the titrant, is utilized to determine the concentration of an unknown solution, called the analyte. The point at which the reaction between these two solutions is complete is known as the endpoint. This completion is typically indicated by a visible color change in the solution, which results from the addition of a substance known as an indicator.

The selection of an appropriate indicator is crucial and depends on the specific nature of the reaction being performed. For instance, in an acid-base titration, phenolphthalein is commonly used. This indicator remains colorless in acidic solutions and turns pink in basic solutions. Consequently, a transition from colorless to pink indicates that all the acid has reacted with the base, marking the completion of the titration.

In the case of a redox titration, a different type of indicator is employed, such as starch when iodine is used as a titrant. Starch forms a blue-black complex with iodine, and once all the iodine has reacted, the solution becomes colorless, indicating the endpoint has been reached.

It is important to differentiate between the endpoint and the equivalence point. The equivalence point refers to the exact moment when stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of the reactants have reacted. The discrepancy between the endpoint and the equivalence point is known as the titration error. However, with careful selection of the indicator and proper technique, this error can be minimized.

In conclusion, the endpoint of a titration is determined by observing a color change in the solution, which occurs due to the interaction between the indicator and either the titrant or the analyte. This color change signifies that the reaction has been completed.
