Examples of substances that exhibit metallic bonding include iron, copper, gold, silver, and aluminum.

Metallic bonding is a specific type of chemical bonding characterized by the electrostatic attraction between conduction electrons and positively charged metal ions. This type of bonding is predominant in metallic substances.

Iron serves as a prime example of a material with metallic bonding. It is a widely utilized metal in construction and manufacturing due to its strength and durability. In iron, metallic bonding occurs through the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of positively charged ions. These delocalized electrons enable iron to effectively conduct both electricity and heat.

Other notable examples of substances with metallic bonding include copper, gold, silver, and aluminum. Copper is particularly valued for electrical wiring because its metallic bonds create a 'sea' of delocalized electrons that can move freely, making it an outstanding conductor of electricity. Gold and silver, both precious metals, are highly malleable and ductile, which is a direct result of their metallic bonding. The nature of the metallic bonds in these metals allows their atoms to slide past one another without breaking the bond, enabling them to be hammered into thin sheets or drawn into fine wires.

Aluminum, in contrast, is a lightweight metal known for its resistance to corrosion. The metallic bonding in aluminum consists of a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalized electrons. This unique bonding arrangement contributes to aluminum's notable properties, such as its lightweight nature and corrosion resistance.

In conclusion, metallic bonding is a distinctive type of chemical bonding found in metallic substances. It involves the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of positively charged ions, which imparts metals with their characteristic properties, including conductivity, malleability, ductility, and corrosion resistance.
