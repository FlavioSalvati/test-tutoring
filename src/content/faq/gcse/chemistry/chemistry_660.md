Transition metals typically exhibit higher boiling points than Group 1 metals.

Transition metals, located in the central region of the periodic table, are characterized by their elevated boiling points. This stands in stark contrast to Group 1 metals, commonly known as alkali metals, which possess relatively low boiling points. The disparity in boiling points can be attributed to the differences in atomic structure and metallic bonding among these metals.

Transition metals have a greater number of electrons available for metallic bonding, resulting in stronger bonds that are more difficult to break apart. Consequently, these metals have higher boiling points. For instance, iron, which is a transition metal, has a boiling point of $2862\,°C$. This high boiling point is due to iron atoms being capable of sharing up to five electrons, thus forming exceptionally strong metallic bonds.

In contrast, Group 1 metals like sodium possess only a single electron available for bonding. This limitation leads to weaker metallic bonds and, consequently, lower boiling points. Sodium, for example, has a boiling point of merely $883\,°C$.

Additionally, transition metals feature a more compact atomic structure, which facilitates greater interactions between atoms and contributes to the formation of stronger bonds. In contrast, Group 1 metals exhibit a less compact atomic arrangement, resulting in fewer interactions between atoms and leading to weaker bonds and lower boiling points.

In summary, the higher boiling points of transition metals compared to those of Group 1 metals can be attributed to their stronger metallic bonds and more compact atomic structures. Understanding these differences is fundamental to grasping the properties of elements within the periodic table.
