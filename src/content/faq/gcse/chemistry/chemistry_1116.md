Ammonia is extracted from the reaction mixture in the Haber process through a method of cooling and liquefaction.

In the Haber process, nitrogen ($N_2$) and hydrogen ($H_2$) gases react to produce ammonia ($NH_3$). It is important to note that this reaction is reversible, meaning ammonia can decompose back into nitrogen and hydrogen. To mitigate this reverse reaction and maximize ammonia yield, the reaction mixture is cooled. The cooling process causes ammonia to liquefy, while the nitrogen and hydrogen remain in gaseous form.

The liquefied ammonia is subsequently separated from the unreacted nitrogen and hydrogen gases. This separation occurs as the mixture flows through a condenser, a device specifically designed to cool the mixture further. As the temperature decreases, ammonia condenses into a liquid and is collected at the bottom of the condenser. In contrast, the unreacted nitrogen and hydrogen, which do not condense, are recycled back into the reactor for reuse in the reaction.

Cooling and liquefaction play a critical role in the Haber process. This method not only facilitates the separation of ammonia from the reaction mixture but also enhances the overall yield of ammonia. Cooling shifts the equilibrium of the reversible reaction to the right, favoring the production of ammonia.

In conclusion, the separation of ammonia in the Haber process is achieved through a combination of cooling and liquefaction. This process effectively separates ammonia from unreacted gases while also maximizing its yield, thereby improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the overall reaction.
