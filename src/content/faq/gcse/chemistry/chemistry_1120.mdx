NPK stands for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, which are the three primary nutrients essential for plant growth.

In the context of fertilizers, NPK designates these vital nutrients: Nitrogen ($N$), Phosphorus ($P$), and Potassium ($K$). Each of these elements plays a distinct and crucial role in the growth and development of plants.

**Nitrogen ($N$)** is a fundamental component of proteins, enzymes, and metabolic processes that facilitate energy synthesis and transfer. It is a key part of chlorophyll, the pigment that enables plants to convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis, transforming water and carbon dioxide into sugars. Nitrogen is vital for promoting the growth of leaves and stems, making it essential for overall plant development.

**Phosphorus ($P$)** is integral to numerous plant functions, including energy transfer and storage, photosynthesis, respiration, and protein synthesis. It plays a significant role in cell division and enlargement, which is critical for determining plant maturity. Additionally, phosphorus is particularly important for root development and flowering, influencing the overall health and productivity of plants.

**Potassium ($K$)**, often referred to as potash, is essential for maintaining overall plant health. It supports protein synthesis and facilitates the movement of nutrients within the plant. Potassium enhances the plant's resistance to drought and cold conditions, as well as its ability to fend off diseases. Furthermore, it contributes to early growth, strengthens stems, and improves the color and flavor of fruits and vegetables.

The numbers displayed on fertilizer packaging, known as the NPK ratio, indicate the percentage by weight of each nutrient present. For instance, a fertilizer labeled as '10-10-10' contains 10% nitrogen ($N$), 10% phosphorus ($P$), and 10% potassium ($K$). The remaining percentage usually consists of inert materials and trace elements.

Understanding the roles of NPK in plant growth can significantly aid gardeners and farmers in selecting the appropriate fertilizer for their specific plants.
