To determine the concentration after mixing two solutions, we use the equation:

$$ C_1 V_1 = C_2 V_2 $$

In this equation, $C$ represents concentration and $V$ stands for volume. Specifically, $C_1$ and $V_1$ denote the concentration and volume of the first solution, while $C_2$ and $V_2$ represent the concentration and volume of the second solution.

To start, you need the initial concentrations and volumes of both solutions. The process involves several steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Volume**: First, determine the total volume of the mixed solution, which is simply the sum of the volumes of the two initial solutions:

$$ V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 $$

2. **Calculate the Total Amount of Solute**: Next, find the total amount of solute in the mixed solution. This is done by calculating the amount of solute in each solution and adding them together. The amount of solute in each solution can be found by multiplying the concentration by its volume:

$$ \text{Total Solute} = C_1 V_1 + C_2 V_2 $$

3. **Calculate the Final Concentration**: Finally, you can find the concentration of the mixed solution, denoted as $C_f$, by dividing the total amount of solute by the total volume of the solution:

$$ C_f = \frac{C_1 V_1 + C_2 V_2}{V_1 + V_2} $$

It is important to understand that concentration measures how much solute is dissolved in a specific volume of solvent. Therefore, when mixing two solutions, both the total amount of solute and the total volume of the solution will change. By applying the formula above, you can accurately compute the new concentration.

Please note that this method assumes the volumes of the two solutions are additive, which is typically a valid assumption for dilute aqueous solutions. However, in cases involving more concentrated solutions or different solvents, the volumes may not be strictly additive, and a more complex calculation may be required.
