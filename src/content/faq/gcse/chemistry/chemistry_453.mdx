The theoretical yield of a gas produced in a chemical reaction can be calculated using stoichiometry along with the balanced chemical equation.

To begin, the first step in determining the theoretical yield of a gas is to write down the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. This equation illustrates the ratios of reactants to products, which are essential for calculating the theoretical yield.

Next, you must identify the amount of the limiting reactant present. The limiting reactant is the substance that will be entirely consumed during the reaction, and it dictates the maximum amount of product that can be generated. To find the limiting reactant, compare the quantities of each reactant you have with the amounts specified in the balanced equation.

After identifying the limiting reactant, you can apply stoichiometry to calculate the theoretical yield. Stoichiometry involves calculating the relationships between the quantities of reactants and products in a chemical reaction, based on the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed.

In stoichiometric calculations, the balanced chemical equation provides a conversion factor. This factor is derived from the ratio of the coefficients of the product and the limiting reactant in the balanced equation. By multiplying the amount of the limiting reactant by this conversion factor, you can determine the theoretical yield of the gas.

It's important to note that the theoretical yield represents the maximum possible amount of product that can be obtained from the limiting reactant. It is termed 'theoretical' because it assumes that the reaction proceeds to completion without any side reactions or losses. In practice, the actual yield is often lower than the theoretical yield due to factors such as incomplete reactions, side reactions, and losses during the recovery of the product.
