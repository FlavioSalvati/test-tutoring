A redox reaction is a chemical process in which oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously.

To elaborate, redox reactions—short for reduction-oxidation reactions—are fundamental types of chemical reactions that are prevalent across various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, biology, and physics. The term "redox" is derived from two key concepts: reduction and oxidation. These processes are intrinsically linked, which is why they are collectively referred to as "redox reactions."

**Oxidation** is defined as the loss of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion during a reaction. Conversely, **reduction** refers to the gain of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion. In simpler terms, a substance that undergoes oxidation loses electrons, while a substance that undergoes reduction gains electrons.

A useful mnemonic to remember this principle is the acronym **OIL RIG**, which stands for "Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain." This phrase highlights the movement of electrons that occurs during the reaction.

In the context of a redox reaction, the substance that loses electrons (and thus undergoes oxidation) is called the **reducing agent**, as it "donates" electrons to reduce the other substance. Conversely, the substance that gains electrons (and undergoes reduction) is referred to as the **oxidizing agent**, since it "accepts" electrons and oxidizes the other substance.

Redox reactions play a crucial role in a wide array of natural phenomena and technological applications. For example, they are integral to the processes of respiration in living organisms, photosynthesis in plants, the rusting of iron, and the operation of batteries. A solid understanding of redox reactions is essential for mastering many aspects of chemistry.
