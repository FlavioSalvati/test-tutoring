Catalysts play a crucial role in chemical reactions, particularly in reversible reactions, where they do not alter the position of equilibrium but rather accelerate the rate at which equilibrium is achieved.

In reversible reactions, catalysts enhance the rates of both the forward and reverse reactions equally. As a result, while the time taken to reach equilibrium is shortened, the actual position of the equilibrium remains unchanged. The equilibrium position is determined by the relative energies of the reactants and products, which are unaffected by the presence of a catalyst.

The mechanism by which a catalyst operates involves providing an alternative reaction pathway that has a lower activation energy. This reduction in activation energy allows a greater proportion of the reactant molecules to possess sufficient energy to undergo the reaction, thereby increasing the reaction rate. Importantly, because a catalyst influences both the forward and reverse reactions to the same extent, the ratio of concentrations of products and reactants at equilibrium stays constant.

To illustrate this, consider a simple reversible reaction in which reactants $A$ and $B$ form products $C$ and $D$. Without a catalyst, this reaction may proceed slowly, taking a significant amount of time to reach equilibrium. However, upon the introduction of a catalyst, the reaction reaches equilibrium more rapidly, yet the equilibrium concentrations of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ remain identical to those that would be achieved in the absence of the catalyst.

In summary, while a catalyst facilitates a reversible reaction by enabling it to reach equilibrium more swiftly, it does not alter the equilibrium position itself. This concept is essential in the study of chemical reactions, as it clarifies the rationale behind the widespread use of catalysts in industrial processes. They enable reactions to proceed efficiently, saving both time and energy, without influencing the ultimate outcome of the reaction.
