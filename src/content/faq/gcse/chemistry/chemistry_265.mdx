Agriculture plays a significant role in the production of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the release of methane and nitrous oxide.

The agricultural sector is a major contributor to two particularly potent greenhouse gases: methane and nitrous oxide. Methane is generated by livestock during digestion, specifically through a process known as enteric fermentation. Additionally, methane is released during the management of animal manure. In fact, livestock farming is responsible for approximately $44\%$ of all global methane emissions.

Nitrous oxide, on the other hand, is released from soils following the application of synthetic fertilizers and animal manure, both of which contain high levels of nitrogen. Soil bacteria break down this nitrogen, producing nitrous oxide as a by-product. Notably, nitrous oxide is around $300$ times more effective as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. It is estimated that agriculture is responsible for about $80\%$ of all global nitrous oxide emissions.

Moreover, agriculture also indirectly contributes to carbon dioxide emissions. This occurs through the use of fossil fuels in agricultural machinery and through deforestation aimed at expanding agricultural land. When forests are cleared, the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, thereby increasing carbon dioxide levels.

Rice cultivation is another significant source of methane emissions. When rice fields are flooded, anaerobic conditions develop, fostering the growth of microbes that produce methane.

In summary, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that agriculture, forestry, and other land use activities accounted for approximately $24\%$ of all greenhouse gas emissions in $2016$. This highlights the agricultural sector as a crucial area for potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
