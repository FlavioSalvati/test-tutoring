In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson made a groundbreaking discovery: he identified the electron through his experiments with cathode rays.

During the late 19th century, Thomson was exploring cathode rays, which are generated when an electric current passes through a gas at low pressure. These rays were detected on a fluorescent screen located at the end of the cathode ray tube. At the time, the scientific community was uncertain about the nature of these rays; some theorized they were waves of light, while others believed they consisted of streams of particles.

To clarify the nature of the rays, Thomson conducted further investigations. He applied an electric field to the cathode ray tube and observed that the rays were deflected toward the positive plate. This observation indicated that they carried a negative charge. Additionally, when he introduced a magnetic field, he found that the rays were also deflected, suggesting that they possessed mass.

From these experiments, Thomson concluded that the rays were composed of particles, which he initially referred to as "corpuscles." Today, these particles are known as electrons. He further calculated the charge-to-mass ratio of these electrons and discovered it was over a thousand times greater than that of a hydrogen ion, implying that electrons were significantly smaller and lighter than atoms.

Thomson's discovery was revolutionary, as it marked the first identification of a subatomic particle. This finding challenged the prevailing view of the atom as an indivisible entity and led to the development of the "plum pudding" model, where electrons were thought to be embedded within a positively charged "pudding." Although this model was eventually supplanted by the nuclear model of the atom, Thomson's identification of the electron remains a fundamental milestone in our understanding of atomic structure.
