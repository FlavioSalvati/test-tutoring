The efficiency of water purification methods is evaluated by comparing the concentration of impurities present in the water before and after the purification process.

To begin calculating this efficiency, you must first assess the amount of impurities in the water prior to purification. This assessment can be conducted using various testing techniques, such as chemical analysis, which can accurately identify and quantify a range of contaminants, including bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and organic compounds.

After obtaining this initial data, you can proceed with the water purification process. This process may involve techniques such as filtration, distillation, chlorination, or the application of ultraviolet light. Once the purification method has been applied, it is essential to test the water again to measure the remaining impurities.

The efficiency of the purification method is determined by subtracting the amount of impurities remaining after the process from the amount present before purification. This calculation yields the total quantity of impurities that were removed. To express this as a percentage, you divide the amount of impurities removed by the initial amount, and then multiply by $100$.

For instance, if you started with $100$ units of impurities and ended with $20$ units, you have successfully removed $80$ units. To calculate the efficiency, you would divide $80$ by $100$, giving you $0.8$, and subsequently multiply by $100$ to determine an efficiency of $80\%$.

It is important to recognize that different purification methods may vary in their effectiveness at removing specific types of impurities. Consequently, the most efficient purification method will depend on the particular contaminants present in the water.
