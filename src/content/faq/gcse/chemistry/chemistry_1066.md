Water quality is assessed for contaminants using a range of methods, including physical testing, chemical analysis, and biological examination.

**Physical Testing**  
Physical testing involves evaluating various characteristics of water, such as its temperature, color, odor, and turbidity. These attributes can provide important insights into the presence of specific contaminants. For instance, a noticeable change in color may indicate the presence of organic matter, metals, or algae. Turbidity, which refers to the cloudiness of water, can suggest the presence of suspended particles, bacteria, or viruses.

**Chemical Analysis**  
Chemical analysis plays a vital role in water testing by employing various techniques to detect and quantify the concentration of different chemical substances within the water. These substances may include heavy metals, pesticides, nitrates, phosphates, and other organic and inorganic compounds. The techniques utilized in chemical analysis can vary widely, ranging from simple colorimetric tests to more sophisticated methods such as spectrophotometry or chromatography.

**Biological Examination**  
Biological examination focuses on detecting and identifying microorganisms present in the water, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This type of analysis is crucial because these microorganisms can lead to illnesses if the water is consumed. Common techniques used in biological examinations include microscopy, culturing, and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

**Advanced Techniques**  
In addition to the aforementioned methods, advanced techniques such as mass spectrometry and atomic absorption spectroscopy are employed to detect specific contaminants at very low concentrations. These sophisticated methods are typically used in research settings or in scenarios where highly precise results are essential.

**Choosing the Right Method**  
It is important to note that the choice of testing method depends on the suspected contaminants. For example, if there is a suspicion of heavy metal contamination, chemical analysis would be the most suitable approach. Conversely, if bacterial contamination is a concern, conducting a biological examination would be the preferred method.
