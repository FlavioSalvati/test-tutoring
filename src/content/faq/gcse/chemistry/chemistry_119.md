To determine the limiting reactant in a chemical reaction involving gases, we can utilize the volumes of the reactants and compare their ratio to the stoichiometric ratio derived from the balanced chemical equation.

This approach is founded on Avogadro's law, which states that equal volumes of gases, when measured at the same temperature and pressure, contain an equal number of molecules. 

### Steps to Identify the Limiting Reactant

1. **Balance the Chemical Equation**: 
   First, you must balance the chemical equation for the reaction at hand. This process will yield the stoichiometric coefficients that represent the ratio of the reactants. For instance, in the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to produce water, the balanced equation is:

   $$ 
   2 \text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(g) 
   $$ 

   From this equation, we can see that the stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is $2:1$.

2. **Compare Volume Ratios**: 
   Next, you need to compare the ratio of the actual volumes of the reactants used in the reaction to the stoichiometric ratio obtained from the balanced equation. If the ratio of the volumes matches the stoichiometric ratio, then the reactants are present in the correct proportions and will completely react with one another. However, if the volume ratio diverges from the stoichiometric ratio, one of the reactants will be in excess, while the other will be the limiting reactant.

3. **Identify the Limiting Reactant**: 
   The limiting reactant is the one that is entirely consumed during the reaction. It dictates the maximum amount of product that can be formed. Once this reactant is depleted, the reaction will cease, even if there is still some quantity of the other reactant remaining. Therefore, by comparing the volumes of the reactants to their stoichiometric ratio, you can determine which reactant will be used up first, thus identifying the limiting reactant.

By following these steps, you can effectively ascertain the limiting reactant in any gaseous chemical reaction.
