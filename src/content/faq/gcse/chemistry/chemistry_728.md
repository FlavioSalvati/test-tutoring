The purpose of a titration curve is to determine the concentration of an unknown solution by plotting pH against volume of titrant added.

A titration curve is a graphical representation of a titration experiment, which is a common laboratory method in chemistry. The curve is created by plotting the pH of the solution being titrated against the volume of the titrant (the solution of known concentration) that has been added. This curve serves a crucial purpose in analytical chemistry as it allows us to determine the concentration of an unknown solution.

The titration curve typically has a characteristic 'S' shape, which is due to the logarithmic nature of the pH scale. The point at which the curve is most steep is known as the equivalence point. This is the point at which exactly enough titrant has been added to react completely with the substance being titrated. By knowing the volume of titrant added to reach this point, and the concentration of the titrant, we can calculate the concentration of the unknown solution using the principle of stoichiometry.

Furthermore, the titration curve can also provide information about the strength of the acid or base being titrated. For strong acids and bases, the pH change around the equivalence point is very sharp, whereas for weak acids and bases, the pH change is more gradual. This can help us to identify the nature of the unknown solution.

In summary, a titration curve is a powerful tool in analytical chemistry. It allows us to determine the concentration of an unknown solution, and provides information about the strength of the acid or base being titrated. It is a practical application of the principles of acid-base chemistry and stoichiometry.
