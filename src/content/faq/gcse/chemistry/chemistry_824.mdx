A **cell** is a fundamental unit that converts chemical energy into electrical energy, whereas a **battery** is composed of multiple cells.

To elaborate, a cell, also known as an electrochemical cell, serves as the basic building block of a battery. It is a device that effectively transforms stored chemical energy into electrical energy. A typical cell comprises two electrodes: the anode (negative electrode) and the cathode (positive electrode), along with an electrolyte that facilitates the movement of ions between the electrodes. When a device is connected to a cell, a chemical reaction occurs, resulting in the flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode, which generates an electric current.

In contrast, a battery is fundamentally a collection of one or more cells. Traditionally, the term “battery” referred specifically to a group of electrochemical cells connected in series. However, in contemporary usage, "battery" is often used to describe a single cell in everyday contexts. Batteries can consist of multiple cells arranged either in series (which increases the voltage), in parallel (which boosts the current), or a combination of both arrangements. This configuration enables batteries to deliver a greater amount of electrical energy compared to a single cell.

For instance, a common AA battery is essentially a single cell, while a car battery represents a true battery, as it contains multiple cells. The cells within a battery can be classified as either primary (non-rechargeable) or secondary (rechargeable).

In conclusion, although the terms "cell" and "battery" are frequently used interchangeably in everyday conversation, they have specific and distinct meanings in the realm of chemistry. A cell is a single unit that converts chemical energy into electrical energy, while a battery is an assembly of such cells.
