To calculate gas volumes using the combined gas law, you rearrange the formula 

$$ P_1 V_1 / T_1 = P_2 V_2 / T_2 $$ 

to solve for the unknown variable.

The combined gas law integrates Boyle's Law, Charles' Law, and Gay-Lussac's Law. It describes the relationship among the pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), and temperature ($T$) of a gas. The law asserts that the ratio of the product of pressure and volume to the temperature of a gas remains constant. In the formula, $P_1$, $V_1$, and $T_1$ represent the initial pressure, volume, and temperature, while $P_2$, $V_2$, and $T_2$ denote the final pressure, volume, and temperature.

To utilize the combined gas law for calculating gas volumes, you must first ensure that all your values are in the appropriate units. Pressure should be expressed in atmospheres (atm), volume in liters (L), and temperature in Kelvin (K). If your measurements are not in these units, conversion is necessary.

Next, identify the unknown variable in your problem. This could be the initial volume ($V_1$), final volume ($V_2$), initial pressure ($P_1$), final pressure ($P_2$), initial temperature ($T_1$), or final temperature ($T_2$). Once you have pinpointed the unknown, rearrange the formula to isolate it. For instance, if you need to determine the final volume ($V_2$), you would rearrange the equation to 

$$ V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{T_1 P_2}. $$

Finally, substitute the known values into the rearranged formula and solve for the unknown. This will provide you with the volume of the gas under the new conditions. Remember to keep your calculations organized and double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
