You are investigating the effect of surface area on reaction rates by conducting a series of experiments with reactant particles of varying sizes.

To explore how surface area impacts reaction rates, it is essential to perform experiments using the same reactant in different physical forms, such as a solid block, small chunks, and a fine powder. The goal is to maintain a constant mass of the reactant while altering its surface area.

For example, consider using calcium carbonate (commonly found in marble) reacting with hydrochloric acid. You can utilize a large piece of marble, smaller chunks, and marble powder, ensuring that each sample has the same mass. A fixed volume of hydrochloric acid should be added to each sample, and the time taken for the reaction to complete must be measured. This can be done by monitoring the duration until the effervescence (bubbling) ceases, indicating that all the calcium carbonate has reacted.

The rate of reaction can be quantified by dividing the amount of reactant consumed or the product formed by the time taken. In this case, you could measure the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced over time. A faster reaction—indicated by a shorter reaction time—correlates with a higher reaction rate.

You should expect the results to demonstrate that powdered marble reacts more quickly than small chunks, which in turn react faster than the large piece. This trend occurs because the powdered marble has a greater surface area exposed to the acid, facilitating more particle collisions that lead to reactions simultaneously. This illustrates that increasing the surface area of a reactant enhances the reaction rate.

Finally, it is crucial to prioritize safety during these experiments. Always wear safety goggles and lab coats, and handle acids with caution.
