The formula for calculating the change in energy is given by:

$$
\Delta E = q + w
$$

In this equation, $\Delta E$ denotes the change in energy of a system, $q$ represents the heat transferred into or out of the system, and $w$ signifies the work done on or by the system.

To elaborate, the equation $\Delta E = q + w$ is a fundamental principle in thermodynamics used to determine the energy change of a system. Here, $\Delta E$ indicates the total energy change, while $q$ and $w$ are the contributions from heat transfer and work, respectively.

It is crucial to observe the sign conventions for $q$ and $w$. If heat is added to the system or if work is performed on the system, both values are considered positive. Conversely, if heat is lost from the system or if the system does work on its surroundings, these values are negative.

For instance, consider a scenario where a system absorbs $20$ joules of heat from its surroundings, represented as $q = +20 \, \text{J}$, and simultaneously does $5$ joules of work on its surroundings, expressed as $w = -5 \, \text{J}$. The total energy change of the system can be calculated as follows:

$$
\Delta E = q + w = +20 \, \text{J} - 5 \, \text{J} = +15 \, \text{J}.
$$

This calculation indicates that the system has gained $15$ joules of energy.

In the context of chemical reactions, the energy change is frequently calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta H = \Delta U + P \Delta V,
$$

where $\Delta H$ represents the enthalpy change, $\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy, $P$ is the pressure, and $\Delta V$ is the change in volume. This equation is derived from the first law of thermodynamics and is applicable under conditions of constant pressure, which is common in many chemical reactions.

It is important to remember that energy conservation is a fundamental principle in these processes. Energy can be transferred between different forms (such as from heat to work or vice versa), but the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant. This principle is known as the law of conservation of energy.
