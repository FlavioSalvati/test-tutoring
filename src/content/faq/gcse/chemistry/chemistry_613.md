**Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** is a systematic method that evaluates the environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life, from "cradle to grave." This comprehensive approach encompasses various phases including raw material extraction, material processing, manufacturing, distribution, usage, repair and maintenance, as well as disposal or recycling.

When focusing on raw material extraction, the LCA examines the environmental consequences of obtaining the necessary raw materials for a product. Key factors analyzed include the energy consumed during extraction, the emissions generated, and the effects on local ecosystems.

For instance, consider a company that produces a plastic product. The LCA would evaluate the environmental impact of extracting crude oil, which is the primary raw material for plastic production. This assessment would take into account the energy expended in drilling operations, the emissions produced during the drilling process, and the potential risk of oil spills that could adversely affect local wildlife.

Moreover, the LCA also addresses the environmental impact of transporting raw materials from the extraction site to the processing facility. This transport phase includes considerations such as the fuel consumed during transit and the emissions released as a result.

Another crucial aspect of the LCA is the assessment of resource depletion. If a raw material is being extracted at a rate that exceeds its natural replenishment, this scenario is classified as unsustainable, and it is duly reflected in the LCA results.

By evaluating all these factors, the LCA provides a holistic view of the environmental impact stemming from raw material extraction. The insights gained from this analysis can be instrumental in identifying opportunities for improvement and guiding more sustainable decision-making in the production process.
