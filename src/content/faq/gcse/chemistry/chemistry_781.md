Electrolysis is a process that utilizes electric current to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction.

The topic of electrolysis is particularly intriguing within the field of chemistry. It involves passing an electric current through a substance to induce a chemical change. This substance, known as an electrolyte, can exist as either a free-flowing liquid or in a molten state, which allows ions to move freely. The chemical transformation occurs as ions either gain or lose electrons, a process referred to as oxidation and reduction, respectively, leading to the formation of new substances.

The electrolysis process is conducted in a device called an electrolytic cell. This cell comprises two electrodes: the anode and the cathode, both of which are connected to a power supply. The anode serves as the positive electrode where oxidation takes place, while the cathode is the negative electrode where reduction occurs. When the power supply is activated, ions within the electrolyte begin to migrate towards the electrodes. Positive ions move towards the cathode, where they gain electrons, while negative ions travel towards the anode, where they lose electrons. This movement of ions generates the electric current.

Electrolysis has numerous applications across various industries. It is employed in processes such as electroplating, which involves depositing a thin layer of metal onto a surface, as well as in the extraction of certain metals from their ores. Additionally, electrolysis plays a vital role in the production of chemicals and the purification of specific materials. For instance, the electrolysis of brine—a solution of salt in water—yields chlorine gas, hydrogen gas, and sodium hydroxide.

A solid understanding of electrolysis is essential for GCSE Chemistry, as it underpins many chemical reactions and industrial processes. It serves as a practical illustration of how electric energy can be converted into chemical energy, and vice versa.
