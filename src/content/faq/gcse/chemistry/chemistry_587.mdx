Greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, play a significant role in ocean acidification by dissolving in seawater and forming carbonic acid.

Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), and nitrous oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$), are emitted into the atmosphere primarily through human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to an increase in the Earth's temperature, a phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. However, the consequences of these gases extend well beyond the atmospheric realm.

It is estimated that approximately one-third of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere is absorbed by the world's oceans. When $\text{CO}_2$ dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) to form carbonic acid ($\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$), which is a weak acid. This process is referred to as ocean acidification. Subsequently, carbonic acid dissociates into hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) and bicarbonate ions ($\text{HCO}_3^-$). The increase in hydrogen ions results in a decrease in the pH of the ocean, making it more acidic.

The heightened acidity of the ocean poses significant threats to marine life, particularly to organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for building their shells or skeletons, such as corals, mollusks, and certain types of plankton. The excess hydrogen ions in the water react with carbonate ions ($\text{CO}_3^{2-}$) to produce additional bicarbonate ions, thereby diminishing the availability of carbonate ions that these organisms need for shell and skeleton formation. This reduction can lead to thinner shells and slower growth rates, rendering these organisms more susceptible to predation and disease.

In summary, greenhouse gases significantly contribute to ocean acidification by elevating the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This $\text{CO}_2$ dissolves in seawater, forming carbonic acid and increasing the ocean's acidity, which can have detrimental effects on marine ecosystems.
