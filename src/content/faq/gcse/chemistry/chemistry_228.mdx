The purity of a substance can be assessed through various analytical methods, including melting point analysis, boiling point analysis, and chromatography.

Purity refers to the concentration of a single chemical compound or element within a sample. A higher purity indicates that the substance exhibits more consistent physical and chemical properties. Different techniques exist to evaluate purity, each with its unique advantages and limitations.

One widely used method is melting point analysis. Pure substances exhibit a precise melting point, while the presence of impurities typically lowers and broadens this melting range. By comparing the observed melting point of a sample to the known melting point of the pure substance, one can estimate the level of impurities. However, this method may not always be reliable since certain impurities do not significantly alter the melting point.

Another approach is boiling point analysis. Like melting point analysis, pure substances have specific boiling points. Impurities generally raise the boiling point and broaden the boiling range. By comparing the observed boiling point with the established boiling point of the pure substance, one can infer the extent of impurity.

Chromatography is a more advanced technique used to determine the purity of a substance. This method separates the components of a mixture based on their differing affinities for a stationary phase and a mobile phase. The resulting chromatogram can identify the components present in the mixture and their relative proportions, thereby providing a measure of the substance's purity.

In summary, determining the purity of a substance involves comparing its physical and chemical properties to those of a known pure sample. The methods employed can vary from straightforward melting or boiling point analyses to more intricate techniques like chromatography.
