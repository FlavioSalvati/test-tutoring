Alkenes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by their colorless and odorless nature. They are less dense than water and insoluble in it, yet they readily dissolve in organic solvents.

As unsaturated hydrocarbons, alkenes consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms, with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. This double bond is fundamental to their unique properties and chemical reactivity.

In terms of physical state, alkenes can exist as colorless gases, liquids, or low-melting-point solids, depending on the molecular size. They generally lack an odor unless modified by the addition of odorous substituents. Their lower density compared to water allows them to float on its surface, a crucial consideration during environmental incidents such as hydrocarbon spills, where they can spread across water bodies.

Alkenes are insoluble in water due to their non-polar characteristics. Water, being a polar molecule, dissolves other polar substances due to the principle of 'like dissolves like.' Consequently, non-polar substances, such as alkenes, dissolve in non-polar organic solvents like ether or chloroform.

The physical properties of alkenes are influenced by the length of their carbon chains and the presence of functional groups. For instance, as the carbon chain length increases, so does the boiling point of the alkene. This increase is attributed to a greater number of electrons, which enhances the strength of London dispersion forces—one of the types of intermolecular forces—between the molecules.

In summary, alkenes are colorless, odorless hydrocarbons that are less dense than water and insoluble in it. Their physical properties, including their state at room temperature and solubility, are determined by molecular size and the presence of functional groups.
