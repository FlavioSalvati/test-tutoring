The precipitate formed when chloride ions react with silver nitrate is silver chloride.

When a solution of silver nitrate ($\text{AgNO}_3$) is combined with a solution containing chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$), a chemical reaction occurs. This reaction is classified as a double displacement reaction, or more specifically, a precipitation reaction. During this process, the silver ions ($\text{Ag}^+$) from the silver nitrate solution interact with the chloride ions from the other solution to produce a new compound, silver chloride ($\text{AgCl}$).

Silver chloride is an insoluble compound, meaning it does not dissolve in water. Instead, it forms a solid that separates from the solution, which we refer to as a precipitate. The appearance of a precipitate is often a visual indicator that a chemical reaction has occurred. In this case, the silver chloride precipitate is characterized by its white color.

The chemical equation representing this reaction is:

$$
\text{AgNO}_3(aq) + \text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s) + \text{NO}_3^-(aq).
$$

In this equation, the notation $(aq)$ signifies that the substances are dissolved in water (aqueous), while the notation $(s)$ indicates that the substance is a solid. Notably, the nitrate ions ($\text{NO}_3^-$) do not participate in precipitate formation and remain dissolved in the solution.

This reaction is frequently employed in chemistry to detect the presence of chloride ions. If a solution becomes cloudy upon the addition of silver nitrate, it indicates that chloride ions are present. The cloudiness arises from the formation of the silver chloride precipitate, providing a simple and effective method for identifying chloride ions in a solution.
