A glowing splint relights in oxygen due to the fact that oxygen supports combustion, creating the essential conditions for fire to reignite.

When a glowing splint is introduced into a test tube filled with oxygen, it relights. This phenomenon occurs because oxygen is a key supporter of combustion. Combustion is a chemical reaction that generates both heat and light, involving a substance—here, the splint—reacting with oxygen.

The glowing splint test is a straightforward yet effective method to demonstrate the presence of oxygen. Initially, when a splint is ignited and then extinguished, it continues to glow. If this glowing splint is subsequently placed into a test tube containing oxygen, it will relight. This occurs because the oxygen in the test tube provides the necessary conditions for the splint to reignite.

Oxygen plays a crucial role in the fire triangle, a model that illustrates the essential components required for a fire to exist. The fire triangle indicates that three elements are necessary for combustion: heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent (typically oxygen). In this scenario, the glowing splint supplies the heat and the fuel, while the oxygen in the test tube serves as the oxidizing agent.

When the glowing splint, which is already heated and capable of catching fire, is placed into the oxygen-rich environment, it relights. This is because the presence of oxygen enables the combustion reaction to persist, causing the splint to reignite. This reaction will continue until either the fuel (the splint) is consumed or the supply of oxygen is depleted.

In conclusion, a glowing splint relights in oxygen because oxygen supports combustion. It provides the necessary conditions for the splint to reignite, effectively illustrating the vital role of oxygen in the fire triangle.
