When additional reactant is introduced to a system at equilibrium, the equilibrium shifts to the right, favoring the forward reaction.

In the context of a chemical reaction, equilibrium refers to a state where the concentrations of both reactants and products remain constant over time. This state is achieved when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. The behavior of systems at equilibrium is explained by Le Chatelier's Principle, which asserts that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing conditions, the system will adjust in a way that counteracts the disturbance.

When you increase the concentration of a reactant, the system responds by attempting to lower that concentration. According to Le Chatelier's Principle, this is accomplished by shifting the equilibrium to the right, thereby favoring the forward reaction. As a result, more of the reactants are converted into products until a new equilibrium is reached.

For instance, consider the reversible reaction:

$$
\text{A} + \text{B} \rightleftharpoons \text{C} + \text{D}
$$

If you add more of reactant A, the system will adjust by shifting the equilibrium to the right, which leads to the conversion of additional A and B into C and D. This process will continue until the concentrations of A and B return to their original levels, at which point a new equilibrium is established.

It is essential to understand that while the position of equilibrium may shift, the equilibrium constant for the reaction remains unchanged. The equilibrium constant is determined by the relative energies of the reactants and products, which are unaffected by changes in their concentrations.

In summary, adding more reactant to a system at equilibrium causes the system to shift to the right, favoring the forward reaction, in order to restore equilibrium. This behavior exemplifies Le Chatelier's Principle, a fundamental concept in the study of chemical equilibria.
