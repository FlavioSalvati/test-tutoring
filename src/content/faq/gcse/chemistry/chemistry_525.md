Alcohols are named according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature by modifying the name of the corresponding alkane. Specifically, the final 'e' in the alkane name is replaced with 'ol'.

In the IUPAC system, the first step in naming an alcohol is to identify the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the hydroxyl group (-OH). This carbon chain is named as you would name an alkane, with the modification of replacing the final 'e' with 'ol'. For instance, a three-carbon chain featuring a hydroxyl group is termed 'propanol', which is derived from 'propane'.

To specify the location of the hydroxyl group on the carbon chain, a number is assigned. The carbon atoms are numbered starting from the end of the chain that is closest to the hydroxyl group. For example, if the hydroxyl group is situated on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain, the compound is named '2-propanol'. If no number is specified, it is generally understood that the hydroxyl group is located on the first carbon atom.

When multiple hydroxyl groups are present, the suffixes 'diol', 'triol', etc., are employed, and the position of each hydroxyl group is indicated by a number. For instance, a three-carbon chain with hydroxyl groups on the first and second carbon atoms is named '1,2-propanediol'.

In cases where the alcohol is not the highest priority functional group, it is designated as a substituent by using the prefix 'hydroxy-'. For example, in a compound that contains both an alcohol and a carboxylic acid functional group, the carboxylic acid takes precedence, and the alcohol is named as a substituent, such as 'hydroxypropanoic acid'.

It is essential to remember that the IUPAC system is designed to offer a clear and consistent method for naming chemical compounds, ensuring that each compound has a unique and universally recognized name.
