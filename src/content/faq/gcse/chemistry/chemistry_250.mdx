The addition of barium chloride to a solution containing sulfate ions results in the formation of a white precipitate of barium sulfate.

When barium chloride, represented as $\text{BaCl}_2$, is introduced to a solution that contains sulfate ions, denoted as $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$, a chemical reaction takes place. This reaction is classified as a precipitation reaction, where a solid, known as a precipitate, is produced from a solution. In this instance, the precipitate formed is barium sulfate ($\text{BaSO}_4$), which appears as a white solid.

The chemical equation describing this reaction is:

$$
\text{BaCl}_2 (aq) + \text{SO}_4^{2-} (aq) \rightarrow \text{BaSO}_4 (s) + 2\text{Cl}^- (aq)
$$

In this equation, the notation $(aq)$ indicates that the substances are in aqueous solution (dissolved in water), while the notation $(s)$ signifies that a solid is formed. The arrow signifies the direction of the reaction, indicating the transformation from reactants to products.

The appearance of the white precipitate of barium sulfate serves as a crucial visual indicator of the presence of sulfate ions in the solution. This reaction is often utilized in analytical chemistry as a test for sulfates, commonly referred to as the barium chloride test. The formation of the white precipitate confirms the presence of sulfate ions in the solution.

Additionally, the reaction between barium chloride and sulfate ions exemplifies a double displacement reaction, also known as a metathesis reaction. In this type of reaction, the cations and anions of two different compounds exchange partners to create two new compounds. Specifically, the barium cation ($\text{Ba}^{2+}$) from barium chloride combines with the sulfate anion ($\text{SO}_4^{2-}$) from the solution to produce barium sulfate, while the chloride anions ($\text{Cl}^-$) remain dissolved in the solution.
