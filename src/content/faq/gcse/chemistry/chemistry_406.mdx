The theoretical yield represents the maximum amount of product that can be produced from a specified quantity of reactant in a chemical reaction. This yield is determined using the balanced chemical equation, which provides essential information about the stoichiometric ratios between reactants and products. The stoichiometric ratio refers to the coefficients of the reactants and products in the balanced equation.

To calculate the theoretical yield, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Limiting Reactant:** The limiting reactant is the substance that is entirely consumed during the reaction, thereby dictating the maximum quantity of product that can be produced. To identify the limiting reactant, compare the available quantities of each reactant with the amounts required according to the stoichiometric ratios from the balanced equation.

2. **Calculate Moles of Product:** Once the limiting reactant is identified, the theoretical yield can be calculated by multiplying the number of moles of the limiting reactant by the stoichiometric ratio between the limiting reactant and the desired product. This calculation yields the number of moles of product that can potentially be formed.

3. **Convert to Mass:** To obtain the mass of the product, multiply the number of moles of the product by its molar mass. The molar mass, which can be found on the periodic table, represents the mass of one mole of the substance.

The formula for calculating the theoretical yield can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Theoretical Yield} = \text{Moles of Limiting Reactant} \times \text{Stoichiometric Ratio} \times \text{Molar Mass of Product}
$$

It's important to note that the theoretical yield signifies the highest possible amount of product that can be formed under ideal conditions. In practical scenarios, the actual yield is often lower due to factors such as side reactions, incomplete reactions, or loss of product during purification processes.
