The primary gases in Earth's early atmosphere included methane, ammonia, water vapor, and carbon dioxide.

Earth's early atmosphere, often referred to as the "primordial atmosphere," was vastly different from the one we experience today. It was predominantly composed of the following gases: methane ($\text{CH}_4$), ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), water vapor ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$). Notably, there was virtually no oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) present during this period.

These gases were likely emitted through volcanic activity, a process known as "outgassing." During its formation, Earth was extremely hot and volatile, with frequent volcanic eruptions significantly influencing the composition of the atmosphere. Methane and ammonia were abundant, both of which are greenhouse gases. This means they effectively trap heat from the Sun, contributing to the high surface temperatures of early Earth.

Water vapor was another crucial component of the early atmosphere. As Earth began to cool, this water vapor condensed to form the oceans, thereby reducing the amount of water vapor remaining in the atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide also constituted a major part of the primordial atmosphere. Over time, however, it was gradually removed through a process called "weathering." This process involves the reaction of carbon dioxide with rocks, resulting in the formation of carbonate minerals, which are eventually washed into the oceans.

It is essential to understand that the early atmosphere was not static; it evolved over billions of years. The emergence of life, particularly photosynthetic organisms, played a pivotal role in increasing oxygen levels, marking a period known as the "Great Oxygenation Event." This event transformed Earth's atmosphere into the oxygen-rich environment we recognize today. However, this transition was gradual and took billions of years, with the early atmosphere remaining dominated by methane, ammonia, water vapor, and carbon dioxide for a significant portion of Earth's history.
