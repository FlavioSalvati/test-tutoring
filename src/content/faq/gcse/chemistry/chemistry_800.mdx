To analyze the results from the temperature change experiment, you will compare the initial and final temperatures to determine the change.

The first step in this analysis is to accurately record the initial temperature before the reaction or process begins. This measurement serves as your baseline. Next, you will record the final temperature once the reaction or process has concluded. The change in temperature is calculated by finding the difference between these two values.

To compute the temperature change, subtract the initial temperature from the final temperature using the formula:

$$
\Delta T = T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial}}
$$

If the final temperature is higher than the initial temperature, the resulting temperature change, $\Delta T$, will be positive, indicating that the reaction or process is exothermic (it releases heat). Conversely, if the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, $\Delta T$ will be negative, signifying that the reaction or process is endothermic (it absorbs heat).

Once you have determined the temperature change, you can use this information to draw conclusions about the reaction or process. For instance, if you are examining the influence of different catalysts on the reaction rate, a larger temperature change might indicate that a specific catalyst enhances the reaction rate.

It's also crucial to consider potential sources of error in your experiment. For example, heat loss to the surroundings could skew your measurements. To improve the reliability of your results, consider repeating the experiment multiple times and calculating an average temperature change.

Finally, present your findings in a clear and organized manner. This could be in the form of a table, a graph, or a written report. Be sure to include all relevant information, such as the initial and final temperatures, the calculated temperature change, and any observations made during the experiment.
