Paper chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures into their individual components. The process begins by placing a small spot of the solution or sample on a strip of absorbent paper, such as filter paper, near the bottom of the sheet. This spot is positioned on a line known as the baseline. The paper is then placed in a container containing a shallow layer of an appropriate solvent, such as ethanol or water, ensuring that the baseline remains above the solvent level.

As the solvent moves up the paper, it carries the components of the mixture with it. The rate at which different components travel varies based on their solubility in the solvent and their affinity for the paper. This differential movement causes the components to spread out at varying distances from the baseline, effectively achieving separation.

When the solvent approaches the top of the paper, the paper is removed from the container and allowed to dry. At this point, the individual components will have migrated different distances up the paper. These distances can be compared to those of known substances under identical conditions to identify the components present in the original mixture.

In instances where the components are colorless and not easily visible, a locating agent may be employed. This chemical interacts with the components to produce a colored product, thereby making the spots visible on the paper.

In summary, paper chromatography is a straightforward yet effective method for separating and identifying the components of mixtures.
