The positive outcome of a carbon dioxide test is indicated by the formation of a white precipitate, which confirms the presence of carbon dioxide.

In this test, a solution of calcium hydroxide—commonly referred to as limewater—is utilized. When carbon dioxide gas is introduced into limewater, it reacts with the calcium hydroxide to produce calcium carbonate, which appears as a white precipitate. This reaction serves as the positive indication of carbon dioxide's presence.

The chemical reaction can be expressed as follows:

$$
\text{CO}_2 \, (g) + \text{Ca(OH)}_2 \, (aq) \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3 \, (s) + \text{H}_2\text{O} \, (l)
$$

In this equation, $\text{CO}_2$ denotes carbon dioxide, $\text{Ca(OH)}_2$ represents calcium hydroxide, $\text{CaCO}_3$ is calcium carbonate (the white precipitate), and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ signifies water. The symbols indicate the physical states: $(g)$ for gas, $(aq)$ for aqueous solution, $(s)$ for solid, and $(l)$ for liquid.

This test is a straightforward and effective method for confirming the presence of carbon dioxide in a gas sample. However, it is crucial to be aware that if an excessive amount of carbon dioxide is bubbled through the limewater, it can dissolve the calcium carbonate, leading to a clear solution. This occurs because the surplus carbon dioxide reacts with calcium carbonate to form calcium hydrogen carbonate, which is soluble in water.

The reaction for this process can be represented as:

$$
\text{CaCO}_3 \, (s) + \text{CO}_2 \, (g) + \text{H}_2\text{O} \, (l) \rightarrow \text{Ca(HCO}_3)_2 \, (aq)
$$

Therefore, when conducting this test, it is essential to avoid introducing too much carbon dioxide into the limewater; otherwise, you may obtain a negative result even in the presence of carbon dioxide.
