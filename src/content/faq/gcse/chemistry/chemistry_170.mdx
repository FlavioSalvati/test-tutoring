The formula for calculating reaction rates is given by the equation:

$$
\text{Rate} = k[A]^x[B]^y
$$

In this formula, $k$ represents the rate constant, while $x$ and $y$ denote the orders of reaction with respect to the reactants A and B, respectively.

To elaborate further, the rate of a chemical reaction is quantified using the rate equation, which is typically expressed as:

$$
\text{Rate} = k[A]^x[B]^y
$$

In this equation, 'Rate' indicates the speed at which the reaction occurs, '$k$' is the rate constant, and '$[A]$' and '$[B]$' symbolize the concentrations of the reactants. The variables '$x$' and '$y$' are the orders of reaction corresponding to reactants A and B.

The rate constant '$k$' is a specific proportionality constant that varies for each reaction and is dependent on the temperature at which the reaction occurs. It can be determined through experimental methods. The orders of reaction '$x$' and '$y$' are generally small whole numbers (0, 1, or 2), which indicate how the reaction rate is influenced by the concentrations of the reactants. 

For instance, if $x = 1$, the reaction is classified as first order with respect to reactant A, meaning that the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of A. Conversely, if $x = 2$, the reaction is second order with respect to A, indicating that the reaction rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of A.

The overall order of the reaction is the sum of the individual orders, expressed as $(x + y)$. This overall order provides insight into how the reaction rate changes when the concentrations of all reactants are modified. For example, if the overall order of the reaction is 2, then doubling the concentrations of all reactants will result in a quadrupling of the reaction rate.

It is important to note that the rate equation and the orders of reaction cannot be deduced directly from the balanced chemical equation. Instead, they must be determined experimentally.
