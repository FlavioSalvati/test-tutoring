Alkenes and alkanes are both classes of hydrocarbons, which are compounds composed entirely of hydrogen and carbon atoms. However, they differ fundamentally in their bonding structures. 

Alkanes are characterized by having only single carbon-carbon bonds, which qualifies them as 'saturated' hydrocarbons. This saturation means that alkanes can accommodate the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible for a given number of carbon atoms. For example, the alkane with three carbon atoms, propane, has the molecular formula $C_3H_8$.

In contrast, alkenes contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, making them 'unsaturated' hydrocarbons. The presence of this double bond reduces the number of hydrogen atoms that can be attached to the carbon skeleton compared to an alkane with the same number of carbon atoms. For instance, the simplest alkene, ethene, has the formula $C_2H_4$, which is fewer hydrogen atoms than ethane ($C_2H_6$).

The double bond in alkenes significantly alters both their chemical reactivity and physical properties. Alkenes tend to be more reactive than their alkane counterparts due to the presence of the double bond, which can readily break and form new bonds with other atoms or molecules. This reactivity is harnessed in various chemical reactions, including addition reactions where new atoms or groups can be added across the double bond.

Additionally, the geometry around the double bond affects the shape of alkenes. Alkenes are planar at the double bond, meaning that the atoms attached to the carbon atoms involved in the double bond lie in the same plane. This contrasts with alkanes, which allow for free rotation around their single bonds, resulting in a more flexible, three-dimensional structure.

In summary, while both alkenes and alkanes are hydrocarbons, the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes introduces notable differences in their structure, chemical reactivity, and physical properties.
