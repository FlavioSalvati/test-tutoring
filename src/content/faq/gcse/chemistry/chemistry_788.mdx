To determine the products formed at each electrode during electrolysis, it's essential to identify the ions present in the electrolyte and refer to the reactivity series.

In an electrolysis process, the products generated at the electrodes depend on the ions present in the electrolyte and their respective reactivity. The electrolyte can be either a molten ionic compound or an aqueous solution, and it is the substance being electrolyzed. The electrodes are the components of the electrolysis apparatus where electricity enters or exits the electrolyte.

At the cathode (the negative electrode), positive ions undergo reduction by gaining electrons to form neutral atoms. If the electrolyte is a molten ionic compound, the metal ions will be reduced at the cathode. For instance, in the case of molten lead bromide, lead ions ($\text{Pb}^{2+}$) will gain electrons to produce lead atoms ($\text{Pb}$):

$$
\text{Pb}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Pb}
$$

In contrast, if the electrolyte is an aqueous solution, hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) from water may compete with metal ions for electrons. Here, the reactivity series plays a crucial role. If the metal is less reactive than hydrogen (for example, copper), the metal ions will be reduced. Conversely, if the metal is more reactive than hydrogen (such as potassium), hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) will be released instead.

At the anode (the positive electrode), negative ions undergo oxidation by losing electrons to form neutral atoms or molecules. In the case of a molten ionic compound, non-metal ions are oxidized at the anode. For example, in molten lead bromide, bromide ions ($\text{Br}^-$) will lose electrons, resulting in the formation of bromine molecules ($\text{Br}_2$):

$$
2\text{Br}^- \rightarrow \text{Br}_2 + 2e^-
$$

When dealing with an aqueous solution, hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) from water may compete with non-metal ions for electrons. If the ion is a halide (such as chloride, $\text{Cl}^-$), it will be oxidized to produce a halogen (like chlorine gas, $\text{Cl}_2$). However, if the ion is not a halide (for example, sulfate, $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$), oxygen gas ($\text{O}_2$) will be produced instead.

It is important to note that the specific products formed at each electrode can vary based on the type of electrolyte and the conditions under which electrolysis takes place.
