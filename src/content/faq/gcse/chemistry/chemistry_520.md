Alkenes and alkanes are both categories of hydrocarbons, which are compounds composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The key distinction between them lies in their bonding structure: alkenes contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, whereas alkanes consist solely of single bonds between carbon atoms. This fundamental difference categorizes alkenes as unsaturated hydrocarbons and alkanes as saturated hydrocarbons.

### Structure and General Formulas

Alkanes, characterized by their single carbon-carbon bonds, follow the general formula:

$$
\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n+2}
$$

where $n$ represents the number of carbon atoms. This configuration contributes to a relatively stable and unreactive nature, making alkanes generally less reactive than alkenes.

In contrast, alkenes possess at least one carbon-carbon double bond, which results in their classification as unsaturated hydrocarbons. The presence of this double bond not only enhances the reactivity of alkenes but also alters their general formula to:

$$
\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}
$$

### Isomerism in Alkenes

The carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes allows for the phenomenon of isomerism. Isomers are molecules that share the same molecular formula but differ in their structural arrangements. For example, butene can exist as two distinct isomers: 1-butene, where the double bond is located at the end of the carbon chain, and 2-butene, where the double bond is positioned between the second and third carbon atoms.

### Physical Properties

Both alkenes and alkanes are generally colorless and can exist in various states, including gases, liquids, or low-melting-point solids. A notable difference in their physical properties is that alkenes typically have slightly higher boiling points compared to alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms. This is attributed to the presence of the double bond, which affects their intermolecular interactions.

### Chemical Reactions

When it comes to chemical reactivity, alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the existence of the carbon-carbon double bond. Alkenes readily undergo addition reactions, in which the double bond breaks and new atoms are incorporated into the carbon framework. Conversely, alkanes tend to participate in substitution reactions, where one atom or group of atoms is replaced by another, reflecting their lower reactivity.

In summary, the differences in bonding structure between alkenes and alkanes lead to variations in their chemical behavior, physical properties, and the types of reactions they undergo.
