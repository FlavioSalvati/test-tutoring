Human activities have profoundly influenced the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a marked increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and methane ($\text{CH}_4$).

The most significant alteration to the atmosphere has been the rise in greenhouse gas concentrations, driven by various human actions such as the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities.

The combustion of fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, and natural gas—used for energy production and transportation is the primary contributor to the increased levels of $\text{CO}_2$ in the atmosphere. When these fuels are burned, they release $\text{CO}_2$ as a byproduct. As a result, atmospheric $\text{CO}_2$ concentrations have risen dramatically, from approximately $280$ parts per million (ppm) during pre-industrial times to over $400$ ppm today.

Deforestation also plays a significant role in elevating $\text{CO}_2$ levels. Trees act as carbon sinks by absorbing $\text{CO}_2$ from the atmosphere and storing it in their biomass. When forests are cleared, and the wood is either burned or allowed to decompose, the stored $\text{CO}_2$ is released back into the atmosphere. This process not only contributes additional $\text{CO}_2$ emissions but also diminishes the number of trees available to absorb $\text{CO}_2$, resulting in a compounded negative effect.

Industrial processes, such as cement production and certain steel manufacturing methods, also contribute to $\text{CO}_2$ emissions. Furthermore, the extraction and refinement of fossil fuels can lead to the release of methane, a greenhouse gas that is significantly more potent than $\text{CO}_2$. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, is another major source of methane emissions.

In conclusion, human activities have historically altered the atmospheric composition by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. This has been primarily driven by the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes. These changes have serious implications for the Earth's climate, as greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change.
