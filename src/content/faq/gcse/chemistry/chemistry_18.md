Metals and non-metals exhibit distinct differences in chemical reactivity, primarily influenced by their respective tendencies to lose or gain electrons during chemical reactions.

Metals are typically more reactive than non-metals because they tend to lose electrons to form positive ions, a process known as oxidation. This propensity arises from the atomic structure of metals. They possess relatively few electrons in their outermost shell, making it easier for them to lose these electrons. The reactivity of a metal is largely determined by how readily it can shed its outermost electrons to form positive ions. For instance, alkali metals such as sodium ($Na$) and potassium ($K$) are highly reactive due to having only one electron in their outermost shell, which can be easily lost.

Conversely, non-metals are generally less reactive because they tend to gain electrons to form negative ions, a process referred to as reduction. Non-metals have more electrons in their outermost shell and are closer to achieving a stable electron configuration. The reactivity of a non-metal is influenced by its ability to gain electrons to attain this stable state. For example, halogens like fluorine ($F$) and chlorine ($Cl$) are very reactive non-metals because they require only one additional electron to complete their outer shell and achieve stability.

It is important to recognize that the reactivity of both metals and non-metals can be affected by various external factors, such as the presence of water or oxygen, as well as temperature and pressure conditions. For example, iron ($Fe$) reacts slowly with oxygen ($O_2$) in the air to form rust; however, this reaction can be accelerated by increasing the temperature or the concentration of oxygen.

In summary, the chemical reactivity of metals and non-metals is fundamentally determined by their atomic structures and the relative ease with which they can lose or gain electrons. Metals are generally more reactive due to their tendency to lose electrons, while non-metals are typically less reactive because they prefer to gain electrons.
