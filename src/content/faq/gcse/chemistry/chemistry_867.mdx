A catalyst is a substance that enhances the rate of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy, but it does not alter the position of the equilibrium. Specifically, a catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway that has a lower energy barrier for both the forward and reverse reactions, resulting in an equal increase in the rates of these reactions. Consequently, the position of equilibrium—the state at which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are balanced—remains unchanged.

The function of a catalyst is often misunderstood. It does not modify the concentrations of reactants or products at equilibrium, nor does it shift the equilibrium position to the left or right. Instead, it facilitates a quicker attainment of equilibrium. This characteristic is particularly advantageous in industrial processes, where time efficiency is paramount.

Importantly, a catalyst is not consumed during the reaction; it can be reused multiple times without being depleted. This property further explains why a catalyst does not affect the equilibrium position, as it does not alter the overall amounts of reactants or products present.

In summary, while a catalyst is vital for accelerating chemical reactions, it does not influence the position of equilibrium. It merely enables the system to achieve equilibrium more swiftly, which can be extremely beneficial in both laboratory and industrial contexts.
