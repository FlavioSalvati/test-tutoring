Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) views product disposal as the concluding phase of a product's life cycle.

In an LCA, the disposal stage is a vital element of the overall analysis. This phase encompasses the end-of-life treatment of the product, which may involve various methods such as recycling, landfilling, incineration, or composting. The LCA evaluates the environmental impacts associated with each of these disposal strategies.

For example, when a product is sent to a landfill, the LCA assesses the emissions generated during its decomposition. It also considers the risk of leachate—liquid that has percolated through the solid waste and extracted some of its constituents—contaminating groundwater. In cases where the product is incinerated, the analysis includes the emissions produced during combustion, such as greenhouse gases and other pollutants.

If the product undergoes recycling, the LCA takes into account the energy and resources necessary for the recycling process. It also evaluates the environmental advantages of minimizing the need for new material production. Furthermore, the LCA considers the potential for the recycled materials to be utilized in creating new products, thereby decreasing the demand for virgin resources.

Additionally, the assessment examines the transportation needed to deliver the product to its disposal site, as well as the associated environmental impacts. This includes the emissions generated by the vehicles used for transport and the ecological effects of the fuel consumed by these vehicles.

In conclusion, the product disposal stage of an LCA involves a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impacts related to the end-of-life treatment of the product. This analysis encompasses the effects of various disposal methods, the transportation required for disposal, and the opportunities for recycling and reusing materials in the production of new products.
