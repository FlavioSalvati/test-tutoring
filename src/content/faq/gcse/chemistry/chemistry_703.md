Atom economy is a key metric that assesses the proportion of starting materials that are transformed into useful products during a chemical reaction.

More specifically, atom economy is a concept rooted in green chemistry that measures the efficiency of a chemical process. It is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Atom Economy} = \left( \frac{\text{Molecular mass of desired products}}{\text{Molecular mass of all products}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

This calculation yields a percentage, with a higher atom economy indicating less waste production, thereby enhancing the environmental sustainability of the reaction.

To illustrate, consider a reaction where a single reactant completely converts into a single product. In this case, the atom economy would be $100\%$. Conversely, if a reaction involves multiple reactants or generates several products—some of which may be non-useful—the atom economy will be less than $100\%$.

Understanding atom economy is vital for promoting sustainable chemistry practices. It encourages chemists to design reactions that maximize the conversion of reactants into valuable products while minimizing waste. This approach not only benefits the environment but also proves to be more economical, as it reduces expenses associated with unused reactants and waste management.

Additionally, atom economy can serve as a predictive tool for assessing the yield of a reaction. Generally, a reaction characterized by a high atom economy is expected to yield a substantial amount of the desired product since a greater fraction of the reactants is being effectively utilized. However, it is essential to recognize that atom economy does not account for side reactions or material losses during the process, which means that the actual yield may fall short of the predicted value.
