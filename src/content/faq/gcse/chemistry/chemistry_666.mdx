Ionic compounds exhibit several distinctive properties including hardness, brittleness, high melting and boiling points, and the ability to conduct electricity when either dissolved in water or in a molten state.

These compounds are formed through the reaction between a metal and a non-metal. During this process, the metal atom loses electrons, resulting in the formation of a positively charged cation, while the non-metal atom gains these electrons, creating a negatively charged anion. The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions leads to the formation of a strong ionic bond. This interaction gives rise to a giant ionic lattice structure, which is responsible for the characteristic properties of ionic compounds.

A prominent feature of ionic compounds is their hardness and brittleness. The robust ionic bonds contribute to their hardness; however, when subjected to an external force, the layers of ions can shift, causing the compound to fracture, which accounts for their brittleness.

Another significant characteristic is their high melting and boiling points. This is a result of the strong ionic bonds that require substantial energy to break. Consequently, ionic compounds typically remain solid at room temperature and only transition to a liquid state at elevated temperatures.

Ionic compounds also possess the ability to conduct electricity, but this occurs only when they are either dissolved in water or in a molten form. In these states, the ions are free to move and facilitate the flow of electric current. In contrast, in the solid state, the ions are fixed in place within the lattice structure and are unable to move, preventing electrical conduction.

Furthermore, many ionic compounds are soluble in water. This solubility arises because the polar water molecules can surround the individual ions and effectively separate them from the lattice, leading to dissolution. However, it is important to note that not all ionic compounds are soluble; solubility depends on factors such as the strength of the ionic bonds and the sizes of the ions involved.
