Condensation polymerization is a reaction in which monomers combine to form a polymer while simultaneously eliminating a small molecule, typically water or hydrogen chloride. This process contrasts with addition polymerization, where the reaction involves only the monomers, with no small molecules released.

In a chemical equation representing condensation polymerization, the formulas for the monomers are placed on the left-hand side, while the formula for the resulting polymer and the small molecule appear on the right-hand side. The arrow in the equation indicates the progression of the reaction. 

For instance, consider the condensation polymerization of ethanoic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$) and ethanol ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}$), which produces ethyl ethanoate ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5$) and water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). This reaction can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In this equation, the monomers are ethanoic acid and ethanol, the polymer formed is ethyl ethanoate, and the small molecule eliminated is water.

It is essential to recognize that for condensation polymerization to occur, each monomer must possess at least two functional groups that can react with one another. In the example provided, ethanoic acid contains a carboxyl group ($-\text{COOH}$) and ethanol has a hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$). These functional groups react to create an ester linkage in the polymer, simultaneously releasing a molecule of water.

When writing these equations, it is crucial to ensure that the number of atoms for each element remains balanced on both sides of the equation, in accordance with the law of conservation of mass.
