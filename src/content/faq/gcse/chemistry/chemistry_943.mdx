A positive result for an oxygen test is indicated by the relighting of a glowing splint.

The procedure for testing the presence of oxygen is straightforward and easy to perform. It involves a glowing splint, which is a small, thin strip of wood, resembling a matchstick but lacking the combustible head. To prepare the splint, it is ignited and then blown out, leaving it glowing without an active flame. This glowing splint is then inserted into a test tube or container suspected of containing oxygen.

If the gas in the container is indeed oxygen, the glowing splint will reignite and burn brightly. This reaction occurs because oxygen is a supporter of combustion, providing an environment necessary for substances to ignite and sustain a flame. Consequently, flames will burn more intensely in an oxygen-rich atmosphere.

The relighting of the glowing splint serves as a definitive positive result for the oxygen test, clearly indicating that the gas being examined is oxygen. This experiment is commonly conducted in GCSE Chemistry and is essential for understanding the properties and behaviors of various gases.

Safety is crucial when performing this test. Always ensure that you are under the supervision of a teacher or a trained professional.
