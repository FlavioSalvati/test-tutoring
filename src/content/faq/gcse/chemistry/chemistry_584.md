Fossil fuels are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by releasing carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and methane ($\text{CH}_4$) during combustion.

Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, originate from the decomposed remains of ancient plants and animals. Over millions of years, these organic materials have been subjected to intense heat and pressure, which transforms them into energy-dense substances. When these fuels are combusted for energy, the carbon stored within them reacts with oxygen from the atmosphere to produce carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), a powerful greenhouse gas.

The process of burning fossil fuels is known as combustion. During this chemical reaction, carbon in the fossil fuels interacts with oxygen to yield carbon dioxide, along with the release of energy. This energy is harnessed for various applications, including heating, electricity generation, and transportation. However, the resulting carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, where it contributes to the greenhouse effect.

In addition to carbon dioxide, the combustion of fossil fuels generates smaller quantities of other greenhouse gases, such as methane ($\text{CH}_4$) and nitrous oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$). Methane is primarily released during the extraction, production, and transportation of coal, oil, and natural gas. While natural sources also emit methane, human activities, particularly those related to fossil fuels, are the leading contributors. Nitrous oxide emissions stem from agricultural practices, industrial activities, and the combustion of fossil fuels and waste, as well as from wastewater treatment processes.

Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, preventing it from escaping into space. This phenomenon results in the warming of the Earth's surface, which drives global warming and climate change. As we continue to burn fossil fuels, we increase our emissions of greenhouse gases, thereby exacerbating global warming. Consequently, it is essential to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
