The general formula for carboxylic acids is given as $R\text{-COOH}$.

Carboxylic acids constitute a class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a carboxyl group, which is denoted by the formula $-\text{COOH}$. In this formula, the 'R' represents any alkyl or aryl group, indicating that 'R' can be any carbon-based chain or ring structure. This 'R' group can vary in complexity; for instance, it may be as simple as a single hydrogen atom, which corresponds to the compound known as formic acid, or it can be a more intricate structure, such as a long carbon chain.

The carboxyl group ($-\text{COOH}$) is the defining feature of carboxylic acids and is responsible for their acidic properties. This functional group consists of a carbon atom that is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and also bonded to a hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$). The presence of the carboxyl group imparts weak acidity to these compounds. In aqueous solutions, carboxylic acids can release a proton (a hydrogen ion, $H^+$) from the hydroxyl component, which is a typical behavior of acids.

Examples of carboxylic acids include acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$), which imparts the sour flavor to vinegar, and citric acid ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_8\text{O}_7$), commonly found in citrus fruits. In these examples, the 'R' group for acetic acid is a methyl group ($\text{CH}_3$), while citric acid features a more complex structure.

In summary, the general formula for carboxylic acids, $R\text{-COOH}$, encompasses a diverse array of organic compounds that contain a carboxyl group. The 'R' can represent any carbon-based group, resulting in a vast variety of possible carboxylic acids.
