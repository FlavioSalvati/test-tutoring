Polysaccharides are formed from monosaccharides through a biochemical process known as dehydration synthesis, also referred to as a condensation reaction.

To elaborate, polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates composed of more than two monosaccharides, which are simple sugars. The mechanism that links these monosaccharides together is called dehydration synthesis because it results in the production of water ($H_2O$) as a by-product of the reaction.

The process initiates when two monosaccharides come into proximity. Each monosaccharide contains a hydroxyl ($-OH$) group. During the reaction, one monosaccharide releases a hydrogen atom ($H$) from its hydroxyl group, while the other monosaccharide loses a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) entirely. This simultaneous loss leads to the formation of a new bond between the two monosaccharides, resulting in the creation of a disaccharide and the release of a water molecule ($H_2O$). This reaction can be repeated, allowing additional monosaccharides to be added and eventually forming a polysaccharide.

For instance, the polysaccharide starch is synthesized by linking hundreds of glucose monosaccharides through dehydration synthesis. Each glucose molecule is connected to the next via an oxygen bridge, with water being released each time a new bond is established. This process is catalyzed by enzymes, which facilitate and accelerate the reaction.

In summary, the formation of polysaccharides from monosaccharides involves the removal of water, hence the term dehydration synthesis. This process is essential in biology, as it enables the storage and transport of carbohydrates within living organisms.
