Excess reactants play a crucial role in chemical reactions by ensuring that the limiting reactant is completely consumed, thereby facilitating the formation of products.

In a chemical reaction, the substances that combine to create new compounds are referred to as reactants, while the new substances formed as a result of the reaction are known as products. The quantity of product produced is determined by the limiting reactant, which is the reactant present in the smallest amount. In contrast, the reactant present in excess does not influence the total amount of product produced but guarantees that all of the limiting reactant is utilized.

For instance, let's examine the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to produce water. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is given by:

$$
2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O.
$$

This equation indicates that two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to generate two molecules of water. If we start with three molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen, oxygen becomes the limiting reactant since it will be fully consumed before all of the hydrogen is used up. Although the excess hydrogen does not affect the total amount of water produced, it ensures that all available oxygen is reacted.

The use of excess reactants is common in chemical processes to guarantee that reactions proceed to completion, meaning that all of the limiting reactant is fully consumed. This practice is particularly significant in industrial applications, where it is often more economical to use an excess of a less expensive reactant rather than precisely measuring the exact stoichiometric amounts required for the reaction.

However, employing excess reactants can lead to waste if the surplus reactant is not recovered and reused. Moreover, the presence of excess reactants can influence the reaction rate. Generally, increasing the concentration of a reactant leads to a higher reaction rate. Therefore, when one reactant is in excess, the reaction may occur more rapidly compared to a scenario where the reactants are present in their exact stoichiometric ratios.
