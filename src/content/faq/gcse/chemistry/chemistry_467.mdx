The electrolysis of molten sodium chloride yields two primary products: sodium metal and chlorine gas.

When molten sodium chloride is subjected to electrolysis, it dissociates into its fundamental components, sodium and chlorine. This process, known as electrolysis, employs a direct electric current (DC) to facilitate a chemical reaction that would not occur spontaneously.

During electrolysis, positive sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) migrate toward the negative electrode, known as the cathode. At the cathode, these sodium ions gain electrons, resulting in the formation of sodium atoms. This process is classified as a reduction reaction because the sodium ions are accepting electrons. The chemical equation representing this reaction is:

$$
\text{Na}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Na}
$$

As sodium metal is produced, it accumulates at the cathode.

Simultaneously, the negative chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$) travel toward the positive electrode, referred to as the anode. At the anode, these chloride ions lose electrons, leading to the production of chlorine gas molecules. This process is characterized as an oxidation reaction since the chloride ions are relinquishing electrons. The corresponding chemical equation for this reaction is:

$$
2\text{Cl}^- - 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2
$$

Chlorine gas is observed bubbling off at the anode during this reaction.

The overall reaction for the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride can be summarized as:

$$
2\text{NaCl}_{(l)} \rightarrow 2\text{Na}_{(s)} + \text{Cl}_2_{(g)}
$$

This indicates that for every two moles of sodium chloride that undergo electrolysis, two moles of sodium metal and one mole of chlorine gas are produced.

This electrolytic process is employed industrially for the production of sodium and chlorine. Sodium is an extremely reactive metal utilized in various applications, such as the manufacturing of specific types of glass and soap. Chlorine, a highly reactive gas, plays a crucial role in water treatment and is essential in the production of a wide array of products, including plastics and pharmaceuticals.
