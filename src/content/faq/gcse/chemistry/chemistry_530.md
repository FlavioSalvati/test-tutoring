**Addition Polymerization: An Overview**

Addition polymerization is a chemical reaction in which monomers—small molecules that contain double or triple bonds—combine to form long chain-like structures known as polymers. The term "addition" polymerization refers to the fact that these monomers add together without the loss of any atoms during the process.

The reaction initiates when the double or triple bond within a monomer molecule breaks, generating a reactive site with a free electron, commonly referred to as a free radical. This free radical can then interact with another monomer molecule, breaking its double bond and forming a bond with it. This sequence of events continues, with each newly added monomer creating another free radical site for subsequent monomers to attach. This chain reaction persists until all available monomer molecules have been consumed, resulting in the formation of a long-chain polymer.

The specific type of polymer produced is determined by the monomer used. For instance, when the monomer is ethene, the resultant polymer is polyethene, which is a widely used type of plastic. The characteristics of the polymer—including its strength, flexibility, and thermal resistance—can be tailored by manipulating the conditions of the polymerization reaction, such as temperature and pressure.

In conclusion, addition polymerization is a process in which monomers combine to create a polymer without the loss of any atoms. This is accomplished through a chain reaction initiated by the breaking of double or triple bonds in the monomers, allowing them to sequentially attach to one another until a polymer is formed.
