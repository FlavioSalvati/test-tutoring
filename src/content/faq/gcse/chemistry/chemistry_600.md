Smog is a form of air pollution that occurs when sunlight interacts with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere.

The term "smog" is a combination of "smoke" and "fog," referring to a visible type of air pollution that often manifests as a thick, hazy cloud. This phenomenon consists primarily of a mixture of pollutants that, when combined with sunlight and heat, create a foggy, smoky haze. Smog is most commonly observed in large, densely populated urban areas characterized by high levels of vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, and elevated temperatures.

The formation of smog involves a complex series of chemical reactions. It begins with the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere. These pollutants typically originate from vehicles, factories, power plants, and other sources that burn fossil fuels. Once released, these compounds react with sunlight to produce ozone, a key component of smog. This process is exacerbated by heat, which is why smog tends to be more prevalent in warmer weather.

In addition to ozone, smog may also contain other harmful substances, such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. These pollutants can pose serious health risks, particularly to the respiratory system. Furthermore, they can cause environmental damage, adversely affecting crops and other vegetation.

The severity and composition of smog can vary based on several factors, including the specific pollutants involved, prevailing weather conditions, and geographical location. For instance, in cooler climates, a type of smog known as "industrial smog" or "grey smog" can develop. This occurs due to the combustion of coal or oil in industrial processes, resulting in high concentrations of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Conversely, "photochemical smog" or "brown smog," which is more common in warmer and sunnier regions, primarily consists of ozone and nitrogen oxides.

Understanding the processes that lead to smog formation and its effects is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate air pollution and safeguard public health. Such measures may include improving fuel efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources, and enforcing air quality regulations.
