To perform a dilution calculation, you can use the formula 

$$ C_1 V_1 = C_2 V_2 $$

where $C$ represents concentration and $V$ denotes volume.

This formula is particularly useful for determining either the final concentration ($C_2$) or the final volume ($V_2$) after a dilution has been made. The terms $C_1$ and $V_1$ refer to the concentration and volume of the solution before dilution.

Let’s break this down further:

- $C_1$: This is the initial concentration of your solution before dilution.
- $V_1$: This is the initial volume of this concentrated solution.
- $C_2$: This is the final concentration you aim to achieve after dilution.
- $V_2$: This is the final volume of the diluted solution.

To effectively use this formula, you need to know three of these variables in order to calculate the fourth. For instance, if you know $C_1$, $V_1$, and $C_2$, you can solve for $V_2$. This will tell you how much solvent you need to add to your initial solution in order to reach the desired final concentration.

Let’s consider an example. Suppose you have $10 \, \text{ml}$ of a solution with a concentration of $5 \, \text{M}$ (molar), and you want to dilute it to a concentration of $1 \, \text{M}$. You would plug these values into the formula:

$$ (5 \, \text{M})(10 \, \text{ml}) = (1 \, \text{M})(V_2) $$

Solving for $V_2$ gives you $50 \, \text{ml}$. This result indicates that you need to add enough solvent to your initial $10 \, \text{ml}$ solution so that the total volume becomes $50 \, \text{ml}$.

It’s important to remember that when you dilute a solution, the amount of solute (the substance dissolved in the solution) remains constant. Only the amount of solvent (the substance in which the solute is dissolved) changes. This principle is the foundation of the dilution formula: the product of the concentration and volume before dilution ($C_1 V_1$) is equal to the product of the concentration and volume after dilution ($C_2 V_2$), reflecting the fact that the amount of solute does not vary.
