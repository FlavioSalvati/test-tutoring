The formation of sedimentary rocks plays a significant role in lowering carbon dioxide levels by trapping and storing carbon within the Earth's crust.

Sedimentary rocks are integral to the Earth's carbon cycle, a natural process that regulates the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in the atmosphere. This cycle involves the transfer of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, biosphere, and geosphere. Sedimentary rocks, including limestone and dolomite, form from the accumulation of small fragments of other rocks or the remains of plants and animals. These fragments, known as sediments, often contain carbon that has been absorbed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis by plants or dissolved in ocean waters.

Over millions of years, as these sediments are buried and compacted, they transform into sedimentary rocks, effectively sequestering carbon within the Earth's crust. This process is referred to as carbon sequestration. The carbon remains stored in these rocks until it is released back into the atmosphere through weathering or subduction into the Earth's mantle, followed by volcanic activity.

However, the process of carbon sequestration in sedimentary rocks occurs slowly, operating over geological timescales. It cannot keep pace with the rapid rise in atmospheric CO$_2$ levels driven by human activities, such as the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. Consequently, while the formation of sedimentary rocks contributes to reducing CO$_2$ levels, it is not a viable solution to the pressing issue of climate change.

In summary, the formation of sedimentary rocks is a natural mechanism that aids in regulating the Earth's carbon cycle by trapping and storing carbon. This process contributes to the reduction of atmospheric CO$_2$, helping to maintain a stable climate. Nevertheless, it is a slow process and is insufficient to counteract the rapid increases in CO$_2$ levels resulting from human activities.
