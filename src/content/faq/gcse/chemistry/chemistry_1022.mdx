The cooling of the Earth resulted in the condensation of water vapor, leading to the formation of oceans and the gradual evolution of our present atmosphere.

Initially, when the Earth was formed, it was extremely hot, and its atmosphere was primarily composed of gases such as methane, ammonia, water vapor, and nitrogen. As the Earth cooled, the water vapor in the atmosphere began to condense, resulting in the creation of oceans. This process significantly reduced the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, altering its composition.

The cooling of the Earth also facilitated the emergence of life, which further transformed the atmospheric composition. Early life forms, such as cyanobacteria, began the process of photosynthesis, releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. Over billions of years, this process gradually elevated the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere to its current level.

Additionally, the cooling of the Earth was instrumental in the formation of the ozone layer. The ozone layer consists of three oxygen atoms bonded together, formed when ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun splits an oxygen molecule ($O_2$) into two individual oxygen atoms. These atoms can then bond with other oxygen molecules to create ozone ($O_3$). This formation could not have occurred during the hotter early Earth, as the elevated temperatures would have hindered the development of ozone.

Moreover, the cooling of the Earth influenced the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) is a greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat within the atmosphere. In the hotter early Earth, there were higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, which contributed to maintaining a warm planet. However, as the Earth cooled, the levels of carbon dioxide decreased. This reduction occurred because some carbon dioxide was absorbed by the oceans and utilized by photosynthetic organisms, while some was sequestered in fossil fuels and limestone.

In summary, the cooling of the Earth had a profound impact on the composition of the atmosphere, ultimately leading to the development of the atmosphere as we know it today.
