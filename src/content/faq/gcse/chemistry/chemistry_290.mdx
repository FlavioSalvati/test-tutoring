To set up a distillation apparatus for the purpose of purifying water, you will need several essential components: a heat source, a distillation flask, a condenser, and a collection vessel.

### Equipment Required
First, gather the necessary equipment:
- A heat source (e.g., a Bunsen burner or a hot plate)
- A distillation flask (where the water to be purified will be placed)
- A condenser (a cooled tube that condenses steam back into liquid)
- A collection vessel (to collect the purified water)

### Assembly of the Apparatus
Begin the assembly by filling the distillation flask with the water that needs purification. Attach the distillation flask securely to one end of the condenser. Position the other end of the condenser above the collection vessel, ensuring that all connections are tight to prevent steam from escaping.

### Initiating the Distillation Process
Once the apparatus is properly set up, you can initiate the distillation process. Heat the distillation flask using your chosen heat source. As the water heats up, it will convert to steam. This steam rises into the condenser, where, due to the cooling effect, it condenses back into liquid water. The purified water will then flow down into the collection vessel.

### Safety Precautions
It is crucial to exercise caution while handling the apparatus, especially when it is heated. Always use heat-resistant gloves and tongs when necessary. Additionally, allow the apparatus to cool down before attempting to disassemble it.

### Effectiveness of Distillation
Distillation is a straightforward and effective method for purifying water. It can remove many impurities, including salts and bacteria, thereby making the water safe for consumption. However, it is important to note that distillation may not eliminate all types of impurities, particularly certain chemicals that have a boiling point lower than that of water.

By following these steps and precautions, you will be able to successfully purify water using a distillation apparatus.
