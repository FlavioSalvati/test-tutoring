To conduct a temperature change experiment, you will require several essential pieces of equipment: a thermometer, a polystyrene cup, a beaker, and specific chemicals.

The thermometer is vital as it measures the temperature of the substances both before and after the chemical reaction. Tracking these temperature changes is the primary objective of the experiment.

A polystyrene cup serves as a calorimeter, which is a device designed to measure the heat produced during chemical reactions or physical changes. Polystyrene is an excellent insulator, effectively minimizing heat loss to the environment and allowing for more accurate readings of the temperature change within the cup.

In addition to the polystyrene cup, a beaker is necessary to provide stability. It holds the polystyrene cup in place, preventing it from tipping over during the experiment. Moreover, the beaker adds an extra layer of insulation, further reducing potential heat loss to the surroundings.

You will also need specific chemicals for your reaction, which will vary based on the aims of your experiment. For instance, if you are exploring the heat of neutralization, you may choose to use an acid and an alkali. Conversely, if you are investigating the heat of displacement, you might select a metal and a solution containing a salt of a less reactive metal.

Finally, it is crucial to prioritize safety when conducting any experiment. Always wear safety goggles and a lab coat to protect your eyes and clothing from possible chemical splashes. Additionally, handle all chemicals with caution, as some may be corrosive or harmful.
