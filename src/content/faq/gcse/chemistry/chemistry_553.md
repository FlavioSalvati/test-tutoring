To prepare limewater for a carbon dioxide test, you need to dissolve calcium hydroxide in water and then filter the resulting solution.

Limewater is essentially a solution of calcium hydroxide ($\text{Ca(OH)}_2$) in water. Here are the steps to prepare it effectively:

1. **Obtain Calcium Hydroxide**: First, acquire some calcium hydroxide, which is typically a white powder. You can find it in a chemistry lab or purchase it from a chemical supplier.

2. **Mix the Solution**: Add a small amount of calcium hydroxide to a container of water. The specific quantity required will depend on the volume of water you are using. As a general guideline, you can use approximately one teaspoon of calcium hydroxide for every litre of water. Stir the mixture thoroughly until all of the calcium hydroxide is completely dissolved, which may take a few minutes.

3. **Observe the Solution**: After dissolving, you will notice that the solution becomes cloudy. This cloudiness occurs because calcium hydroxide is only slightly soluble in water, leading to some undissolved particles remaining in suspension.

4. **Filter the Solution**: To obtain a clear solution, you will need to filter the mixture. Pour the cloudy solution through filter paper placed in a funnel, allowing it to drain into another container. The filter paper will capture the undissolved particles, resulting in a clear limewater solution.

Your limewater is now prepared and ready for use in a carbon dioxide test. When carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) is bubbled through limewater, it reacts with calcium hydroxide to form calcium carbonate ($\text{CaCO}_3$), which appears as a white precipitate. This reaction serves as a classic test for the presence of carbon dioxide and is commonly used in school science experiments.
