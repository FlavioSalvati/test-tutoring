Technologies designed to mitigate nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions include Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), and Lean NOx Traps (LNT).

**Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)** is a prominent technology for controlling NOx emissions. This process involves injecting a liquid-reductant agent, typically automotive-grade urea—commonly referred to as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)—into the exhaust stream of a diesel engine. The introduction of DEF initiates a chemical reaction that converts nitrogen oxides into nitrogen, water, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), which are subsequently released through the vehicle's tailpipe.

**Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)** is another effective method for reducing NOx emissions. This technique recirculates a portion of the engine's exhaust gas back into the engine cylinders. By doing so, the oxygen concentration available for combustion is decreased, leading to a reduction in combustion temperature and, consequently, a lower formation of NOx. EGR systems can be categorized as either high pressure or low pressure, with high pressure EGR generally being more efficient in reducing NOx emissions.

**Lean NOx Traps (LNT)** are also utilized for controlling NOx emissions, particularly in diesel engines. These devices capture NOx from the exhaust gas when the engine operates in a lean condition (where there is more air than fuel). The captured NOx is then released and reduced to nitrogen when the engine runs in a rich condition (where there is more fuel than air). This process is known as "regeneration." LNTs employ a washcoat of materials that adsorb NOx from the exhaust gas, followed by catalyzing its reduction to nitrogen during the regeneration phase.

Each of these technologies has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the selection of a particular method often depends on the specific application and regulatory requirements. Nonetheless, they all play a vital role in minimizing the environmental impact of NOx emissions.
