The Earth's atmosphere consists primarily of a mixture of gases, with nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide being the most prevalent, along with trace amounts of other gases.

Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, accounting for approximately $78\%$ of its volume. This gas is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and it is relatively inert, meaning it does not readily react with other substances. Nitrogen is essential for life on Earth, as it serves as a crucial component of amino acids and proteins.

Oxygen ranks as the second most abundant gas, constituting about $21\%$ of the atmosphere. It is vital for life, as most organisms rely on oxygen for respiration. Furthermore, oxygen readily combines with other elements to form various compounds. For instance, it reacts with hydrogen to produce water and combines with carbon to generate carbon dioxide.

Argon, a noble gas, makes up about $0.93\%$ of the atmosphere. Similar to nitrogen and oxygen, argon is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-toxic. Its stability is attributed to its full outer shell of electrons, which prevents it from easily reacting with other substances.

Carbon dioxide is present in much smaller amounts, comprising approximately $0.04\%$ of the atmosphere. Despite its minor concentration, carbon dioxide plays a pivotal role in regulating Earth's climate, as it absorbs heat and contributes to the greenhouse effect.

Beyond these primary gases, the atmosphere also contains trace quantities of other gases such as neon, helium, methane, krypton, and hydrogen, as well as water vapor. Together, these trace gases constitute less than $1\%$ of the atmosphere; however, they are significant for various processes on Earth. For instance, methane is a potent greenhouse gas, while neon and helium find applications in various industrial processes.
