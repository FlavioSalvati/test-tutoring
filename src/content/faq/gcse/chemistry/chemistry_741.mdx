The ideal gas law is a fundamental model that approximates the behavior of real gases under typical conditions.

The ideal gas law, expressed as $PV = nRT$, is a key principle in physical chemistry. It indicates that the pressure ($P$) of a gas multiplied by its volume ($V$) is directly proportional to the number of moles ($n$) of the gas and its absolute temperature ($T$), with $R$ representing the ideal gas constant. This law operates under the assumption that gases behave ideally, meaning they conform to this equation under all temperature and pressure conditions. However, real gases do not always adhere to these idealized behaviors.

Real gases tend to deviate from the ideal gas law under extreme conditions, such as high pressures or low temperatures. This deviation occurs because the ideal gas law assumes that gas particles do not interact with one another and occupy no volume. In reality, gas particles possess physical volume and do interact with each other. At high pressures, the volume occupied by the gas particles becomes significant relative to the total volume of the gas. Conversely, at low temperatures, the attractive forces between particles become pronounced, leading to non-ideal behavior.

The van der Waals equation modifies the ideal gas law by accounting for the finite volume of gas particles and the intermolecular attractions that occur. This equation offers a more accurate representation of real gases, especially under extreme conditions. Nevertheless, under standard conditions—such as room temperature and atmospheric pressure—real gases often behave similarly to ideal gases. This reliability makes the ideal gas law a valuable tool; it serves as a simpler model that is effective for most situations encountered in GCSE Chemistry.

In summary, while the ideal gas law is a simplification, it provides a reliable approximation of real gas behavior in many scenarios. Recognizing its limitations allows us to better understand the complexities of real gas behavior.
