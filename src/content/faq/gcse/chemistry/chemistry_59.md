Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) consist of a single layer of carbon atoms, whereas multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are composed of multiple concentric layers of carbon.

SWCNTs are characterized by their cylindrical structure formed from just one layer of carbon atoms. This unique configuration endows them with remarkable properties, including exceptional strength combined with light weight, outstanding thermal conductivity, and efficient electrical conductivity. These features make SWCNTs highly valuable in a range of applications, particularly in electronics and materials science.

In contrast, MWCNTs comprise several concentric tubes, each formed by additional layers of carbon atoms, resembling Russian nesting dolls. Due to their multiple layers, MWCNTs are generally stronger and more robust than SWCNTs. They also exhibit improved thermal stability, which can be advantageous in specific applications.

The properties of both SWCNTs and MWCNTs can vary significantly based on their structural configuration. For instance, the electrical conductivity of a carbon nanotube is influenced by the arrangement of the carbon atoms, which is determined by the nanotube's 'chirality'â€”a term that describes the 'twist' in the carbon atom arrangement.

From a production standpoint, MWCNTs are typically easier and more cost-effective to manufacture compared to SWCNTs. The production processes for SWCNTs often yield a mixture of nanotubes with different chiralities, making separation challenging. In contrast, the production of MWCNTs is less sensitive to such variations, simplifying the manufacturing process.

In conclusion, while both SWCNTs and MWCNTs possess distinct and valuable properties, their primary differences lie in their structural characteristics, inherent properties, and production methods. Understanding these differences is essential for leveraging their potential across various fields.
