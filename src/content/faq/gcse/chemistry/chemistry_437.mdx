Examples of reactions characterized by high atom economy include the Haber process, the Ostwald process, and the Contact process.

### The Haber Process

The Haber process is a method for synthesizing ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. This reaction exhibits high atom economy because all the atoms from the reactants are incorporated into the product, leaving no waste. The balanced chemical equation for the Haber process is:

$$
\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_3(g)
$$

In this equation, you can observe that every atom from the reactants is utilized to produce ammonia, ensuring that no by-products are generated.

### The Ostwald Process

Another notable example of a reaction with high atom economy is the Ostwald process, which is employed to produce nitric acid from ammonia. The complete series of reactions in the Ostwald process can be summarized as follows:

1. 
$$
4\text{NH}_3(g) + 5\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 4\text{NO}(g) + 6\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
$$

2. 
$$
2\text{NO}(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{NO}_2(g)
$$

3. 
$$
3\text{NO}_2(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{HNO}_3(aq) + \text{NO}(g)
$$

Throughout these reactions, all atoms from the reactants are effectively transformed into products, resulting in no waste materials.

### The Contact Process

The Contact process is another important reaction used to manufacture sulfuric acid from sulfur dioxide. The overall balanced equation for the Contact process is:

1. 
$$
2\text{SO}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{SO}_3(g)
$$

2. 
$$
\text{SO}_3(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4(aq)
$$

This reaction also demonstrates high atom economy, as all the atoms in the reactants are utilized to create the final product, sulfuric acid.

### Conclusion

In each of these processes, high atom economy is advantageous because it leads to the efficient use of resources and minimizes waste generation. This not only enhances cost-effectiveness but also contributes positively to environmental sustainability.
