Transition metals typically exhibit higher melting points compared to Group 1 metals.

Transition metals, which encompass elements such as iron, copper, and gold, are characterized by their elevated melting points. In contrast, Group 1 metals, including lithium, sodium, and potassium, possess relatively low melting points. This disparity can be attributed to the differences in atomic structure and the nature of bonding present in these elements.

Group 1 metals, also referred to as alkali metals, have a single electron in their outermost shell. This outer electron is relatively easy to remove, resulting in metallic bonding where each atom contributes its outer electron to a 'sea' of delocalized electrons. This leads to relatively weak bonds between the atoms, explaining the low melting and boiling points observed in alkali metals.

Conversely, transition metals have multiple electrons in their outer shells. These electrons are capable of moving freely and forming various bonds with other atoms, resulting in stronger metallic bonds. Consequently, transition metals exhibit significantly higher melting and boiling points. For instance, the melting point of iron (a transition metal) is $1538\,^\circ C$, whereas sodium (a Group 1 metal) has a melting point of only $98\,^\circ C$.

Moreover, the structural characteristics of transition metals enable them to form alloys with a variety of other metals, which can further elevate their melting points. In contrast, Group 1 metals can only form alloys with one another, limiting their versatility. This is a key reason why transition metals are frequently utilized in applications requiring high melting points, such as in the construction of buildings and vehicles.

In summary, the differences in melting points between transition metals and Group 1 metals can be primarily attributed to their atomic structure and bonding characteristics. Transition metals, with their multiple outer shell electrons and capacity to form alloys, typically possess higher melting points than their Group 1 counterparts.
