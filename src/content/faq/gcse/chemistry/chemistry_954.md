Carbon dioxide gas can be effectively collected for testing using the method known as downward displacement of water in a gas collection tube.

In a typical laboratory environment, carbon dioxide is commonly generated through the reaction between an acid and a carbonate. For example, when hydrochloric acid reacts with calcium carbonate, it produces carbon dioxide, water, and calcium chloride. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

$$
2 \text{HCl} + \text{CaCO}_3 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CaCl}_2.
$$

To collect the gas, you will need a setup that includes a conical flask, a delivery tube, a gas collection tube, and a trough filled with water. The reactants—hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate—are combined in the conical flask. The delivery tube is connected to the flask and is submerged in the trough of water. The gas collection tube, which is filled with water and inverted, is positioned over the end of the delivery tube.

As the reaction takes place, carbon dioxide gas is generated and travels through the delivery tube. It enters the gas collection tube, displacing the water downwards. This technique is effective because carbon dioxide is denser than air and has low solubility in water, allowing it to push the water out of the tube.

Once the gas has been collected, various tests can be performed to analyze its properties. One classic test for the presence of carbon dioxide is its ability to turn limewater milky. It is crucial to handle carbon dioxide with care, as high concentrations can be hazardous.

Always prioritize safety in any scientific experiment. Ensure that you wear appropriate protective gear and conduct your work in a well-ventilated area.
