To set up an electrolysis experiment, you will need the following components: an electrolyte, two electrodes, a power source, and connecting wires.

First, select an appropriate electrolyte. An electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity, which can be in the form of a solution containing salt, acid, or alkali, or a molten ionic compound. The electrolyte contains ions that will migrate towards the electrodes when an electric current is applied.

Next, you will require two electrodes, typically made from inert materials such as graphite or platinum. These materials are chosen because they do not react with the electrolyte or the products generated during the electrolysis process. One electrode is connected to the positive terminal of the power source and is referred to as the anode, while the other electrode connects to the negative terminal and is called the cathode.

The power source, which is usually a battery or a power pack, supplies the electrical energy necessary to drive the electrolysis reaction. You will connect the power source to the electrodes using wires.

To configure the experiment, carefully place the electrodes into the electrolyte, ensuring they do not touch each other. Connect the anode to the positive terminal of the power source and the cathode to the negative terminal. Once the connections are secure, turn on the power source.

As the electric current flows through the circuit, positive ions within the electrolyte will move towards the cathode, where they will gain electrons in a process known as reduction. Conversely, negative ions will migrate towards the anode, where they will lose electrons in a process called oxidation. You will be able to observe the products of electrolysis forming at the electrodes. For instance, if you are electrolyzing a copper sulfate solution, you will notice copper metal depositing at the cathode and oxygen gas being released at the anode.

Always exercise caution when handling materials, as some electrolytes can be corrosive and the products of electrolysis may pose hazards. It is essential to adhere to safety guidelines throughout the experiment.
