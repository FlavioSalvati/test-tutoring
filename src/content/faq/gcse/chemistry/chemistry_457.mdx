You can convert gas volumes between different conditions using two fundamental principles: the ideal gas law and the combined gas law.

The ideal gas law states that the product of a gas's pressure and volume is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas and its absolute temperature. This relationship is mathematically represented as:

$$
PV = nRT
$$

In this equation, $P$ denotes the pressure, $V$ represents the volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. If you know the initial and final conditions of the gas, you can utilize this equation to convert the gas volume from one set of conditions to another.

The combined gas law is a rearrangement of the ideal gas law that allows for the comparison of the initial and final states of a gas without requiring knowledge of the number of moles. It is expressed as:

$$
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
$$

In this formula, $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the initial and final pressures, $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the initial and final volumes, and $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the initial and final temperatures, all measured in appropriate units.

To effectively use these gas laws, it is crucial to ensure that all measurements are in the correct units. Pressure is typically measured in atmospheres (atm), volume in liters (L), and temperature in Kelvin (K). The number of moles ($n$) is dimensionless, while the ideal gas constant ($R$) is usually expressed as $0.0821 \, \text{L} \cdot \text{atm}/(\text{K} \cdot \text{mol})$.

It is important to remember that these laws are based on the assumption that gases behave ideally. This means they follow these equations under all temperature and pressure conditions. However, real gases tend to adhere to these laws only at low pressures and high temperatures. At extreme temperatures and pressures, more complex equations of state may be necessary. Nonetheless, for most GCSE-level problems, the ideal and combined gas laws will be sufficient for your calculations.
