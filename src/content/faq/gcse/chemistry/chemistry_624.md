An alloy is formed by melting two or more metals together and subsequently cooling and solidifying the mixture.

The process of creating an alloy is known as smelting. During smelting, the base metal is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to cause it to melt. The exact temperature required for this process varies with the type of metal. For instance, iron melts at approximately $1,538$ degrees Celsius, while aluminum melts at a significantly lower temperature of $660$ degrees Celsius.

Once the base metal is in its liquid state, the next step is to add one or more secondary metals, known as alloying elements. These alloying elements are typically introduced in smaller quantities compared to the base metal. The primary purpose of incorporating these elements is to enhance the properties of the base metal. For example, when carbon is added to iron, it forms steel, which possesses greater strength and durability than pure iron.

After the base metal and alloying elements are combined, the mixture is stirred to ensure that the components are uniformly distributed throughout. This step is crucial, as it guarantees that the final product exhibits consistent properties.

Once the metals are thoroughly mixed, the next phase involves cooling and solidifying the mixture. This is typically accomplished by pouring the molten metal into a mold and allowing it to cool. The cooling process can be controlled to be either slow or rapid, depending on the desired characteristics of the final alloy. For instance, slow cooling results in a coarse-grained structure, which tends to make the alloy softer and more ductile, whereas rapid cooling produces a fine-grained structure, resulting in a harder and stronger alloy.

In summary, the process of creating an alloy entails melting a base metal, adding alloying elements, stirring the mixture for uniformity, and then cooling and solidifying it. The resulting alloy exhibits properties that are often different from, and superior to, those of the individual metals.
