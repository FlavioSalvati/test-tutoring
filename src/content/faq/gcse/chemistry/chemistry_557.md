You can confirm the presence of multiple gases in a mixture using various gas detection methods and chemical tests.

To identify the different gases in a mixture, several techniques are available. One common method is gas chromatography, a laboratory technique that separates and identifies gases based on their varying distributions between a stationary phase and a mobile phase. In this process, the gas mixture is injected into the instrument, where it is transported through a column by an inert, gaseous mobile phase. The column is coated with a stationary phase that interacts differently with each gas. As the gases exit the column, they are detected and identified.

Another effective technique is mass spectrometry, which identifies gases based on their mass-to-charge ratio. In this method, the gas mixture is ionized, and the resulting ions are separated according to their mass and charge. The resulting spectrum provides valuable information that can be used to identify the gases present in the mixture.

Chemical tests can also help identify specific gases. For instance:
- Oxygen can be tested by attempting to relight a glowing splint.
- Carbon dioxide can be detected through its reaction with limewater, which turns milky.
- Hydrogen can be identified using the 'pop' test, where a lit splint ignites the gas with a characteristic 'pop' sound.
- Chlorine gas will turn damp litmus paper white and subsequently bleach it.
- Ammonia will cause damp red litmus paper to turn blue.

Infrared spectroscopy is another valuable technique for gas identification. Each gas absorbs infrared radiation at specific wavelengths, creating a unique absorption spectrum that allows for identification.

Always prioritize safety when handling gases, particularly in a laboratory setting. Be sure to follow your teacher's instructions and wear the appropriate protective equipment at all times.
