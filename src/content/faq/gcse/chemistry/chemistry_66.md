Percentage yield is a key metric used to assess the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It is determined by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and then multiplying the result by $100$.

To elaborate, percentage yield measures how much product was actually obtained from a reaction (the actual yield) compared to the maximum potential product that could be produced under ideal conditions (the theoretical yield). The formula for calculating percentage yield is expressed as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100
$$

In this context, the actual yield refers to the quantity of product that is generated from a reaction, which is typically less than the theoretical yield. This discrepancy is often due to losses that occur during the reaction process or because the reaction does not proceed to completion. Conversely, the theoretical yield represents the maximum possible amount of product that could be formed from the available reactants. This value is determined using stoichiometry based on the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

For instance, if a reaction has a theoretical yield of $10$ grams, but the actual yield obtained is only $8$ grams, the percentage yield can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100 = 80\%
$$

This outcome indicates that the reaction achieved an efficiency of $80\%$, meaning that $80\%$ of the theoretical maximum amount of product was successfully produced.

It is important to note that the percentage yield can never exceed $100\%$. A yield greater than $100\%$ suggests that there may have been errors in calculations or measurements.
