Bioleaching and phytomining are innovative techniques used to extract metals from the environment by utilizing bacteria and plants to absorb and concentrate these metals.

**Bioleaching** is a biotechnological process that employs bacteria to extract metals from ores or waste materials. These bacteria thrive in metal-rich environments and have the capability to convert metals into forms that are easier to extract. Typically, bacteria are introduced into a solution containing the metal ore, where they grow and multiply. As the bacteria proliferate, they produce acids that dissolve the metals from the ore. The resulting solution is then processed to recover the metals, making this method particularly effective for extracting metals such as copper and gold.

In contrast, **phytomining** involves the use of plants to extract metals from the soil. Certain species, known as hyperaccumulators, can absorb high concentrations of metal ions through their roots. These plants are cultivated in soils that contain low-grade ore or waste materials. As they grow, they take up metal ions and store them in their tissues. Once the plants reach maturity, they are harvested and incinerated. The ash produced from this process contains a significant concentration of the metal, which can then be extracted using various techniques.

Both bioleaching and phytomining are regarded as more environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional mining methods. They do not involve harmful chemicals, and they can effectively extract metals from low-grade ores or waste materials that would otherwise be uneconomical to mine. However, it is important to note that both methods are relatively slow and may not be appropriate for extracting large quantities of metals.
