When sodium hydroxide is added to a solution containing copper(II) ions, a striking blue precipitate of copper(II) hydroxide is formed.

The addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to a solution with copper(II) ions (Cu$^{2+}$) initiates a chemical reaction known as a double displacement reaction. In this process, the ions from the reacting compounds exchange partners, resulting in the formation of new compounds. Specifically, the copper(II) ions react with the hydroxide ions (OH$^-$) present in the sodium hydroxide solution to produce copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)$_2$), which appears as a blue precipitate. Meanwhile, the sodium ions (Na$^+$) from the sodium hydroxide remain dissolved in the solution.

The chemical equation that represents this reaction is:

$$
\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Cu(OH)}_2 + 2\text{Na}^+
$$

This reaction is frequently employed in laboratory settings as a qualitative test for the presence of copper(II) ions. The appearance of the blue precipitate serves as a positive indication of copper(II) ions in the solution. It is important to highlight that the precipitate is insoluble in water, which allows it to settle out from the solution as a solid.

Beyond its application as a laboratory test, this reaction has practical implications. For instance, copper(II) hydroxide is utilized in agriculture as a fungicide to combat crop diseases. Additionally, it plays a role in the production of rayon, a type of synthetic fiber.

Safety is paramount when conducting chemical reactions. Sodium hydroxide is a strong alkali that can cause burns, so it should be handled with caution. Always use appropriate protective equipment, such as gloves and safety goggles, when working with chemicals.
