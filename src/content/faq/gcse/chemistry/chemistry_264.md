Human activities significantly elevate greenhouse gas levels, primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation.

The increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases is largely attributed to human actions, especially industrial activities. A major contributor to this phenomenon is the burning of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas. When these fuels are combusted for energy, they emit carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), a powerful greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. This process, known as combustion, means that the more fossil fuels we burn, the greater the release of $\text{CO}_2$, which intensifies the greenhouse effect and accelerates global warming.

Deforestation is another critical human activity that contributes to higher greenhouse gas levels. Trees play a vital role in absorbing $\text{CO}_2$ during photosynthesis, effectively acting as natural carbon sinks. When extensive areas of forest are cleared, not only is the number of trees that can absorb $\text{CO}_2$ diminished, but the deforestation process often involves burning the trees. This burning releases the stored carbon back into the atmosphere as $\text{CO}_2$.

Agricultural practices also impact greenhouse gas levels. The cultivation of certain crops and the raising of livestock generate methane ($\text{CH}_4$), another potent greenhouse gas. For instance, rice cultivation produces methane during the decomposition of organic matter in flooded fields. Additionally, livestock, particularly cattle, emit methane during digestion, which is subsequently released into the atmosphere.

Industrial processes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions as well. For example, cement production and various chemical reactions in factories often involve the combustion of fossil fuels. These processes can also emit other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$) and fluorinated gases. Although these gases are less prevalent, they are significantly more potent than $\text{CO}_2$ in terms of their greenhouse effect.

In conclusion, human activities elevate greenhouse gas levels through the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural practices, and various industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect and driving global warming.
