Here are some examples of molecules that contain covalent bonds: water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), and oxygen ($\text{O}_2$).

Covalent bonds are a specific type of chemical bond characterized by the sharing of pairs of electrons between atoms. These bonds are prevalent in many substances that we encounter in our everyday lives. For instance, water, which is vital for sustaining life, is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. In this molecule, the oxygen atom shares one electron with each hydrogen atom, resulting in a stable configuration.

Another noteworthy example is carbon dioxide, a gas that we exhale and that is also generated through the combustion of fossil fuels. The carbon dioxide molecule consists of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. In this case, the carbon atom forms double covalent bonds by sharing two pairs of electrons with each oxygen atom. This electron sharing contributes to the stability of the molecule.

Methane, which is the primary component of natural gas, is yet another molecule characterized by covalent bonds. It consists of one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Here, the carbon atom shares one pair of electrons with each hydrogen atom, resulting in single covalent bonds.

Lastly, oxygen, the gas that we breathe to survive, is composed of two oxygen atoms. These atoms share two pairs of electrons, forming a double covalent bond. This type of bond is essential for rendering oxygen a stable molecule.

In summary, covalent bonds play a critical role in the formation of numerous molecules, including water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), and oxygen ($\text{O}_2$). By allowing atoms to share electrons, these bonds lead to the creation of stable molecules. A solid understanding of covalent bonds is fundamental for comprehending the chemical reactions that take place in our environment and within our bodies.
