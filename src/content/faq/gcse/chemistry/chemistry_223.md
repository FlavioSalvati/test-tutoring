The sequence of amino acids in a protein is fundamental to determining its shape and function, as it directly influences the protein's folding and overall structure.

Think of the amino acid sequence as a blueprint that directs how the protein folds into its unique three-dimensional configuration. This structure is essential because it dictates the protein's role within the body. Proteins are composed of chains of amino acids, which are often referred to as the building blocks of proteins. There are $20$ distinct types of amino acids that can be combined in a myriad of ways, resulting in an extensive variety of proteins.

The specific order of these amino acids in a protein chain is dictated by the DNA sequence of the gene encoding that protein. This sequence is unique to each protein and plays a critical role in determining its final structure. As amino acids interact with one another and their surrounding environment, the protein chain folds into a specific shape, which can manifest as a simple helix, a pleated sheet, or a more complex globular structure.

The interactions between amino acids can be categorized as hydrophobic (water-repelling) or hydrophilic (water-attracting), with these properties significantly influencing protein folding. Hydrophobic amino acids tend to cluster in the interior of the protein, away from the aqueous environment of the cell, while hydrophilic amino acids are more likely to be located on the protein's surface, engaging with the surrounding water.

The final structure of a protein is critically important, as it determines the protein's function. For instance, enzymes— a specific type of protein— possess unique shapes that enable them to bind to other molecules and accelerate chemical reactions. If there is even a slight alteration in the amino acid sequence, the protein may fail to fold correctly, leading to a loss of function. Such alterations can result in diseases, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, both of which are caused by a single change in the amino acid sequence of a protein.
