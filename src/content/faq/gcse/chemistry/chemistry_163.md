Chemical cells generate electricity by converting chemical energy into electrical energy through a process known as an electrochemical reaction.

Chemical cells, also referred to as electrochemical cells, are devices that produce electricity via chemical reactions. This process involves the transfer of electrons between substances, which are typically housed within the cell in the form of an electrolyte and electrodes.

A chemical cell is composed of two electrodes: the anode and the cathode, both of which are immersed in an electrolyte. The anode is the electrode where oxidation occurs, leading to a loss of electrons, while the cathode is the electrode where reduction takes place, resulting in a gain of electrons. The electrolyte is a medium that contains ions, which are atoms or molecules with a net electric charge.

When the cell is connected to an external circuit, the electrons that are released at the anode travel through the circuit to the cathode, creating an electric current. This movement of electrons is commonly referred to as electricity. The electrolyte facilitates the movement of ions between the electrodes, thereby completing the circuit and allowing the chemical reaction to persist.

The fundamental reaction that drives the operation of the cell is a redox reaction. This type of reaction involves the transfer of electrons between substances. In the context of a chemical cell, the substance at the anode undergoes oxidation (losing electrons), while the substance at the cathode undergoes reduction (gaining electrons). This electron transfer from the anode to the cathode is what produces the electric current.

In summary, chemical cells generate electricity by harnessing a chemical reaction to create a flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode. This flow of electrons, or electric current, is subsequently utilized to power electrical devices.
