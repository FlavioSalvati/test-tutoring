To write the formula for an ionic compound, it is essential to balance the charges of the involved ions.

In an ionic compound, the total positive charge from the metal ions (cations) must equal the total negative charge from the non-metal ions (anions). This balance is necessary because ionic compounds are electrically neutral overall. To create the formula, you first need to identify the charges of the ions involved. For instance, sodium (Na) carries a charge of $+1$, while chloride (Cl) has a charge of $-1$. Hence, the formula for sodium chloride is written as NaCl.

Not all ions possess a charge of $+1$ or $-1$. For example, magnesium (Mg) has a charge of $+2$, and oxygen (O) has a charge of $-2$. In this scenario, the charges balance perfectly, resulting in the formula for magnesium oxide being MgO. However, if the charges do not naturally balance, adjustments must be made to the number of ions involved. For instance, aluminium (Al) has a charge of $+3$, while oxygen (O) has a charge of $-2$. To achieve charge balance in this case, it requires two aluminium ions for every three oxygen ions, yielding the formula Al$_2$O$_3$.

It is important to remember that the formula for an ionic compound does not indicate the exact number of ions present in a specific sample; rather, it reflects the ratio of ions within the compound. For example, the formula Al$_2$O$_3$ indicates that for every two aluminium ions, there are three oxygen ions. Additionally, the convention is to always write the metal ion first in the formula.

Writing the formula for an ionic compound is a fundamental skill in chemistry. It provides insight into the composition of the compound and elucidates how the ions interact with one another. This skill is also crucial for predicting the properties of the compound and its reactions with other substances.
