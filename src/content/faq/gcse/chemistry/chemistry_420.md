The final concentration of a solution after dilution can be determined using the dilution equation, which is expressed as:

$$ C_1 V_1 = C_2 V_2 $$

In this equation, $C$ represents concentration and $V$ denotes volume. 

To elaborate, this formula is fundamental for calculating the final concentration of a solution following dilution. The variables in the equation are defined as follows:
- $C_1$: the initial concentration of the solution,
- $V_1$: the initial volume of the solution,
- $C_2$: the final concentration after dilution,
- $V_2$: the final volume after dilution.

To utilize this equation effectively, you need to know the values of three out of the four variables. You can then rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown variable. For instance, if you are aware of the initial concentration and volume of a solution, along with the final volume after dilution, you can calculate the final concentration ($C_2$) by rearranging the equation to:

$$ C_2 = \frac{C_1 V_1}{V_2} $$

Consider the following example: Suppose you have $100 \, \text{ml}$ of a solution with a concentration of $0.5 \, \text{mol/L}$, and you dilute it by adding water until the final volume reaches $200 \, \text{ml}$. To find the final concentration, substitute the known values into the formula:

$$ C_2 = \frac{0.5 \, \text{mol/L} \times 100 \, \text{ml}}{200 \, \text{ml}} = 0.25 \, \text{mol/L} $$

It is important to ensure that the units of volume are consistent on both sides of the equation. If the volumes are provided in different units, you must convert them to the same unit before applying the formula. Additionally, this equation assumes that the volumes of the solutions are additive, which is generally a reasonable approximation for dilute aqueous solutions.
