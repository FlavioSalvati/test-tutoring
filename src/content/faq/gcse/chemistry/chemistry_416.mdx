To convert grams to moles, you divide the mass of the substance (in grams) by its molar mass.

The molar mass of a substance is defined as the mass of one mole of that substance, typically expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). You can find the molar mass for each element on the periodic table. For compounds, the molar mass is calculated by summing the molar masses of all constituent elements.

To perform a grams-to-moles conversion, you must know the molar mass of the substance. For instance, the molar mass of water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) is approximately $18 \, \text{g/mol}$, which is derived from the molar masses of hydrogen ($1.01 \, \text{g/mol}$ for each hydrogen atom) and oxygen ($16.00 \, \text{g/mol}$). If you have $36 \, \text{g}$ of water, you would calculate the number of moles by dividing $36$ by $18$. Thus, in this case, you would have $2$ moles of water.

This conversion is essential in chemistry because chemical reactions typically occur at the molecular level rather than by mass. By converting grams to moles, you can ascertain the number of molecules involved in a reaction, which is vital for understanding and predicting the interactions between different substances.

The formula for converting grams to moles is:

$$
\text{Number of moles} = \frac{\text{Mass in grams}}{\text{Molar mass}}
$$

To summarize, to convert grams to moles, first determine the molar mass of the substance, which can be found on the periodic table or calculated for compounds. Then, divide the mass of the substance in grams by its molar mass to obtain the number of moles.
