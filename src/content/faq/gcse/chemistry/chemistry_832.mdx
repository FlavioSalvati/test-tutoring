Chemical cells, also referred to as electrochemical cells, are essential devices in the field of chemistry that convert chemical energy into electrical energy through chemical reactions. These reactions typically involve the transfer of electrons between substances, a process known as a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction.

There are two primary types of chemical cells: galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. 

**Galvanic Cells** (or voltaic cells) generate electricity spontaneously from chemical reactions. They consist of two distinct metals, called electrodes, which are immersed in a solution known as an electrolyte. The interaction between the electrodes and the electrolyte facilitates the movement of electrons from one electrode to the other, producing an electric current.

Conversely, **Electrolytic Cells** require an external source of electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. These cells are commonly used in processes such as electroplating and electrolysis, where an electric current induces a chemical change.

In both types of cells, the fundamental mechanism for generating electricity lies in the movement of electrons. In a galvanic cell, the spontaneous chemical reaction results in the flow of electrons, thus creating an electric current. In an electrolytic cell, an external electric current forces the movement of electrons, which in turn drives a chemical reaction.

Understanding the principles of chemical cells is vital for many scientific and technological applications. They are integral to a broad range of uses, including batteries, fuel cells, and industrial processes like electroplating. By harnessing the energy released during chemical reactions, chemical cells offer a versatile and efficient means of generating electricity.
