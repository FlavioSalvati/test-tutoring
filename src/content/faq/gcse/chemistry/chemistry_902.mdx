Equilibrium concentrations are determined experimentally by measuring the concentrations of reactants and products once the system has reached equilibrium.

In a chemical reaction, equilibrium occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. At this stage, the concentrations of both the reactants and products remain constant over time, even though the reactions continue to occur. To experimentally determine these equilibrium concentrations, one must measure the concentrations of reactants and products after the system has reached equilibrium.

The method used for measurement depends on the nature of the substances involved. For instance, if the reactants or products are colored, their concentrations can be quantified using a spectrophotometer. This instrument measures the amount of light absorbed by a solution; a more concentrated solution will absorb more light.

In cases where the reactants or products are gases, their concentrations can be determined by measuring the pressure of the gas within a closed system. This is based on the ideal gas law, which states that the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its concentration.

Additionally, titration can be employed to determine the concentrations of reactants or products. This technique involves adding a solution of known concentration to the reaction mixture until the reaction reaches completion. The volume of the titrant used provides a measure of the concentration of the reactant or product in question.

Once the concentrations of all reactants and products have been measured, they can be substituted into the expression for the equilibrium constant, $K_c$, to verify that the reaction is at equilibrium. The equilibrium constant is a quantitative measure of the position of equilibrium and is specific to a particular reaction at a given temperature. If the calculated value of $K_c$ aligns with the known value, it confirms that the reaction is at equilibrium and that the measured concentrations represent the equilibrium concentrations.
