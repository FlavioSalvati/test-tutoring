Common types of batteries include alkaline, lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium (NiCd), lead-acid, and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries.

**Alkaline Batteries**  
Alkaline batteries are the most widely used type of battery in household items such as remote controls and toys. They derive their name from the alkaline electrolyte, typically potassium hydroxide, that is used within the battery. Alkaline batteries are well-regarded for their long shelf life and good energy density. However, they are non-rechargeable, meaning that once they are depleted, they must be disposed of responsibly.

**Lithium-Ion Batteries**  
Lithium-ion batteries are prevalent in portable electronics, including mobile phones and laptops, due to their high energy density and the ability to be recharged multiple times. These batteries operate by allowing lithium ions to move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during discharge, and then back again when charging. While they offer significant advantages, lithium-ion batteries can pose safety risks if not handled properly, as they have the potential to overheat and even explode under certain conditions.

**Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) Batteries**  
Nickel-cadmium batteries are rechargeable and are commonly used in power tools and photography equipment. They are known for their ability to deliver high current and their resilience against damage from overcharging. However, because they contain toxic heavy metals, many regions are phasing out their use due to environmental concerns.

**Lead-Acid Batteries**  
Lead-acid batteries are the oldest type of rechargeable battery and are primarily used in automobiles and other vehicles. They feature a high power-to-weight ratio, making them ideal for starting car engines. Despite their effectiveness, lead-acid batteries are relatively heavy and contain toxic lead, which can be harmful to the environment if not disposed of properly.

**Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) Batteries**  
Nickel-metal hydride batteries are similar to nickel-cadmium batteries but use a hydrogen-absorbing alloy for the negative electrode instead of cadmium. They are often found in hybrid vehicles and high-drain devices, such as digital cameras. NiMH batteries offer a higher energy density than NiCd batteries and are considered less harmful to the environment.
