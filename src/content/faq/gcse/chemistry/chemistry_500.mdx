Increased temperatures accelerate chemical reactions by providing additional energy, which causes particles to move more rapidly and collide more frequently.

To elaborate, every chemical reaction requires a specific amount of energy to initiate, known as the activation energy. This energy is necessary to break the bonds in the reactants, allowing new bonds to form in the products. When the temperature rises, the particles of the reactants acquire more kinetic energy, resulting in faster movement and more frequent collisions.

These collisions not only occur more often but are also more energetic. This distinction is vital because not every collision leads to a successful reaction. Only those collisions that possess enough energy to surpass the activation energy barrier will result in a reaction. Consequently, at elevated temperatures, not only do the collisions increase in frequency, but a larger proportion of them also succeed in initiating a reaction.

This phenomenon is described by the Collision Theory, which posits that for a reaction to take place, particles must collide with adequate energy and in the proper orientation. By raising the temperature, we enhance both the speed and energy of the particles, leading to a higher rate of successful collisions, thereby accelerating the reaction.

It is important to note that this principle is generally applicable to most reactions; however, it does not hold true for all. Some reactions may be unaffected by temperature changes or could even slow down if the temperature becomes excessively high. This is because extreme heat can denature the reactants or trigger undesirable side reactions. Nonetheless, in the majority of cases, increasing the temperature will facilitate a faster reaction rate.
