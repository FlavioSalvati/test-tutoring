Alcohols are a class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of one or more hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups. They are derived from hydrocarbons through the substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms with a hydroxyl group. The general formula for alcohols can be expressed as $$C_nH_{2n+1}OH$$, where $n$ denotes the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.

One of the principal properties of alcohols is their solubility in water. This solubility arises from the hydroxyl group, which is capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, the solubility of alcohols tends to decrease as the length of the carbon chain increases. This phenomenon occurs because the non-polar nature of the carbon chain does not interact favorably with water, and as the chain lengthens, the influence of the polar hydroxyl group on the overall polarity of the molecule diminishes.

In addition to their solubility, alcohols are also known for their flammability. They can ignite and combust in the presence of air, producing water and carbon dioxide as byproducts. The flammability of alcohols tends to increase with the length of the carbon chain, as longer chains contain a greater number of carbon and hydrogen atoms that are available for oxidation.

Another significant aspect of alcohols is their reactivity. They can participate in a variety of chemical reactions, including oxidation, esterification, and dehydration. The reactivity of an alcohol is influenced by its classification, which is determined by the number of alkyl groups bonded to the carbon atom that carries the hydroxyl group. Primary alcohols, which have one alkyl group, are generally more reactive than secondary alcohols, which have two alkyl groups. In turn, secondary alcohols are more reactive than tertiary alcohols, which possess three alkyl groups.

Lastly, alcohols exhibit higher boiling points compared to hydrocarbons or ethers of similar molecular size. This increased boiling point can be attributed to the ability of alcohols to form hydrogen bonds, which require more energy to break than the weaker van der Waals forces present in hydrocarbons or ethers.
