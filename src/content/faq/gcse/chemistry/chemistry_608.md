Reverse osmosis is a widely used process for water purification that effectively removes undesirable particles from water by utilizing a semi-permeable membrane.

To elaborate, reverse osmosis (RO) is a sophisticated water purification technology that employs a semi-permeable membrane to eliminate ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water. The term "reverse" osmosis refers to the fact that this process counteracts the natural flow of osmosis, where water moves from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated one through a semi-permeable membrane.

In the reverse osmosis process, pressure is applied to the more concentrated solution (the contaminated water), which forces water molecules through the semi-permeable membrane to the less concentrated side (the purified water). The tiny pores of the membrane allow only water molecules to pass, effectively blocking larger contaminant molecules, including salts, bacteria, and various chemicals.

As a result, purified water accumulates on one side of the membrane, while a highly concentrated contaminated solution remains on the other side. This contaminated solution is subsequently discarded, and the purified water is collected for consumption.

The efficiency of reverse osmosis in removing contaminants is influenced by several factors, including the applied pressure, the concentration of the contaminants, and the quality of the membrane. This method is particularly popular for water purification because it can eliminate up to $99\%$ of water impurities, such as lead, fluoride, chlorine, detergents, and pesticides. However, it is important to note that while reverse osmosis effectively removes harmful substances, it also strips away beneficial minerals from the water.

In summary, reverse osmosis is a highly effective water purification technique that utilizes a semi-permeable membrane and applied pressure to remove contaminants from water, thereby providing a reliable source of clean and safe drinking water.
