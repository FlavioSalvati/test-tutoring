To calculate the moles of a limiting reactant, it is essential to first balance the chemical equation and then apply stoichiometry.

In any chemical reaction, the limiting reactant is the substance that gets completely consumed when the reaction reaches completion. This reactant ultimately determines the maximum amount of product that can be produced. To find the moles of a limiting reactant, follow these steps:

1. **Write the Balanced Chemical Equation**: Start by ensuring that you have the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. This equation is crucial as it provides the stoichiometric ratios in which the reactants combine to form products.

2. **Convert Masses to Moles**: Next, convert the masses of the reactants into moles. This can be achieved by dividing the mass of each reactant by its respective molar mass. The molar mass of a substance, which can be found on the periodic table, represents the mass of one mole of that substance.

3. **Identify the Limiting Reactant**: After determining the number of moles for each reactant, you can figure out which one is the limiting reactant. To do this, divide the number of moles of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficientâ€”this is the number in front of the substance in the balanced equation. The reactant that yields the smallest value is the limiting reactant.

For instance, consider the reaction where $2$ moles of hydrogen ($\text{H}_2$) react with $1$ mole of oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) to produce water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). The balanced equation for this reaction is:

$$
2\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In this case, the stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen to oxygen to water is $2:1:2$. If we divide the number of moles of each reactant by their stoichiometric coefficients, we get:

- For hydrogen: $$\frac{2}{2} = 1$$
- For oxygen: $$\frac{1}{1} = 1$$

Since both results are equal, neither reactant is limiting in this situation. However, if we had only $1$ mole of hydrogen, the calculation would be:

- For hydrogen: $$\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$

In this case, hydrogen would be the limiting reactant because $0.5$ is less than $1$.

Remember that the limiting reactant is critical as it determines the maximum amount of product that can be formed. Once this reactant is fully consumed, the reaction ceases, even if there are still some amounts of the other reactants remaining.
