To perform an oxygen test, you will need three primary materials: a glowing splint, a test tube, and a sample of the gas you wish to examine.

### Required Materials
1. **Glowing Splint**: This is typically a small piece of wood, such as a splint or a wooden skewer. It should be ignited and then extinguished so that it remains smouldering, rather than actively burning. The glowing splint is essential for testing the reactivity of the gas sample.
  
2. **Test Tube**: This glass container is used to hold the gas sample. It is important to ensure that the test tube is clean and dry prior to use to guarantee accurate results.

3. **Gas Sample**: This is the gas you suspect to be oxygen. It could be collected from a chemical reaction or extracted from the atmosphere.

### Procedure
The process for conducting the oxygen test is quite simple. Follow these steps:

1. Introduce the glowing splint into the test tube that contains the gas sample.
2. Observe the splint: if it reignites or burns more brightly, this is a strong indication that oxygen is present. This reaction occurs because oxygen supports combustion, enabling the glowing splint to ignite more vigorously.

### Safety Precautions
Safety is of utmost importance when performing this test. Here are some essential safety practices:

- Always handle the glowing splint using tongs or an appropriate holder to prevent burns.
- Conduct the test in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood to avoid the accumulation of potentially harmful gases.

Additionally, consider wearing safety equipment, such as gloves, goggles, and a lab coat, to protect your skin and clothing. Remember, prioritizing safety is crucial when carrying out any chemical test.
