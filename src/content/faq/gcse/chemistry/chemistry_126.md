The standard conditions for measuring gas volumes are defined as a temperature of $0^\circ C$ and a pressure of $1$ atmosphere.

More specifically, these conditions are commonly referred to as Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). The standard temperature is set at $0^\circ C$, which is equivalent to $273.15$ Kelvin. This temperature corresponds to the freezing point of water and serves as a fundamental baseline for various scientific measurements. The standard pressure is defined as $1$ atmosphere (atm), which represents the average atmospheric pressure at sea level.

These defined conditions are essential because they provide a consistent and reproducible environment for measuring and comparing the volumes of different gases. Under STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies a volume of $22.4$ liters. This value is known as the molar volume of a gas at STP and is a crucial concept in many areas of chemistry.

It’s important to recognize that STP is not the only set of conditions used for measuring gas volumes. For example, in certain fields, a temperature of $25^\circ C$ and a pressure of $1$ atmosphere are adopted, which are referred to as Normal Temperature and Pressure (NTP). However, for most purposes in GCSE Chemistry, the focus will be on STP.

Keep in mind that gases can exhibit different behaviors under varying conditions of temperature and pressure. These variations are described by the gas laws, which you will explore in greater detail later on. For now, just remember that when we discuss the volume of a gas, we are typically referring to its volume at STP.
