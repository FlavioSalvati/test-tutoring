Atom economy is a key metric in green chemistry that evaluates the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It quantifies the proportion of starting materials that are converted into desired products, while assessing the amount of waste generated. A higher atom economy indicates less waste and a more sustainable reaction.

To calculate atom economy, you need to determine the molecular mass of all reactants and products involved in the reaction. The molecular mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule, which can be easily found using the periodic table.

The formula for calculating atom economy is as follows:

$$
\text{Atom Economy (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Total molecular mass of desired products}}{\text{Total molecular mass of all reactants}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

For example, consider a reaction where the total molecular mass of the reactants is $200 \, \text{g/mol}$, and the molecular mass of the desired product is $150 \, \text{g/mol}$. The atom economy can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Atom Economy} = \left( \frac{150}{200} \right) \times 100\% = 75\%
$$

This result indicates that $75\%$ of the mass of the reactants is converted into the desired product, while $25\%$ is wasted. In the context of green chemistry, the objective is to design reactions that achieve the highest possible atom economy, thereby minimizing waste and enhancing sustainability in chemical processes.
