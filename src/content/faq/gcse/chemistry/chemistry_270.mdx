The Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement are two pivotal international accords designed to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in December $1997$. This agreement falls under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and mandates its signatories to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol acknowledges that developed countries bear a significant responsibility for the high levels of greenhouse gases currently present in the atmosphere, a consequence of over $150$ years of industrial activity. Consequently, it imposes a greater obligation on developed nations based on the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities."

In contrast, the Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change, adopted by $196$ Parties during COP $21$ in Paris on December $12, 2015$, and it officially came into force on November $4, 2016$. The primary objective of this agreement is to limit global warming to well below $2$, and preferably to $1.5$ degrees Celsius, relative to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term temperature target, countries are committed to reaching peak greenhouse gas emissions as swiftly as possible and to realizing a climate-neutral world by mid-century.

Both agreements are vital in the global battle against climate change. They embody the collective determination of the international community to confront the challenges posed by greenhouse gas emissions and their detrimental effects on our planet. However, the effectiveness of these agreements hinges on the dedication and proactive measures of all participating nations.
