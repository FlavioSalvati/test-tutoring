Pure substances are defined by their fixed composition, consistent properties, and inability to be separated into simpler substances through physical methods.

In the field of chemistry, pure substances represent a fundamental concept. These materials consist of only one type of particle, which can be an atom, molecule, or ion. This singular composition ensures that pure substances maintain a specific chemical structure. For instance, pure water is always composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, represented as $H_2O$. This characteristic distinguishes pure substances from mixtures, which can vary in composition.

One of the most significant attributes of pure substances is their consistent properties. Regardless of the source, a pure substance will exhibit the same physical and chemical characteristics. For example, pure gold will consistently possess the same density, color, melting point, and reactivity, whether it is sourced from a jewelry store in London or extracted from a mine in South Africa.

Additionally, pure substances cannot be separated into simpler substances using physical methods. This is due to the uniformity of the particles that compose a pure substance. For example, one cannot separate pure water into hydrogen and oxygen using filtration or distillation. Instead, a chemical reaction, such as electrolysis, is required to break the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

In summary, pure substances are distinguished by their fixed composition, consistent properties, and the fact that they cannot be separated through physical means. Understanding these properties is essential for various aspects of chemistry, including substance identification and predicting behavior under different conditions.
