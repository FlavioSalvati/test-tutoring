The layers in graphite can easily slide over one another due to the weak forces of attraction that exist between them.

Graphite is a distinct form of carbon characterized by its layered structure. Each layer consists of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Within each layer, the carbon atoms are held together by strong covalent bonds, which confer significant strength to the individual layers. However, the forces of attraction between these layers, known as Van der Waals forces, are relatively weak.

This weak interlayer bonding facilitates the movement of the layers, allowing them to slide past one another with ease. When an external force is applied, the layers can slip over each other, which is why graphite has a slippery texture. This property makes graphite an effective lubricant in various industrial applications. Additionally, it explains why you can write with a pencil, which contains graphite. The pressure from the pencil against the paper causes layers of graphite to detach and leave a mark.

The ability of the layers in graphite to slide over each other is a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other forms of carbon, such as diamond. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral configuration, resulting in a rigid structure that prevents layers from sliding. This contrast in structure and properties between graphite and diamond serves as a compelling illustration of how the arrangement of atoms within a material can dramatically influence its physical characteristics.
