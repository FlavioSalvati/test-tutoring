Static equilibrium occurs when forces are balanced, resulting in no movement, while dynamic equilibrium involves balanced forces with ongoing motion.

To elaborate, static equilibrium describes a condition in which all forces acting on an object are in balance, leading to no change in its motion. In this state, the object is either at rest or its center of mass is moving at a constant velocity. For instance, consider a book resting on a table. The book is in static equilibrium because the gravitational force pulling it downward is exactly countered by the normal force exerted by the table pushing it upward. Since these forces are equal and opposite, there is no net force acting on the book, and it remains stationary.

Conversely, dynamic equilibrium refers to a balance of forces in a scenario where an object is in motion. In this case, while the forces are balanced, the object continues to move. However, this motion is uniform; the object travels at a steady speed in a straight line. The balance of forces allows for this constant motion. An example of dynamic equilibrium is a car traveling at a constant speed. Here, the force of the engine is balanced by the opposing forces of friction and air resistance, resulting in a steady velocity.

In the realm of chemistry, dynamic equilibrium pertains to a state in a chemical reaction where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. In this scenario, the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time, even though the reactions continue to occur. This contrasts with static equilibrium, where no reactions take place because the reactants and products are in a stable, unchanging state.
