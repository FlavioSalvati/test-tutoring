To determine the volume of a gas collected over water, one must subtract the water vapor pressure from the total pressure of the gas mixture.

When gas is collected over water, the resulting mixture consists of both the gas and water vapor. According to Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, the total pressure of this mixture is the sum of the pressures exerted by the gas and by the water vapor. This principle states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases equals the sum of the pressures that each gas would exert if it were present alone.

The pressure of the water vapor, referred to as the vapor pressure, is temperature-dependent and can be found in standard reference tables. To isolate the pressure (and therefore the volume) of the gas alone, you need to subtract the vapor pressure of the water from the total pressure of the gas mixture.

Subsequently, the volume of the gas can be calculated using the ideal gas law, given by the equation:

$$
PV = nRT
$$

In this equation:
- $P$ represents the pressure of the gas,
- $V$ is the volume,
- $n$ denotes the number of moles of gas,
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and
- $T$ is the temperature measured in Kelvin.

It is important to ensure that the pressure is expressed in the same units as the gas constant $R$, and that the temperature is always in Kelvin. The volume calculated will correspond to the specific conditions of temperature and pressure at which the gas was collected. If you require the volume to be expressed under standard conditions, you will need to apply the combined gas law to adjust the volume accordingly.
