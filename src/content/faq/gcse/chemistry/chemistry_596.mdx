Particulate matter (PM) refers to tiny particles or droplets suspended in the air that can originate from a variety of sources.

PM encompasses a broad spectrum of particles that are small enough to be carried by air currents and inhaled into the respiratory system. These particles may be solid, liquid, or a combination of both, and they can vary significantly in size, composition, and origin. Particulate matter is typically categorized into two primary groups: PM$_{10}$ and PM$_{2.5}$. PM$_{10}$ includes particles with a diameter of $10$ micrometres or less, while PM$_{2.5}$ consists of particles with a diameter of $2.5$ micrometres or less.

The sources of particulate matter are diverse and can be classified as either natural or anthropogenic (man-made). Natural sources include dust from the Earth's surface, sea salt from oceans, pollen from plants, and particles generated by volcanic eruptions or forest fires. In contrast, anthropogenic sources primarily result from combustion processes. These include emissions from vehicles, power plants, industrial activities, and the burning of wood and other solid fuels for heating and cooking.

In urban environments, road traffic is often the most significant contributor to particulate matter. The combustion of gasoline or diesel in vehicle engines produces a variety of particles, including soot and metallic particles. Similarly, industrial activities such as metal smelting, power generation, and the manufacturing of cement, chemicals, and food can release substantial quantities of particulate matter into the atmosphere.

Additionally, particulate matter can be formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions involving gases, a process referred to as secondary particulate matter formation. For instance, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides—emitted by power plants and vehicle exhaust—can react with other atmospheric substances to produce fine particulate matter.

Understanding the sources of particulate matter is vital due to its significant impacts on air quality and human health. Elevated levels of particulate matter in the air can lead to a range of health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
