A life cycle assessment (LCA) comprises four primary stages: goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation.

The first stage, **goal and scope definition**, establishes the purpose of the study and the system boundaries. The system boundaries dictate which processes are included in the assessment. For instance, in an LCA of a plastic water bottle, you would consider the extraction of raw materials, the manufacturing of the bottle, its usage, and its disposal.

The second stage is the **inventory analysis**. This step involves gathering data on all inputs and outputs associated with the system. Inputs typically encompass raw materials and energy, while outputs may include emissions to air, water, and land. This stage can be the most time-consuming part of an LCA, as it necessitates meticulous data collection.

The third stage is the **impact assessment**, where the potential environmental impacts of the system are evaluated. These impacts could include factors such as climate change, ozone depletion, and human toxicity. During this stage, models are often employed to predict the environmental implications of the system.

The final stage is **interpretation**, in which the results from both the inventory analysis and impact assessment are analyzed to draw conclusions. This stage also seeks to identify opportunities for reducing the environmental impacts of the system. For example, if the LCA indicates that the manufacturing phase of the plastic water bottle contributes the most to environmental harm, this insight could prompt modifications in the manufacturing process to mitigate the overall impact.

In summary, a life cycle assessment is a systematic approach that evaluates the environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle, from "cradle to grave." It includes defining the goals and scope, collecting relevant data, assessing potential impacts, and interpreting the findings.
