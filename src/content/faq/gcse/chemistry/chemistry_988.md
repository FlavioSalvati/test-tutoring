Flame emission spectroscopy is a technique that analyzes the light emitted by a sample when it is heated in a flame.

In more detail, this method is employed to identify the presence and concentration of specific metal ions within a sample. The process begins by introducing the sample into a flame. As the sample is heated, the atoms absorb energy, causing their electrons to transition to higher energy levels. When these excited electrons return to their original energy states, they release energy in the form of light.

This emitted light is then directed through a spectroscope, a device that separates light into its constituent wavelengths. Each element has a unique emission spectrum characterized by specific wavelengths, forming a distinctive line spectrum. By comparing the line spectrum of the sample with known spectra of various elements, scientists can identify which elements are present.

Moreover, the intensity of the emitted light—essentially the brightness of the spectral lines—is directly proportional to the concentration of the element in the sample. Consequently, flame emission spectroscopy not only identifies the elements present but also estimates their concentrations.

This technique is widely used across various fields, including environmental monitoring, clinical analysis, and geological studies. Its advantages include simplicity, speed, and the ability to detect even trace amounts of an element in a sample. However, it is important to note that flame emission spectroscopy is limited to elements that can be vaporized in a flame, typically encompassing metals and a few non-metals.
