Energy transfer during chemical reactions is typically measured using calorimetry, a technique that quantifies the heat energy absorbed or released throughout the reaction.

Calorimetry is a scientific method employed to measure the heat exchanged during a chemical reaction. This technique is grounded in the principle of conservation of energy, which asserts that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. In a chemical reaction, energy can either be absorbed or released. The difference in energy is referred to as the enthalpy change, which is commonly expressed in joules ($J$) or kilojoules per mole ($kJ/mol$).

The most prevalent type of calorimeter used in educational settings is the simple calorimeter, often called a coffee cup calorimeter. This apparatus consists of a polystyrene cup, a lid with an opening for a thermometer, and frequently a larger container for insulation. When a reaction occurs within the cup, the heat energy transferred will either raise or lower the temperature of the solution. By measuring the temperature change and knowing the specific heat capacity of the solution, the energy transferred can be calculated.

Another variety of calorimeter is the bomb calorimeter, which is specifically designed for reactions involving combustion. In this setup, the reactants are placed in a sealed metal container, referred to as the 'bomb,' and ignited. The heat generated by the reaction is absorbed by the surrounding water, and the resulting temperature change is measured.

In both types of calorimetry, it is crucial to consider potential sources of error. Heat loss to the surroundings can lead to an underestimation of the energy transferred. Therefore, insulation is employed, and measurements should be taken promptly. Despite possible errors, calorimetry remains a valuable tool for accurately measuring energy transfer during chemical reactions.
