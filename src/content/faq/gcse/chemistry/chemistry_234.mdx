The Rf value in chromatography is defined as the ratio of the distance traveled by a substance to the distance traveled by the solvent front.

In the context of chromatography, the Rf value, or Retention Factor, is an essential concept. It is a numerical representation of how far a substance moves relative to the solvent in a chromatography system. The Rf value is calculated using the formula:

$$
Rf = \frac{\text{Distance traveled by the substance}}{\text{Distance traveled by the solvent}}
$$

Specifically, this involves measuring the distance from the baseline to the center of the substance spot for the numerator, and the distance from the baseline to the solvent front for the denominator.

The Rf value serves as a characteristic property of a specific substance and can be utilized to identify unknown substances by comparing their Rf values with those of known substances, provided the chromatography conditions remain consistent. It is important to note that the Rf value is always less than or equal to $1$, since a substance cannot travel farther than the solvent front.

Several factors can influence the Rf value, including the type of solvent used, the temperature during the experiment, and the nature of the chromatography medium, such as the type of paper. Therefore, when comparing Rf values, it is crucial to maintain constant experimental conditions to ensure accurate comparisons.

In summary, the Rf value is a vital tool in chromatography, offering a quantitative measure of a substance's movement and aiding in the identification of unknown substances. Understanding and applying the concept of Rf is fundamental for your GCSE Chemistry studies.
