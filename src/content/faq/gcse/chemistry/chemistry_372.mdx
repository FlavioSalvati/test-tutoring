Alloys generally exhibit greater strength compared to pure metals due to their more intricate atomic structure, which enhances their resistance to deformation.

Pure metals are composed of identical atoms arranged in a consistent, repeating pattern. This uniform arrangement allows the atomic layers to easily slide over one another, leading to deformation when stress is applied. Conversely, alloys consist of two or more different types of atoms. The variation in size and properties of these atoms disrupts the orderly atomic arrangement, making it more difficult for the layers to slide past each other. Consequently, alloys demonstrate increased resistance to deformation, rendering them stronger than their pure metal counterparts.

The process of creating an alloy involves combining a primary metal with one or more additional elements. These supplementary elements can be other metals or non-metals, such as carbon. The atoms of these additional elements can either occupy the spaces between the primary metal atoms or replace some of those atoms. This disruption of the regular atomic arrangement results in a more complex structure.

For instance, steel is an alloy composed of iron and carbon. The carbon atoms are significantly smaller than the iron atoms, allowing them to fit into the interstitial spaces within the iron lattice. This interference with the regular arrangement of iron atoms makes it more challenging for the layers to glide over each other, which is why steel is substantially stronger than pure iron.

In addition to enhancing strength, alloying can also improve various other properties of metals. For example, it can increase resistance to corrosion, enhance heat resistance, or alter the color of the metal. These characteristics make alloys incredibly versatile and valuable across a wide array of applications, including construction, transportation, jewelry, and electronics.
