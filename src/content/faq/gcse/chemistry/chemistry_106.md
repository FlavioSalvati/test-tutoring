To standardize a solution for titration, it is essential to accurately determine its concentration using a solution with a known concentration, referred to as the standard solution.

Standardization itself is a specific process within titration, a laboratory technique used for quantitative chemical analysis to ascertain the concentration of a specific substance, known as the analyte. The standard solution is the one with a known concentration, while the solution whose concentration is to be determined is called the analyte.

The first step in this process is the preparation of the standard solution. Typically, a strong acid or base is used, as these substances fully dissociate in water, allowing for a precise determination of concentration. To prepare the standard solution, you must accurately weigh a pure sample of the solid acid or base, dissolve it in a known volume of distilled water, and then transfer it to a volumetric flask to achieve a final known volume.

Once the standard solution is prepared, you can proceed to perform the titration. This involves adding the standard solution from a burette into a known volume of the analyte, which is contained in a conical flask. The addition continues until the reaction between the two solutions reaches completion, which is typically indicated by a color change from a pH indicator. This indicator is a substance that changes color at the endpoint of the reaction.

After determining the volume of the standard solution required to completely react with the analyte, you can calculate the concentration of the analyte using the following formula:

$$
\text{Concentration of analyte} = \frac{\text{Concentration of standard solution} \times \text{Volume of standard solution}}{\text{Volume of analyte}}
$$

To ensure accuracy, this titration process may need to be repeated several times. The average of the results from these trials will provide the most reliable estimate of the analyte's concentration. This is the procedure for standardizing a solution in titration.
