An endothermic reaction is a type of chemical process that absorbs heat energy from its surroundings.

To elaborate, endothermic reactions require energy in the form of heat to proceed. This heat is drawn from the surrounding environment, which results in a decrease in temperature in that area. Consequently, these reactions often feel cold to the touch.

The term 'endothermic' is derived from the Greek words 'endo', meaning "inside," and 'therm', meaning "heat." Thus, endothermic reactions can be understood as processes that take in heat. This is in contrast to exothermic reactions, which release heat into their surroundings.

In an endothermic reaction, the energy necessary to break the bonds in the reactants exceeds the energy released when new bonds are formed in the products. This excess energy is absorbed from the surroundings in the form of heat. A classic example of an endothermic reaction is photosynthesis in plants, where light energy from the sun is absorbed to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.

Endothermic reactions are significant in various fields of chemistry and everyday life. For instance, they are utilized in cold packs for injuries, where the chemical reaction absorbs heat from the body, providing a cooling effect to the affected area. Additionally, these reactions are essential in meteorology; the evaporation of water from oceans is an endothermic process that contributes to cloud and rain formation.

Understanding endothermic reactions is crucial for grasping energy changes in chemical processes. It is important to remember that energy is conserved in all chemical reactions. In the case of endothermic reactions, energy is transferred from the surroundings to the reaction itself.
