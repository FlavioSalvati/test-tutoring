Greenhouse gases are essential for regulating heat within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to an increase in the planet's average temperature.

Key greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), and nitrous oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$), play a vital role in maintaining the Earth's temperature balance. These gases allow sunlight, or solar energy, to penetrate the atmosphere freely. When this energy reaches the Earth's surface, it is transformed into heat, which then rises back into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap a portion of this heat, preventing it from escaping into space and instead re-radiating it in all directions. This mechanism is referred to as the greenhouse effect.

In the absence of greenhouse gases, much of the heat would escape, resulting in an average temperature of approximately $-18$ degrees Celsius. Such a low temperature would be inhospitable for most forms of life. Thus, greenhouse gases are crucial for our survival. However, challenges arise when the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere escalates.

Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heating, and transportation, alongside deforestation, have markedly increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. This intensification of the greenhouse effect is responsible for the rising average temperature of the Earth, a phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming.

Global warming triggers climate change, which can lead to extreme weather events, including more frequent and severe storms, heatwaves, and intense rainfall. Additionally, it can cause sea levels to rise, resulting in coastal flooding and the destruction of habitats for numerous species.

In conclusion, while greenhouse gases are indispensable for maintaining the Earth's temperature, their excessive accumulation due to human activities is driving the planet's warming, which may lead to significant and potentially devastating changes in our climate.
