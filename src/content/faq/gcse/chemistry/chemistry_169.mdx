The rate of a chemical reaction is determined by measuring the change in concentration of either the reactants or the products over a specified period of time.

To elaborate, the rate of a chemical reaction indicates how swiftly the reactants are consumed or how quickly the products are generated. This rate is typically quantified by assessing the change in concentration of a particular reactant or product over a defined time interval. The standard unit for reaction rate is expressed in moles per liter per second, denoted as $\text{mol/L/s}$; however, it can be represented in various other units, depending on the specific reaction being studied.

To compute the rate of a reaction, one needs to observe the concentration of either a reactant or a product as the reaction progresses. This can be accomplished using a variety of techniques, such as titration, spectroscopy, or by monitoring observable physical changes like color shifts or volume variations. Once you have collected the relevant measurements, you can determine the rate of reaction by dividing the change in concentration by the change in time.

For instance, if the concentration of a reactant decreases by $0.5 \, \text{mol/L}$ over a period of $10 \, \text{s}$, the rate of reaction can be calculated as follows: 

$$ \text{Rate} = \frac{\Delta[\text{Reactant}]}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.5 \, \text{mol/L}}{10 \, \text{s}} = 0.05 \, \text{mol/L/s}. $$

It is crucial to acknowledge that the rate of a chemical reaction can change over time. Many reactions tend to slow down as the reactants are depleted. This decrease in rate occurs because there are fewer particles available to interact with one another. Consequently, the reaction rate is often highest at the beginning of the reaction.

Moreover, several factors can influence the rate of a chemical reaction, including temperature, the concentration of reactants, the surface area of solid reactants, and the presence of catalysts. Understanding these factors is essential for predicting and controlling the rates of chemical reactions effectively.
