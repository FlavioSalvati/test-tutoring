The behavior of particles varies significantly across the three states of matter: solids, liquids, and gases. 

In solids, particles are densely packed in a regular arrangement and possess the least amount of energy compared to their counterparts in liquids and gases. They vibrate around fixed positions but lack sufficient energy to change their location. This characteristic is why solids maintain a definite shape and volume. The strong forces of attraction between the particles hold them closely together, permitting only vibrational movement about their fixed points.

In contrast, particles in liquids have more energy than those in solids, allowing them to move freely around one another while still remaining relatively close. Although the particles in a liquid are still in close proximity, they can slide past each other, which enables liquids to flow and adopt the shape of their container. The forces of attraction between liquid particles are weaker than those in solids but stronger than those found in gases.

In the gaseous state, particles possess the highest energy levels and are spaced far apart. They move rapidly in all directions and have enough energy to overcome any attractive forces between them. This explains why gases expand to fill their containers, regardless of the container's shape or volume. The forces of attraction among gas particles are very weak or nearly nonexistent, allowing them to move freely and swiftly.

In summary, the behavior of particles across solids, liquids, and gases is primarily influenced by their energy levels and the strength of the forces of attraction between them. As the energy of the particles increases, their ability to move increases, and as the forces of attraction weaken, the particles can become more dispersed.
