Water plays a crucial role in condensation polymerization, primarily as a by-product produced during the reaction.

Condensation polymerization is a specific type of polymerization where monomers or reactants, each possessing two functional groups, react to form a polymer along with a small molecule, typically water. This process is significant because the elimination of water is integral to the reaction.

The polymerization process begins with the interaction between two different bi-functional or tri-functional monomer units. Each monomer has two reactive sites, allowing them to connect to either end of another monomer. As the reaction progresses, these monomers link together, resulting in the loss of small molecules. The most common form of condensation polymerization involves the reaction between a dicarboxylic acid and a diol, leading to the formation of a polyester and water.

The formation of the water molecule occurs through the elimination of a hydrogen atom from one reactive site and a hydroxyl group from the other. This elimination process is why it is referred to as "condensation" polymerization; the reaction involves the condensation, or removal, of a water molecule.

Moreover, the continuous production of water serves to drive the reaction toward completion. In a closed system, the reaction would eventually reach an equilibrium state, where the rates of the forward (polymerization) and reverse (depolymerization) reactions are equal. However, the ongoing removal of water, a product of the reaction, shifts the equilibrium toward the polymerization direction, in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle. This principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by altering the conditions, the equilibrium position will adjust to counteract the change. Thus, the production and removal of water are essential for ensuring that the reaction continues until all monomers are consumed.

In summary, water is not only a by-product of condensation polymerization but also a critical driving force that facilitates the progression of the reaction.
