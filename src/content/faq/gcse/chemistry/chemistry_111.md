Temperature has a direct impact on the volume of a gas: when the temperature increases, the volume of the gas also increases, and vice versa.

This relationship is further elucidated by the kinetic theory of gases. According to this theory, gases consist of a vast number of tiny particles that are in constant, random motion. The temperature of a gas is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of these particles. As the temperature of a gas rises, the kinetic energy of the particles increases as well. This leads to faster particle movement, resulting in more frequent and forceful collisions against the walls of their container. Such increased collisions cause the gas to expand in volume.

On the other hand, when the temperature of a gas decreases, the kinetic energy of the particles also diminishes. The particles then move more slowly, leading to fewer and less forceful collisions against the container walls. Consequently, the volume of the gas decreases.

This fundamental relationship between temperature and volume is encapsulated in Charles's Law. Named after Jacques Charles, who first articulated the principle in the 1780s, Charles's Law states that the volume of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the absolute temperature scale (Kelvin), provided that the pressure remains constant. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

$$ V \propto T $$

This implies that if you double the temperature of a gas, you will also double its volume, as long as the pressure is maintained at a constant level.

In practical terms, this means that when you heat a balloon, it expands as the volume of the gas inside increases. Conversely, cooling the balloon causes it to shrink as the gas volume decreases. This principle is applied in various everyday scenarios, such as in hot air balloons and refrigeration systems.
