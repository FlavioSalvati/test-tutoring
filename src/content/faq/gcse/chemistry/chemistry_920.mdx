Formulations are complex mixtures composed of various components, while pure substances consist exclusively of a single type of particle.

Formulations are intentionally crafted mixtures designed to possess specific properties. They are created by carefully combining different components in precise proportions to ensure that the final product exhibits the desired characteristics. Examples of formulations include paints, medicines, cleaning products, and fuels. Each of these formulations comprises multiple substances that work synergistically to fulfill a particular function. For instance, paint is a formulation that includes a pigment for color, a binder to secure the pigment, and a solvent to dilute the paint, facilitating its application.

In contrast, pure substances are materials composed solely of one type of particle. These particles can be individual atoms, such as helium ($\text{He}$) or neon ($\text{Ne}$), or they can be molecules, like water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) or carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$). Pure substances exhibit fixed physical and chemical properties, including boiling point, melting point, and density. They cannot be separated into their constituent parts through physical methods; rather, they can only be decomposed via chemical reactions. For example, water is a pure substance that can be separated into hydrogen and oxygen through the process of electrolysis.

In summary, the primary distinction between formulations and pure substances lies in their composition: formulations are mixtures of various components, each contributing to the overall properties of the product, while pure substances consist of only one type of particle and possess fixed properties. Understanding this difference is vital in fields such as pharmaceuticals—where formulations are used to deliver drugs effectively—and materials science, where pure substances often serve as fundamental building blocks to create new materials with tailored properties.
