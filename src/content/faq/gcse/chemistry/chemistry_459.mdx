Dalton's law of partial pressures can be applied to gas volumes by treating each gas as if it were the only gas present in the container.

According to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures that each individual gas would exert if it were occupying the container alone. This principle is grounded in the notion that gas particles are extremely small relative to the distances separating them, allowing us to consider the volume of each gas particle as negligible.

When applying Dalton's law to gas volumes, it is essential to account for both the volume of the container and the amounts of each gas present. Each gas in the mixture behaves independently of the others, which means that the contribution of each gas to the total pressure—referred to as its partial pressure—is proportional to the fraction of the total volume it occupies.

For instance, consider a container with a total volume of $10 \, \text{litres}$ that contains two gases, A and B. If gas A occupies $7 \, \text{litres}$ while gas B occupies $3 \, \text{litres}$, then gas A contributes $70\%$ of the total pressure, while gas B contributes $30\%$.

To calculate the partial pressure of each gas, you can multiply the total pressure by the volume fraction of each gas. For example, if the total pressure in the container is $100 \, \text{kPa}$, the partial pressure of gas A would be $70 \, \text{kPa}$ and the partial pressure of gas B would be $30 \, \text{kPa}$.

It is important to note that Dalton's law assumes that the gases do not chemically react with one another and that they behave ideally. This means that the gases conform to the ideal gas law under all conditions of temperature and pressure. In reality, gases may exhibit deviations from ideal behavior, particularly at high pressures and low temperatures. However, for many practical applications, Dalton's law serves as a valuable approximation.
