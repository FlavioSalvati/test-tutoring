Proteins are large biomolecules composed of chains of smaller units known as amino acids.

These proteins are essential components of all living cells and encompass various substances, including enzymes, hormones, and antibodies, which are crucial for the proper functioning of an organism. In the animal diet, proteins play a vital role in growth and tissue repair, and they can be sourced from foods such as meat, fish, eggs, milk, and legumes.

Amino acids are organic compounds that link together to form proteins. When proteins undergo digestion or breakdown, they release amino acids, which the human body utilizes to synthesize proteins necessary for various functions, including food metabolism, growth, and tissue repair. Additionally, amino acids can serve as an energy source for the body.

There are $20$ distinct types of amino acids that can combine to form proteins. The specific sequence of these amino acids determines each protein's unique three-dimensional structure and its corresponding function. Proteins can be categorized based on their diverse functions in the body, which include: Adhesion, Antibody, Catalytic, Channel, Enzyme, Messenger, Structural component, and Transport, listed in alphabetical order.

The structure of a protein is dictated by the sequence of amino acids in its polypeptide chains. This amino acid sequence is determined by the arrangement of nucleotides in the gene that encodes the protein. The relationship between an mRNA codon and its associated amino acid is referred to as the genetic code.

In summary, proteins are constructed from amino acids, and the order of these amino acids dictates both the structure and function of each protein. This concept is fundamental to the fields of biology and biochemistry.
