Transition metals exhibit unique interactions with ligands through a process known as ligand substitution, leading to the formation of coordination complexes.

These metals are distinctive because they can form complexes with ligands, primarily due to the presence of d-orbitals that can accept pairs of electrons from the ligands. Ligand substitution occurs when one ligand replaces another in a coordination complex. Ligands, which can be either ions or molecules, donate a pair of electrons to the transition metal, creating a coordinate bond, also referred to as a dative covalent bond.

The capacity of a transition metal to bond with ligands is defined by its coordination number. For instance, a transition metal with a coordination number of $6$ can coordinate with $6$ ligands, resulting in a coordination complex characterized by a central metal atom or ion surrounded by these ligands. The arrangement of ligands can lead to various geometric shapes, such as octahedral, tetrahedral, or square planar, depending on the coordination number and the spatial configuration of the ligands.

The interaction between transition metals and ligands also influences the color of the resulting complexes. When light is absorbed by these complexes, electrons in the d-orbitals are excited to higher energy levels. The specific wavelengths of light that are absorbed correspond to particular colors, which accounts for the wide variety of colors observed in transition metal complexes.

Additionally, the type of ligand plays a crucial role in determining the properties of the complex, including its color and stability. This is explained by the 'spectrochemical series', which ranks ligands based on their ability to split the d-orbitals of the transition metal. Ligands that are positioned at one end of the series tend to cause a large energy split, resulting in low-spin complexes, while those at the opposite end induce a smaller energy split, leading to high-spin complexes. Understanding this concept is essential for grasping the behavior of transition metals in coordination with ligands.
