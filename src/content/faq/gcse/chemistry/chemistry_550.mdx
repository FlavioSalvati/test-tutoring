Chlorine gas can be effectively collected for testing through the method known as the upward displacement of air in a gas jar.

In laboratory settings, chlorine gas is typically generated by reacting a strong acid with a chloride salt. A common example is the reaction between hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide, which produces chlorine gas according to the following chemical equation:

$$
\text{MnO}_2 + 4\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{MnCl}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Cl}_2
$$

To collect the chlorine gas, a delivery tube is used to direct the gas into an inverted gas jar that is submerged in a trough of water. Since chlorine is denser than air, it displaces the air in the jar from the bottom upwards, making this technique effective for gas collection.

It is crucial to remember that chlorine is a toxic gas and can be harmful if inhaled. Therefore, this experiment should only be carried out in a well-ventilated area, ideally under a fume hood, and always accompanied by proper safety precautions.

Once the gas jar is filled with chlorine gas, a glass lid can be placed on top to seal the jar. The collected gas can then be utilized for various experiments, such as testing its reactivity with different substances or observing its effects on litmus paper.

When handling chlorine gas, it is imperative to wear safety goggles and gloves to protect your eyes and skin from potential harm. Always prioritize safety when conducting experiments with hazardous materials.
