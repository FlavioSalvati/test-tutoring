Alkanes and alkenes are two distinct types of hydrocarbons, which are compounds composed solely of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The primary difference between them lies in their bonding structure and resulting properties. 

Alkanes are classified as saturated hydrocarbons, meaning they contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. This saturation allows alkanes to possess the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms. The general formula for alkanes can be expressed as:

$$
\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n+2}
$$

where $n$ represents the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.

In contrast, alkenes are categorized as unsaturated hydrocarbons because they contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond. This presence of a double bond results in fewer hydrogen atoms compared to alkanes. The existence of the double bond not only alters the hydrogen count but also influences the chemical behavior of alkenes, making them more reactive than alkanes. Alkenes can undergo addition reactions, where other atoms or molecules attach across the double bond. The general formula for alkenes is given by:

$$
\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}
$$

The differences in bonding structures also lead to variations in the physical properties of alkanes and alkenes. Generally, alkanes are less dense than water, exhibit low melting and boiling points, and are insoluble in water. Alkenes, due to their double bonds, typically have slightly higher melting and boiling points than their alkane counterparts with the same number of carbon atoms.

Regarding their applications, alkanes are frequently utilized as fuels; for instance, propane and butane are commonly used in gas barbecues and camping stoves. On the other hand, alkenes are valuable for their reactivity and are often employed in the manufacturing of polymers, such as plastics, as well as various other chemicals. 

Understanding the differences between alkanes and alkenes is essential in organic chemistry, as it aids in predicting the properties and reactions of these compounds.
