Atom economy is a key measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction, specifically quantifying how much of the starting materials are transformed into useful products.

In more detail, atom economy is a fundamental concept in green chemistry that assesses the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Atom Economy} = \left( \frac{\text{Molecular mass of desired products}}{\text{Molecular mass of all products}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

This formula expresses atom economy as a percentage. A higher atom economy indicates that less waste is produced, thereby making the reaction more environmentally friendly.

For instance, if a reaction involves a single reactant that completely converts into a single product, the atom economy is $100\%$. Conversely, if a reaction involves multiple reactants and/or yields several products—some of which may be undesirable—the atom economy will be less than $100\%$.

Understanding atom economy is crucial in the field of sustainable chemistry. It motivates chemists to design reactions that maximize the conversion of reactants into useful products while minimizing waste. This approach not only benefits the environment but also enhances cost-effectiveness by reducing expenses associated with unused reactants and waste disposal.

Moreover, atom economy can serve as an indicator for predicting the yield of a reaction. Generally, a reaction with a high atom economy is expected to have a high yield since a greater proportion of the reactants is converted into the desired product. However, it is important to keep in mind that atom economy does not account for side reactions or any losses that may occur during the process, which means that the actual yield may end up being lower than anticipated.
