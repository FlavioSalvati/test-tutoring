Transition metals are frequently employed as catalysts due to their ability to accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed in the process.

These metals, which include elements like iron, copper, and nickel, possess a distinctive electronic configuration that enables them to speed up reactions effectively. One key feature of transition metals is their multiple oxidation states, allowing them to easily donate or accept electrons. This characteristic enhances their capacity to facilitate interactions between different substances.

In a chemical reaction, a catalyst functions by providing an alternative pathway that has a lower activation energy. The activation energy, denoted as $E_a$, represents the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur. By reducing this energy barrier, a catalyst enables the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. Transition metals excel in this role because they can form stable intermediate compounds with the reactants, which contributes to lowering the activation energy.

Additionally, transition metals are not consumed during the reactions they catalyze. They can assist in the reaction without being depleted, allowing them to continue facilitating the process as long as reactants are available. This property makes them particularly efficient and cost-effective as catalysts.

Another advantage of transition metals as catalysts is their ability to adsorb other substances onto their surfaces. Adsorption refers to the process in which atoms, ions, or molecules from one substance adhere to the surface of another. This increases the concentration of reactants at the catalyst's surface, thereby enhancing the reaction rate.

In summary, the unique properties of transition metals—including their multiple oxidation states, the ability to form stable intermediates, and their adsorption capabilities—render them highly effective catalysts in various chemical reactions.
