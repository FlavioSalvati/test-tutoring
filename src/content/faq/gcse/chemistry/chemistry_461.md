A notable example of a reduction reaction involving metals is the extraction of iron from its ore in a blast furnace.

During the extraction of iron from its ore, a reduction reaction occurs within the blast furnace. The primary component of iron ore is iron oxide, which is reduced by carbon in the form of coke. In this context, carbon serves as the reducing agent, meaning it donates electrons to the iron oxide. This chemical process can be represented by the following equation:

$$
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{C} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}.
$$

In this reaction, iron oxide ($\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) is reduced to elemental iron ($\text{Fe}$), while carbon ($\text{C}$) is oxidized to carbon monoxide ($\text{CO}$). This scenario exemplifies a redox reaction, where reduction and oxidation happen simultaneously. The resultant iron is in its elemental form and can be utilized in various industrial applications.

This extraction process is fundamental to metallurgy, as reduction reactions are essential for obtaining metals from their ores. It is important to recognize that not all metals can be extracted using carbon as a reducing agent. For instance, more reactive metals, such as aluminium and potassium, require alternative extraction methods.

Understanding these reactions is vital for GCSE Chemistry students, as it lays the groundwork for many industrial processes and constitutes a key concept in the study of redox reactions.
