Examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid.

Strong acids are defined as substances that completely ionize in water, meaning they fully dissociate into their respective ions. This behavior stands in contrast to weak acids, which only partially ionize. The strength of an acid is determined by the degree to which it ionizes in water.

**Hydrochloric Acid ($\text{HCl}$)** is a common example of a strong acid. It is widely used in laboratories and various industries for purposes such as cleaning metal surfaces and processing leather. When dissolved in water, hydrochloric acid completely ionizes, resulting in the formation of hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$).

**Sulfuric Acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$)** is another prominent strong acid, extensively utilized in the production of fertilizers, dyes, and detergents. It also plays a crucial role in car batteries. Upon dissolving in water, sulfuric acid fully dissociates into two hydrogen ions ($2\text{H}^+$) and one sulfate ion ($\text{SO}_4^{2-}$).

**Nitric Acid ($\text{HNO}_3$)** is a strong acid frequently employed in the manufacture of fertilizers and explosives, as well as in etching and metal cleaning processes. In aqueous solution, nitric acid completely ionizes to yield a hydrogen ion ($\text{H}^+$) and a nitrate ion ($\text{NO}_3^-$).

It is important to note that the term "strong" refers to the acid's ability to ionize in water, rather than its concentration. Even a dilute solution of a strong acid will fully ionize. Additionally, these acids should be handled with caution, as they can be corrosive and potentially harmful.
