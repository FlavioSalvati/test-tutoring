The volume of gas generated during electrolysis is typically measured using either a gas syringe or an inverted measuring cylinder.

In a standard electrolysis experiment, the setup consists of an electrolyte (the substance being electrolyzed) and two electrodes. When an electric current is passed through the electrolyte, it initiates a chemical reaction that produces gas at one or both electrodes. To quantify the volume of this gas, researchers can utilize either a gas syringe or an inverted measuring cylinder.

A gas syringe is a specialized apparatus resembling a large syringe equipped with a tight seal, which can be connected to the electrode where the gas is being generated. As gas is produced, it forces the plunger of the syringe outward, allowing the volume of gas to be read from the scale on the side of the syringe. This method is highly accurate; however, it may encounter issues if an excessive amount of gas is produced too rapidly, potentially causing the syringe to stick.

Alternatively, an inverted measuring cylinder can be employed to measure the volume of gas produced. In this method, the cylinder is filled with water and then inverted in a water trough, with the open end submerged beneath the water's surface. A tube is connected from the electrode, allowing the gas produced to flow into the cylinder. As the gas bubbles into the cylinder, it displaces the water inside, and the volume of gas can be determined by measuring the decrease in the water level within the cylinder.

Both measurement methods require careful handling to ensure accurate results. It is crucial to prevent any gas from escaping before taking measurements and to ensure that volume readings are obtained at consistent temperature and pressure conditions, as gas volumes can fluctuate with changes in temperature and pressure.
