Carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in the greenhouse effect by trapping heat from the Sun within the Earth's atmosphere.

As one of the primary greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) significantly influences the greenhouse effect, which is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When solar energy reaches the Earth's atmosphere, a portion of it is reflected back into space, while the remaining energy is absorbed by the Earth and subsequently re-emitted by greenhouse gases.

CO2, along with other greenhouse gases such as methane ($\text{CH}_4$) and water vapor ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), absorbs and retains this heat, preventing it from escaping back into space. This mechanism of heat absorption and re-emission is essential for warming our planet's surface, making it suitable for life. However, an increase in the concentration of these gases can lead to excessive heat retention, resulting in global warming.

Human activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels—including coal, oil, and natural gas—have significantly raised the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. This rise in CO2 enhances the greenhouse effect, contributing to an increase in the Earth's average temperature, a phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. Additionally, deforestation amplifies CO2 levels since trees absorb CO2 and release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. When trees are removed, not only is this beneficial process diminished, but the carbon stored in their biomass is also released back into the atmosphere.

In conclusion, CO2 contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing heat from the Sun and preventing its escape into space. While this process is vital for sustaining life on Earth, an excess of CO2 resulting from human activities is intensifying the greenhouse effect and driving global warming.
