To prepare a solution with a specific concentration, you must dissolve a precise quantity of solute in a defined volume of solvent.

### Understanding Molarity

First, it's important to grasp the concept of molarity, which quantifies concentration. Molarity ($M$) is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The formula for calculating molarity is given by:

$$
M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}
$$

### Example: Preparing a 1M Sodium Chloride Solution

To illustrate, suppose you want to prepare a $1M$ solution of sodium chloride (NaCl). The molar mass of NaCl is $58.44 \, g/mol$. Therefore, to achieve this concentration, you would need to dissolve $58.44 \, g$ of NaCl in one liter of water.

### Steps to Prepare a Solution of Specific Concentration

1. **Calculate the Required Amount of Solute**: Use the formula 
   $$
   \text{mass} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} \times \text{Molar mass}
   $$
   to determine the mass of solute needed.
   
2. **Weigh the Solute**: Using a balance, accurately weigh the calculated amount of solute.

3. **Dissolve the Solute**: In a beaker, dissolve the solute in a small volume of solvent.

4. **Transfer to Volumetric Flask**: Carefully pour the solution into a volumetric flask.

5. **Adjust the Volume**: Add additional solvent until the solution reaches the mark on the flask, ensuring the total volume is correct.

6. **Mix Thoroughly**: Stopper the flask and shake it well to ensure the solute is completely dissolved.

### Safety Precautions

Always prioritize safety when handling chemicals. It is essential to wear protective clothing, including gloves and goggles, and to work in a well-ventilated area. If you have any doubts or questions, do not hesitate to consult your teacher or lab supervisor for guidance.
