The test for carbon dioxide gas is a straightforward and widely utilized method in chemistry. It involves passing the gas through limewater, which is a solution of calcium hydroxide. When carbon dioxide is introduced into limewater, a chemical reaction occurs that results in the formation of calcium carbonate, an insoluble compound that manifests as a milky precipitate. This transition from a clear solution to a milky appearance serves as a positive indication of the presence of carbon dioxide.

The chemical reaction can be represented by the following equation:

$$
\text{CO}_2 (g) + \text{Ca(OH)}_2 (aq) \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3 (s) + \text{H}_2\text{O} (l)
$$

In this equation, $\text{CO}_2$ denotes carbon dioxide, $\text{Ca(OH)}_2$ represents calcium hydroxide (the component of limewater), $\text{CaCO}_3$ is calcium carbonate (the resulting milky precipitate), and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ is water.

This test is highly specific to carbon dioxide and does not yield the same result when exposed to other gases, making it a reliable method for confirming the presence of carbon dioxide in a gas sample. However, it is important to recognize that the limewater test only indicates whether carbon dioxide is present; it does not provide information about its concentration. For precise measurements of carbon dioxide concentration, more advanced analytical equipment would be required.

In a practical laboratory setting, you can conduct this test by collecting the gas you suspect contains carbon dioxide and bubbling it through a test tube or container filled with limewater. If the limewater turns milky, it confirms the presence of carbon dioxide. Conversely, if the limewater remains clear, it indicates that the gas does not contain carbon dioxide. This simple yet effective test can be easily performed in a school laboratory using basic equipment.
