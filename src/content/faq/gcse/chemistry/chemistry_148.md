During the electrolysis of aqueous solutions, an electric current is passed through the solution to induce a chemical reaction.

Electrolysis is a process that utilizes an electric current to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. In the context of aqueous solutions, this process entails the decomposition of specific molecules within the solution into their elemental constituents. Typically, the solution consists of a salt dissolved in water, and the water itself can also be dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen.

The electrolysis process begins by establishing a circuit that includes a power source, two electrodes (commonly made from inert materials such as platinum or graphite), and the aqueous solution. The electrodes are submerged in the solution and connected to the power source. Once the power is activated, an electric current flows through the circuit.

In this setup, positive ions in the solution are attracted to the negative electrode, known as the cathode, where they undergo reduction by gaining electrons. Conversely, negative ions migrate toward the positive electrode, called the anode, where they experience oxidation by losing electrons. This movement of ions creates the electric current within the solution.

For instance, in a solution of copper sulfate, represented as $CuSO_4$, the copper ions ($Cu^{2+}$) are drawn to the cathode, where they gain electrons and deposit as solid copper metal. Meanwhile, the sulfate ions ($SO_4^{2-}$) are attracted to the anode, but water is preferentially oxidized, leading to the production of oxygen gas.

The electrolysis of aqueous solutions plays a crucial role in numerous industrial applications, such as the production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide from brine (saltwater), the purification of copper, and the generation of hydrogen for fuel cells. Furthermore, it serves as a fundamental concept in chemistry, illustrating key principles about the behavior of ions, electric currents, and chemical reactions.
