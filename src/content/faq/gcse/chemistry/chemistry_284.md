Wastewater treatment consists of four key stages: preliminary treatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, and tertiary treatment.

The first stage is **preliminary treatment**, which focuses on the removal of large debris and grit (such as sand and small stones) present in the wastewater. Large objects are eliminated using screens, while grit is removed in grit chambers. This initial step is critical, as the presence of these materials can lead to damage and excessive wear on the equipment used in the subsequent stages of the treatment process.

The second stage is **primary treatment**, which involves the separation of organic and inorganic solids from the wastewater. This separation occurs through a process called sedimentation, where the wastewater is allowed to rest in a large tank known as a primary sedimentation tank. In this tank, heavier solids settle to the bottom, forming a layer of sludge, while lighter materials, such as oils and fats, float to the surface, creating a layer of scum. Both the sludge and scum are subsequently removed, allowing the remaining liquid to proceed to the next stage.

The third stage is **secondary treatment**, aimed at degrading the organic content of the wastewater, which may originate from human waste, food waste, soaps, and detergents. This is accomplished through the action of microorganisms that consume the organic waste, converting it into carbon dioxide, water, and energy. This biological process takes place in aeration tanks, where air is introduced to promote the growth of these microorganisms.

The final stage is **tertiary treatment**. Although not always included in the treatment process, when it is, this step focuses on the removal of any remaining inorganic compounds and pathogens. Various methods are employed for this purpose, including filtration, lagooning, nutrient removal, and disinfection. After undergoing tertiary treatment, the purified water can be safely discharged back into the environment or reused for applications such as irrigation or industrial cooling.
