When halogens react with hydrogen, they produce hydrogen halides, which are colorless gases with acidic properties.

Halogens consist of five chemically similar elements: fluorine ($\text{F}$), chlorine ($\text{Cl}$), bromine ($\text{Br}$), iodine ($\text{I}$), and astatine ($\text{At}$). When these elements react with hydrogen ($\text{H}$), they form compounds known as hydrogen halides. These reactions are typically exothermic, meaning they release energy in the form of heat.

For instance, when hydrogen reacts with chlorine, the resulting product is hydrogen chloride ($\text{HCl}$), a colorless gas characterized by its pungent odor. This reaction can be represented by the equation:

$$
\text{H}_2 + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HCl}
$$

Similarly, when hydrogen reacts with bromine, it produces hydrogen bromide ($\text{HBr}$) according to the equation:

$$
\text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HBr}
$$

This pattern continues for reactions involving other halogens.

Hydrogen halides exhibit acidic properties. When these gases dissolve in water, they form hydrohalic acids. For example, when hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water, it produces hydrochloric acid, a strong acid widely used in laboratories and industrial applications.

The reactivity of halogens with hydrogen decreases as you move down the group. Fluorine, located at the top, is the most reactive and can react explosively with hydrogen even under cold and dark conditions. Chlorine also reacts with hydrogen but at a slower rate, often requiring a catalyst or light to initiate the reaction. Bromine and iodine are less reactive and typically require heat to initiate their reactions with hydrogen.

In conclusion, the reaction of halogens with hydrogen yields hydrogen halides, which are colorless gases with acidic properties. The reactivity of halogens diminishes as you descend the group, with fluorine being the most reactive element.
