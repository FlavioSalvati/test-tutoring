Polymers are large molecules composed of repeating subunits, known as monomers, which are linked together to form a chain.

Polymers represent a fundamental concept in chemistry, particularly within the realm of organic chemistry. The term "polymer" originates from the Greek words "poly," meaning "many," and "meros," meaning "parts." This nomenclature reflects the composition of polymers, which consist of numerous repeating units called monomers. These monomers are small, simple molecules that can chemically bond to create larger, more complex structures.

The process of synthesizing a polymer from monomers is referred to as polymerization. There are two primary types of polymerization: addition polymerization and condensation polymerization. In addition polymerization, monomers combine to form a polymer without generating any other byproducts. Conversely, in condensation polymerization, two different types of monomers react to form a polymer while simultaneously releasing a small molecule, often water.

Polymers exhibit a diverse array of properties and applications, which are influenced by the types of monomers used and the manner in which they are linked. For instance, plastics—widely utilized in everyday life for applications ranging from packaging to automotive components—are a prominent category of polymers. Other significant examples include proteins, DNA, and cellulose, all of which are essential for biological functions.

The structural arrangement of a polymer can significantly impact its physical properties. For example, if the polymer chains are densely packed and strongly bonded, the resulting material will be hard and rigid. Conversely, if the chains are loosely arranged and connected by weaker bonds, the polymer will possess a softer and more flexible nature. This variation in structure is why polymers are found in an extensive range of materials, from rubber to glass.

In summary, polymers are large, intricate molecules made up of repeating units known as monomers. They are formed through the process of polymerization and possess a wide variety of properties and applications.
