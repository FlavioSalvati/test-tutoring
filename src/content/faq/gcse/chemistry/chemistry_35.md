In ionic bonding, electrons are transferred from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of positively and negatively charged ions.

Ionic bonding is a specific type of chemical bond characterized by the electrostatic attraction between ions that possess opposite charges. These ions are formed when atoms either lose or gain electrons. The involvement of electrons is crucial in this process, as they are the particles that facilitate the creation of ions by moving from one atom to another.

The process begins with an atom, typically a metal, losing one or more of its electrons. This loss transforms the atom into a positively charged ion, known as a cation. The electrons that are lost are then acquired by another atom, usually a non-metal, which becomes a negatively charged ion, referred to as an anion. This transfer of electrons allows both atoms to attain a stable electron configuration, often achieving a full outer shell that is energetically favorable.

Once the cations and anions are formed, they attract each other due to their opposite charges, resulting in the formation of an ionic bond. This bond effectively holds the ions together, leading to the creation of an ionic compound. The structure of these compounds is typically a crystal lattice, where each ion is surrounded by ions of the opposite charge. This arrangement is a consequence of the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the ions, which operate in all directions.

In summary, electrons are essential to the process of ionic bonding. They are the particles transferred to create ions, and it is the attraction between these ions that forms the ionic bond. Without the movement of electrons, ionic bonding would not be possible.
