Ionic equations are used to represent the ions involved in a chemical reaction, focusing solely on the particles that undergo change during the process.

To write ionic equations, you must follow a series of steps. First, begin by writing the balanced molecular equation for the reaction. This equation incorporates all reactants and products in their molecular forms. For instance, when sodium chloride reacts with silver nitrate to produce sodium nitrate and silver chloride, the balanced molecular equation can be expressed as:

$$
\text{NaCl} + \text{AgNO}_3 \rightarrow \text{NaNO}_3 + \text{AgCl}
$$

The next step is to construct the total ionic equation. This involves dissociating all strong electrolytes into their respective ions. Strong electrolytes include strong acids, strong bases, and soluble salts. In our example, the total ionic equation would be:

$$
\text{Na}^+ + \text{Cl}^- + \text{Ag}^+ + \text{NO}_3^- \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + \text{NO}_3^- + \text{AgCl}
$$

The third step is to identify and eliminate the spectator ions. Spectator ions are those that appear on both sides of the equation and do not engage in the reaction. In our example, the spectator ions are $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{NO}_3^-$. After canceling these ions, we arrive at the net ionic equation:

$$
\text{Cl}^- + \text{Ag}^+ \rightarrow \text{AgCl}
$$

It is important to include the states of the substances (solid, liquid, gas, or aqueous) in the equations. Additionally, ensure that charges and atoms are balanced in the final net ionic equation.

In summary, the process of writing ionic equations involves: 
1. Creating the balanced molecular equation,
2. Dissociating strong electrolytes into their ions to form the total ionic equation,
3. Eliminating spectator ions to obtain the net ionic equation.

This systematic approach clearly illustrates the actual chemical changes occurring in the reaction.
