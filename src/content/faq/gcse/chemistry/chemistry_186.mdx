The equilibrium constant, denoted as $K_c$, quantifies the relationship between the concentrations of products and reactants in a chemical reaction at equilibrium. It is derived from the law of mass action, which posits that the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants.

To determine $K_c$, you must first have the balanced chemical equation for the reaction, along with the equilibrium concentrations of all reactants and products. The general formula for calculating $K_c$ is:

$$
K_c = \frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b}
$$

In this equation, the symbols $[A]$, $[B]$, $[C]$, and $[D]$ represent the molar concentrations of the reactants ($A$ and $B$) and products ($C$ and $D$) at equilibrium. The lowercase letters ($a$, $b$, $c$, $d$) are the stoichiometric coefficients from the balanced chemical equation.

For instance, consider the reaction:

$$
aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD
$$

At equilibrium, if the concentrations of the species are denoted as $[A]$, $[B]$, $[C]$, and $[D]$, the equilibrium constant expression can be written using the formula provided above.

It's crucial to remember that the concentrations of the reactants and products are raised to the power of their respective stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation. Additionally, pure solids and liquids are excluded from the equilibrium expression, as their concentrations are deemed constant.

Importantly, the value of $K_c$ is dimensionless, functioning solely as a ratio that reflects the relative extent of the reaction at equilibrium. A large value of $K_c$ indicates a reaction that favors the formation of products, whereas a small value suggests that the reactants are favored.
