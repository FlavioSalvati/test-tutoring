The composition of the Earth's atmosphere has evolved significantly over time, driven by both natural processes and human activities.

Since its formation approximately $4.6$ billion years ago, the Earth's atmosphere has undergone profound changes. In its early state, the atmosphere was primarily composed of helium and hydrogen. However, volcanic activity played a crucial role in altering this composition, as it released gases including water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. This transition marked the emergence of what is known as the second atmosphere.

Around $2.7$ billion years ago, photosynthetic organisms began to develop, introducing oxygen into the atmosphere. This process, referred to as oxygenation, resulted in the formation of the third atmosphere, which bears a resemblance to our current atmosphere. It is predominantly composed of nitrogen ($78\%$) and oxygen ($21\%$), with trace amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases.

In recent centuries, particularly since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the composition of the atmosphere has continued to shift, primarily due to human activities. The Industrial Revolution sparked a dramatic increase in the combustion of fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide. Consequently, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has surged from approximately $280$ parts per million (ppm) during the pre-industrial era to over $400$ ppm today. This rise in carbon dioxide levels is a significant driver of global warming and climate change.

Additionally, human actions have contributed to the release of various other gases into the atmosphere. For instance, the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in aerosol products and refrigeration has resulted in the depletion of the ozone layer. The emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from fossil fuel combustion can lead to the formation of acid rain.

In summary, the Earth's atmosphere has transformed dramatically over geological time, evolving from a hydrogen and helium-rich composition to one predominantly made up of nitrogen and oxygen. In recent years, human activities have further altered this balance, resulting in increased levels of carbon dioxide and other pollutants.
