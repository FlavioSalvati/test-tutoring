Condensation polymerization is a chemical reaction in which monomers combine to form a polymer, simultaneously releasing a small molecule as a byproduct.

This type of reaction occurs between monomers, which are small molecules that contain active sites. These monomers link together to produce a larger, more complex structure known as a polymer. The term "condensation" is used because the reaction results in the elimination of a smaller molecule. Common byproducts of this process include water, but other simple molecules such as hydrogen chloride or methanol can also be produced.

The process commences when two monomers, each equipped with two functional groups, react with one another. A functional group is a specific group of atoms within a molecule that determines its characteristic chemical reactions. In condensation polymerization, one functional group from each monomer interacts with the other, forming a covalent bond while releasing a small molecule. This reaction can propagate in a chain-like fashion, allowing additional monomers to join and further small molecules to be released, ultimately resulting in the formation of a long-chain polymer.

A notable example of condensation polymerization is the synthesis of nylon. In this reaction, a molecule of water is expelled when a carboxylic acid group from one monomer reacts with an amine group from another. The resulting polymer, nylon, is versatile and widely used in various applications, including clothing and carpeting.

Understanding condensation polymerization is crucial in the field of chemistry, particularly for the production of plastics and other synthetic materials. It is a fundamental process that enables the creation of a diverse range of materials with varying properties, from flexible rubber to robust, durable plastics.
