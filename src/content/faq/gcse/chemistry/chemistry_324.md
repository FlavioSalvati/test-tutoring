Atoms are the fundamental units of elements, whereas molecules are formed when two or more atoms bond together.

An atom is the smallest unit of an element that retains the characteristics of that element. It consists of three types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus at the center of the atom, while electrons orbit the nucleus in defined energy levels. Each element is uniquely identified by the number of protons in its nucleus, referred to as its atomic number. For instance, hydrogen has one proton, which means its atomic number is $1$.

In contrast, molecules are created when two or more atoms chemically bond together. This bonding can involve atoms of the same element, such as $O_2$ (oxygen), or atoms of different elements, such as $H_2O$ (water). The atoms within a molecule are held together by chemical bonds, which arise from the sharing or transferring of electrons between atoms.

The primary distinction between atoms and molecules lies in their structure and composition. An atom is an individual unit that can exist independently and cannot be broken down into simpler substances without losing its chemical properties. On the other hand, a molecule is a collection of atoms that are chemically bonded, representing the smallest unit of a compound that retains all the properties of that compound.

In summary, while both atoms and molecules are essential building blocks in chemistry, they differ significantly in their structure and composition. Recognizing these differences is fundamental to understanding the basics of chemistry and the nature of various substances.
