Hydrogen gas can be collected for testing using two primary methods: electrolysis and the reaction of a metal with an acid.

### Method 1: Electrolysis

The first method involves electrolysis, which is the process of passing an electric current through water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). This causes the water to dissociate into hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) and oxygen gas ($\text{O}_2$). The hydrogen gas produced can be collected over water in a test tube or gas jar. It is essential to note that this method generates both hydrogen and oxygen gases, so care must be taken to ensure that only the hydrogen gas is collected.

### Method 2: Reaction of Metal with Acid

The second method for collecting hydrogen gas involves reacting a metal with an acid. For instance, when zinc ($\text{Zn}$) reacts with hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$), hydrogen gas and zinc chloride are produced. The chemical reaction is represented as follows:

$$
\text{Zn}(s) + 2\text{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{ZnCl}_2(aq) + \text{H}_2(g)
$$

In this case, the hydrogen gas can be collected in a test tube or gas jar by displacing the air within.

### Safety Precautions

In both methods, it is crucial to collect the hydrogen gas without allowing it to mix with air to mitigate the risk of explosion, as hydrogen is highly flammable. Additionally, the collected gas should be tested immediately or stored properly for future use.

### Testing Hydrogen Gas

To test the collected hydrogen gas, you can perform the "pop test." This involves bringing a lit splint close to the mouth of the test tube or gas jar containing the hydrogen. If the gas is indeed hydrogen, it will ignite with a characteristic "pop" sound, confirming its presence.

### Conclusion

Safety should always be your top priority when conducting these experiments. Be sure to wear safety goggles and lab coats, and work in a well-ventilated area to minimize any potential hazards.
