To calculate the concentration from titration results, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}}.
$$

In a titration, you are essentially mixing two solutions: the analyte and the titrant. The process continues until the reaction between these two solutions is complete, which occurs at a specific point known as the equivalence point. To determine the concentration of the analyte, you must know the volume of the titrant used to reach the equivalence point and its concentration.

The first step is to calculate the number of moles of the titrant. This can be done using the formula:

$$
\text{Moles of titrant} = \text{Volume of titrant (L)} \times \text{Concentration of titrant (mol/L)}.
$$

Remember to convert the volume from millilitres to litres by dividing by $1000$.

Next, using the balanced chemical equation for the reaction, identify the stoichiometric ratio between the analyte and the titrant. This ratio indicates how many moles of the analyte react with each mole of titrant.

Once you have the stoichiometric ratio, you can calculate the number of moles of the analyte by multiplying the number of moles of the titrant by the stoichiometric ratio:

$$
\text{Moles of analyte} = \text{Moles of titrant} \times \text{Stoichiometric ratio}.
$$

Finally, to find the concentration of the analyte, divide the number of moles of the analyte by its volume (in litres):

$$
\text{Concentration of analyte} = \frac{\text{Moles of analyte}}{\text{Volume of analyte (L)}}.
$$

For example, if you used $0.025$ litres of a $0.1 \, \text{M}$ titrant to reach the equivalence point, you would have used:

$$
\text{Moles of titrant} = 0.025 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.0025 \, \text{moles}.
$$

If the stoichiometric ratio is $1:1$, then the moles of the analyte will also be $0.0025$. If the volume of the analyte was $0.05$ litres, the concentration can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Concentration of analyte} = \frac{0.0025 \, \text{moles}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.05 \, \text{M}.
$$

Always ensure that your measurements are accurate and your calculations are precise to achieve the most reliable results.
