The rise in oxygen levels on Earth can be primarily attributed to the process of photosynthesis carried out by early life forms, particularly cyanobacteria.

Photosynthesis is a vital process employed by plants and various organisms to transform light energy, predominantly from the sun, into chemical energy. This chemical energy can later be utilized to fuel the activities of these organisms. The significance of photosynthesis in increasing Earth's oxygen levels cannot be overstated. The earliest organisms known to perform photosynthesis were likely simple, single-celled microorganisms, specifically cyanobacteria. These organisms began producing oxygen approximately $2.4$ billion years ago during a pivotal period known as the Great Oxygenation Event.

Cyanobacteria are a unique type of bacteria that harness energy through photosynthesis. Although commonly referred to as "blue-green algae," they are not true algae. These microorganisms are believed to be the first to engage in oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that generates oxygen as a byproduct. This process utilizes sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose, a type of sugar that serves as an energy source for the organism, along with oxygen.

As cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic organisms continued to produce oxygen, this gas began to accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a substantial increase in oxygen levels. This rise in oxygen enabled the evolution of more complex life forms that depend on oxygen for respirationâ€”a process that releases energy from glucose.

It is essential to recognize that this transformative process unfolded over an extended period. The Great Oxygenation Event, which marked the first significant rise in Earth's oxygen levels, took place over hundreds of millions of years. Even after this event, it required an additional billion years for oxygen levels to reach a threshold sufficient to support the large, complex life forms familiar to us today.
