Ionic compounds exhibit high melting points due to the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between their positively and negatively charged ions.

These compounds are typically formed when a metal reacts with a non-metal, resulting in a lattice structure composed of alternating positive and negative ions. The ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces, commonly referred to as ionic bonds. The strength of these bonds is the primary reason why ionic compounds display high melting and boiling points.

To melt an ionic compound, it is necessary to supply enough energy to overcome these strong electrostatic forces and break the ionic bonds. This process requires a significant amount of heat energy, which accounts for the high melting point of these substances. The same principle applies when boiling ionic compounds; stronger forces of attraction necessitate more energy to break the bonds, resulting in elevated melting and boiling points.

For instance, consider sodium chloride (NaCl), a well-known ionic compound. Sodium chloride has a melting point of $801^\circ C$, which is notably high. This elevated melting point is due to the strong ionic bonds that hold sodium ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ($\text{Cl}^-$) ions together. To transform solid sodium chloride into a liquid or gas, a substantial amount of heat energy must be supplied to overcome these ionic bonds.

In conclusion, the high melting points of ionic compounds can be directly attributed to the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between their ions. These forces create robust ionic bonds that require considerable energy to break, resulting in high melting and boiling points.
