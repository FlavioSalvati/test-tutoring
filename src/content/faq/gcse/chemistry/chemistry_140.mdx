When preparing soluble salts, safety must always be your top priority. This process often involves the use of acids, which can be hazardous if not handled appropriately. Therefore, it is essential to wear protective clothing, including gloves and safety goggles, to shield your skin and eyes from potential splashes.

When working with acids, always exercise caution. Pour acids slowly and deliberately to minimize the risk of splashing. If you need to dilute an acid, remember to add the acid to the water, not the reverse. This approach is critical because adding water to acid can trigger an exothermic reaction, which may result in the acid splattering out of the container.

Additionally, ensure that you work in a well-ventilated area. Certain reactions can generate gases that are harmful if inhaled. If you are in a laboratory setting, utilize a fume cupboard if one is available to help mitigate this risk.

Be vigilant about the possibility of spills. Should a spill occur, do not attempt to clean it up yourself unless you have received proper training. Instead, immediately notify a teacher or another responsible adult for assistance.

Moreover, it is vital to avoid eating, drinking, or touching your face while handling chemicals. Even with gloves on, there is a risk of chemical contamination on your hands. Always wash your hands thoroughly after completing your experiment.

Remember, safety in the laboratory is not solely about protecting yourself; it is also about safeguarding the well-being of those around you. By adhering to these precautions, you contribute to creating a safe and productive learning environment for everyone involved.
