Pressure plays a significant role in determining the equilibrium position of gas reactions by shifting the equilibrium toward the side that has fewer gas molecules.

This behavior is explained by Le Chatelier's Principle, which states that when a change in conditions is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will respond in a way that counteracts that change. In the context of gases, an increase in pressure will prompt the system to reduce it. The system achieves this by favoring the reaction that produces fewer gas molecules, as fewer molecules result in lower pressure.

Consider the following equilibrium reaction involving nitrogen gas, hydrogen gas, and ammonia:

$$
\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g)
$$

In this reaction, four gas molecules (one nitrogen and three hydrogen) combine to produce two molecules of ammonia. If the pressure is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the right, towards the side with fewer gas molecules (the ammonia side), in an effort to reduce the pressure. Conversely, if the pressure is decreased, the equilibrium will shift to the left, toward the side with more gas molecules (the nitrogen and hydrogen side), in order to increase the pressure.

It is crucial to recognize that this principle applies only to reactions where there is a difference in the number of gas molecules on either side of the equation. If the number of gas molecules is the same on both sides, a change in pressure will not affect the equilibrium position.

While this explanation simplifies the concept, it is important to understand that real-world situations can be more complex. Other factors, such as temperature and concentration, can also influence the position of equilibrium. However, for your GCSE Chemistry studies, grasping how pressure affects gas equilibrium through Le Chatelier's Principle is an excellent foundational concept.
