In a hydrogen fuel cell, the anode serves as the positive electrode where the oxidation half-reaction occurs. At this electrode, hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) is supplied and undergoes a process of splitting into protons ($\text{H}^+$) and electrons ($\text{e}^-$). This reaction is facilitated by a catalyst, commonly made of platinum, which accelerates the reaction without being consumed in the process.

During this reaction, each molecule of hydrogen gas is converted into two protons and two electrons. This transformation is termed oxidation, as hydrogen loses electrons in the process. The chemical equation representing this reaction is given by:

$$
\text{2H}_2 \rightarrow 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^-
$$

Once generated, the protons produced at the anode migrate through the electrolyte toward the cathode, which is the negative electrode. In contrast, the electrons cannot traverse the electrolyte directly. Instead, they must flow through an external circuit, generating an electric current that can be harnessed to power various devices.

This fundamental process enables hydrogen fuel cells to produce electricity efficiently. It is notable for being a clean energy source, with the only by-products being water and heat. Understanding the role of the anode in this process is essential for grasping the overall functionality of hydrogen fuel cells.
