The general formula for alkanes is given by $ C_nH_{2n+2} $.

Alkanes are a category of hydrocarbons, which are compounds composed solely of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The formula $ C_nH_{2n+2} $ succinctly captures this composition. In this expression, $ n $ represents the number of carbon atoms present in the molecule. The term $ 2n+2 $ specifies the corresponding number of hydrogen atoms, which is always twice the number of carbon atoms plus an additional two.

For instance, if an alkane contains $ 3 $ carbon atoms (where $ n=3 $), it will have $ 2(3)+2 = 8 $ hydrogen atoms. This results in the molecular formula $ C_3H_8 $, commonly known as propane. Likewise, if an alkane has $ 5 $ carbon atoms (where $ n=5 $), it will contain $ 2(5)+2 = 12 $ hydrogen atoms, leading to the molecular formula $ C_5H_{12} $, known as pentane.

This general formula provides a straightforward means to comprehend the structure of alkanes. It indicates that alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, meaning they possess the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom. This characteristic is why alkanes are often referred to as "saturated hydrocarbons."

Furthermore, the general formula enables us to predict the properties of various alkanes. For example, as the number of carbon atoms increases, the boiling point of the alkane tends to rise. This increase is attributed to the larger molecular size, which results in stronger intermolecular forces that require more energy to overcome.

In conclusion, the general formula $ C_nH_{2n+2} $ serves as a valuable tool for understanding both the structure and properties of these significant hydrocarbons.
