Group 1 elements, known as alkali metals, include lithium ($\text{Li}$), sodium ($\text{Na}$), potassium ($\text{K}$), rubidium ($\text{Rb}$), cesium ($\text{Cs}$), and francium ($\text{Fr}$). These elements are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen. When alkali metals react with oxygen, they undergo a vigorous and exothermic chemical reaction, resulting in the formation of metal oxides.

The general reaction can be expressed by the equation:

$$
4M + O_2 \rightarrow 2M_2O
$$

where $M$ represents a Group 1 element. For instance, when sodium ($\text{Na}$) reacts with oxygen ($O_2$), the reaction is represented as:

$$
4\text{Na} + O_2 \rightarrow 2\text{Na}_2O
$$

This reaction produces sodium oxide ($\text{Na}_2\text{O}$).

The metal oxides formed during these reactions are classified as basic compounds. This means they have the ability to react with acids, yielding a salt and water in a process known as neutralization. For example, sodium oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$) to produce sodium chloride (table salt) and water:

$$
\text{Na}_2\text{O} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

The reactivity of Group 1 elements with oxygen increases as you move down the group. Consequently, elements such as potassium ($\text{K}$), rubidium ($\text{Rb}$), cesium ($\text{Cs}$), and francium ($\text{Fr}$) react more vigorously with oxygen compared to lithium ($\text{Li}$) and sodium ($\text{Na}$). This increased reactivity is attributed to the larger atomic size and lower ionization energy of the elements further down the group, which makes it easier for the outermost electron to be lost, facilitating the reaction.

Due to their high reactivity with oxygen, it is crucial to handle alkali metals with care in laboratory settings. These metals are typically stored under oil to prevent exposure to air. If they come into contact with air, they can react violently, and in some cases, may even ignite. Therefore, it is essential to adhere to safety guidelines when working with Group 1 elements to ensure a safe working environment.
