Changes in pressure can significantly influence gaseous equilibria by shifting the equilibrium position toward the side with fewer gas molecules.

This phenomenon is explained by Le Chatelier's Principle, which states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by altering the conditions, the equilibrium will adjust to counteract that change. Specifically, in the context of gaseous equilibria, an increase in pressure causes the equilibrium to shift toward the side with fewer gas molecules in order to reduce the pressure. Conversely, if the pressure is decreased, the equilibrium will shift toward the side with more gas molecules to increase the pressure.

For example, consider the equilibrium reaction between nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to produce ammonia:

$$
\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g)
$$

In this reaction, there are a total of four moles of gas on the left-hand side and two moles of gas on the right-hand side. Therefore, if the pressure is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the right, toward the side that has fewer gas molecules, resulting in the production of more ammonia. Conversely, if the pressure is decreased, the equilibrium will shift to the left, toward the side with more gas molecules, leading to the production of less ammonia.

It is important to note that not all changes in pressure will result in a shift in the equilibrium position. If the number of gas molecules is the same on both sides of the reaction equation, a change in pressure will have no effect on the equilibrium position. For instance, in the following reaction:

$$
2\text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
$$

There are three moles of gas on both sides of the equation, meaning that a change in pressure will not shift the equilibrium position.

Understanding how variations in conditions affect equilibria is crucial for controlling chemical reactions in industrial processes.
