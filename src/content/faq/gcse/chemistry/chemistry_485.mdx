Batteries store energy through chemical reactions and release it as electrical energy when connected to a circuit.

Essentially, batteries serve as compact, portable reservoirs of chemical energy. This energy is held in the form of potential energy within the chemical bonds of the materials present inside the battery. A battery typically comprises two distinct types of materials known as electrodes, which are separated by a chemical substance referred to as the electrolyte. One electrode, known as the anode, functions as the negative terminal, while the other, called the cathode, serves as the positive terminal.

When a battery is connected to an external circuit, a chemical reaction is initiated. This reaction prompts electrons to migrate from the anode to the cathode, thereby generating an electrical current. The flow of these electrons through the circuit is what powers the electrical devices connected to the battery.

The chemical reaction occurring within the battery is classified as a redox reaction, which involves the transfer of electrons between substances. Specifically, the anode undergoes oxidation (loses electrons), while the cathode experiences reduction (gains electrons). This electron transfer is the fundamental process that produces electrical energy.

The energy stored in a battery is released until the chemical substances within it are depleted. At this point, the battery is deemed 'dead' because it can no longer generate an electrical current. However, certain types of batteries, known as rechargeable batteries, can reverse their chemical reactions by applying an external electrical power source, enabling them to be reused.

In conclusion, batteries function by storing and releasing energy through a series of chemical reactions. These reactions facilitate the movement of electrons from the anode to the cathode, creating an electrical current that powers various devices.
