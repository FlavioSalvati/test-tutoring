Transition metals are often key components in various common alloys, including stainless steel, bronze, brass, and pewter.

**Stainless Steel**

Stainless steel is a widely recognized alloy primarily composed of iron, a transition metal, along with carbon and other elements such as chromium, nickel, and molybdenum. The incorporation of these additional elements imparts exceptional corrosion resistance to stainless steel. For example, chromium reacts with oxygen to form a protective layer of chromium oxide on the steel's surface, effectively preventing rust. Furthermore, nickel and molybdenum also contribute to enhanced corrosion resistance, as well as improved strength and toughness of the alloy.

**Bronze**

Bronze is another prevalent alloy that features a transition metal, specifically copper. Typically, bronze consists of approximately $88\%$ copper and $12\%$ tin, although the composition can vary. The addition of tin significantly increases the hardness and durability of bronze compared to pure copper, which is why it has historically been used to manufacture weapons, tools, and construction materials. Other elements, such as aluminum, manganese, nickel, or zinc, may also be included to create various types of bronze with tailored properties.

**Brass**

Brass is an alloy made from copper and zinc, both of which are transition metals. The ratio of copper to zinc can be adjusted to produce different varieties of brass, each possessing distinct characteristics. Known for its bright, gold-like appearance, brass is particularly valued for its acoustic properties, making it an ideal material for musical instruments. Additionally, brass is commonly used in decorative items, plumbing fixtures, and electrical connectors.

**Pewter**

Pewter is a malleable metal alloy traditionally composed of $85\%$ to $99\%$ tin, blended with copper, antimony, bismuth, and occasionally silver. In this alloy, copper and antimony serve as hardening agents, while lead is often included in lower-grade pewter for its softness and malleability. Today, pewter is widely used for crafting decorative objects, including collectible statuettes, figurines, game pieces, aircraft models, and jewelry.
