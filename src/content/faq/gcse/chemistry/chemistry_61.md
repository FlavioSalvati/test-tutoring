Nanoparticles are extremely small particles that are typically measured in nanometres, with sizes ranging from $1$ to $100$ nanometres.

To put this into perspective, a nanometre is one billionth of a metre, which is approximately $1/80,000$ the diameter of a human hair! These particles can be composed of various materials, including metals, ceramics, and polymers.

One of the most remarkable characteristics of nanoparticles is their significantly larger surface area relative to their volume. As the size of a particle decreases, the proportion of atoms located on its surface increases. This unique feature makes nanoparticles highly reactive and advantageous for a wide array of applications. For instance, in the field of medicine, nanoparticles can be employed to deliver drugs directly to cancer cells, thereby minimizing the side effects associated with chemotherapy. In electronics, they facilitate the development of smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient devices.

Moreover, nanoparticles exhibit distinct properties compared to the same materials in bulk form. For example, while bulk gold is recognized as a shiny yellow metal that does not react with oxygen, gold nanoparticles can appear red or purple and may engage in reactions with oxygen. This change in behavior is due to the alterations in material properties that occur when sizes are reduced to the nanoscale.

Despite their remarkable potential, the use of nanoparticles also raises significant concerns. Their minuscule size allows them to easily penetrate the human body and the environment, and our understanding of their possible impacts remains incomplete. Therefore, it is crucial to handle nanoparticles with care and to conduct further research into their effects on health and the environment.
