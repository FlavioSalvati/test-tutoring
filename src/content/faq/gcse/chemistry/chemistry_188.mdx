Reversible reactions in chemical equations are indicated by a double-headed arrow (↔).

To elaborate, a reversible reaction is a type of chemical reaction where the reactants convert into products, which can then react to regenerate the original reactants. This characteristic allows the reaction to proceed in both the forward and backward directions. In contrast, an irreversible reaction moves only in one direction, from reactants to products.

In chemical equations, we utilize a specific symbol—a double-headed arrow (↔)—to represent these reversible reactions. This arrow points in both directions, signifying that the reaction can occur in either direction. For instance, the reversible reaction in which nitrogen and hydrogen combine to form ammonia can be expressed as:

$$
\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \leftrightarrow 2\text{NH}_3(g).
$$

The double-headed arrow is significant because it indicates that the reaction can achieve a state of equilibrium. At equilibrium, both the forward and reverse reactions continue to occur; however, their rates are equal, resulting in no overall change in the concentrations of the reactants and products. It is important to note that while the concentrations remain constant at equilibrium, they are not necessarily equal.

The position of the equilibrium can be influenced by altering conditions such as concentration, pressure, or temperature. This concept is encapsulated by Le Chatelier's Principle. Therefore, gaining a solid understanding of reversible reactions and their representation is essential for grasping many fundamental concepts in chemistry.
