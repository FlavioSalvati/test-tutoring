The accuracy of a titration can be influenced by several factors, including measurement errors, the quality of reagents, and the precision with which the endpoint is determined.

**Measurement Errors**

Measurement errors can significantly compromise the accuracy of titration results. These errors may arise from inaccuracies in measuring the volume of the solution used, imprecision in the balance employed to weigh the sample, and mistakes in reading the burette. For instance, if the initial and final readings on the burette are not recorded accurately, this can result in substantial errors when calculating the concentration of the unknown solution. Similarly, inaccuracies in weighing the sample can also lead to incorrect final results.

**Quality of Reagents**

The quality of the reagents used during titration is another critical factor influencing accuracy. If the reagents are impure or have degraded over time, this can lead to erroneous results. For example, if the standard solution employed in the titration is not prepared correctly or has become contaminated, it adversely affects the overall accuracy. Additionally, if the indicator used to ascertain the endpoint is unsuitable or has deteriorated, this can result in errors when determining the endpoint of the titration.

**Precision of Endpoint Determination**

The precision of endpoint determination is yet another vital aspect that affects titration accuracy. The endpoint marks the moment when the reaction between the titrant and the analyte is complete. If the endpoint is not accurately identified, this can lead to miscalculations of the unknown solution's concentration. For instance, failing to observe the color change of the indicator precisely, or conducting an over-titration or under-titration, can introduce inaccuracies into the final results. Therefore, it is essential to select an appropriate indicator and to meticulously monitor the color change at the endpoint to ensure the accuracy of the titration.
