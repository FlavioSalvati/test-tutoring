Aluminium is extracted from its ore, bauxite, through a process known as the Hall-Héroult process, which utilizes electrolysis.

The extraction of aluminium consists of several crucial steps. Initially, bauxite ore is purified to yield aluminium oxide, a white powder from which aluminium can be derived. This purification is accomplished using the Bayer process. In this process, bauxite is combined with sodium hydroxide and subjected to heating under pressure. The aluminium oxide dissolves in the sodium hydroxide, forming sodium aluminate, while impurities like iron oxides and silicates remain undissolved and can be filtered out.

Following this purification, the next step involves converting the sodium aluminate back into aluminium oxide. This is done by adding more aluminium oxide to the solution, which leads to the precipitation of aluminium hydroxide from the sodium aluminate. The aluminium hydroxide is then heated to a high temperature to eliminate any residual water, resulting in pure aluminium oxide.

The final stage is the electrolysis of the aluminium oxide to produce aluminium, which is the essence of the Hall-Héroult process. In this step, aluminium oxide is dissolved in a molten cryolite bath, which reduces the melting point of the aluminium oxide and enhances the conductivity of the solution. The resulting mixture is then subjected to a strong electric current. At the cathode, aluminium ions are reduced to form aluminium metal, while at the anode, oxygen ions are oxidized to generate oxygen gas.

The aluminium metal settles at the bottom of the electrolysis cell, where it can be tapped off and subsequently cooled to form solid aluminium. This process is continuous; as aluminium is extracted, additional aluminium oxide is added to the electrolysis cell. The oxygen gas produced at the anode reacts with the carbon anodes to produce carbon dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere. This reaction is a significant contributor to carbon emissions in the aluminium industry.
