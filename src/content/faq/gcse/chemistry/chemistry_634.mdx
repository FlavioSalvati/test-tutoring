Nitrogen is incorporated into fertilizers through various industrial processes, the most notable being the Haber process, which synthesizes nitrogen and hydrogen.

The inclusion of nitrogen in fertilizers is essential for producing these vital agricultural products. Nitrogen serves as a crucial nutrient for plant growth, enhancing crop yields and promoting soil health. The Haber process, developed in the early 20th century, is the primary method employed for adding nitrogen to fertilizers.

The Haber process facilitates the direct synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. Nitrogen is sourced from the atmosphere, which consists of approximately $78\%$ nitrogen, while hydrogen is typically extracted from natural gas, or methane. This reaction occurs under high pressure, approximately $200$ atmospheres, and at an elevated temperature of $450^\circ C$, utilizing an iron catalyst to accelerate the reaction. The ammonia produced is subsequently utilized to manufacture ammonium nitrate, a widely used nitrogenous fertilizer.

Another method for incorporating nitrogen into fertilizers is the Ostwald process. This process involves the oxidation of ammonia to produce nitric acid, which is then converted into ammonium nitrate. The Ostwald process is generally employed in conjunction with the Haber process, as the ammonia generated in the Haber process serves as the feedstock for the Ostwald process.

In addition to industrial methods, nitrogen can also be added to fertilizers through biological nitrogen fixation. This natural process involves specific bacteria, known as nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants. Although this process is not typically involved in the production of commercial fertilizers, it plays a vital role in organic farming and sustainable agricultural practices.
