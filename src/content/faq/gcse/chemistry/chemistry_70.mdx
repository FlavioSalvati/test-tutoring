The comparison between actual yield and theoretical yield is made through the calculation of percentage yield, which is defined by the formula:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

**Theoretical Yield** refers to the maximum quantity of product that can be generated from a chemical reaction under ideal conditions. This value is determined using the balanced chemical equation along with the amounts of reactants involved. Conversely, **Actual Yield** is the amount of product that is actually obtained in a real-world experiment or industrial process.

To assess the efficiency of a reaction, we compute the percentage yield. This involves dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and then multiplying the result by $100$ to express it as a percentage. The percentage yield serves as an indicator of the reaction's efficiency: a high percentage yield, close to $100\%$, implies that the reaction was highly efficient, with minimal waste or side reactions. In contrast, a low percentage yield indicates inefficiency, suggesting significant waste or undesirable side reactions.

For instance, consider a scenario where the theoretical yield of a reaction is $10$ grams and the actual yield obtained is $8$ grams. The percentage yield can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage Yield} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100\% = 80\%
$$

This result indicates that $80\%$ of the maximum possible product was successfully produced, while $20\%$ was lost due to waste or side reactions.

It is important to recognize that achieving a $100\%$ yield is exceedingly uncommon in practical scenarios. Various factors contribute to this, including incomplete reactions, losses that occur during the experimental process, or unforeseen side reactions. Consequently, chemists strive to maximize percentage yield while minimizing waste in their experiments.
