The electronic structure of an atom is fundamentally determined by the number of electrons it contains and the principles of quantum mechanics.

The term "electronic structure" refers to the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus of an atom. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Electrons are organized into energy levels, commonly known as shells. Each shell has a specific capacity for electrons: the first shell can accommodate up to $2$ electrons, the second shell can hold up to $8$, and this pattern continues with higher shells.

Quantum mechanics significantly influences the electronic structure of atoms. According to these principles, electrons do not follow fixed orbits; instead, they occupy cloud-like regions around the nucleus, referred to as orbitals. Each orbital can contain a maximum of two electrons, which must have opposite spins. The shape and size of these orbitals are determined by their energy levels and their types, which include s, p, d, and f orbitals.

The Pauli Exclusion Principle is a key concept in quantum mechanics that asserts no two electrons in an atom can possess the same set of quantum numbers. This principle ensures that each electron occupies a unique position within an orbital, further refining the atom's electronic structure.

The Aufbau Principle provides guidance on how electrons fill orbitals. It states that electrons will first occupy the lowest energy orbitals available before progressing to higher energy states. This principle, in conjunction with Hund's Rule— which specifies that electrons will fill degenerate (equal energy) orbitals singly before pairing—explains the observed electronic configurations of various atoms.

In conclusion, an atom's electronic structure is shaped by its electron count and the governing principles of quantum mechanics, which dictate the arrangement of these electrons around the nucleus.
