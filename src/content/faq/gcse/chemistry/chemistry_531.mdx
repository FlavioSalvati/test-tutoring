Addition polymers are characterized by their durability, chemical resistance, low melting points, and often exhibit flexibility and lightweight properties. 

These polymers are formed through a process known as addition polymerization, where numerous small molecules, called monomers, chemically bond to create long chain-like structures, known as polymers. The specific properties of these addition polymers largely depend on the types of monomers employed and the conditions under which the polymerization occurs.

One of the defining features of addition polymers is their exceptional durability. They possess a high degree of strength and resistance to wear and tear, making them suitable for a wide array of applications, ranging from packaging materials to automotive components. This durability arises from the robust covalent bonds that link the polymer chains together.

Moreover, addition polymers demonstrate significant resistance to many chemicals, meaning they do not readily react with other substances. This property further enhances their utility in packaging applications. For instance, polyethylene, a commonly used addition polymer, is frequently found in plastic bags because it remains inert when in contact with food or other items.

Another notable characteristic of addition polymers is their low melting points. This property enables easy molding into various shapes, which is advantageous during manufacturing processes. For example, polystyrene, another addition polymer, is widely utilized in the production of disposable cups and plates due to its ability to be easily shaped when heated.

Finally, addition polymers are often flexible and lightweight, making them ideal for diverse applications, including textiles and medical devices. A prime example is polypropylene, a type of addition polymer that is utilized in the manufacturing of surgical sutures, as it is both flexible and lightweight while maintaining sufficient strength to securely hold a wound closed.
