The formation of the ozone layer is a remarkable phenomenon that results from the interaction of sunlight with the Earth's atmosphere. This intricate process, known as photodissociation, serves as the primary mechanism for ozone layer development. During photodissociation, solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation breaks down oxygen molecules ($\text{O}_2$) into individual oxygen atoms.

The process begins with the emission of UV radiation from the Sun. When this radiation reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the existing oxygen molecules. The high-energy UV radiation is potent enough to disrupt the bonds that hold the $\text{O}_2$ molecules together, resulting in the formation of free oxygen atoms.

Once the oxygen molecules are dissociated, the liberated oxygen atoms are available to react with other oxygen molecules. When an oxygen atom encounters another $\text{O}_2$ molecule, they can combine to form ozone ($\text{O}_3$). This reaction is facilitated by the presence of a third molecule, which absorbs the excess energy produced during the reaction and thus stabilizes the newly formed ozone.

This process of ozone formation is continuous and ongoing. However, ozone molecules are unstable and can be broken down by further interactions with UV radiation. Despite this instability, as long as there is a consistent supply of UV radiation and oxygen molecules, the overall concentration of ozone in the atmosphere remains relatively stable. This delicate balance between the creation and destruction of ozone molecules is what sustains the ozone layer.

The ozone layer plays an essential role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing the majority of the Sun's harmful UV radiation. Without this protective layer, such radiation would penetrate the Earth's surface, posing significant risks to living organisms.
