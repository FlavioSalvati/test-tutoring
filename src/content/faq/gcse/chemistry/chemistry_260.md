The rise in oxygen levels had a profound impact on life on Earth, facilitating the evolution of complex, multicellular organisms.

This significant increase in atmospheric oxygen, known as the Great Oxygenation Event, occurred approximately $2.4$ billion years ago. This event marked a crucial turning point in Earth's history, setting the foundation for the development of complex life forms. Before this transformation, Earth's atmosphere was primarily devoid of oxygen, and life was predominantly represented by simple, single-celled organisms called prokaryotes. These organisms thrived in anaerobic conditions, meaning they did not require oxygen for survival.

The emergence of cyanobacteria, capable of performing photosynthesis, fundamentally altered this scenario. These organisms utilized sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose while releasing oxygen as a by-product. Over time, the oxygen generated by cyanobacteria began to accumulate in the atmosphere, leading to a notable increase in atmospheric oxygen levels.

The rise in oxygen had significant repercussions for life on Earth. Firstly, it caused the extinction of many anaerobic organisms, which could not survive in the newly oxygen-rich environment. However, it also opened the door for the evolution of aerobic organisms, which utilize oxygen to generate energy through a process known as cellular respiration. This process is considerably more efficient than the anaerobic energy production methods employed by earlier life forms, enabling aerobic organisms to grow larger and more complex.

Furthermore, the increase in atmospheric oxygen contributed to the formation of the ozone layer, which serves as a protective shield against harmful ultraviolet radiation. Without this protective layer, the existence of life as we know it would have been highly improbable.

In conclusion, the increase in oxygen was a pivotal factor in the evolution of complex, multicellular life on Earth. While it led to the extinction of many anaerobic organisms, it also facilitated the emergence of aerobic organisms and the creation of the ozone layer, both of which are essential for sustaining life.
