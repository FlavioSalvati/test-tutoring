Alkaline batteries are designed for single use, while rechargeable batteries can be utilized multiple times through recharging.

Alkaline batteries, also referred to as primary batteries, are constructed for one-time use. They contain an alkaline electrolyte, typically potassium hydroxide, which is not reversible. This means that once the chemical reactions within the battery have taken place, they cannot be undone, rendering the battery incapable of being recharged. When the energy stored in an alkaline battery is depleted, the battery must be discarded. These batteries are frequently employed in devices that require low power over extended periods, such as remote controls and clocks.

In contrast, rechargeable batteries, often called secondary batteries, are designed to be recharged and reused multiple times. The chemical reactions that occur within these batteries are reversible. When connected to a power source, the reactions that took place during discharge are reversed, allowing the battery to regain its charge. Consequently, after the energy in a rechargeable battery has been consumed, it can be recharged and used again. These batteries are commonly found in devices that demand substantial power and are used frequently, such as mobile phones and laptops.

The primary distinction between these two types of batteries lies in their longevity and environmental impact. Although alkaline batteries are less expensive upfront, the cumulative cost of replacement can be significant over time. Rechargeable batteries, while initially more costly, can be utilized hundreds or even thousands of times, making them more economical in the long run. Furthermore, since alkaline batteries are disposed of after a single use, they contribute to environmental waste. In contrast, rechargeable batteries, due to their multiple uses, generate less waste, making them a more environmentally friendly option.
