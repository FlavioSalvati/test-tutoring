Alloys exhibit greater strength than pure metals due to their more intricate atomic structures, which enhance resistance to deformation and fracture.

Pure metals are composed of identical atoms arranged in a regular, repeating lattice. This uniform arrangement allows atomic layers to slide easily over one another, resulting in softness and malleability. Consequently, pure metals lack significant strength and can be easily deformed or broken under stress.

In contrast, alloys are created by combining two or more different metals. The varying sizes of these metal atoms disrupt the regular atomic arrangement, making it more challenging for atomic layers to slide past one another. As a result, alloys are generally harder and stronger than the individual pure metals from which they are derived.

Moreover, the composition of an alloy can lead to a wide array of structural configurations, influenced by the proportions of the constituent metals and the manufacturing conditions. These diverse structures impart distinct properties, allowing alloys to be customized for specific applications. For instance, steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, possesses significantly greater strength than pure iron, making it suitable for a variety of uses, from construction to automobile manufacturing.

Additionally, alloys may include non-metal elements, such as carbon in steel, which can further enhance their strength. These non-metal elements can form robust bonds with metal atoms, reinforcing the alloy's structure and contributing to its overall hardness and strength.

In summary, alloys are stronger than pure metals due to their complex structures, characterized by a mixture of differently sized atoms and the potential presence of non-metal elements. This complexity significantly enhances their resistance to deformation and breakage.
