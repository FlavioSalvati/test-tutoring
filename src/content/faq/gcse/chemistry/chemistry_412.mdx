Catalysts enhance atom economy by increasing the yield of desired products while minimizing waste production.

Catalysts are essential in chemical reactions as they provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. This characteristic allows reactions to proceed more easily and often results in an increased reaction rate. But how does this relate to atom economy? Atom economy is defined as the proportion of reactants that are converted into useful products. In an ideal scenario, every atom from the reactants would be transformed into beneficial products, resulting in an atom economy of $100\%$.

When a catalyst is employed in a reaction, it can steer the reaction towards the desired products, effectively reducing the formation of unwanted by-products. This capability is particularly crucial in industrial processes, where high atom economy is sought for both economic viability and environmental sustainability. By enhancing the yield of the desired product, catalysts can significantly improve the atom economy of a reaction.

For instance, consider the Haber process for synthesizing ammonia. This reaction is reversible and, in the absence of a catalyst, does not favor ammonia production. However, when an iron catalyst is introduced, the rate of the forward reaction is accelerated, resulting in a higher yield of ammonia. This improvement enhances the atom economy of the process, as a greater proportion of nitrogen and hydrogen is converted into ammonia rather than remaining unreacted or forming undesirable by-products.

Additionally, catalysts are not consumed during the reaction, allowing them to be reused multiple times without depletion. This feature further contributes to improved atom economy, as it minimizes the need for additional materials in the reaction.

In summary, catalysts can significantly enhance the atom economy of a reaction by increasing the yield of desired products, reducing waste production, and being reusable.
