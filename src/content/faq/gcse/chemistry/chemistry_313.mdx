Examples of composite materials include fibreglass, concrete, carbon fibre, wood, and engineered wood products such as plywood.

Composite materials are created by combining two or more distinct types of materials, each possessing unique properties. This combination results in a new material that exhibits characteristics different from those of the individual components. The primary goal is to harness the advantageous properties of each material to achieve enhanced performance.

Fibreglass is a widely used composite material composed of fine glass fibres woven into a cloth and bonded together with a plastic resin. The glass fibres impart strength and flexibility, while the resin contributes toughness and impact resistance. This synergy results in a material that is not only strong and lightweight but also highly durable, making fibreglass ideal for applications in boats, automobiles, and construction.

Concrete serves as another prime example of a composite material. It is formed by mixing cement, sand, and aggregate (small stones). The cement and sand create a paste that binds the aggregate together, resulting in a material that is both strong and durable, yet retains a degree of flexibility. This makes concrete particularly well-suited for construction purposes.

Carbon fibre is a high-performance composite material known for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. It is produced by weaving thin strands of carbon into a fabric and then infusing it with a plastic resin. The carbon fibres provide strength and stiffness, while the resin ensures toughness and impact resistance. Owing to its lightweight nature and extraordinary strength, carbon fibre is extensively utilized in high-performance sectors such as aerospace and motorsport.

Wood is a natural composite material formed from cellulose fibres that are bound together by a substance known as lignin. The cellulose fibres contribute strength and flexibility, whereas lignin adds rigidity. Engineered wood products, such as plywood, are synthetic composites made by gluing together thin layers of wood. In plywood, the grain of each layer is oriented at right angles to the layers above and below, resulting in a material that exhibits strength in all directions. This characteristic makes plywood a versatile and widely utilized building material.
