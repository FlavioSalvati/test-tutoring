Ionic compounds exhibit high melting points primarily due to the strong electrostatic forces of attraction that exist between their positively and negatively charged ions.

These compounds are typically formed through the reaction of a metal with a non-metal. They possess a lattice structure where positive and negative ions alternate. The strong electrostatic forces binding these ions together are referred to as ionic bonds. The strength of these ionic bonds is the key factor responsible for the elevated melting and boiling points of ionic compounds.

To melt an ionic compound, it is necessary to supply sufficient energy to overcome these strong forces of attraction and break the ionic bonds. This process requires a significant amount of heat energy, which contributes to the high melting point. The same principle applies to the boiling of these compounds: the stronger the electrostatic forces between the ions, the more energy is required to break the bonds, resulting in higher melting and boiling points.

For instance, consider sodium chloride, denoted as NaCl. This common ionic compound has a melting point of $801^\circ C$, which is notably high. This elevated melting point is attributable to the strong attraction between sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$) within its lattice structure, forming robust ionic bonds. To melt sodium chloride, one must provide enough heat energy to overcome these substantial ionic bonds.

In conclusion, the high melting points of ionic compounds stem from the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between their constituent ions. These forces create powerful ionic bonds that require considerable energy to break, which accounts for the elevated melting and boiling points observed in these compounds.
