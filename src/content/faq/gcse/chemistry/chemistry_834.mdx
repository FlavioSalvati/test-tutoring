Reaction rates are generally quantified in terms of concentration per unit time, commonly expressed as moles per liter per second ($\text{mol/L/s}$).

More specifically, reaction rates indicate the speed at which a chemical reaction takes place. They are typically defined by the change in concentration of either a reactant or a product over a designated time interval. While the standard unit for reaction rates is $\text{mol/L/s}$, alternative units may be employed based on the context. For instance, in atmospheric chemistry, reaction rates can be represented in molecules per cubic centimeter per second ($\text{molecules/cm}^3/\text{s}$).

The choice of units can vary depending on the degree of precision required. In certain scenarios, it may be more appropriate to express the reaction rate in terms of concentration changes per minute, hour, or even day, particularly for slower reactions where changes in concentration per second may be too minimal to measure reliably.

Additionally, reaction rates can be described in terms of either reactants or products. For example, in the reaction $A + B \rightarrow C + D$, the reaction rate could be articulated as the decrease in concentration of the reactants $A$ or $B$, or the increase in concentration of the products $C$ or $D$. The selection of which concentration to use will depend on what is most pertinent or practical for the specific reaction being analyzed.

In summary, while the predominant unit for reporting reaction rates is $\text{mol/L/s}$, the specific units employed can differ based on the context and the particular needs of the reaction under investigation.
