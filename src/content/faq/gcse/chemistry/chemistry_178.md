You can effectively demonstrate the impact of a catalyst in the laboratory by conducting an experiment using hydrogen peroxide and yeast.

In a typical experiment, you would begin by preparing two identical solutions of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a compound that naturally decomposes into water and oxygen, but this process occurs relatively slowly at room temperature. The objective of the experiment is to illustrate how the addition of a catalyst can accelerate this reaction.

In the first part of the experiment, you will observe the reaction rate of the hydrogen peroxide solution without any catalyst. You can achieve this by measuring the volume of oxygen gas produced over a specific period of time, which will provide a baseline reaction rate.

Next, you will introduce a small amount of yeast to the second hydrogen peroxide solution. Yeast serves as a catalyst in this reaction due to the presence of an enzyme called catalase, which facilitates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide. After adding the yeast, you will again measure the rate of oxygen gas production using the same method as before.

By comparing the reaction rates of the two solutions, you can clearly demonstrate the effect of the catalyst. The solution containing yeast should produce oxygen gas at a significantly faster rate than the solution without yeast, indicating that the catalyst has greatly enhanced the reaction rate.

It is important to note that a catalyst is not consumed in the reaction, meaning that even a small amount of yeast can exert a substantial effect. This experiment serves as a straightforward yet effective way to illustrate the role of catalysts in chemical reactions. Be sure to handle all chemicals with care and adhere to your teacher's safety instructions throughout the experiment.
