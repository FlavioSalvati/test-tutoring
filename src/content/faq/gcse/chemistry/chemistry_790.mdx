Chlorine gas is produced through the process of electrolysis, which involves passing an electric current through a sodium chloride solution, commonly known as brine.

The electrolysis process for generating chlorine gas consists of several important steps. Initially, a brine solution is prepared. This solution is then placed in an electrolytic cell, which contains two electrodes: an anode (the positive electrode) and a cathode (the negative electrode).

When an electric current is applied to the brine, the sodium chloride dissociates into its component ions, a process known as electrolysis. At the anode, chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$) lose electrons and are converted into chlorine gas ($\text{Cl}_2$). The reaction occurring at the anode can be represented as:

$$
2 \text{Cl}^- - 2 e^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2
$$

This indicates that for every two chloride ions, one molecule of chlorine gas is generated.

At the cathode, hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) gain electrons to form hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$), while sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) remain in the solution. The reaction at the cathode can be expressed as:

$$
2 \text{H}^+ + 2 e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2
$$

This means that for every two hydrogen ions, one molecule of hydrogen gas is produced.

The chlorine gas generated during this process can be collected and utilized for various applications, including water treatment, plastic production, and the manufacture of numerous chemicals. However, it is crucial to handle chlorine gas with care, as it is highly toxic.

Understanding the electrolysis process is an essential aspect of GCSE Chemistry, as it illustrates how elements can be separated from their compounds. This fascinating process demonstrates the transformative power of electricity in altering substances.
