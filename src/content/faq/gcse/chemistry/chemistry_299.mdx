A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a systematic method used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with a product throughout its entire life cycle.

More specifically, an LCA provides a thorough approach to assessing the environmental effects of a product or service, spanning from its inception to its disposal. This process encompasses all stages of a productâ€™s life, including the extraction of raw materials, production, distribution, usage, repair and maintenance, as well as its eventual disposal or recycling. This comprehensive evaluation is often described as assessing the product "from cradle to grave."

The LCA process is structured into four key stages:

1. **Goal and Scope Definition**: This initial stage involves clarifying the product or service being assessed, the objectives of the assessment, and the boundaries of the system to be evaluated.

2. **Inventory Analysis**: In this stage, data is gathered on all inputs and outputs of the system, such as energy consumption, material usage, and emissions produced.

3. **Impact Assessment**: During this phase, the potential environmental impacts of the system are identified and evaluated. This assessment may cover various concerns, including climate change, human health effects, ecosystem quality, and resource depletion.

4. **Interpretation of Results**: In the final stage, the findings from the assessment are analyzed, and conclusions are drawn based on the data collected.

The primary objective of an LCA is to offer a comprehensive overview of the environmental impacts of a product or service and to pinpoint opportunities for reducing these impacts. This tool is invaluable for decision-making, serving businesses, policymakers, and consumers alike in making more sustainable choices.
