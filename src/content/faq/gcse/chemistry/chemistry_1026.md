The atmosphere of early Earth was vastly different from what we experience today. Approximately $4.5$ billion years ago, it was primarily composed of methane ($\text{CH}_4$), ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), water vapor ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), with almost no oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) present. This contrasts sharply with the current atmosphere, which consists of about $78\%$ nitrogen ($\text{N}_2$), $21\%$ oxygen ($\text{O}_2$), and trace amounts of other gases, including carbon dioxide and argon ($\text{Ar}$).

The early atmosphere likely originated from gases released through volcanic activity, a process known as volcanic outgassing. This process expelled significant quantities of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and nitrogen, while oxygen was released in minimal amounts. The elevated levels of methane and ammonia can be attributed to the scarcity of oxygen and the abundance of hydrogen ($\text{H}_2$). Together, these gases, along with water vapor, contributed to a greenhouse effect that trapped heat, resulting in a much hotter early Earth.

The transition from an oxygen-poor atmosphere to one rich in oxygen was primarily driven by photosynthesis in early life forms, particularly cyanobacteria. These microorganisms utilized sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. This significant transformation began around $2.4$ billion years ago and is referred to as the Great Oxygenation Event.

As oxygen levels increased, ozone ($\text{O}_3$) began to form in the upper atmosphere, providing a protective shield against harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This change made Earth's conditions more suitable for life. Over time, as oxygen levels rose, the concentrations of methane and ammonia decreased due to their reaction with the increasing oxygen. Thus, Earth's atmosphere has continued to evolve over billions of years, ultimately supporting a diverse array of life forms.
