Particulate matter (PM) poses serious health risks, including respiratory issues and heart disease, when inhaled.

Particulate matter refers to a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets present in the air. These particles can consist of various components, such as acids, organic chemicals, metals, and dust. The size of these particles is directly correlated with their potential to cause health problems. In particular, particles smaller than $10$ micrometres in diameter are the most concerning because they can penetrate deep into the lungs, and some may even enter the bloodstream.

Exposure to particulate matter can adversely affect both the lungs and the heart. Numerous scientific studies have established a link between particle pollution and various health problems, including coughing, wheezing, decreased lung function, asthma attacks, heart attacks, and even premature death in individuals with pre-existing heart or lung conditions.

Long-term exposure to particulate matter can lead to significant health challenges. It can initiate or exacerbate respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). Additionally, it can impair the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections.

Beyond respiratory complications, chronic exposure to particulate matter is also associated with an increased risk of heart disease. The particles can infiltrate the bloodstream and trigger inflammation, which may contribute to the formation of plaques in the arteries. This process heightens the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes.

Moreover, some studies have indicated a potential association between exposure to particulate matter and other health conditions, such as diabetes and neurological disorders. However, further research is necessary to explore these links comprehensively.

In summary, particulate matter in the air we breathe can significantly impact human health, particularly concerning respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and manage air quality to minimize exposure to these harmful particles.
