Carboxylic acids undergo reactions with metals, resulting in the formation of a salt and the release of hydrogen gas.

Like other acids, carboxylic acids engage in a single displacement reaction with metals. This type of reaction is classified as a redox reaction, where a metal displaces hydrogen from the acid. During this process, the metal combines with the carboxylate ion—derived from the carboxylic acid—to produce a salt, while hydrogen gas is liberated.

For instance, when ethanoic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$) reacts with magnesium ($\text{Mg}$), the magnesium displaces the hydrogen from the acid. This results in the formation of magnesium ethanoate, which is a salt, alongside the release of hydrogen gas. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

$$
2 \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{Mg} \rightarrow (\text{CH}_3\text{COO})_2\text{Mg} + \text{H}_2.
$$

This reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. The reason for this heat release is that the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (the carboxylic acid and the metal) is less than the energy released when new bonds are formed in the products (the salt and hydrogen gas).

It is crucial to note that not all metals can react with carboxylic acids. Metals that are less reactive than hydrogen, such as copper or silver, will not displace hydrogen from the acid. The reactivity of a metal is determined by its position in the reactivity series, which ranks metals in order of decreasing reactivity.

In summary, carboxylic acids react with metals to yield a salt and hydrogen gas through an exothermic single displacement reaction. The reactivity of the metal plays a key role in determining whether this reaction will take place.
