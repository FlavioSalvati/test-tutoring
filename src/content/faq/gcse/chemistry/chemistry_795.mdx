A reaction profile is a diagram that illustrates the energy changes that occur during a chemical reaction.

More specifically, a reaction profile, often referred to as an energy level diagram, serves as a graphical representation of the energy fluctuations throughout the course of a chemical reaction. This diagram is an essential tool in physical chemistry, as it aids in visualizing the energy involved in a reaction. The vertical axis of the diagram indicates the energy level, while the horizontal axis depicts the progression of the reaction.

At the outset of the reaction, the reactants possess a specific amount of energy. As the reaction advances, energy may be either absorbed or released, resulting in a change in energy levels. These changes are depicted as peaks or troughs within the reaction profile. The highest point of the peak represents the activation energy, denoted as $E_a$, which is the minimum energy necessary for the reaction to proceed.

If the energy of the products is lower than that of the reactants, the reaction is classified as exothermic. In this case, the energy difference is released, typically in the form of heat. This scenario is illustrated by a downward slope in the reaction profile. Conversely, if the products possess more energy than the reactants, the reaction is termed endothermic. Here, the energy difference is absorbed from the surroundings, represented by an upward slope in the reaction profile.

In summary, a reaction profile is a valuable tool for comprehending the energy changes that occur during a chemical reaction. It effectively visualizes the energy that is absorbed or released, as well as the activation energy required for the reaction to take place.
