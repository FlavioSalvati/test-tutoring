Fractional distillation is a technique used to separate the various components of crude oil by heating them to different temperatures, which correspond to their specific boiling points.

Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, each characterized by distinct molecular sizes and boiling points. The fractional distillation process begins by heating crude oil to approximately $350^\circ \text{C}$, transforming it into a vapor. This vapor is then introduced into a fractionating column, a tall structure equipped with trays or plates designed to facilitate separation.

The fractionating column operates with a temperature gradient: the bottom of the column maintains the highest temperatures, while the temperature decreases gradually toward the top. As the vapor ascends through the column, various hydrocarbon components condense back into liquid form at temperatures that correspond to their boiling points. Heavier hydrocarbons, which possess higher boiling points, condense on the lower trays of the column, while the lighter hydrocarbons, having lower boiling points, rise higher before condensing.

Each tray collects a specific 'fraction' or component of the crude oil, which can then be extracted for further processing or utilization. For instance, the heaviest residues collected at the bottom are typically used to produce bitumen, while the next fraction up may be utilized for diesel fuel, followed by kerosene, petrol, and so forth. The lightest fractions, which may not condense within the column at all, are drawn off from the top as gases.

Through this process, fractional distillation effectively separates the intricate mixture of hydrocarbons found in crude oil into valuable components, each with unique properties and applications. This method can be likened to sorting a mixed bag of sweets into distinct typesâ€”while they all belong to the same category, they differ in flavors, shapes, and colors.
