Addition polymerization is a chemical reaction in which monomers combine to form a polymer without the generation of any additional products.

To elaborate, addition polymerization is a specific type of chain-growth polymerization. During this process, monomers that contain double or triple bonds can react with one another to create a polymer. The mechanism involves the cleavage of these double or triple bonds, enabling the monomers to link together in a repetitive sequence, ultimately resulting in the formation of a long-chain polymer.

A distinguishing characteristic of addition polymerization is that it does not produce any by-products during the reaction. This contrasts with condensation polymerization, which often results in the formation of a small molecule, typically water, alongside the polymer.

A classic example of addition polymerization is the synthesis of polyethylene from ethylene monomers. In this reaction, the double bond in the ethylene monomer is broken, allowing the monomers to connect in a chain formation to generate the polymer. This reaction is typically initiated by a catalyst or through the application of heat, which provides the necessary energy to break the double bonds in the monomers.

Addition polymerization plays a vital role in the production of many common plastics, including polyethylene and polypropylene. These materials have diverse applications, ranging from packaging materials to components used in vehicles and household appliances. Consequently, a thorough understanding of addition polymerization is crucial in the fields of materials science, manufacturing, and various industrial applications.
