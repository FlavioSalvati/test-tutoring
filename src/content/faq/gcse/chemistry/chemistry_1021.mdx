Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that significantly contributes to global warming by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. It accomplishes this by absorbing solar energy and impeding the rate at which this energy escapes back into space. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect, which plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's temperature. However, excessive concentrations of greenhouse gases, including methane, can lead to global warming, posing a serious environmental threat.

Over a period of $100$ years, methane is more than $25$ times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide. Although its atmospheric concentration is much lower than that of carbon dioxide, methane's substantial heat-trapping capability makes it a key player in climate change. Methane emissions arise from various sources, including the production and transportation of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Additionally, it is emitted from agricultural activities, particularly livestock, and from the decomposition of organic waste in municipal solid waste landfills.

The significance of methane as a greenhouse gas raises considerable concern, especially given the rising levels of methane emissions. To combat global warming, various strategies have been proposed to reduce methane emissions. These include enhancing the efficiency of fossil fuel extraction and usage, improving livestock management and agricultural practices, and minimizing organic waste.

Understanding methane's role in the greenhouse effect is essential for grasping the broader challenges of climate change. By continuing to study and monitor atmospheric methane levels, we can devise more effective strategies to mitigate its impact and safeguard our planet's future.
