Covalent bonds can be categorized as single, double, or triple based on the number of electron pairs shared between two atoms.

In a covalent bond, atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. The nature of the covalent bond formed depends on how many pairs of electrons are shared. 

- A **single covalent bond** consists of one shared pair of electrons, which means a total of two electrons are shared. This is the simplest form of covalent bonding, commonly observed in molecules such as hydrogen ($\text{H}_2$), where two hydrogen atoms share one pair of electrons to attain stability.

- A **double covalent bond** involves two shared pairs of electrons, resulting in a total of four electrons being shared. This type of bond is frequently found in molecules like oxygen ($\text{O}_2$), where each oxygen atom shares two pairs of electrons with the other. Double bonds are generally stronger and shorter than single bonds due to the increased number of shared electrons.

- A **triple covalent bond** consists of three shared pairs of electrons, equating to six electrons shared in total. This bond represents the strongest and shortest type of covalent bond. An example of this can be seen in nitrogen ($\text{N}_2$), where each nitrogen atom shares three pairs of electrons with the other.

The type of covalent bond formed not only influences the strength and length of the bond but also impacts the physical and chemical properties of the molecule. For instance, molecules with double and triple bonds often exhibit different shapes and reactivities compared to those with single bonds. Understanding the distinctions between single, double, and triple covalent bonds is essential for predicting the behavior and properties of various molecules.
