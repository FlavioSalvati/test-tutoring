Iron and sodium exhibit distinct chemical properties, including differences in reactivity, oxidation states, and the types of compounds they form.

Iron, classified as a transition metal, possesses multiple oxidation states. This characteristic enables it to create a diverse array of compounds. For example, iron can form iron(II) compounds, where its oxidation state is $+2$, as well as iron(III) compounds, with an oxidation state of $+3$. In terms of reactivity, iron is less reactive than sodium. It reacts gradually with oxygen in the air, leading to the formation of iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. Unlike sodium, iron does not react violently with water or air.

In contrast, sodium is categorized as an alkali metal. It has a single oxidation state of $+1$ and predominantly forms ionic compounds. Sodium is highly reactive; it reacts vigorously with water to produce sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas, and it also reacts with oxygen in the air to form sodium oxide. Due to its high reactivity, sodium must be stored under oil to prevent unwanted reactions with moisture in the air.

The differences in the chemical properties of iron and sodium can be attributed to their positions in the periodic table. Iron is located in the middle of the table, within the transition metals block, while sodium is positioned on the far left in the alkali metals group. These placements reflect the atomic structure of each element, particularly the arrangement of their electrons, which influences their chemical behavior. For instance, sodium's single electron in its outermost energy level makes it eager to react in order to achieve a stable electron configuration. In contrast, iron's multiple outer electrons facilitate various oxidation states, allowing for more complex chemical interactions.
