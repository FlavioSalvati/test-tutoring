Water is generated in a hydrogen fuel cell through a chemical reaction involving hydrogen and oxygen.

In a hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) and oxygen gas ($\text{O}_2$) serve as the fuel. The process begins when hydrogen gas is introduced to the anode, which is the negative electrode of the fuel cell. At the anode, a catalyst—typically made of platinum—facilitates the splitting of hydrogen molecules into protons ($\text{H}^+$) and electrons ($\text{e}^-$).

The electrons are then compelled to travel through an external circuit, generating an electric current before they arrive at the cathode, the positive electrode. In contrast, the protons traverse a proton exchange membrane (PEM) that separates the anode from the cathode. This membrane selectively allows only protons to pass through, thus forcing the electrons to take the longer route via the external circuit.

At the cathode, oxygen gas is introduced. Here, the oxygen molecules react with the protons that have successfully crossed the PEM and the electrons that have journeyed through the external circuit. This reaction results in the formation of water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), which is the sole by-product of the hydrogen fuel cell.

The overall chemical reaction occurring in a hydrogen fuel cell can be summarized as follows:

$$
2\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{energy}.
$$

This equation indicates that for every two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen, two molecules of water are produced, along with energy in the form of electricity.

This process is not only efficient but also environmentally friendly, as the only by-product is water. Thus, hydrogen fuel cells represent a promising technology for sustainable energy production. However, it is essential to consider that the methods used to produce hydrogen gas can have varying environmental impacts.
