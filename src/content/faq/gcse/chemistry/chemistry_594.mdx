Common atmospheric pollutants resulting from fuel combustion include carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), carbon monoxide ($\text{CO}$), sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$), nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$), and particulates.

When fuels are burned, they emit a range of pollutants into the atmosphere. One of the most prevalent is carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), a greenhouse gas that significantly contributes to global warming. This gas is produced when carbon-based fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are combusted in the presence of oxygen. Another important pollutant is carbon monoxide ($\text{CO}$), a toxic gas generated when there is insufficient oxygen to completely oxidize the fuel into $\text{CO}_2$.

Sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$) is another pollutant that arises from burning fuels, especially those containing sulfur impurities, such as coal and oil. In the atmosphere, $\text{SO}_2$ can react with water to form sulfuric acid, which contributes to acid rain. This phenomenon can cause significant damage to buildings, harm aquatic ecosystems, and adversely affect soil fertility.

Nitrogen oxides, which include nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$) and nitric oxide ($\text{NO}$), are also emitted when fuels are burned at high temperatures. These gases can react with atmospheric water to produce nitric acid, another contributor to acid rain. Moreover, they can react with sunlight to form ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant that poses health risks.

Lastly, particulates, which are tiny solid or liquid particles, are released during the combustion of fuels. These particulates can include soot, ash, and various metals. When inhaled, they can cause respiratory problems and contribute to the formation of smog.

In summary, the combustion of fuels releases a diverse array of pollutants into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), carbon monoxide ($\text{CO}$), sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$), nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$), and particulates. These pollutants have detrimental effects on the environment and pose serious risks to human health.
