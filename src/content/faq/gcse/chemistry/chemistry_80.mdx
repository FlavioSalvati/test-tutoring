To determine the number of moles from a balanced chemical equation, you utilize the stoichiometric coefficients that appear in front of the reactants and products.

In a balanced chemical equation, these coefficients indicate the number of moles of each substance that participate in the reaction. They establish the relationship between the amounts of reactants and products. For example, in the equation 

$$
2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O},
$$ 

the coefficients reveal that two moles of hydrogen react with one mole of oxygen to produce two moles of water.

To find the number of moles of substances based on a balanced equation, you first need to know the quantity of at least one substance involved in the reaction. This could be given directly as the number of moles of a reactant or product, or as the mass of a substance (from which you can calculate the number of moles using its molar mass). Once you have the number of moles for one substance, you can use the stoichiometric coefficients to find the number of moles of any other substance in the reaction.

For instance, if you know that you have $4$ moles of hydrogen in the reaction above, you can employ the stoichiometric coefficients to conclude that you will require $2$ moles of oxygen (given the hydrogen to oxygen ratio of $2:1$) and produce $4$ moles of water (because the ratio of hydrogen to water is $2:2$, which simplifies to $1:1$).

In summary, the essential aspect of determining moles from a balanced equation is to understand the stoichiometric coefficients and how they represent the mole ratios of the reactants and products.
