Diamond is utilized in cutting tools due to its status as the hardest known material, which makes it exceptionally effective for cutting and grinding applications.

As a form of carbon, diamond is celebrated for its remarkable hardness, a characteristic attributed to its unique crystal structure. In this structure, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral configuration. This arrangement forms a rigid three-dimensional network that is highly resistant to deformation, establishing diamond as the hardest material known to man.

When employed in cutting tools, diamond's unparalleled hardness enables it to slice through virtually any substance with remarkable ease. This property is particularly beneficial in industries such as construction and manufacturing, where materials with varying degrees of hardness need to be cut or shaped. Tools tipped with diamond can effectively cut through materials that would quickly wear down other cutting implements, such as those made from steel or tungsten carbide.

Moreover, diamond possesses a high melting point and outstanding thermal conductivity, allowing it to endure the heat produced during cutting operations. This capability helps prevent overheating and premature wear of the tool, thereby prolonging its operational lifespan.

Additionally, diamondâ€™s chemical inertness contributes to its resistance to corrosion and wear, further enhancing its durability. As a result, diamond cutting tools require less frequent replacement compared to those made from alternative materials, making them a cost-effective long-term investment.

It is essential to recognize, however, that while diamond is incredibly hard, it is also brittle. Consequently, diamond cutting tools may shatter if subjected to strong impacts or misused. Therefore, proper handling is crucial to avoid damaging these tools.

In conclusion, the unique combination of exceptional hardness, high melting point, excellent thermal conductivity, and chemical inertness makes diamond an ideal material for manufacturing cutting tools.
