Here are enhanced and clearer descriptions of the reactions with high atom economy, formatted according to your specifications:

Examples of reactions that exhibit high atom economy include the Haber process, the Ostwald process, and the Contact process.

The **Haber process** is a method for synthesizing ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gases. This reaction boasts a high atom economy because every atom in the reactants is utilized to form the product. The balanced chemical equation for the Haber process is:

$$
\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_3(g)
$$

In this equation, all atoms from the reactants are converted into ammonia, resulting in no waste products.

The **Ostwald process** serves as another prime example of a reaction with high atom economy. This process is employed to produce nitric acid from ammonia. The overall sequence of reactions in the Ostwald process can be broken down as follows:

1. 
$$
4\text{NH}_3(g) + 5\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 4\text{NO}(g) + 6\text{H}_2\text{O}(g)
$$

2. 
$$
2\text{NO}(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{NO}_2(g)
$$

3. 
$$
3\text{NO}_2(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{HNO}_3(aq) + \text{NO}(g)
$$

Throughout these reactions, all atoms present in the reactants are converted into products, meaning there are no waste products generated.

The **Contact process** is utilized to manufacture sulfuric acid from sulfur dioxide. The overall reaction for the Contact process is represented as follows:

1. 
$$
2\text{SO}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{SO}_3(g)
$$

2. 
$$
\text{SO}_3(g) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4(aq)
$$

This reaction also exhibits high atom economy, as all atoms from the reactants are fully incorporated into the final product.

In all of these processes, high atom economy is advantageous because it ensures efficient use of resources and minimizes waste production. This efficiency is not only cost-effective but also more environmentally friendly, contributing to sustainable practices in chemical manufacturing.
