To perform a hydrogen test, you will need a few essential items: a burning splint, a test tube, and a sample suspected to contain hydrogen.

### Materials Required:
1. **Sample**: This could be a gas collected from a chemical reaction or a substance that you believe may contain hydrogen.
2. **Test Tube**: Use a clean and dry test tube or similar container to hold your sample. Ensuring that the test tube is free from contaminants is crucial for accurate results.
3. **Burning Splint**: A burning splint is a small wooden stick that you ignite at one end, typically using a match or lighter. Handle the burning splint with care to prevent burns or fire hazards.

### Procedure:
1. **Preparation**: Begin by ensuring that you have a sample that may contain hydrogen.
2. **Ignition of Splint**: Light one end of the wooden splint using a match or lighter.
3. **Testing for Hydrogen**: Carefully bring the burning splint to the mouth of the test tube containing your sample. If the sample indeed contains hydrogen, you will hear a distinctive "pop" sound as the gas ignites. This phenomenon, known as the 'pop test,' clearly indicates the presence of hydrogen.

### Safety Considerations:
Safety is of utmost importance when conducting a hydrogen test. Here are some essential safety guidelines:
- Always wear safety goggles and a lab coat to protect your eyes and skin.
- Conduct the test in a well-ventilated area, away from flammable materials.
- Never point the mouth of the test tube towards yourself or others, as the ignited hydrogen can cause burns or other injuries.

### Conclusion:
In summary, to conduct a hydrogen test, gather a sample that may contain hydrogen, a clean test tube for the sample, and a burning splint to ignite the gas. Always adhere to safety guidelines during the test to ensure a safe and accurate procedure.
