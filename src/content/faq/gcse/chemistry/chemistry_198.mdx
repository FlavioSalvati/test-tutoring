Crude oil, commonly referred to as petroleum, is a naturally occurring, unrefined fossil fuel. It is primarily composed of hydrocarbons, which are compounds formed from hydrogen and carbon atoms. The complexity of crude oil arises from the varying lengths, structures, and complexities of these hydrocarbons, which can range from simple molecules containing just one carbon atom, such as methane ($\text{CH}_4$), to more complex ones with as many as 60 carbon atoms.

In addition to hydrocarbons, crude oil contains trace amounts of other elements, including oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. These elements are typically found in the form of compounds such as carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$), and sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$). The presence of these compounds can have significant environmental implications, particularly when crude oil is combusted as fuel.

Moreover, crude oil may also contain minute quantities of metal impurities, primarily iron, nickel, and vanadium. These metals usually exist as complex compounds and can significantly influence the refining process. For instance, they may lead to corrosion of refining equipment or the formation of undesirable by-products during processing.

The specific composition of crude oil can vary considerably depending on its geographical source. Different oil fields worldwide produce crude oil with distinct characteristics, impacting its quality, suitability for various applications, and market pricing. For example, crude oil that possesses a high sulfur content is classified as 'sour' crude, which is generally considered less desirable compared to 'sweet' crude that has a lower sulfur content.
