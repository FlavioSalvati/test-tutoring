Ground-level ozone is produced when sunlight interacts with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.

Unlike ozone in the upper atmosphere, which provides a protective layer against harmful ultraviolet rays, ground-level ozone is not emitted directly. Instead, it forms through chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This process occurs when pollutants released from sources such as automobiles, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, and chemical manufacturing facilities react in the presence of sunlight.

Nitrogen oxides are a group of gases generated during high-temperature combustion processes, which take place in power plants and motor vehicles. In contrast, volatile organic compounds are released from a variety of sources, including gasoline, paints, solvents, and even some types of vegetation.

When nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds interact in the atmosphere under sunlight, they undergo a series of chemical reactions that lead to the formation of ozone. These reactions are particularly intensified by heat, which is why ground-level ozone levels tend to be more problematic during the warmer summer months.

The formation of ground-level ozone is a significant concern due to its harmful effects on human health and the environment. Exposure to ground-level ozone can lead to respiratory issues, trigger asthma attacks, reduce lung function, and contribute to various lung diseases.

In summary, ground-level ozone is generated through a series of chemical reactions driven by sunlight, involving nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds primarily emitted from human activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels.
