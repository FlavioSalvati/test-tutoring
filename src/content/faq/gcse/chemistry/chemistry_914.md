Condensation polymers are distinguished by their high melting and boiling points, exceptional durability, and the release of small molecules during their formation.

These polymers are produced through a process called condensation polymerization. In this process, monomers are linked together with the elimination of a small molecule, often water, which is the reason for the term "condensation." This differs from addition polymerization, where all atoms in the monomers contribute to forming the polymer without the loss of any small molecules.

A notable characteristic of condensation polymers is their elevated melting and boiling points. This property arises from the strong intermolecular forces acting between the polymer chains, which necessitate significant energy to overcome. Consequently, condensation polymers are frequently utilized in applications that demand materials capable of withstanding high temperatures, such as in the production of plastics and fibers.

Additionally, condensation polymers are renowned for their durability. Their resistance to wear and tear makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, from textiles to automotive components. This durability stems from the robust covalent bonds that link the polymer chains, making them difficult to break.

Moreover, condensation polymers tend to be less reactive than their corresponding monomer units. This reduced reactivity occurs because the active groups on the monomers are consumed during the polymerization process, leaving fewer reactive sites on the polymer chains.

Furthermore, the synthesis of condensation polymers is marked by the release of small molecules, such as water or methanol. This aspect is a fundamental characteristic of condensation polymerization and is integral to the nomenclature of these polymers. Notably, this process can be reversed through the addition of the small molecule, a reaction known as hydrolysis, which can decompose the polymer back into its monomer units.
