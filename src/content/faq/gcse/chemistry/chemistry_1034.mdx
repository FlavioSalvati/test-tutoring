Nitrogen oxides, commonly referred to as NOx, are a group of gases primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen. The two most prevalent forms are nitric oxide ($\text{NO}$) and nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$). These gases are generated through the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen during combustion processes, particularly at elevated temperatures. They are emitted into the atmosphere from various sources, including vehicle exhaust, power plants, and industrial operations.

When inhaled, nitrogen oxides can pose significant threats to respiratory health. They can react with moisture present in the lungs to produce nitric acid, which may lead to damage of lung tissue. This damage can result in a variety of respiratory issues, such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

In addition to causing direct harm to the respiratory system, nitrogen oxides can impair lung function, making breathing more difficult. This effect is particularly concerning for individuals with existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma or bronchitis, as it can exacerbate their symptoms.

Furthermore, nitrogen oxides play a crucial role in the formation of ground-level ozone, a major component of smog. Ozone is a potent respiratory irritant that can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, coughing, and throat irritation. It can also aggravate conditions like bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.

Consequently, exposure to nitrogen oxides—whether directly or through the resultant formation of ozone—can have serious repercussions for respiratory health. It is vital to recognize these effects and take proactive measures to minimize exposure, such as reducing outdoor activities on days when air pollution levels are high.
