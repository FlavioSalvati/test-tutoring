Carbon offset schemes are initiatives designed to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions as part of the global effort to combat climate change.

At their core, carbon offset schemes function as a form of trade. When you purchase an offset, you are essentially funding projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These projects may include efforts in renewable energy, energy efficiency, or reforestation. The primary goal of these schemes is to counterbalance or "offset" the emissions generated by individuals, businesses, or even entire nations.

The concept of carbon offsetting is predicated on the idea that financing emissions reductions in one location can compensate for emissions produced elsewhere. For instance, a company located in the UK might offset its carbon emissions by investing in a reforestation project in Brazil. The trees planted in Brazil absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, effectively "offsetting" the emissions generated by the UK-based company.

There are two principal categories of carbon offset schemes: voluntary and compliance schemes. Voluntary schemes allow individuals or companies to choose to offset their carbon emissions based on their own decisions. In contrast, compliance schemes are part of international frameworks designed to combat climate change, where countries have committed to reducing their carbon emissions under agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement.

Despite their benefits, carbon offset schemes are not without controversy. Critics argue that these initiatives enable businesses to evade their environmental responsibilities by purchasing offsets instead of directly reducing their emissions. Additionally, they highlight the challenges associated with accurately measuring the amount of carbon dioxide that these projects actually save. Nevertheless, carbon offset schemes are widely acknowledged as a crucial tool in the fight against climate change. They offer a mechanism for individuals and businesses to take accountability for their emissions and contribute to global efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas levels.
