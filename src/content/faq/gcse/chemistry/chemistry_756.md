An illustrative example of an oxidation reaction involving metals is the rusting of iron, which occurs when iron reacts with oxygen to produce iron(III) oxide.

To elaborate, the rusting of iron is a prevalent oxidation reaction that takes place when iron (Fe) interacts with oxygen ($O_2$) in the atmosphere, resulting in the formation of iron(III) oxide ($Fe_2O_3$), commonly known as rust. This chemical reaction can be represented by the equation:

$$
4 \, Fe + 3 \, O_2 \rightarrow 2 \, Fe_2O_3.
$$

This process qualifies as an oxidation reaction because iron loses electrons, thus undergoing oxidation to become iron(III) ions. Meanwhile, the oxygen gains the electrons that iron has lost, which means it is undergoing reduction. This dual process is why such reactions are often classified as redox reactions, as they involve both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously.

It's important to highlight that this reaction does not occur rapidly; rather, it is a slow process that can take years for a piece of iron to completely rust. Additionally, the presence of water—whether from humidity in the air or from the surrounding environment—facilitates the reaction, acting as a catalyst that accelerates the rusting process.

The rusting of iron is just one example of an oxidation reaction involving metals. Other notable examples in chemistry include the reaction of sodium with water and the tarnishing of silver. In these reactions, a metal reacts with oxygen or another substance, leading to the oxidation of the metal.
