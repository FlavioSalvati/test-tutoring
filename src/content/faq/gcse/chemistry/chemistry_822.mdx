To achieve accurate measurements of temperature changes, it is essential to use a calibrated thermometer and adhere to proper measurement procedures.

First and foremost, it is vital to utilize a thermometer that has been accurately calibrated. Calibration ensures that the thermometer yields precise readings. This process involves comparing the thermometer's measurements with a known standard and making necessary adjustments. Regular checks on the calibration of your thermometer are also important to maintain its accuracy over time.

Next, correct placement of the thermometer is crucial. For instance, when measuring the temperature of a liquid, the thermometer should be immersed in the liquid without touching the sides or bottom of the container. This is important because the temperature of the container may differ from that of the liquid, leading to potential inaccuracies in the readings.

Additionally, the thermometer should be read at eye level to avoid parallax error. Parallax error occurs when the thermometer is viewed from an angle, resulting in the reading appearing higher or lower than it actually is. To prevent this, make sure that your eye is aligned directly with the scale on the thermometer.

It is also essential to allow sufficient time for the thermometer to reach thermal equilibrium with the substance being measured. This means waiting until the reading stabilizes before recording the temperature. Taking a reading too soon may not accurately reflect the true temperature of the substance.

Finally, always remember to clean the thermometer both before and after use. Any residue left on the thermometer can interfere with its ability to measure temperature accurately.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that you are measuring temperature changes accurately, which is crucial for many scientific experiments.
