The theoretical yield represents the maximum quantity of product that can be generated from a specified amount of reactant in a chemical reaction. This yield is determined using the balanced chemical equation, which indicates the stoichiometric ratios between the reactants and products. The stoichiometric ratio is derived from the coefficients present in the balanced equation.

To compute the theoretical yield, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Limiting Reactant**: The limiting reactant is the substance that is entirely consumed during the reaction, thereby dictating the maximum amount of product that can be produced. To find the limiting reactant, compare the amounts of each reactant available with the amounts required according to the stoichiometric ratios.

2. **Calculate the Theoretical Yield**: Once the limiting reactant has been identified, the theoretical yield can be calculated using the following formula:

   $$ 
   \text{Theoretical Yield} = \text{Moles of Limiting Reactant} \times \text{Stoichiometric Ratio} \times \text{Molar Mass of Product} 
   $$

   Here, the stoichiometric ratio is the ratio of moles of the limiting reactant to the moles of the desired product as specified in the balanced equation.

3. **Convert Moles to Mass**: To express the theoretical yield in terms of mass, multiply the number of moles of the product by its molar mass. The molar mass, which can be found on the periodic table, represents the mass of one mole of the substance.

It is important to note that the theoretical yield is the ideal scenario. In practice, the actual yield is frequently lower due to various factors such as side reactions, incomplete reactions, or losses during product purification. 

In summary, the formula for calculating theoretical yield is:

$$ 
\text{Theoretical Yield} = \text{Moles of Limiting Reactant} \times \text{Stoichiometric Ratio} \times \text{Molar Mass of Product} 
$$

Remember, the theoretical yield is not just a number; it reflects the potential maximum of product that could be formed under ideal conditions.
