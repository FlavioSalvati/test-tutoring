To calculate the conditional probability $ P(B|A) $, we utilize the formula:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}
$$

In this context, $ P(B|A) $ signifies the probability of event $ B $ occurring given that event $ A $ has already taken place. To determine this value, we apply the formula for conditional probability. 

We are provided with the following values: $ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.1 $ and $ P(A) = 0.2 $. We can now substitute these values into the formula:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}
$$

Substituting the known values gives us:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{0.1}{0.2}
$$

Next, we perform the division:

$$
P(B|A) = 0.5
$$

Thus, the probability of event $ B $ occurring, given that event $ A $ has occurred, is $ 0.5 $ or $ 50\% $.

This implies that if we know event $ A $ has occurred, there is a $ 50\% $ chance that event $ B $ will also occur. Understanding conditional probability is essential in numerous real-life scenarios, such as forecasting weather, making medical diagnoses, and analyzing games of chance. By methodically applying the formula, we can effectively determine the likelihood of one event contingent upon the occurrence of another.
