The angle of elevation and the angle of depression are equal when measured from the same horizontal line.

To elaborate, the angle of elevation is the angle formed between a horizontal line and the line of sight when an observer looks upward at an object. In contrast, the angle of depression is the angle formed between a horizontal line and the line of sight when an observer looks downward at an object. Both angles are measured from the observer's eye level or any horizontal plane.

Consider a scenario where you are standing on a hill and looking down at a tree located at a lower elevation. The angle your line of sight forms with the horizontal line while gazing down at the tree is referred to as the angle of depression. Conversely, if someone is standing at the base of the tree and looking up at you, the angle their line of sight makes with the horizontal line is called the angle of elevation. These two angles are equal because they represent alternate interior angles created by a transversal that intersects two parallel lines (the horizontal lines at your eye level and at the base of the tree).

This relationship is vital for solving problems related to heights and distances, as it enables the use of trigonometric ratios to determine unknown lengths or angles. For instance, if you know the height of a building and the distance from the observer to the base of the building, you can utilize the angle of elevation to calculate the building's height using trigonometric functions such as tangent. Grasping this relationship not only simplifies numerous real-world problems but also serves as a fundamental concept in trigonometry.
