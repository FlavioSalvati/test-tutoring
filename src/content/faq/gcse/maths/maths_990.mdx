The formula for calculating the length of a line segment is known as the distance formula, which is expressed as:

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

To gain a better understanding of this formula, consider two points on a coordinate plane, denoted as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The distance formula allows us to determine the straight-line distance between these two points. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which is used to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. First, calculate the difference in the x-coordinates, given by $x_2 - x_1$, and the difference in the y-coordinates, represented by $y_2 - y_1$. These differences correspond to the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle.

2. Next, square these differences: $(x_2 - x_1)^2$ and $(y_2 - y_1)^2$. Squaring the differences ensures that all values are positive, thereby eliminating any negative signs.

3. Then, add the squared differences together. This sum represents the square of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the points and the coordinate axes.

4. Finally, take the square root of this sum to obtain the length of the hypotenuse, which corresponds to the distance between the two points.

To illustrate this with an example, let’s consider the points $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 1)$:

- The differences in the coordinates are calculated as follows:
  - $x_2 - x_1 = 7 - 3 = 4$
  - $y_2 - y_1 = 1 - 4 = -3$

- Next, square these differences:
  - $(4)^2 = 16$
  - $(-3)^2 = 9$

- Adding these squared values gives:
$$
16 + 9 = 25
$$

- Finally, taking the square root of 25 yields:
$$
\sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Thus, the length of the line segment between the points $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 1)$ is 5 units.
