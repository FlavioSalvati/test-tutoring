To plot the equation $ y = 3x - 4 $, you will find points by substituting various values for $ x $ and then drawing a line through these points.

First, it's important to recognize that $ y = 3x - 4 $ is a linear equation in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ is the y-intercept. In this case, the slope $ m $ is $ 3 $, indicating that the line rises $ 3 $ units for every $ 1 $ unit it moves to the right. The y-intercept $ c $ is $ -4 $, which is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis.

To begin plotting the graph, start by determining the y-intercept. Set $ x = 0 $ in the equation:

$$ 
y = 3(0) - 4 = -4 
$$

This calculation reveals that the point $(0, -4)$ lies on the graph. Make sure to plot this point on the y-axis.

Next, select another value for $ x $ in order to find a second point. For instance, let’s take $ x = 1 $:

$$ 
y = 3(1) - 4 = 3 - 4 = -1 
$$

Thus, the point $(1, -1)$ is also on the graph. Be sure to plot this point as well.

For a third point, let’s choose $ x = 2 $:

$$ 
y = 3(2) - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2 
$$

This gives us the point $(2, 2)$, which should also be plotted on the graph.

Now, draw a straight line through the points $(0, -4)$, $(1, -1)$, and $(2, 2)$. This line represents the equation $ y = 3x - 4 $. Make sure your line extends across the graph to clearly illustrate the linear relationship between the variables $ x $ and $ y $. By plotting these points and connecting them with a straight line, you have successfully graphed the equation.
