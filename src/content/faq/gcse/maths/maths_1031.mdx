The formula for calculating the volume of a cone is given by:

$$
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
$$

To understand this formula, it's important to note that the volume $ V $ of a cone is determined by two fundamental measurements: the radius $ r $ of its circular base and the height $ h $ of the cone. The radius is defined as the distance from the center of the base to its edge, while the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the cone's apex (the tip).

This formula can be better understood by comparing it to the volume of a cylinder. A cylinder that has the same base and height as the cone would have a volume calculated as $ \pi r^2 h $. The volume of the cone is precisely one-third of that of the cylinder, which is why we include the factor of $ \frac{1}{3} $ in the formula.

The symbol $ \pi $ (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $3.14159$. It represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and plays a crucial role in calculations involving circular shapes.

To apply the formula, follow these steps: first, square the radius (multiply the radius by itself), then multiply that result by $ \pi $, followed by multiplying by the height. Finally, divide the entire result by $3$. 

For instance, if a cone has a radius of $3 \, \text{cm}$ and a height of $6 \, \text{cm}$, the volume can be calculated as follows:

$$
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 (6) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9)(6) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (54) = 18 \pi
$$

Thus, the volume of the cone would be $ 18 \pi $ cubic centimeters, which is approximately $56.55 \, \text{cm}^3$ when you multiply by the approximate value of $ \pi $.
