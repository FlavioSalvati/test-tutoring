The standard notation for a function typically employs the format $ f(x) $, where $ f $ denotes the function name and $ x $ represents the input value.

In mathematics, a function establishes a specific relationship between values: each input value (often referred to as $ x $) is associated with precisely one output value (commonly designated as $ y $ or $ f(x) $). The expression $ f(x) $ is interpreted as "f of x," signifying the output of the function $ f $ when the input is $ x $.

For instance, consider a function $ f $ defined by the equation 

$$
f(x) = 2x + 3.
$$

This indicates that for any given input $ x $, the output is determined by doubling $ x $ and then adding 3. Therefore, if we take $ x = 2 $, we can compute the output as follows:

$$
f(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 7.
$$

While the letter $ f $ is frequently used to designate functions, one can also utilize other letters such as $ g $, $ h $, or any other symbol. What is vital is that both the function name and the input variable are clearly defined. For example, the function 

$$
g(t) = t^2 - 4 
$$ 

illustrates another case where $ g $ is the function name and $ t $ is the input variable.

Functions can also be illustrated graphically, with input values plotted along the x-axis and output values along the y-axis. This visual representation aids in understanding how the function behaves for various inputs.

Grasping function notation is essential, as it lays the groundwork for more advanced mathematical topics such as calculus and algebra. It facilitates clear communication and analysis of mathematical relationships.
