To create a net for a triangular prism, begin by sketching two triangles and three rectangles arranged in a specific configuration.

A triangular prism consists of two triangular bases and three rectangular lateral faces. To construct its net, follow these steps:

1. **Draw the First Triangle**: Start by drawing one of the triangular bases. This triangle will serve as one end of the prism.

2. **Attach the First Rectangle**: Next, draw a rectangle connected to one side of the triangle. This rectangle represents one of the lateral faces of the prism.

3. **Add the Second Rectangle**: Now, draw another rectangle attached to the opposite side of the first triangle. This rectangle acts as the second lateral face. Ensure that both rectangles are the same length as the corresponding sides of the triangle they are attached to.

4. **Include the Third Rectangle**: Draw the third rectangle connected to the remaining side of the triangle. This rectangle should match the length of the side of the triangle it is connected to and maintain the same width as the other rectangles.

5. **Draw the Second Triangle**: Finally, add the second triangular base, which should be attached to one of the rectangles. This triangle must be identical to the first triangle you drew.

When you fold the net along its edges, the two triangles will form the bases of the prism, while the three rectangles will comprise the lateral faces. 

By following these steps, you will create a net that, when folded, transforms into a triangular prism. This visual representation is valuable for understanding the three-dimensional shape and its properties, which is essential for solving related problems in GCSE Mathematics.
