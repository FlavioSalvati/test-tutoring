The probability of rolling a 3 followed by a 5 with two six-sided dice is given by $\frac{1}{36}$.

To clarify this concept, let's break it down step by step. When you roll a single six-sided die, each of the six faces (or numbers) has an equal probability of landing face up. Therefore, the probability of rolling any specific number, such as a 3, is $\frac{1}{6}$. Similarly, the probability of rolling a 5 on a single die is also $\frac{1}{6}$.

When we consider two independent events, such as rolling two dice one after the other, we can find the combined probability by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event. Specifically, the probability of rolling a 3 on the first die is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of rolling a 5 on the second die is also $\frac{1}{6}$. To calculate the overall probability of both events occurring in sequence, we multiply these probabilities:

$$
\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}.
$$

This calculation indicates that there is a $1$ in $36$ chance of rolling a 3 on the first die and a 5 on the second die. This is because there are $6$ possible outcomes for the first roll and $6$ possible outcomes for the second roll, leading to a total of $6 \times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Among these outcomes, only one corresponds to the specific sequence of rolling a 3 followed by a 5.
