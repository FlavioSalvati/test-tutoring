To simplify the expression $2\sqrt{20}$, we can follow a systematic approach. The first step is to factor the number inside the square root. We can express the number $20$ in terms of its prime factors: 

$$
20 = 2 \times 2 \times 5 = 4 \times 5.
$$

Notably, $4$ is a perfect square, which allows us to rewrite $\sqrt{20}$ as $\sqrt{4 \times 5}$.

Next, we apply the property of square roots, which states that 

$$
\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}.
$$

Using this property, we can rewrite $\sqrt{4 \times 5}$ as:

$$
\sqrt{4 \times 5} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{5}.
$$

Since $\sqrt{4} = 2$, this further simplifies to:

$$
2\sqrt{5}.
$$

Now, we return to our original expression, $2\sqrt{20}$. We substitute $\sqrt{20}$ with $2\sqrt{5}$:

$$
2\sqrt{20} = 2 \times 2\sqrt{5}.
$$

Multiplying the constants together, we find:

$$
2 \times 2 = 4,
$$

thus leading us to:

$$
2\sqrt{20} = 4\sqrt{5}.
$$

Therefore, the simplified form of $2\sqrt{20}$ is 

$$
4\sqrt{5}.
$$

This simplification process highlights the importance of recognizing perfect squares and utilizing the properties of square roots to methodically simplify the expression.
