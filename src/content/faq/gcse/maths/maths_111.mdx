To determine 25% of 400, we first need to clarify what 25% represents. Percentages express a quantity as a fraction of 100. Thus, 25% signifies 25 out of every 100.

To calculate 25% of any number, you can apply the formula:

$$
\text{Percentage of a Number} = \left( \frac{\text{percentage}}{100} \right) \times \text{total number}
$$

In this particular instance, we seek to find 25% of 400. By substituting into the formula, we have:

$$
\text{Calculation} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 400
$$

Simplifying $\frac{25}{100}$ yields $0.25$. Therefore, we multiply $0.25$ by $400$:

$$
0.25 \times 400 = 100
$$

Consequently, we conclude that 25% of 400 is $100$. 

This method is versatile and can be utilized to determine any percentage of any number. Simply replace $25$ with the desired percentage and $400$ with the number you are analyzing. Mastering this technique is beneficial in various real-life scenarios, such as calculating discounts, interest rates, and analyzing statistics.
