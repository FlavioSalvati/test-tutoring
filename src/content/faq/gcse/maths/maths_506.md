The expression for a vector **e** is given by 

$$
\mathbf{e} = |\mathbf{e}| \cdot \left(\frac{\mathbf{e}}{|\mathbf{e}|}\right),
$$ 

where $|\mathbf{e}|$ denotes the magnitude of the vector and $\left(\frac{\mathbf{e}}{|\mathbf{e}|}\right)$ represents its direction.

To elaborate, a vector is a quantity characterized by both magnitude (size) and direction. The formula 

$$
\mathbf{e} = |\mathbf{e}| \cdot \left(\frac{\mathbf{e}}{|\mathbf{e}|}\right)
$$ 

allows us to express the vector **e** in terms of these two components. Here, $|\mathbf{e}|$ signifies the magnitude of the vector, which quantifies its length. The term $\left(\frac{\mathbf{e}}{|\mathbf{e}|}\right)$ indicates the direction of the vector, represented as a unit vector. A unit vector possesses a magnitude of $1$ and points in the same direction as the original vector.

To compute the magnitude $|\mathbf{e}|$ of a vector **e** with components $(x, y)$, we apply the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
|\mathbf{e}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
$$ 

This formula yields a single numerical value that indicates the length of the vector.

The direction of the vector is expressed by the unit vector $\left(\frac{\mathbf{e}}{|\mathbf{e}|}\right)$. To determine this unit vector, we divide each component of the vector by its magnitude. For a vector **e** with components $(x, y)$, the unit vector is given by 

$$
\left(\frac{x}{|\mathbf{e}|}, \frac{y}{|\mathbf{e}|}\right).
$$ 

This process normalizes the vector, maintaining its direction while scaling its length to $1$.

In summary, by combining the magnitude and the unit vector, we can completely characterize the vector **e** in terms of its magnitude and direction. This is a fundamental concept in vector mathematics, with significant applications across various fields such as physics and engineering.
