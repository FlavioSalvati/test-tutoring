To solve the inequality $ 2x - 5 > 3 $, we will isolate $ x $ by first adding $ 5 $ to both sides and then dividing by $ 2 $.

We start with the given inequality:

$$
2x - 5 > 3.
$$

To eliminate the $ -5 $ on the left-hand side, we add $ 5 $ to both sides of the inequality. This operation keeps the inequality balanced, resulting in:

$$
2x - 5 + 5 > 3 + 5.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
2x > 8.
$$

Next, to isolate $ x $, we need to remove the coefficient $ 2 $. Since $ 2 $ is multiplied by $ x $, we perform the opposite operation, which is division. We divide both sides of the inequality by $ 2 $:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} > \frac{8}{2}.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x > 4.
$$

Thus, the solution to the inequality $ 2x - 5 > 3 $ is $ x > 4 $. This indicates that any value of $ x $ greater than $ 4 $ will satisfy the inequality. 

For instance, if we take $ x = 5 $ and substitute it back into the original inequality, we check:

$$
2(5) - 5 > 3.
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
10 - 5 > 3,
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
5 > 3.
$$

This statement is true, confirming that $ x > 4 $ is indeed the correct solution.
