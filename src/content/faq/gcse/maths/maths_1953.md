To convert the decimal $0.75$ into a percentage, you multiply it by $100$ and then append the percent symbol.

When you convert a decimal to a percentage, you are determining how many parts out of $100$ the decimal represents. To achieve this, you simply multiply the decimal by $100$. For example, for $0.75$, the calculation is:

$$
0.75 \times 100 = 75
$$

After performing this multiplication, you add the percent symbol (%) to signify that the result is a percentage. Thus, $0.75$ becomes $75\%$. This indicates that $0.75$ is equivalent to $75$ out of $100$, or $75\%$.

This method of conversion applies to any decimal number. For instance, if you have $0.5$, multiplying by $100$ gives you:

$$
0.5 \times 100 = 50
$$

Therefore, $0.5$ is equal to $50\%$. In a similar fashion, when you multiply $0.25$ by $100$, you obtain:

$$
0.25 \times 100 = 25
$$

Thus, $0.25$ translates to $25\%$.

It's important to note that multiplying by $100$ is effectively the same as shifting the decimal point two places to the right. This provides a quick method for converting any decimal into a percentage. For example, shifting the decimal point in $0.75$ two places to the right yields $75$.

Understanding this conversion process is valuable in various mathematical contexts, including statistics, probability, and practical applications such as calculating discounts and interest rates.
