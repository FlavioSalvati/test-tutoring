To determine the length (or magnitude) of the vector $(9, -40)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, a fundamental concept in mathematics. This vector consists of two components: $9$ in the x-direction and $-40$ in the y-direction. To find its length, we need to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of these components.

Let's break down the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Square each component**: Compute $9^2$ and $(-40)^2$. This results in:
   $$ 
   9^2 = 81 
   $$
   and
   $$ 
   (-40)^2 = 1600. 
   $$

2. **Sum the squared values**: Add these two results together:
   $$ 
   81 + 1600 = 1681. 
   $$

3. **Take the square root**: Finally, we find the square root of this sum to get the length of the vector:
   $$ 
   \sqrt{1681} = 41. 
   $$

Thus, the length of the vector $(9, -40)$ is $41$.

This method is effective because the vector forms a right-angled triangle with the x and y axes, where the length of the vector represents the hypotenuse. According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. By using this theorem, you can easily calculate the length of any vector given its components.
