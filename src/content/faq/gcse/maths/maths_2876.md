To find the magnitude of the vector $(21, -72)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to its components.

In two-dimensional space, the magnitude of a vector can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem. A vector can be visualized as a directed line segment originating from the point $(0,0)$ and extending to the point $(x,y)$. For the vector $(21, -72)$, its components are $x = 21$ and $y = -72$.

The magnitude (or length) of this vector represents the distance from the origin to the point $(21, -72)$. We calculate the magnitude using the following formula:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

Substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ into the formula, we have:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{21^2 + (-72)^2}
$$

First, we need to compute the squares of the components:

$$
21^2 = 441
$$

$$
(-72)^2 = 5184
$$

Next, we add these squared values together:

$$
441 + 5184 = 5625
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the total:

$$
\sqrt{5625} = 75
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(21, -72)$ is $75$. This method is applicable to any two-dimensional vector and is a fundamental principle in vector mathematics.
