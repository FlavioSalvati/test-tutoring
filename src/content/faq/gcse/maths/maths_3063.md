The initial step in creating a scatter diagram is to gather and organize the data you intend to plot.

First, you need to collect the data that will be used for your scatter diagram. This data typically consists of pairs of values, with each pair representing two related variables. For instance, you might gather information on the number of hours students study and their corresponding exam scores. It is essential to ensure that your data is both accurate and relevant to the relationship you are analyzing.

Once you have collected your data, the next task is to organize it in a clear and systematic manner. This often involves constructing a table with two columns: one for each variable. For example, if you are examining study hours and exam scores, you would list the study hours in one column and the corresponding exam scores in the adjacent column. This organization facilitates the visualization of the pairs of values and will aid you when you begin plotting them on your scatter diagram.

Additionally, organizing your data allows you to identify any errors or outliers that could impact your analysis. Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the rest of your dataset and can skew your results. By thoroughly reviewing your data at this stage, you can make informed decisions about whether to include or exclude these outliers.

In summary, collecting and organizing your data is a vital first step in constructing a scatter diagram, as it lays the groundwork for a precise and meaningful analysis.
