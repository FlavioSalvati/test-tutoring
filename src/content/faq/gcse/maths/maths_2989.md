Survey responses can be categorized into several types of data: qualitative, quantitative, discrete, and continuous.

When collecting survey responses, it is essential to organize the data into these different categories to make the information more comprehensible. Qualitative data refers to characteristics or attributes and is typically non-numerical. For instance, responses regarding favorite colors or types of pets fall under qualitative data. In contrast, quantitative data involves numerical values that can be measured. An example of quantitative data would be the number of hours that students study each week.

Quantitative data can be further subdivided into discrete and continuous data. Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values, often represented as whole numbers. For example, the number of siblings a person has is discrete, as it is impossible to have a fractional number of siblings, such as $2.5$. Continuous data, on the other hand, can take any value within a given range and includes fractions or decimals. An illustrative example of continuous data is the height of students in a class, which can be, for example, $150.5$ cm, $160.2$ cm, and so forth.

To classify survey responses effectively, start by determining whether the data is qualitative or quantitative. If it is quantitative, further assess whether it is discrete or continuous. This classification is crucial as it guides the selection of appropriate methods for data analysis and presentation. For example, bar charts are suitable for displaying discrete data, while histograms are ideal for continuous data. Understanding these categories enhances the interpretation of survey results, enabling you to draw meaningful conclusions.
