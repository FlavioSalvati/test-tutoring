To order a set of negative decimals, you should arrange them from the smallest (most negative) to the largest (least negative).

When working with negative decimals, it is crucial to understand that a number is considered smaller the more negative it is. For instance, $-3.5$ is smaller than $-2.1$ because $-3.5$ lies further to the left on the number line. To effectively order a set of negative decimals, begin by comparing their absolute values (ignoring the negative sign) to grasp their relative sizes.

Start by listing the negative decimals you wish to arrange. For example, consider the set: $-1.2$, $-3.4$, $-0.5$, and $-2.3$. Next, compare the absolute values of these numbers: $1.2$, $3.4$, $0.5$, and $2.3$. Arrange these absolute values in ascending order: $0.5$, $1.2$, $2.3$, and $3.4$. Now, reapply the negative signs to obtain the ordered set of negative decimals: $-0.5$, $-1.2$, $-2.3$, and $-3.4$.

Keep in mind that the number with the smallest absolute value is the least negative and, therefore, the largest among the set of negative decimals. Conversely, the number with the largest absolute value is the most negative and thus the smallest in the set. Practicing this method will enhance your ability to accurately order negative decimals.
