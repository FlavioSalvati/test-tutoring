To apply Pythagoras' Theorem effectively, first identify the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle and then utilize the formula:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that pertains specifically to right-angled triangles. It asserts that in such a triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The formula can be expressed as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

Here, $c$ denotes the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the other two sides.

For instance, consider a triangle with side lengths of $7 \, \text{cm}$ and $24 \, \text{cm}$. To apply Pythagoras' Theorem, you first need to ascertain whether these lengths are the legs ($a$ and $b$) or if one of them is the hypotenuse ($c$). If both $7 \, \text{cm}$ and $24 \, \text{cm}$ are the legs of the triangle, you can find the hypotenuse by substituting these values into the theorem:

$$
7^2 + 24^2 = c^2
$$

Performing the calculations yields:

$$
49 + 576 = c^2
$$
$$
625 = c^2
$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

$$
c = 25 \, \text{cm}
$$

Thus, if $7 \, \text{cm}$ and $24 \, \text{cm}$ are the legs, the hypotenuse measures $25 \, \text{cm}$.

On the other hand, if one of these sides is the hypotenuse, you can rearrange the formula to solve for the unknown side. For example, if $24 \, \text{cm}$ is the hypotenuse and $7 \, \text{cm}$ is one leg, you would set up the equation as follows:

$$
7^2 + b^2 = 24^2
$$

Solving this gives:

$$
49 + b^2 = 576
$$
$$
b^2 = 576 - 49
$$
$$
b^2 = 527
$$

Taking the square root of both sides results in:

$$
b \approx 22.96 \, \text{cm}
$$

In summary, Pythagoras' Theorem is an invaluable tool for determining the length of a missing side in a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known.
