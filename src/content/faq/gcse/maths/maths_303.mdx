To find the equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by the equation $y = 2x + 5$, we will utilize the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line.

First, we identify the slope of the given line, which is $2$. For a line to be perpendicular to another, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of the original slope. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of $2$ is $-\frac{1}{2}$. This indicates that the slope of the line we are looking for will be $-\frac{1}{2}$.

Next, we will apply the point-slope form of a line's equation, which is expressed as:

$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

Here, $m$ represents the slope, and $(x_1, y_1)$ denotes a specific point on the line. If you have a particular point through which the perpendicular line passes, you can substitute that point along with the slope $-\frac{1}{2}$ into this equation. 

For instance, if the line is required to pass through the point $(4, 3)$, we can substitute these values into the equation:

$$y - 3 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 4)$$

Now, let's simplify this equation to express it in the slope-intercept form, $y = mx + c$:

1. Start with:
   $$y - 3 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 2$$
2. Adding $3$ to both sides gives:
   $$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 5$$

Thus, the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $y = 2x + 5$ and passes through the point $(4, 3)$ is:

$$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 5$$

If you do not have a specific point provided, you can express the equation in a more general form as:

$$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + c$$

Here, $c$ represents the y-intercept, which can be determined if a point on the line is available.
