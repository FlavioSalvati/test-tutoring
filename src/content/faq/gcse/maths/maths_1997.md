To calculate 15% of £80, we can follow a straightforward process. First, let's clarify what percentage means: a percentage represents a number as a fraction of 100. Therefore, $15\%$ translates to $15$ out of $100$, or mathematically, $\frac{15}{100}$.

Now, let's break down the steps to find $15\%$ of £80:

1. **Convert the percentage to a decimal**: To do this, divide the percentage by $100$. Thus, $15\%$ becomes $0.15$.
2. **Multiply the decimal by the amount**: In this case, you will multiply $0.15$ by £80.

Now, let's perform the calculation:

$$
0.15 \times £80 = £12
$$

Therefore, we conclude that $15\%$ of £80 equals £12. 

This method can be applied to any percentage calculation. Just remember to convert the percentage to a decimal first, and then multiply it by the amount in question. Mastering this skill is incredibly beneficial for various real-life applications, including calculating discounts, determining interest rates, and more.
