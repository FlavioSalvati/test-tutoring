To determine the actual distance from a scale drawing, you need to multiply the measured distance by the scale factor.

A scale drawing is a visual representation of an object or area that preserves accurate proportions while being either reduced or enlarged by a specific ratio, referred to as the scale factor. For instance, a scale of $1:100$ indicates that $1$ unit on the drawing corresponds to $100$ units in reality.

To begin, measure the distance between two points on the scale drawing using a ruler. Suppose you find that the distance measures $5 \, \text{cm}$ on the drawing. Next, identify the scale factor indicated with the drawing. If the scale is $1:50$, this means that $1 \, \text{cm}$ on the drawing equates to $50 \, \text{cm}$ in real life.

To calculate the actual distance, multiply the measured distance by the scale factor. In this scenario, the calculation would be:

$$
5 \, \text{cm} \times 50 = 250 \, \text{cm}.
$$

Thus, the actual distance between the two points is $250 \, \text{cm}$.

It is crucial to ensure that the units you are using are consistent during these calculations. If the scale is presented in different units, make sure to convert them to the same unit before performing the multiplication. For example, if the scale is $1 \, \text{inch} : 1 \, \text{mile}$ and you measure $2 \, \text{inches}$ on the drawing, the actual distance would be $2 \, \text{miles}$.

Understanding how to utilize scale factors is essential for accurately interpreting maps, architectural plans, and various technical drawings. Practicing with different scales and measurements will enhance your confidence in determining actual distances from scale drawings.
