The slope of the equation $ y = -2x + 7 $ is $ -2 $.

To determine the slope of a linear equation in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, one must identify the coefficient of $ x $. In the equation $ y = -2x + 7 $, the term $ -2x $ reveals that the coefficient of $ x $ is $ -2 $. This coefficient, denoted as $ m $, represents the slope of the line.

The slope provides insight into the steepness and direction of the line. A positive slope indicates that the line rises as one moves from left to right, while a negative slope signifies that it descends in that same direction. In this case, with a slope of $ -2 $, for every unit you move to the right along the $ x $-axis, the value of $ y $ decreases by $ 2 $ units.

Understanding the slope is essential for graphing linear equations and analyzing their behavior. It allows you to predict how changes in $ x $ will impact $ y $. For instance, if you increase $ x $ by $ 1 $, $ y $ will decrease by $ 2 $ units due to the slope of $ -2 $. This concept is fundamental in GCSE Mathematics and will serve as a valuable tool in more advanced subjects, such as calculus and physics.
