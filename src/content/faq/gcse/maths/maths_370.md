The angle at the center of a circle is always twice the angle at the circumference that is subtended by the same arc.

This relationship is a fundamental property in the study of circles within geometry. When you consider a circle and draw two lines from its center to the circumference, these lines create an angle at the center. If you then draw two lines connecting the same points on the circumference to another point on the circumference, they form an angle at that point on the circumference. According to this property, the angle at the center is always twice as large as the angle at the circumference, provided both angles are subtended by the same arc.

To visualize this concept, imagine a circle with a central point $ O $. Select two points, $ A $ and $ B $, on the circumference and draw lines $ OA $ and $ OB $. The angle $ \angle AOB $ represents the angle at the center. Now, choose another point $ C $ on the circumference and draw lines $ AC $ and $ BC $. The angle $ \angle ACB $ represents the angle at the circumference. According to the properties of circles, we have:

$$
\angle AOB = 2 \angle ACB.
$$

This property is particularly useful for solving various problems related to circles, such as determining unknown angles or proving that certain lines are parallel or perpendicular. It also aids in understanding the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, where the opposite angles sum to $ 180^\circ $. Remembering this relationship can significantly simplify many geometry problems.
