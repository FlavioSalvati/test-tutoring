The initial step in creating a pie chart involves collecting and organizing your data into categories and their corresponding values.

To begin constructing a pie chart, you should gather the data you wish to represent. This data must be divided into distinct categories, each accompanied by a value. For instance, if you are creating a pie chart to illustrate your classmates' favorite fruits, you would list each fruit (such as apples, bananas, and oranges) and tally the number of people who prefer each one.

Once you have compiled your data, it is essential to organize it in a manner that facilitates further analysis. Typically, this involves creating a table with two columns: one for the categories and another for the values. For example, if $10$ people prefer apples, $5$ prefer bananas, and $15$ prefer oranges, your table would be structured as follows:
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Fruit} & \text{Number of People} \\
\hline
\text{Apples} & 10 \\
\text{Bananas} & 5 \\
\text{Oranges} & 15 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

This organized data will be instrumental in the subsequent steps, where you will calculate the angles for each slice of the pie chart and ultimately draw the chart itself. Keep in mind that the total of all the values should equal $100\%$ of the data, with each category's value representing a proportion of this total. This preliminary step is crucial, as accurate data collection and organization ensure that your pie chart accurately reflects the information you intend to present.
