The simplified form of $\sqrt{18}$ is $3\sqrt{2}$.

To simplify $\sqrt{18}$, we begin by identifying its prime factors. We can express $18$ as the product of its prime factors: 

$$18 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 2 \times 3^2.$$

Using the property that the square root of a product is equal to the product of the square roots, we can write:

$$\sqrt{18} = \sqrt{2 \times 3^2}.$$

Next, we can separate this expression into two parts: $\sqrt{3^2}$ and $\sqrt{2}$. The square root of $3^2$ is simply $3$, as the square and the square root cancel each other out:

$$\sqrt{3^2} = 3.$$

Now, we multiply this result by the square root of $2$, which remains as $\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, we have:

$$\sqrt{18} = 3 \times \sqrt{2} = 3\sqrt{2}.$$

This technique of breaking down a number into its prime factors and subsequently simplifying the square roots is a valuable method for simplifying square roots in general. It makes the expression more manageable and easier to work with in subsequent calculations.
