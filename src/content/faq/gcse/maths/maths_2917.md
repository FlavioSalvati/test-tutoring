To calculate the expected frequency of an event, you simply multiply the total number of trials by the associated probability of that event.

When tasked with finding the expected frequency, the first step is to determine the total number of trials or observations conducted in your experiment or survey. The probability represents the likelihood of a specific outcome occurring. For instance, consider rolling a standard die; the probability of rolling a 3 is given by $\frac{1}{6}$.

Once you have established the total number of trials, you can calculate the expected frequency by multiplying this total by the probability of the event. This calculation yields the expected frequency, which indicates how many times you would anticipate the event occurring if you were to repeat the experiment numerous times. For example, if you roll a die a total of $60$ times, the expected frequency of rolling a 3 can be computed as follows: 

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \text{Total Trials} \times \text{Probability} = 60 \times \frac{1}{6} = 10.
$$

This approach is applicable in a variety of contexts, such as predicting outcomes in games, analyzing survey results, or examining patterns in scientific experiments. It allows you to make informed predictions based on the provided probabilities and the number of trials conducted. 

Keep in mind that the expected frequency represents a theoretical value; actual results may differ due to random chance. However, as the number of trials increases, the actual frequencies observed should converge closely to the expected frequencies.
