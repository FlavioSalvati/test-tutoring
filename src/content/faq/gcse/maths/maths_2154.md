The inequality representing "z is more than 5" can be expressed as:

$$
z > 5
$$

In mathematical terms, an inequality is a statement that compares two values or expressions, indicating that one is larger or smaller than the other. The symbol ">" denotes "greater than." Therefore, when we state that "z is more than 5," we mean that the value of $ z $ must exceed 5. This is succinctly captured with the expression:

$$
z > 5
$$

To visualize this concept more clearly, consider a number line. The point corresponding to the number 5 marks a specific location on this line. If $ z $ is greater than 5, it signifies that $ z $ can be any number located to the right of 5 on the number line. This includes values such as $5.1$, $6$, $10$, and so forth, but it explicitly excludes the number $5$ itself.

In practical applications, when solving an equation or addressing a problem that requires finding values for $ z $ that satisfy the inequality $ z > 5 $, you would search for any number greater than $5$. This type of problem is frequently encountered in GCSE Maths, where a solid understanding of inequalities is essential for solving a variety of algebraic challenges.

It is important to remember that inequalities are a core component of algebra. They allow us to express a range of possible solutions rather than a single fixed value. This characteristic makes inequalities particularly valuable in real-world scenarios, where conditions or constraints are often not precise but instead fall within a specific range.
