To solve the equation $5x - 7 = 18$, we will first isolate the variable $x$. 

Starting with the original equation:

$$ 5x - 7 = 18 $$

Our first step is to eliminate the constant term on the left side, which is $-7$. We can do this by adding $7$ to both sides of the equation:

$$ 5x - 7 + 7 = 18 + 7 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ 5x = 25 $$

Next, we need to solve for $x$ by removing the coefficient $5$. We accomplish this by dividing both sides of the equation by $5$:

$$ \frac{5x}{5} = \frac{25}{5} $$

Simplifying this yields:

$$ x = 5 $$

Thus, the solution to the equation $5x - 7 = 18$ is:

$$ x = 5 $$
