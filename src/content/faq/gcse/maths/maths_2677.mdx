To determine the area of a compound shape consisting of two triangles and a rectangle, you need to calculate and sum the areas of each individual shape.

First, identify the dimensions of each shape within the compound figure. For the rectangle, measure its length and width. The area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
$$

Next, for each triangle, you will need to know its base and height. The area of a triangle is calculated with the following formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

Make sure to obtain accurate measurements for the base and height of each triangle.

After calculating the areas of the rectangle and both triangles, you can find the total area of the compound shape by summing these areas. For instance, if the area of the rectangle is $20$ square units, the area of the first triangle is $10$ square units, and the area of the second triangle is $15$ square units, the total area can be computed as follows:

$$
\text{Total Area} = 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 \text{ square units}
$$

Always double-check your measurements and calculations to ensure accuracy. This method is applicable to any compound shape that includes triangles and rectangles, making it a valuable skill in geometry.
