The formula for calculating the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is given by 

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$

In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, positioned opposite the right angle. This formula, $ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $, is derived from Pythagoras' Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse $ c $ is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, $ a $ and $ b $. This relationship can be expressed as 

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
$$ 

To isolate the hypotenuse, we take the square root of both sides, leading to the formula 

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$

For instance, consider a right-angled triangle where one side $ a $ measures $3$ units and the other side $ b $ measures $4$ units. The steps to calculate the hypotenuse $ c $ are as follows:

1. Square each side: 
   - $ 3^2 = 9 $ 
   - $ 4^2 = 16 $.
   
2. Sum the squares: 
   - $ 9 + 16 = 25 $.
   
3. Take the square root of the total: 
   - $ \sqrt{25} = 5 $.

Thus, the hypotenuse $ c $ is $5$ units long. This formula is crucial for solving various problems in geometry and trigonometry, as it clarifies the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle. It is important to note that this theorem is applicable only to right-angled triangles, where one angle measures exactly $90$ degrees.
