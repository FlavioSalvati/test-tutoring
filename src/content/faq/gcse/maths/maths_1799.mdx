To multiply two decimal numbers, follow these straightforward steps: first, disregard the decimal points and treat the numbers as whole numbers; then, perform the multiplication as usual; finally, place the decimal point in the result based on the total number of decimal places in the original numbers.

Letâ€™s illustrate this process with an example: multiplying $1.2$ by $3.4$. 

1. **Ignore the Decimal Points**: Begin by treating the decimals as whole numbers. This means you will multiply $12$ (from $1.2$) by $34$ (from $3.4$).

2. **Perform the Multiplication**:
   $$
   12 \times 34 = 408.
   $$

3. **Count the Decimal Places**: Next, determine the total number of decimal places in the numbers you started with. In this case, $1.2$ has $1$ decimal place, and $3.4$ also has $1$ decimal place. Adding these gives:
   $$
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ decimal places.}
   $$

4. **Place the Decimal Point**: Now, you need to insert the decimal point in your product. Since you have a total of $2$ decimal places, start from the right of $408$ and move left $2$ places. This results in:
   $$
   4.08.
   $$

Therefore, the final result is:
$$
1.2 \times 3.4 = 4.08.
$$

In summary, the essential steps are: 
1. Ignore the decimals and multiply the numbers as if they are whole numbers.
2. Count the total number of decimal places from the original numbers.
3. Adjust the decimal point in your final answer accordingly.

This method not only ensures accuracy but also helps you grasp the underlying principles of decimal multiplication.
