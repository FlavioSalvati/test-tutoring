To simplify $ \sqrt{50} $, we can express it as $ 5\sqrt{2} $ by factoring out the square root of the largest perfect square.

Letâ€™s break this process down step by step. First, we identify the factors of $ 50 $. The number $ 50 $ can be factored into $ 25 $ and $ 2 $, where $ 25 $ is a perfect square since $ 25 = 5^2 $. This allows us to rewrite $ \sqrt{50} $ as $ \sqrt{25 \times 2} $.

Next, we apply the property of square roots, which states that $ \sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} $. Using this property, we can separate the expression into $ \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2} $. Since the square root of $ 25 $ is $ 5 $, we find that this simplifies to $ 5\sqrt{2} $. Thus, we conclude that 

$$
\sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}.
$$

This method is effective because it utilizes the property of square roots and the fact that $ 25 $ is a perfect square, making the simplification process straightforward. This approach is particularly useful for simplifying square roots of numbers that are not perfect squares by breaking them down into factors that include perfect squares.
