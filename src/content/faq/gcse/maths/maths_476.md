The formula for determining the hypotenuse of a 3D right-angled triangle is derived from the square root of the sum of the squares of its three sides.

In three dimensions, a right-angled triangle, often referred to as a right-angled tetrahedron, consists of three edges that intersect at a right angle. These edges can be visualized as the dimensions of a rectangular box or cuboid. To calculate the hypotenuse, which represents the longest diagonal that spans through the box, we utilize a formula that generalizes Pythagoras' Theorem to three dimensions.

The formula is given by:

$$
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$

In this expression, $d$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse, while $x$, $y$, and $z$ represent the lengths of the three sides that meet at the right angle.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, consider a cuboid with side lengths of $x$, $y$, and $z$. First, we can find the diagonal of the base of the cuboid using Pythagoras' Theorem in two dimensions, which is expressed as:

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

This calculation yields the length of the diagonal across the base. Next, we treat this diagonal as one side of a right-angled triangle, with the height $z$ serving as the third side. By applying Pythagoras' Theorem once again, we arrive at the equation:

$$
d = \sqrt{(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 + z^2}
$$

This expression simplifies to:

$$
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$

This three-dimensional formula is particularly valuable in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics, where calculating distances in three-dimensional space is often required.
