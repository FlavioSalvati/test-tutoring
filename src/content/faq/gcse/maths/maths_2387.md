The equation $ y = 5x - 3 $ describes a straight line characterized by a gradient of $5$ and a y-intercept of $-3$.

To break this down further, the equation is in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the gradient (or slope) and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. A gradient of $5$ indicates that for every unit increase in $ x $, $ y $ increases by $5$ units. This steepness of the line is essential for understanding its behavior. Specifically, a positive gradient signifies that the line ascends from left to right.

The y-intercept of $-3$ indicates the point at which the line intersects the y-axis. This intersection occurs when $ x = 0 $. By substituting $ x = 0 $ into the equation, we find:

$$
y = 5(0) - 3 = -3
$$

Thus, the coordinates of this point are $ (0, -3) $ on the graph.

To graph this equation, you can begin by plotting the y-intercept at $ (0, -3) $. Next, utilize the gradient to identify another point. Starting from $ (0, -3) $, move one unit to the right (increasing $ x $ by $1$) and five units up (increasing $ y $ by $5$), which leads you to the point $ (1, 2) $. Mark this point on your graph as well. Finally, draw a straight line through these two points to complete the graph of $ y = 5x - 3 $.

Understanding this equation enables you to quickly sketch its graph and analyze how variations in $ x $ influence $ y $. This is a fundamental concept in GCSE Maths, invaluable for addressing various problems related to linear relationships.
