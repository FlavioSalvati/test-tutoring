To find the composite function $(f \circ g)(x)$, we substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$. This results in the expression $f(g(x)) = \sqrt{x + 4}$.

Let’s delve into the details. A composite function is formed when one function is applied to the result of another function. In this case, we have two functions defined as follows: 

$$ f(x) = \sqrt{x} $$ 

and 

$$ g(x) = x + 4. $$ 

To create the composite function $(f \circ g)(x)$, we will substitute the output of $g(x)$ into $f(x)$.

First, we will evaluate $g(x)$. For any input $x$, the function $g(x)$ adds $4$ to $x$. Thus, we can express this as:

$$ g(x) = x + 4. $$

Next, we take the result from $g(x)$ and use it as the input for $f(x)$. The function $f(x)$ calculates the square root of its input. Therefore, we substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$ by replacing the variable $x$ in the equation $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ with $g(x)$, which results in $x + 4$.

This gives us:

$$ f(g(x)) = f(x + 4) = \sqrt{x + 4}. $$

Thus, the composite function $(f \circ g)(x)$ can be expressed as:

$$ (f \circ g)(x) = \sqrt{x + 4}. $$ 

In practical terms, this means that for any value of $x$, you first add $4$ to $x$, and then take the square root of the resulting value.
