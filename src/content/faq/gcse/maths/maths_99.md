To determine the interest rate, you can divide the interest earned by the principal amount and then multiply the result by $100$.

Calculating the interest rate is a fundamental concept in both finance and mathematics. To accurately find the interest rate, you need three essential pieces of information: the principal amount (which is the initial sum of money), the interest earned, and the time period during which the interest was accrued. The formula for calculating the interest rate is given by:

$$ \text{Interest Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Interest Earned}}{\text{Principal}} \right) \times 100 $$

Let’s illustrate this with an example. Assume you have £200 in a savings account, and after one year, you have earned £10 in interest. To calculate the interest rate, follow these steps:

1. Identify the principal (denoted as $P$): £200
2. Identify the interest earned (denoted as $I$): £10
3. Substitute these values into the formula:

$$ \text{Interest Rate} = \left( \frac{10}{200} \right) \times 100 $$

4. Calculate the fraction:

$$ \frac{10}{200} = 0.05 $$

5. Multiply by $100$ to convert your result into a percentage:

$$ 0.05 \times 100 = 5\% $$

Thus, the interest rate is $5\%$.

This method is specifically applicable to simple interest, where the interest is calculated solely on the principal amount. In contrast, for compound interest—where interest is calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest—the calculations become more complex and require different formulas. Nevertheless, mastering the basic method for calculating simple interest rates serves as an excellent foundation for GCSE Maths students.
