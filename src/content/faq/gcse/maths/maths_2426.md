The slope of a line that is parallel to the equation $ y = 6x - 2 $ is $ 6 $.

To find the slope of a line that is parallel to a given line, we focus on the coefficient of $ x $ in the line's equation. In this case, the equation $ y = 6x - 2 $ is expressed in slope-intercept form, $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the slope and $ c $ represents the y-intercept.

In the equation $ y = 6x - 2 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 6 $, indicating that the slope of this line is $ 6 $. Since parallel lines share the same slope, any line that is parallel to $ y = 6x - 2 $ will also have a slope of $ 6 $.

Grasping the concept of parallel lines is essential in both geometry and algebra. Parallel lines never intersect and consistently maintain an equal distance from one another, which is the reason their slopes are identical. Therefore, if you encounter any line and wish to find another line parallel to it, simply ensure that the slope remains unchanged.

For instance, consider another line represented by the equation $ y = 6x + 4 $. You can easily conclude that this line is parallel to $ y = 6x - 2 $ because it too has a slope of $ 6 $. While the y-intercept (the constant term) may vary, the critical aspect for parallelism is that the slopes must remain the same.
