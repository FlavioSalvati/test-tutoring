To effectively sketch the graph of the function $ y = x^3 - x $, it is essential to identify key points, observe symmetry, and analyze the behavior of the graph as $ x $ approaches large values.

**1. Finding the Roots:**
To locate the roots, we set $ y = 0 $. Solving the equation $ x^3 - x = 0 $ yields:

$$ 
x(x^2 - 1) = 0 
$$

From this, we find the roots $ x = 0 $, $ x = 1 $, and $ x = -1 $. These points represent where the graph intersects the x-axis.

**2. Determining Turning Points:**
Next, we need to find the turning points by calculating the first derivative of the function:

$$ 
y' = 3x^2 - 1 
$$

Setting the first derivative to zero, we solve:

$$ 
3x^2 - 1 = 0 
$$

This gives us the solutions:

$$ 
x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} 
$$

To classify these turning points, we calculate the second derivative:

$$ 
y'' = 6x 
$$

Evaluating the second derivative at the turning points:

- At $ x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $:

$$ 
y''\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) > 0 
$$

This indicates a local minimum.

- At $ x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $:

$$ 
y''\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) < 0 
$$

This indicates a local maximum.

**3. Evaluating the Function at Turning Points:**
Now, we compute the values of $ y $ at these turning points:

- For the local minimum:

$$ 
y\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}} 
$$

- For the local maximum:

$$ 
y\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = -\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}} 
$$

**4. Analyzing Symmetry:**
The graph exhibits symmetry about the origin, which can be confirmed by the property $ y(-x) = -y(x) $. This indicates that the function is odd.

**5. Examining End Behavior:**
Finally, we analyze the end behavior of the function. As $ x $ approaches infinity ($ x \to \infty $), $ y $ also approaches infinity ($ y \to \infty $). Conversely, as $ x $ approaches negative infinity ($ x \to -\infty $), $ y $ approaches negative infinity ($ y \to -\infty $). This means the graph extends infinitely in both directions.

**6. Sketching the Graph:**
With the roots, turning points, and symmetry established, you can proceed to plot these key points. Ensure the curve passes through the roots at $ (0, 0) $, $ (1, 0) $, and $ (-1, 0) $ and follows the identified behavior, including the local maximum at $ \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, -\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}\right) $ and the local minimum at $ \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}\right) $. The final sketch will be a smooth curve that reflects all the analyzed characteristics.
