The conditional probability $ P(A|B) $ is given as $ 0.5 $.

To calculate $ P(A|B) $, which represents the probability of event $ A $ occurring given that event $ B $ has already occurred, we utilize the formula for conditional probability:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}.
$$

In this scenario, we know that $ P(B) = 0.6 $ and $ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.3 $.

By substituting these values into the formula, we find:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{0.3}{0.6}.
$$

When we perform the division $ 0.3 \div 0.6 $, the result is $ 0.5 $. Thus, the probability of $ A $ occurring given that $ B $ has occurred is $ 0.5 $.

This indicates that if we are aware that event $ B $ has taken place, there is a $ 50\% $ likelihood that event $ A $ will also occur. Understanding conditional probability is crucial as it allows us to analyze situations where events are interdependent; in such cases, the occurrence of one event influences the probability of another event happening.
