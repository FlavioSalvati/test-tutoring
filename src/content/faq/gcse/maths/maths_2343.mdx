The gradient of the line given by the equation $ y = 4x - 5 $ is 4.

In the context of linear equations, the standard form is represented as $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the gradient (or slope) of the line, and $ c $ represents the y-intercept. The coefficient $ m $ indicates the steepness of the line. In the equation $ y = 4x - 5 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is 4, which means that the gradient of the line is indeed 4.

To clarify this concept further, letâ€™s analyze what the gradient signifies. The gradient of a line describes the rate at which the $ y $-value changes for every unit increase in the $ x $-value. Specifically, a gradient of 4 indicates that for every increase of 1 unit in $ x $, the corresponding $ y $-value rises by 4 units. This relationship illustrates the line's steepness: a larger gradient results in a steeper incline.

In practical terms, if you were to graph this line, you would begin at the y-intercept, which is -5 (the constant term in the equation). From that point, for each step you take to the right along the x-axis, you would ascend 4 steps on the y-axis. This consistent ratio of rise to run is what characterizes the gradient of the line. 

Understanding gradients is essential in GCSE Maths, as it aids in effectively graphing linear equations and analyzing their behavior.
