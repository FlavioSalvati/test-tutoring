To sketch the graph of $ y = \sin(x) $, you should begin by plotting key points and then drawing a smooth, continuous wave that represents the sine function.

First, itâ€™s important to note that the sine function is periodic, repeating its pattern every $ 2\pi $ radians (or 360 degrees). The fundamental shape of the sine wave begins at the origin $ (0,0) $, rises to a maximum value of 1 at $ \frac{\pi}{2} $ radians (90 degrees), returns to 0 at $ \pi $ radians (180 degrees), drops to a minimum of -1 at $ \frac{3\pi}{2} $ radians (270 degrees), and finally returns to 0 again at $ 2\pi $ radians (360 degrees).

To create the sketch, start by drawing the x-axis and y-axis. On the x-axis, mark the key points: $ 0 $, $ \frac{\pi}{2} $, $ \pi $, $ \frac{3\pi}{2} $, and $ 2\pi $. On the y-axis, indicate the points 1 and -1, which represent the maximum and minimum values of the sine function, respectively.

Next, plot the critical points: $ (0,0) $, $ \left(\frac{\pi}{2}, 1\right) $, $ (\pi, 0) $, $ \left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, -1\right) $, and $ (2\pi, 0) $. These points illustrate one complete cycle of the sine wave.

Now, connect these points with a smooth, continuous curve. The curve should start at the origin, ascend to the maximum at $ \frac{\pi}{2} $, descend back to zero at $ \pi $, drop to the minimum at $ \frac{3\pi}{2} $, and return to zero at $ 2\pi $.

Keep in mind that the sine wave extends infinitely in both directions. Therefore, you can continue the pattern to the left and right if desired. The resulting wave should be smooth and continuous, with no abrupt corners or breaks.
