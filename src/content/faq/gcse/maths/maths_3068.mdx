To create a scatter diagram with bivariate data, you will represent each pair of related values as a point on a graph.

Begin by collecting your bivariate data, which consists of two sets of related measurements. For instance, you might gather data on the heights and weights of a group of individuals. Each pair of values, such as (height, weight), corresponds to a single point on your scatter diagram.

Next, set up your axes on graph paper or using graphing software. The horizontal axis (the x-axis) will represent one of the variables, while the vertical axis (the y-axis) will represent the other variable. Be sure to label each axis clearly with the name of the variable it represents, and include appropriate units where necessary.

After labeling, determine the scale for each axis. The scale should encompass the entire range of your data and be evenly spaced. For example, if your height data ranges from $150 \, \text{cm}$ to $190 \, \text{cm}$, then your x-axis should reflect this range.

Now, plot each pair of values on the graph. For instance, if one individual has a height of $160 \, \text{cm}$ and a weight of $55 \, \text{kg}$, locate $160$ on the x-axis and $55$ on the y-axis, and place a dot at the intersection of these two values.

Continue this process for all pairs of values. Once you have plotted all the points, you will begin to observe any patterns or relationships between the two variables. For example, you may notice that, as height increases, weight also tends to increase, indicating a positive correlation.

Finally, analyze the scatter diagram to gain insights into the relationship between the variables. Look for trends, clusters, or outliers that may provide valuable information about your data.
