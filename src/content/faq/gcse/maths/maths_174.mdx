To expand the expression $(x + 5)(x - 3)$, we can utilize the distributive property, commonly referred to as the FOIL method, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, and Last. This technique allows us to systematically multiply each term from the first binomial by each term from the second binomial.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **First Terms**: Multiply the first terms of each binomial: 
   $$x \times x = x^2.$$

2. **Outer Terms**: Multiply the outer terms:
   $$x \times -3 = -3x.$$

3. **Inner Terms**: Multiply the inner terms:
   $$5 \times x = 5x.$$

4. **Last Terms**: Finally, multiply the last terms:
   $$5 \times -3 = -15.$$

Now, we will combine all these products:
$$x^2 - 3x + 5x - 15.$$

Next, we simplify by combining the like terms, specifically $-3x$ and $5x$:
$$-3x + 5x = 2x.$$

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
$$x^2 + 2x - 15.$$

In conclusion, the expanded form of the expression $(x + 5)(x - 3)$ is:
$$x^2 + 2x - 15.$$

This method ensures that every possible product between the terms in the binomials is accounted for, resulting in the correct expanded expression.
