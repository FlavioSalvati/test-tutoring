To calculate cumulative frequency, you need to add the frequency of each class interval to the sum of all previous frequencies.

Cumulative frequency provides a running total of frequencies across the class intervals in a data set. To begin, you will need a frequency table that lists each class interval alongside its corresponding frequency. The cumulative frequency for the first class interval is simply the frequency of that interval itself.

For each subsequent class interval, you will add its frequency to the cumulative frequency of the previous interval. This process continues for each class interval, effectively accumulating the frequencies as you progress through the intervals.

For instance, consider the following frequency table with class intervals and their associated frequencies:

- $0-10$: $3$
- $10-20$: $5$
- $20-30$: $7$
- $30-40$: $4$

The cumulative frequency for the first interval ($0-10$) is $3$. For the second interval ($10-20$), you add $5$ to the previous cumulative frequency of $3$, resulting in $8$. For the third interval ($20-30$), you add $7$ to the previous cumulative frequency of $8$, yielding $15$. Finally, for the fourth interval ($30-40$), you add $4$ to the previous cumulative frequency of $15$, which gives you $19$.

Thus, the cumulative frequencies for the intervals are as follows:

- $0-10$: $3$
- $10-20$: $8$
- $20-30$: $15$
- $30-40$: $19$

This method allows you to observe how frequencies accumulate over the range of data, facilitating the analysis of trends and patterns within the dataset.
