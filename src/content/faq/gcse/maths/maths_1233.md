To determine the surface area of a cylinder, we can employ the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi r(h + r)
$$

The surface area of a cylinder is comprised of two components: the curved surface area and the areas of the two circular bases. In this formula, $r$ represents the radius of the cylinder, and $h$ denotes its height.

Let's begin by identifying the given values: the radius $r$ is $2 \, \text{cm}$ and the height $h$ is $8 \, \text{cm}$. We will substitute these values into the formula as follows:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi r(h + r)
$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi \times 2 \times (8 + 2)
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi \times 2 \times 10
$$

Which further simplifies to:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 40\pi
$$

To obtain a numerical approximation, we can use $ \pi \approx 3.14 $:

$$
\text{Surface Area} \approx 40 \times 3.14
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
\text{Surface Area} \approx 125.6 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Therefore, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately $125.6$ square centimeters. This calculation successfully accounts for both the curved surface and the two circular bases, resulting in the total surface area.
