To solve for $ x $ in the equation 

$$ \frac{5}{x} = \frac{10}{20}, $$ 

we will employ cross-multiplication and then isolate $ x $.

First, let's rewrite the equation for better clarity:

$$ \frac{5}{x} = \frac{10}{20}. $$

Next, we simplify the fraction on the right-hand side:

$$ \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}. $$

Now, the equation becomes:

$$ \frac{5}{x} = \frac{1}{2}. $$

To find $ x $, we can use cross-multiplication. This technique involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other. Thus, we have:

$$ 5 \times 2 = 1 \times x. $$

This simplifies to:

$$ 10 = x. $$

Consequently, we find that $ x = 10 $.

To confirm our solution, we can substitute $ x $ back into the original equation:

$$ \frac{5}{10} = \frac{10}{20}. $$

Now, we simplify both sides:

$$ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}. $$

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we verify that our solution $ x = 10 $ is indeed correct.
