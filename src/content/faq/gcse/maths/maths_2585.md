The sum of the interior angles in a regular polygon with $ n $ sides is given by the formula:

$$
(n-2) \times 180 \text{ degrees}.
$$

To understand the reasoning behind this formula, letâ€™s break it down. A polygon is a two-dimensional shape characterized by straight sides. A regular polygon is one where all sides and angles are congruent. The sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated by dividing the polygon into triangles.

For a polygon with $ n $ sides, it is possible to draw $ n - 2 $ triangles within it. For instance, a quadrilateral (which has 4 sides) can be divided into 2 triangles, while a pentagon (5 sides) can be divided into 3 triangles, and so forth. Each triangle has an angle sum of $ 180 $ degrees. Thus, if you have $ n - 2 $ triangles, the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon is:

$$
(n-2) \times 180 \text{ degrees}.
$$

This formula is particularly useful because it applies to any polygon, regardless of the number of sides it possesses. For example, consider a hexagon (which has 6 sides). Using the formula, we can calculate the sum of its interior angles as follows:

$$
(6-2) \times 180 = 4 \times 180 = 720 \text{ degrees}.
$$

This indicates that the sum of all the interior angles in a hexagon is $ 720 $ degrees.

It is important to note that this formula provides the total sum of the interior angles. If you wish to determine the measure of each individual angle in a regular polygon, you would divide this sum by the number of sides $ n $. For example, in a regular hexagon, each angle would be calculated as:

$$
\frac{720}{6} = 120 \text{ degrees}.
$$

In summary, the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is a valuable tool for geometry, allowing for quick calculations based on the number of sides.
