A number is classified as odd if it is not divisible by $2$ and leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $2$.

To elaborate, numbers can be categorized into two distinct types: even and odd. An even number is defined as one that can be divided by $2$ without yielding any remainder. For example, when we divide $4$ by $2$, the result is $2$, with no remainder left over. In contrast, an odd number, when divided by $2$, will always produce a remainder of $1$. For instance, dividing $5$ by $2$ results in $2$ with a remainder of $1$, which confirms that $5$ is an odd number.

A practical method for determining whether a number is odd is to examine its last digit. If the last digit is $1$, $3$, $5$, $7$, or $9$, then the number is classified as odd. For example, the number $37$ ends with a $7$, confirming that it is indeed odd. This rule is effective because the divisibility of a number by $2$ is determined solely by its last digit.

Odd numbers exhibit several intriguing properties. For instance, the sum of two odd numbers is always even. When you add an odd number to an even number, the result will always be odd. Furthermore, the product of two odd numbers will also yield an odd number. These properties can be particularly useful when solving various mathematical problems and can help in quickly identifying the nature of a number in different contexts.

Understanding the concepts of odd and even numbers is fundamental in mathematics and plays a crucial role in various fields, including algebra, number theory, and problem-solving.
