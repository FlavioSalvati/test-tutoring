To add the expressions $\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{12}$, we first simplify $\sqrt{12}$ to $2\sqrt{3}$, and then we can combine the two terms to obtain $3\sqrt{3}$.

When working with square roots, it is often beneficial to simplify them before performing any addition. The term $\sqrt{3}$ is already in its simplest form. However, we can simplify $\sqrt{12}$. To do this, we need to factor $12$ into its prime components. The number $12$ can be expressed as $4 \times 3$, and further, $4$ can be factored into $2 \times 2$. Therefore, we can write:

$$
12 = 2 \times 2 \times 3.
$$

Using the property that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can express $\sqrt{12}$ as:

$$
\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \times 3} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{3}.
$$

Since $\sqrt{4} = 2$, we find that:

$$
\sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}.
$$

Now that we have simplified $\sqrt{12}$, we can proceed to add the two terms. We have $\sqrt{3}$ and $2\sqrt{3}$. Adding these together is analogous to combining like terms in algebra. We can think of $\sqrt{3}$ as a variable, similar to $x$. Therefore, the expression $\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{3}$ can be treated like $x + 2x$, which simplifies to $3x$. Thus, we conclude that:

$$
\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}.
$$

In summary, the sum of $\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{12}$ is:

$$
3\sqrt{3}.
$$
