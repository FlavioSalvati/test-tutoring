The equation of the line that passes through the point $(1, 2)$ with a slope of $4$ can be expressed as 

$$ y = 4x - 2. $$

To derive the equation of a line, we utilize the slope-intercept form, which is given by 

$$ y = mx + c, $$ 

where $ m $ represents the slope and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. In this scenario, the slope $ m $ is specified as $4$, and we know that the line passes through the point $(1, 2)$.

First, we substitute the slope $ m = 4 $ into the equation:

$$ y = 4x + c. $$

Next, we need to determine the value of $ c $. To find $ c $, we will substitute the coordinates of the given point $(1, 2)$ into the equation. This involves replacing $ x $ with $1$ and $ y $ with $2$:

$$ 2 = 4(1) + c. $$

Now, letâ€™s simplify this equation:

$$ 2 = 4 + c. $$

To isolate $ c $, we subtract $4$ from both sides:

$$ 2 - 4 = c, $$
$$ c = -2. $$

With the value of $ c $ determined, we can now write the complete equation of the line:

$$ y = 4x - 2. $$

This equation indicates that for any given value of $ x $, the corresponding $ y $ value can be calculated by multiplying $ x $ by $4$ and then subtracting $2$. The line has a steep slope, which means it rises rapidly as you move from left to right. The y-intercept is $-2$, which marks the point where the line intersects the y-axis.
