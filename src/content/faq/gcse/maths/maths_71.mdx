When you round the number $99.999$ to one decimal place, the result is $100.0$.

The process of rounding to one decimal place involves examining the digit in the second decimal place to determine whether to round up or down. In this particular case, the number in question is $99.999$, where the digit in the second decimal place is $9$. According to the rules of rounding, if this digit is $5$ or more, the digit in the first decimal place is rounded up.

In this instance, the first decimal place holds a $9$, and given that the second decimal place also contains a $9$ (which exceeds $5$), the first decimal place is rounded up. However, incrementing $9$ by $1$ results in $10$, necessitating a carry over to the next integer. As a result, $99.999$ rounded to one decimal place becomes $100.0$.

This rounding process ensures the number is represented as accurately as possible, within the constraints of the defined number of decimal places. Do remember that rounding is a technique used to simplify numbers, making them more manageable to work with while preserving a reasonable level of accuracy.
