To plot the point $(0, 6)$ on a Cartesian plane, begin by locating the y-axis at $6$ and marking the point there.

A Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular lines: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis. The coordinates of the point $(0, 6)$ are expressed in the format $(x, y)$, where $x$ represents the horizontal coordinate and $y$ denotes the vertical coordinate.

Since the x-coordinate is $0$, this point lies directly on the y-axis. To plot it accurately, start at the origin, which is the point $(0, 0)$ where the x-axis and y-axis intersect. From the origin, move vertically upwards along the y-axis until you reach the value of $6$.

After reaching $y = 6$, there is no need to move left or right, as the x-coordinate is $0$. Simply place a dot or mark at this position on the y-axis. This marks the point $(0, 6)$.

Keep in mind that the y-axis is the vertical line on the graph, with positive values located above the origin. Therefore, moving up to $6$ means counting six units upward from the origin. This method ensures that you accurately plot the point on the Cartesian plane.
