The expression $2.3 \times 10^4$ can be converted to its standard numerical form as $23,000$.

To understand how we arrive at this result, let’s break it down step by step. The notation $2.3 \times 10^4$ is known as scientific notation, which is a convenient way to express very large or very small numbers. The term $10^4$ represents $10$ raised to the power of $4$, which can be calculated by multiplying $10$ by itself four times:

$$
10^4 = 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10,000.
$$

Next, we multiply $2.3$ by $10,000$. When multiplying a number by $10,000$, we effectively shift the decimal point four places to the right. Starting with $2.3$, we can visualize this process as follows:

1. Begin with $2.3$.
2. Move the decimal point one place to the right: $23$.
3. Move it another place: $230$.
4. Move it again: $2,300$.
5. Finally, move it one more place to the right: $23,000$.

Thus, we conclude that:

$$
2.3 \times 10^4 = 23,000.
$$

This method of using scientific notation is especially advantageous in fields such as science and engineering, where it becomes essential to manage very large or very small numbers with greater ease and precision.
