To determine a missing value in a proportion, you can utilize the technique of cross-multiplication and then solve the resulting equation.

A proportion is defined as an equation indicating that two ratios are equivalent. For instance, if you have the proportion 

$$ 
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} 
$$ 

and you need to find a missing variable, you can apply cross-multiplication. This involves multiplying the numerator of one ratio by the denominator of the other ratio. Specifically, you would compute $a \times d$ and $b \times c$, leading to the equation 

$$ 
a \times d = b \times c. 
$$ 

For example, consider the proportion 

$$ 
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{x}{8}. 
$$ 

To find the value of $x$, you apply cross-multiplication, resulting in 

$$ 
3 \times 8 = 4 \times x. 
$$ 

This simplifies to 

$$ 
24 = 4x. 
$$ 

To isolate $x$, divide both sides of the equation by $4$, yielding 

$$ 
x = 6. 
$$ 

Let's examine another scenario: if you have 

$$ 
\frac{5}{x} = \frac{10}{15}, 
$$ 

cross-multiplication will give you 

$$ 
5 \times 15 = 10 \times x. 
$$ 

This simplifies to 

$$ 
75 = 10x. 
$$ 

Dividing both sides by $10$, you find 

$$ 
x = 7.5. 
$$ 

Cross-multiplication is a dependable method for solving proportions, as it maintains the equivalence of the ratios. It is essential to verify your solution by substituting the computed value back into the original proportion to confirm that both sides are equal. This technique is particularly valuable in GCSE Maths, where a solid understanding of proportions is crucial for tackling various mathematical problems.
