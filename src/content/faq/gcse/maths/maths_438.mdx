The formula for calculating the angle of elevation is given by:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\right)
$$

The angle of elevation is defined as the angle formed between a horizontal line and the line of sight when observing an object above the horizontal plane. To determine this angle, you need two key measurements: the height of the object (the opposite side of the triangle) and the horizontal distance from the observer to the base of the object (the adjacent side). The formula employs the inverse tangent function, commonly denoted as $\tan^{-1}$ or $\arctan$, to compute the angle $\theta$.

For instance, consider a scenario where you are standing $10$ metres away from a tree that has a height of $5$ metres. In this case, the height of the tree serves as the opposite side, and the distance from the tree represents the adjacent side. By substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{5}{10}\right)
$$

Simplifying the fraction inside the parentheses yields:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1} (0.5)
$$

Using a scientific calculator, you can determine that the angle $\theta$ is approximately $26.57$ degrees.

This concept is particularly significant in trigonometry and plays a crucial role in solving problems related to right-angled triangles. Mastering the angle of elevation formula has practical applications in everyday situations, such as calculating the height of a building or a mountain when you can measure the distance to its base.
