To calculate the magnitude of the vector $(8, 15)$, we can utilize the formula:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

The magnitude of a vector represents its length. For a vector expressed in terms of its components $(x, y)$, the magnitude can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem. This is due to the fact that the vector forms a right triangle with the x-axis and the y-axis.

In our example, the vector is $(8, 15)$. To find its magnitude, we first square each component:

- For the x-component: $8^2 = 64$
- For the y-component: $15^2 = 225$

Next, we sum these squared values:

$$
64 + 225 = 289
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the total:

$$
\sqrt{289} = 17
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(8, 15)$ is $17$.

This method is applicable to any vector in two dimensions. Simply remember to square each component, add the results, and then take the square root of the sum. This process will yield the length of the vector, which is its magnitude.
