To enter a negative number on a calculator, you typically need to use the "(-)" or "NEG" button.

When you wish to input a negative number, simply locate the button labeled "(-)" or "NEG." This button is specifically meant to change the sign of a number from positive to negative. For instance, if you want to enter $-5$, you would first press the "5" key, followed by the "(-)" or "NEG" key. This action will convert the display from $5$ to $-5$.

It's essential to be aware that the placement and labeling of this key may differ based on the make and model of your calculator. On some scientific calculators, the "(-)" button might be positioned either at the bottom or to the side of the number keys. In contrast, graphing calculators may have it located in a different section, often near the top or as a secondary function of another key.

Mastering the input of negative numbers is vital for tackling a wide range of mathematical problems, including those in algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. If you find yourself uncertain about how to proceed, consult your calculator's manual or look for online tutorials specific to your calculator model. This knowledge will enhance your efficiency and accuracy in calculations, which is crucial for achieving success in GCSE Maths.
