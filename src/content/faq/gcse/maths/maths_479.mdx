The formula for calculating the slant height of a pyramid is given by:

$$
l = \sqrt{h^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2}
$$

In this equation, $l$ signifies the slant height, $h$ denotes the vertical height (or altitude) of the pyramid, and $a$ represents the length of one side of the pyramid's base. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which is instrumental in determining the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.

To visualize this concept, consider a right-angled triangle formed by the vertical height of the pyramid, half the base length, and the slant height. In this triangle, the vertical height $h$ serves as one leg, while half the base length, given by $\frac{a}{2}$, constitutes the other leg. The slant height $l$ acts as the hypotenuse. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship among the sides of the triangle is expressed as follows:

$$
l^2 = h^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2
$$

By taking the square root of both sides, we arrive at the formula for the slant height:

$$
l = \sqrt{h^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2}
$$

This formula is particularly valuable when calculating the surface area or lateral surface area of a pyramid. It is important to note that the slant height is distinct from the vertical height; the slant height measures the distance along the face of the pyramid from the base to the apex, while the vertical height measures the perpendicular distance from the base to the apex.
