To determine the length of the vector $(1, 1)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which gives us the expression:

$$
\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}.
$$

To elaborate, the length of a vector, often referred to as its magnitude, can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For a vector with components $(x, y)$, the formula for its length is given by:

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
$$

This relationship arises because the vector forms a right-angled triangle with the x-axis and y-axis, where the length of the vector represents the hypotenuse of this triangle.

In the case of the vector $(1, 1)$, we substitute $x = 1$ and $y = 1$ into the formula. This results in:

$$
\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}.
$$

Calculating the squares of the components, we find $1^2 = 1$ and $1^2 = 1$. Adding these values together yields:

$$
1 + 1 = 2.
$$

Consequently, the length of the vector is:

$$
\sqrt{2}.
$$

This method is applicable to any vector in two-dimensional space. By squaring each component, summing the results, and then taking the square root, you can ascertain the length of any vector. This principle is a fundamental aspect of vector mathematics and has significant applications in fields such as physics and engineering.
