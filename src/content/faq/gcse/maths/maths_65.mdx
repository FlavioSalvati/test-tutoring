The number $9,800,000$ can be expressed in standard form (also recognized as scientific notation) as $9.8 \times 10^6$.

Standard form or scientific notation is a method widely employed in fields such as science and engineering for expressing extremely large or small numbers in a more compact, manageable format. This format involves representing the number as a product of a number between $1$ and $10$, and a power of $10$.

For instance, consider the number $9,800,000$. The first step in converting this to standard form is to identify the significant figures, which in this case are $9.8$. Subsequently, count the number of places the decimal point has to move to the left to convert $9,800,000$ into $9.8$. In this instance, the decimal point needs to shift $6$ places to the left. This shift is denoted as a power of $10$, which leads us to express $9,800,000$ as $9.8 \times 10^6$.

In this standard form, the number preceding the multiplication sign ($9.8$ in this case) is referred to as the coefficient and it must lie between $1$ and $10$. The exponent ($6$ here) signifies the number of places the decimal point has moved. For large numbers, the exponent will be positive, whereas for numbers less than $1$, the exponent will be negative. This method greatly simplifies computations and enhances the readability and notation of exceptionally large or small numbers.
