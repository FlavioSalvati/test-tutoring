To analyze concavity, we examine the sign of the second derivative of a function.

To begin with, it's essential to understand what the second derivative represents. For a function $ f(x) $, the first derivative $ f'(x) $ indicates the slope of the function at any given point. The second derivative, denoted as $ f''(x) $, reveals how the slope is changing. In simpler terms, it provides insight into the "curvature" of the graph.

If $ f''(x) > 0 $ within a specific interval, the graph of the function is said to be concave up in that interval. This indicates that the graph takes on a "U" shape, suggesting that the slope of the function is increasing. Conversely, if $ f''(x) < 0 $ in an interval, the graph is concave down, resembling an upside-down "U" shape, which implies that the slope of the function is decreasing.

To determine the concavity of a function, follow these steps:
1. **Calculate the second derivative**: Start by differentiating the function twice to obtain $ f''(x) $.
2. **Analyze the sign of $ f''(x) $**: Investigate the intervals where $ f''(x) $ is positive or negative.
3. **Identify intervals of concavity**: Based on the sign of $ f''(x) $, determine the intervals where the function is concave up or concave down.

For instance, consider the function $ f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x $. First, we find the first derivative:

$$
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2.
$$

Next, we compute the second derivative:

$$
f''(x) = 6x - 6.
$$

Setting the second derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

$$
6x - 6 = 0 \implies x = 1.
$$

Now, we analyze the sign of $ f''(x) $ in the intervals determined by this critical point. For $ x < 1 $, we find that $ f''(x) < 0 $, indicating concave down. For $ x > 1 $, we have $ f''(x) > 0 $, indicating concave up. This analysis reveals how the graph curves around $ x = 1 $.
