To create a graph from your temperature data, you will need to plot the data points and connect them effectively.

Begin by collecting your temperature data and selecting the type of graph you wish to create. A line graph is often the most appropriate choice for temperature data, as it effectively illustrates changes over time. Start by labeling your axes: the horizontal axis (x-axis) typically represents time (such as days or hours), while the vertical axis (y-axis) represents temperature.

Next, establish the scale for each axis. For the x-axis, mark equal intervals corresponding to your time data. For the y-axis, select a scale that encompasses the full range of temperatures in your dataset, ensuring that the intervals remain evenly spaced.

Now, proceed to plot each data point on the graph. For every time value on the x-axis, locate the corresponding temperature value on the y-axis and place a dot at the intersection of these two values. Repeat this process for all data points.

Once all points have been plotted, connect them with straight lines. This will allow you to visualize trends and patterns in the temperature data over time. If the data points suggest a smooth progression, you may opt to draw a smooth curve instead of straight segments.

Finally, be sure to add a title to your graph and appropriately label the axes with their units (for example, "Time (days)" on the x-axis and "Temperature (Â°C)" on the y-axis). This will enhance the clarity and accessibility of your graph for anyone who views it.
