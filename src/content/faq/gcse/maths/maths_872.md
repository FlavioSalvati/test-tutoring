The equation representing twice an unknown number, decreased by 3, can be expressed as:

$$
2x - 3
$$

In this equation, the variable $x$ denotes the unknown number. The expression "twice a number" implies that we multiply the number by $2$, which is represented mathematically as $2x$. The phrase "minus 3" indicates that we subtract $3$ from the result of $2x$. Thus, the complete equation is $2x - 3$.

To illustrate this further, let's assume the unknown number $x$ is equal to $5$. In that case, twice this number would be calculated as:

$$
2 \times 5 = 10
$$

Subtracting $3$ from $10$ yields:

$$
10 - 3 = 7
$$

Therefore, if $x$ equals $5$, the expression $2x - 3$ results in $7$. This equation can be utilized to determine the value of the expression for any number that you substitute for $x$.

Mastering the formation and manipulation of such equations is a vital skill in GCSE Maths. It enables you to solve problems where you need to find an unknown value based on specific conditions. Practicing these types of equations will enhance your algebraic capabilities and prepare you for more advanced mathematical challenges.
