To add two mixed numbers, the process involves converting them into improper fractions, performing the addition, and then simplifying the result back into a mixed number.

Letâ€™s go through the steps in detail. A mixed number is composed of a whole number and a fractional part, such as $2 \frac{3}{4}$. To add two mixed numbers, we begin by converting each one into an improper fraction. 

For instance, consider the mixed number $2 \frac{3}{4}$. To convert this into an improper fraction, we calculate:

$$
2 \times 4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11,
$$

thus, $2 \frac{3}{4}$ converts to $\frac{11}{4}$.

Next, we apply the same conversion to the second mixed number. Suppose we have $1 \frac{2}{3}$. We convert it into an improper fraction using the following calculation:

$$
1 \times 3 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5,
$$

which means $1 \frac{2}{3}$ becomes $\frac{5}{3}$.

Now, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are $4$ and $3$, and the least common denominator (LCD) is $12$. We convert each fraction accordingly:

$$
\frac{11}{4} = \frac{33}{12}
$$

and 

$$
\frac{5}{3} = \frac{20}{12}.
$$

Now, we can add the two fractions:

$$
\frac{33}{12} + \frac{20}{12} = \frac{53}{12}.
$$

Finally, we need to convert the improper fraction $\frac{53}{12}$ back into a mixed number. We do this by dividing $53$ by $12$, which gives us $4$ with a remainder of $5$. Therefore, we can express $\frac{53}{12}$ as the mixed number:

$$
4 \frac{5}{12}.
$$

In conclusion, the sum of the mixed numbers is:

$$
2 \frac{3}{4} + 1 \frac{2}{3} = 4 \frac{5}{12}.
$$
