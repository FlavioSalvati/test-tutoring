There are several distinct types of numbers in mathematics: natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers.

**Natural Numbers** are the most basic type of numbers, starting from $1$ and continuing upwards: $$1, 2, 3, \ldots$$. These are the numbers we typically learn to count with.

**Whole Numbers** include all natural numbers along with zero. This set can be represented as: $$0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$.

**Integers** expand upon whole numbers by incorporating negative numbers as well. The set of integers includes: $$\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$. Integers are particularly useful for representing quantities that can fall below zero, such as temperatures or bank balances.

**Rational Numbers** are those that can be expressed as a fraction, where both the numerator and the denominator are integers. Examples include: $$\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{3}{4}, 5$$. This category encompasses both integers and fractions, and rational numbers can be positive or negative.

**Irrational Numbers** cannot be represented as simple fractions. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating. Notable examples include the square root of $2$ ($\sqrt{2}$) and the mathematical constant $\pi$. These numbers play a significant role in various fields of mathematics and science.

**Real Numbers** comprise both rational and irrational numbers. Essentially, any number that can be located on the number line is a real number. This category includes numbers such as $0$, $-1$, $2.5$, and $\sqrt{3}$.

**Complex Numbers** extend the concept of real numbers by incorporating an imaginary unit, denoted as $i$, where $$i^2 = -1$$. A complex number is typically expressed in the form $$a + bi$$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Complex numbers are particularly important in advanced mathematics and engineering.

Understanding these different types of numbers is essential for analyzing and solving a wide array of mathematical problems.
