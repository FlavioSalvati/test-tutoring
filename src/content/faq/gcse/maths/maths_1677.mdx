To determine the interquartile range (IQR) using a cumulative frequency graph, you need to identify the values at the 25th and 75th percentiles.

The IQR is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of your data. It is calculated by subtracting the 25th percentile (denoted as $Q_1$) from the 75th percentile (denoted as $Q_3$):

$$
\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

To find these values on a cumulative frequency graph, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Total Frequency**: First, determine the total number of data points, which corresponds to the highest point on the cumulative frequency axis.

2. **Find $Q_1$**: Calculate 25% of the total frequency. For example, if the total frequency is 100, then 25% is 25. Draw a horizontal line from this value on the cumulative frequency axis to intersect the curve. Then, drop a vertical line from this intersection down to the horizontal axis. The point where this vertical line meets the horizontal axis represents $Q_1$.

3. **Find $Q_3$**: Calculate 75% of the total frequency. For instance, if the total frequency is 100, then 75% is 75. Similarly, draw a horizontal line from this value on the cumulative frequency axis to intersect the curve, and then drop a vertical line down to the horizontal axis. The intersection of this vertical line with the horizontal axis will give you $Q_3$.

4. **Calculate the IQR**: Finally, subtract $Q_1$ from $Q_3$ to find the interquartile range:

$$
\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

By following these steps, you can accurately determine the interquartile range from a cumulative frequency graph, which will enhance your understanding of the spread and distribution of your data.
