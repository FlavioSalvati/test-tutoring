The representation of a vector $\mathbf{s}$ in the form $ai + bj$ is expressed as $\mathbf{s} = ai + bj$, where $a$ and $b$ denote its components.

To elaborate, vectors are mathematical entities characterized by both magnitude and direction. When we represent a vector as $ai + bj$, we are breaking it down into its horizontal and vertical components. Here, $a$ serves as the coefficient of the unit vector $i$, which indicates direction along the horizontal axis (the $x$-axis), while $b$ is the coefficient of the unit vector $j$, which points in the vertical direction (along the $y$-axis).

For instance, if vector $\mathbf{s}$ has components $3$ and $4$, it can be represented as:

$$
\mathbf{s} = 3i + 4j.
$$

This notation signifies that the vector extends $3$ units in the horizontal direction and $4$ units in the vertical direction. The unit vectors $i$ and $j$ are commonly used notations to denote directions along the $x$- and $y$-axes, respectively.

To determine the components $a$ and $b$ of a vector, you can utilize its coordinates. If a vector originates from the point $(0, 0)$ and terminates at the point $(x, y)$, then the component $a$ is equal to $x$, and the component $b$ is equal to $y$. For example, if a vector ends at the point $(5, -2)$, it can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{s} = 5i - 2j.
$$

Grasping this representation is essential for performing various vector operations, such as addition, subtraction, and calculating the magnitude or direction of the vector.
