To determine the probability of event A given that event B has occurred, we use the formula:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

This formula represents conditional probability, which allows us to calculate the likelihood of event A occurring when we know that event B has already taken place. In this expression, $P(A|B)$ denotes the probability of A given B. The numerator, $P(A \cap B)$, indicates the probability that both events A and B occur simultaneously, while the denominator, $P(B)$, represents the probability of event B occurring.

Letâ€™s illustrate this concept with an example involving a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Suppose we want to find the probability of drawing an Ace (event A), given that the card drawn is a red card (event B). 

First, we need to ascertain the number of red cards in the deck, which totals to $26$, as there are $13$ hearts and $13$ diamonds. Out of these red cards, there are $2$ Aces (the Ace of hearts and the Ace of diamonds). 

Now, we can calculate the probabilities:

- The probability of drawing a red card, $P(B)$, is given by:

$$
P(B) = \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

- The probability of drawing a red Ace, $P(A \cap B)$, is:

$$
P(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{52} = \frac{1}{26}
$$

Using the conditional probability formula, we can now find $P(A|B)$:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{26}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{26} \times \frac{2}{1} = \frac{2}{26} = \frac{1}{13}
$$

This method can be applied to a wide variety of scenarios, whether involving cards, dice, or any other probabilistic events. Just remember to identify both the joint probability of the events occurring together and the probability of the condition given.
