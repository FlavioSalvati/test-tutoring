To determine the volume ratio of similar shapes, you need to cube the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions.

When examining similar shapes, the linear dimensions—such as lengths, widths, and heights—are proportional to each other. If the ratio of these dimensions is expressed as $a:b$, the corresponding volume ratio can be calculated by cubing this linear ratio. This relationship arises because volume is a three-dimensional measurement, and each linear dimension contributes to the overall volume.

For instance, if two similar shapes have a linear ratio of $2:3$, you would cube each number in the ratio to find the volume ratio. Specifically, you calculate $2^3 = 8$ and $3^3 = 27$, resulting in a volume ratio of $8:27$. This indicates that if the smaller shape has a volume of $8$ cubic units, the larger shape will possess a volume of $27$ cubic units.

This method is applicable to any pair of similar shapes, including cubes, spheres, or other geometric solids. The essential concept to remember is that volume scales with the cube of the linear dimensions. This principle proves to be highly useful in various real-world applications, such as scaling models or analyzing the properties of objects of different sizes.
