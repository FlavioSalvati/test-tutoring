To determine the coordinates of the x-intercept for the linear equation $ y = 2x + 8 $, we find the point where the graph intersects the x-axis. At this intersection, the value of $ y $ is zero. Therefore, we start by setting $ y $ to 0 in the equation:

$$
0 = 2x + 8
$$

Next, we solve for $ x $. We begin by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

$$
0 - 8 = 2x + 8 - 8
$$
$$
-8 = 2x
$$

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate $ x $:

$$
\frac{-8}{2} = \frac{2x}{2}
$$
$$
-4 = x
$$

Thus, the x-coordinate of the x-intercept is $ -4 $. Since the y-coordinate at the x-intercept is always 0, the coordinates of the x-intercept are $ (-4, 0) $.

In summary, by setting $ y $ to 0 and solving for $ x $, we determined that the x-intercept of the line $ y = 2x + 8 $ is the point $ (-4, 0) $. This indicates that the graph of the equation crosses the x-axis at $ x = -4 $.
