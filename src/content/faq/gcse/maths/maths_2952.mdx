The probability of selecting two differently colored balls without replacement is influenced by the number of balls of each color present in the bag.

To determine this probability, we need to know both the total number of balls and the count of each color. For example, consider a bag containing red and blue balls, where there are $ r $ red balls and $ b $ blue balls. The overall total of balls in the bag can be expressed as $ r + b $.

First, we will calculate the total number of ways to choose any two balls from the bag. This is given by the combination formula $ \binom{n}{2} $, where $ n $ represents the total number of balls. Therefore, the total number of ways to select two balls is 

$$
\binom{r+b}{2} = \frac{(r+b)(r+b-1)}{2}.
$$

Next, we need to calculate the number of ways to select two balls of the same color. For the red balls, this is given by 

$$
\binom{r}{2} = \frac{r(r-1)}{2},
$$ 

and for the blue balls, it is 

$$
\binom{b}{2} = \frac{b(b-1)}{2}.
$$

To find the number of ways to pick two balls of different colors, we subtract the number of ways to pick two balls of the same color from the total number of ways to pick any two balls. Thus, the number of ways to select two differently colored balls is 

$$
\binom{r+b}{2} - \binom{r}{2} - \binom{b}{2}.
$$

Finally, the probability of selecting two differently colored balls can be calculated by dividing the number of ways to pick two differently colored balls by the total number of ways to pick any two balls. This yields the following expression:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{\binom{r+b}{2} - \binom{r}{2} - \binom{b}{2}}{\binom{r+b}{2}}.
$$

Upon simplifying this expression, we arrive at:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{2rb}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}.
$$

This formula provides a straightforward method for calculating the probability of picking two differently colored balls without replacement.
