Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset.

Identifying outliers involves examining values that are substantially higher or lower than the other data points. These outliers can influence statistical measures such as the mean and standard deviation, making their detection crucial. For instance, consider a set of test scores where most students score between $60$ and $80$, but one student scores $100$; in this case, the score of $100$ would be classified as an outlier.

One effective method for detecting outliers is the interquartile range (IQR) approach. To calculate the IQR, you first determine the lower quartile ($Q1$) and the upper quartile ($Q3$) of the dataset. The IQR is then computed as:

$$
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
$$

Next, to establish the bounds for potential outliers, you multiply the IQR by $1.5$. The upper limit is found by adding this value to $Q3$, while the lower limit is obtained by subtracting it from $Q1$. Any data points that fall outside these limits are considered outliers. Mathematically, the limits can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Upper Limit} = Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}
$$

$$
\text{Lower Limit} = Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}
$$

Outliers may arise from various factors, including measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or they might represent rare but legitimate events. For example, if you are measuring the heights of students in a class and one measurement is $2.5$ meters, this could indicate either an error or an exceptionally tall individual.

Understanding outliers is essential, as they can skew your data analysis. They may cause the mean to be inaccurately high or low, leading to a distorted interpretation of the dataset. Therefore, upon identifying an outlier, it is important to investigate its origin and determine whether to include it in your analysis.
