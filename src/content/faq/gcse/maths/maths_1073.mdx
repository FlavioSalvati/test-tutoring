The scale factor is expressed as $1:500$.

To determine the scale factor, you need to compare the actual length of an object to its corresponding length on the drawing. In this example, the actual length is $10$ metres, while the length on the drawing is $2$ centimetres. First, we need to convert the actual length into the same units as the drawing length. Since there are $100$ centimetres in a metre, we can convert $10$ metres to centimetres:

$$
10 \text{ m} = 10 \times 100 \text{ cm} = 1000 \text{ cm}.
$$

Now we have the actual length as $1000$ centimetres and the drawing length as $2$ centimetres. The scale factor is defined as the ratio of the drawing length to the actual length. To calculate this, we divide the actual length by the drawing length:

$$
\frac{1000 \text{ cm (actual length)}}{2 \text{ cm (drawing length)}} = 500.
$$

This result indicates that $1$ centimetre on the drawing represents $500$ centimetres (or $5$ metres) in real life. Consequently, the scale factor is $1:500$. This ratio signifies that each unit of measurement on the drawing is $500$ times smaller than its actual size. 

Understanding scale factors is essential in disciplines such as architecture and engineering, where precise representations of large objects or areas are required on smaller, more manageable drawings.
