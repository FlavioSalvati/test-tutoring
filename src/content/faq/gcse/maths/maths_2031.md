The doubling time in exponential growth refers to the duration required for a quantity to double in size.

In the context of exponential growth, quantities increase at a rate that is proportional to their current value. This characteristic implies that as the quantity expands, the rate of growth itself accelerates. Doubling time serves as a specific metric to gauge the speed of this growth. It holds particular significance in various fields such as biology, finance, and population studies, where understanding the pace of growth is essential.

To compute the doubling time, one can employ the Rule of 70, a straightforward formula expressed as follows:

$$ \text{Doubling Time (in years)} = \frac{70}{\text{Growth Rate (in percentage)}} $$

For instance, if a population is increasing at a rate of $5\%$ per year, the doubling time would be:

$$ \text{Doubling Time} = \frac{70}{5} = 14 \text{ years} $$

This indicates that in $14$ years, the population will have doubled compared to its current size.

Grasping the concept of doubling time enables you to forecast future values and make informed decisions. For example, if you know that a particular investment doubles every $10$ years, you can estimate its future worth. Similarly, if a bacterial culture doubles every $2$ hours, you can predict the population of bacteria after a specified duration.

In summary, doubling time is a fundamental concept in exponential growth, aiding us in understanding and predicting the rate at which quantities increase over time.
