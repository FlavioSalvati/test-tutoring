To enlarge a square by a scale factor of $1.5$, multiply each side length by $1.5$.

When enlarging a square using a scale factor, you are increasing the size of the square while preserving its shape. Specifically, a scale factor of $1.5$ indicates that each side of the square will be $1.5$ times its original length. For instance, if the original square has a side length of $4 \, \text{cm}$, the new side length will be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{New Side Length} = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 1.5 = 6 \, \text{cm}.
$$

To better visualize this, consider drawing a square on graph paper. If the original square occupies $4$ units along each side, the enlarged square will span $6$ units along each side. This enlargement impacts not only the side lengths but also the area of the square. 

The area of a square is determined by squaring the side length, which can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{Side Length} \times \text{Side Length}.
$$

For the original square with a side length of $4 \, \text{cm}$, the area is calculated as:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} = 16 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

In contrast, for the enlarged square with a side length of $6 \, \text{cm}$, the area is:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{enlarged}} = 6 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 36 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

In summary, to enlarge a square by a scale factor of $1.5$, simply multiply the length of each side by $1.5$. This will yield the new dimensions of the square, allowing you to calculate the new area as needed. This method guarantees that the shape remains a square, only larger.
