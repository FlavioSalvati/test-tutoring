To represent the inequality $ x > 0 $ on a number line, follow these steps:

1. **Draw the Number Line**: Begin by sketching a horizontal line that represents the number line.

2. **Locate Zero**: Identify the point on this line corresponding to $ 0 $.

3. **Indicate the Open Circle**: Since $ 0 $ is not included in the solution (because $ x $ must be strictly greater than $ 0 $), place an open circle at $ 0 $. This open circle signifies that $ 0 $ itself is excluded from the solution set.

4. **Shade the Appropriate Region**: Next, shade the portion of the number line to the right of the open circle. This shaded area represents all numbers greater than $ 0 $. You can extend the shading indefinitely to the right, as there is no upper limit to the values that $ x $ can take. The shaded region clearly indicates that any number within this area satisfies the inequality $ x > 0 $.

5. **Understand the Importance of the Open Circle**: The open circle is essential, as it visually communicates that $ 0 $ is not part of the solution set. If the inequality were $ x \geq 0 $, a closed circle would be used instead, indicating that $ 0 $ is included in the solution.

By grasping these visual cues, you can accurately interpret and represent inequalities on a number line.
