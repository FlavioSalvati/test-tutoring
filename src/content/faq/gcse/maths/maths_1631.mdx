To determine the range of a set of test scores, you subtract the lowest score from the highest score.

The range serves as a measure of the dispersion of scores within a data set. To calculate it, you first need to identify both the highest and lowest scores. For instance, consider the test scores: $56$, $78$, $89$, $92$, and $65$. In this example, the highest score is $92$, and the lowest score is $56$. The next step is to perform the subtraction: 

$$
92 - 56 = 36.
$$

Thus, the range of these test scores is $36$.

The range provides a quick overview of the variability present in your data. A larger range suggests that the scores are more widely dispersed, whereas a smaller range indicates that the scores are clustered more closely together. However, it's important to keep in mind that the range only takes into account the two extreme values and does not provide insights into the distribution of the other scores. For a more comprehensive analysis, you may also consider other measures of spread, such as the interquartile range or the standard deviation.

In summary, calculating the range is a straightforward process: identify the highest and lowest values, and subtract the lowest from the highest. This simple calculation can help you quickly assess the spread of your test scores.
