To calculate the perimeter of a complex compound shape, you need to sum the lengths of all its outer edges.

When working with a compound shape, the first step is to identify all the individual segments that form its outer boundary. This may involve breaking the shape down into simpler components, such as rectangles, triangles, or circles, and concentrating on the edges that constitute the perimeter.

Begin by carefully tracing the outline of the shape, ensuring that you include every segment that contributes to the outer edge. It can be helpful to mark each segment as you proceed to prevent overlooking any parts or counting any segments more than once. If the shape contains curves, such as sections of circles, you will need to calculate the lengths of these curved segments (using circumference or arc length) and incorporate them into your total.

For instance, if your compound shape consists of a semicircle attached to a rectangle, the perimeter can be found by adding the lengths of the three straight sides of the rectangle to the length of the curved edge of the semicircle. Keep in mind that the straight edge of the semicircle that connects to the rectangle is not part of the perimeter.

Once you have identified and measured all the segments, simply add these lengths together to determine the total perimeter. Be sure to double-check your measurements and calculations for accuracy. This systematic approach ensures that you account for every part of the outer boundary, resulting in the correct perimeter of the complex compound shape.
