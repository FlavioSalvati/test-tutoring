The elapsed time from $2:30 \text{ PM}$ to $6:00 \text{ PM}$ is $3$ hours and $30$ minutes.

To calculate the elapsed time between two specific points in time, you can simplify the process by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. First, let's examine the time from $2:30 \text{ PM}$ to $3:00 \text{ PM}$. This interval lasts for $30$ minutes. Next, we will calculate the duration from $3:00 \text{ PM}$ to $6:00 \text{ PM}$, which is a straightforward $3$-hour interval.

Now, we can combine these two intervals. By adding the $30$ minutes from $2:30 \text{ PM}$ to $3:00 \text{ PM}$ with the $3$ hours from $3:00 \text{ PM}$ to $6:00 \text{ PM}$, we arrive at a total of $3$ hours and $30$ minutes.

When working with time calculations, it can be helpful to use visual aids such as a number line or a clock face. These tools can make it easier to visualize how hours and minutes accumulate. Additionally, keep in mind that there are $60$ minutes in an hour; thus, if the minutes you add exceed $60$, you will need to convert those minutes into hours.

Mastering the calculation of elapsed time is a valuable skill for everyday activities, whether you are planning your schedule, cooking, or traveling. Practicing with various time intervals will enhance your confidence and accuracy in making these calculations.
