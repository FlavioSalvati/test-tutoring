The domain of the function $ f(x) = \ln(x) $ is defined as $ x > 0 $.

To elaborate, the function $ f(x) = \ln(x) $ denotes the natural logarithm of $ x $. The natural logarithm is only applicable to positive real numbers, which means that $ x $ must be greater than zero for the function to operate correctly. Attempting to compute the natural logarithm of zero or a negative number results in an undefined value, leading to an error on most calculators.

To grasp the reasoning behind this restriction, consider the definition of the natural logarithm. The natural logarithm of a number $ x $ is the exponent to which the base $ e $ (approximately $ 2.718 $) must be raised to yield $ x $. Because raising $ e $ to any real number will always produce a positive result, it follows that $ x $ must also be positive. For instance, we have $ \ln(1) = 0 $ since $ e^0 = 1 $, and $ \ln(e) = 1 $ because $ e^1 = e $.

From a graphical perspective, the function $ f(x) = \ln(x) $ exhibits a vertical asymptote at $ x = 0 $. This indicates that the graph approaches the y-axis but never touches or intersects it. As $ x $ approaches zero from the positive side, $ \ln(x) $ decreases without bound, trending towards negative infinity. In contrast, as $ x $ increases, $ \ln(x) $ rises, albeit at a progressively decreasing rate.

Thus, when working with the function $ f(x) = \ln(x) $, it is crucial to remember that $ x $ must always be a positive number.
