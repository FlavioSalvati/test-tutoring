When it comes to subtracting mixed numbers, a systematic approach is essential. A mixed number is composed of a whole number and a fraction. The process begins by converting these mixed numbers into improper fractions.

To transform a mixed number into an improper fraction, you multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction, then add the numerator. Your calculation's sum becomes the new numerator, with the denominator remaining unchanged. For instance, the mixed number $2 \frac{3}{4}$ can be converted into an improper fraction by calculating $2 \times 4 + 3 = 11$. Hence, the mixed number $2 \frac{3}{4}$ is transformed into the improper fraction $\frac{11}{4}$.

The next stage involves ensuring that both fractions share a common denominator. If they don't, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators and adjust each fraction accordingly. For example, if you're given the fractions $\frac{11}{4}$ and $\frac{5}{6}$, the LCM of the denominators 4 and 6 is 12. Therefore, $\frac{11}{4}$ should be converted to $\frac{33}{12}$, and $\frac{5}{6}$ should be converted to $\frac{10}{12}$.

Subsequently, you subtract the numerators while the common denominator remains the same. In the context of our sample, the calculation becomes $\frac{33}{12} - \frac{10}{12} = \frac{23}{12}$.

Finally, if possible, simplify the resulting fraction. If the fraction is improper, it can be converted back into a mixed number. For our example, $\frac{23}{12}$ can be simplified by dividing 23 by 12 to yield 1 with a remainder of 11. Consequently, the fraction would be $1 \frac{11}{12}$.

By adhering to these steps, you can confidently subtract mixed numbers and present the result in its simplest form.
