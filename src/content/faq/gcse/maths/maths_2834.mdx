The translation vector that moves the point $(2, 3)$ to $(5, 7)$ is given by $(3, 4)$.

To understand how we derive this translation vector, let's break the process down step by step. A translation vector indicates both the distance and direction required to move a point. It is represented in the form $(a, b)$, where $a$ denotes the horizontal movement and $b$ represents the vertical movement.

First, we will examine the horizontal movement. We start at $x = 2$ and need to reach $x = 5$. To determine the extent of this movement, we subtract the initial x-coordinate from the final x-coordinate:

$$
5 - 2 = 3
$$

This calculation shows that we must move $3$ units to the right.

Next, we analyze the vertical movement. We begin at $y = 3$ and aim to move to $y = 7$. Again, we find the difference by subtracting the starting y-coordinate from the ending y-coordinate:

$$
7 - 3 = 4
$$

This indicates that we need to move $4$ units upward.

Combining these two movements, we arrive at the translation vector $(3, 4)$. This vector instructs us to move $3$ units to the right and $4$ units up to transition from the point $(2, 3)$ to the point $(5, 7)$.

In summary, the translation vector $(3, 4)$ effectively shifts the point $(2, 3)$ to $(5, 7)$ by moving it $3$ units horizontally and $4$ units vertically. This concept is fundamental in coordinate geometry and is essential for understanding how points and shapes can be translated on a graph.
