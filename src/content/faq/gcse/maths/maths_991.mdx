To calculate the distance between the points $(1, 1)$ and $(4, 5)$, we can utilize the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.

The distance formula provides a method to determine the length of the line segment connecting two points in a Cartesian coordinate plane. The formula is given by:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In this equation, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points, we can designate $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 1)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (4, 5)$.

To proceed, we first calculate the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates:

$$
x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 1 = 3
$$

$$
y_2 - y_1 = 5 - 1 = 4
$$

Next, we square these differences:

$$
(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 3^2 = 9
$$

$$
(y_2 - y_1)^2 = 4^2 = 16
$$

We then sum these squared differences:

$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the distance:

$$
\sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Thus, the distance between the points $(1, 1)$ and $(4, 5)$ is 5 units. This method provides an accurate way to measure the straight-line distance between any two points on a coordinate plane.
