The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the line represented by the equation $ y = -2x + 3 $ is given by $ \frac{1}{2} $.

To grasp this concept, let's first examine the gradient of the original line. The equation $ y = -2x + 3 $ is structured in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the gradient. In this case, the gradient $ m $ is equal to $-2$.

A fundamental property of perpendicular lines states that the product of their gradients is equal to $-1$. Thus, if we have a line with a gradient $ m $, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to it can be calculated using the formula:

$$
m_{\text{perpendicular}} = -\frac{1}{m}
$$

Here, since the gradient of the given line is $-2$, we can substitute this value into the formula:

$$
m_{\text{perpendicular}} = -\frac{1}{-2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Consequently, the gradient of the line perpendicular to $ y = -2x + 3 $ is indeed $ \frac{1}{2} $. This implies that for every $ 2 $ units you move horizontally, the line will rise $ 1 $ unit vertically. 

Understanding this relationship is crucial for graphing and analyzing lines in coordinate geometry, which is a fundamental aspect of GCSE Maths.
