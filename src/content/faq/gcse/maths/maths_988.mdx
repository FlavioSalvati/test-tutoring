The gradient of the linear equation $ y = 6x - 2 $ is $ 6 $.

To find the gradient of a linear equation expressed in the form $ y = mx + c $, you need to identify the coefficient of $ x $. In the equation $ y = 6x - 2 $, the term $ 6x $ represents the slope, or gradient, of the line. Specifically, the gradient is the numerical coefficient that multiplies $ x $, which in this instance is $ 6 $.

The gradient provides insight into the steepness of the line. A positive gradient indicates that the line slopes upward as you move from left to right, while a negative gradient signifies a downward slope. In this case, with a gradient of $ 6 $, the line has a steep upward incline. This means that for every $ 1 $ unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by $ 6 $ units.

Understanding the gradient is essential for graphing linear equations and analyzing their behavior. It allows you to predict how variations in $ x $ will influence $ y $, and it plays a critical role in solving problems related to rates of change.
