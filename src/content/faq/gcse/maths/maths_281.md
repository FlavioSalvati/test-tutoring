The equation of the line is given by 

$$
y = 3x + 2.
$$

To formulate the equation of a line, two key components are essential: the slope (or gradient) and the y-intercept. The slope quantifies the steepness of the line, while the y-intercept indicates the point at which the line intersects the y-axis. The general expression for a line in slope-intercept form is 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $m$ represents the slope and $c$ denotes the y-intercept.

In this particular case, the slope $m$ is equal to $3$, and the y-intercept $c$ is equal to $2$. Substituting these values into the slope-intercept formula yields:

$$
y = 3x + 2.
$$

This equation conveys that for every unit increase in $x$, the value of $y$ increases by $3$ units. Furthermore, when $x$ is $0$, the value of $y$ is $2$. This representation effectively illustrates a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.

When graphing this equation, you would begin at the point $(0, 2)$ on the y-axis. From that point, for each unit you move to the right along the x-axis, you would ascend $3$ units vertically. This process results in a straight line. Such a visual representation enhances understanding of how the slope and y-intercept determine the line's position and angle on the graph.
