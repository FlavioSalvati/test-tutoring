The slope of the line described by the equation $y = -5x + 8$ is $-5$.

In the equation $y = -5x + 8$, the slope is indicated by the coefficient of $x$. This format is known as the slope-intercept form, which is expressed as $y = mx + c$. In this expression, $m$ represents the slope, while $c$ denotes the y-interceptâ€”the point where the line intersects the y-axis.

To grasp the concept of slope, consider it as a measure of the steepness of the line. A positive slope indicates that the line rises as it moves from left to right, whereas a negative slope indicates that the line descends. In this case, the slope of $-5$ signifies that for every unit you move to the right along the x-axis, the line drops by $5$ units. This steep negative slope indicates a rapid decline.

The y-intercept, which is $8$ in this equation, indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $(0, 8)$. This information is particularly valuable for graphing the line, as you can begin at this point and use the slope to determine the line's direction and steepness.

Grasping the concepts of slope and y-intercept is essential for quickly sketching the graph of the line and analyzing its behavior. For students preparing for GCSE Maths, mastering these concepts is crucial for solving a variety of problems involving linear equations.
