To convert $250$ centimetres to metres, you need to divide the number of centimetres by $100$.

The metric system is structured around powers of ten, which simplifies conversions significantly. The fundamental unit of length in this system is the metre. Centimetres represent a smaller unit of length, where $1$ metre is equivalent to $100$ centimetres. Consequently, to convert from centimetres to metres, you simply divide the number of centimetres by $100$.

For instance, if you have $250$ centimetres and wish to convert it to metres, you would perform the following calculation:

$$
250 \, \text{cm} \div 100 = 2.5 \, \text{m}
$$

Thus, $250$ centimetres is equal to $2.5$ metres. This conversion method can be applied to any amount of centimetres. Just remember the essential step: divide by $100$. The prefix 'centi-' signifies one-hundredth, which clarifies that there are $100$ centimetres in a metre.
