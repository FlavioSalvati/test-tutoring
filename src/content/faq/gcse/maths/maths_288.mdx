The slope of a line quantifies the rate at which the variable $ y $ changes relative to the variable $ x $. In the equation 

$$ 
y = \frac{x}{2} - 1, 
$$ 

the slope is represented by the coefficient of $ x $, which is $ \frac{1}{2} $. This indicates that for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by $ \frac{1}{2} $ units. The slope not only indicates the steepness of the line but also its direction. A positive slope, such as $ \frac{1}{2} $, signifies that the line ascends as it moves from left to right.

To illustrate this concept, let’s plot the equation on a graph. We can start by selecting a value for $ x $, for instance, $ x = 0 $. Substituting this value into the equation yields:

$$ 
y = \frac{0}{2} - 1 = -1. 
$$ 

Thus, one point on the graph is $(0, -1)$. Next, let’s choose another value for $ x $, such as $ x = 2 $. Plugging this value into the equation results in:

$$ 
y = \frac{2}{2} - 1 = 0. 
$$ 

This gives us another point: $(2, 0)$. If we plot these points and draw a line through them, we observe that the line rises by $ 1 $ unit for every $ 2 $ units it moves to the right, consistent with our slope of $ \frac{1}{2} $.

Understanding the slope is essential for interpreting the behavior of the line. If the slope were negative, the line would decline as it moves to the right. Conversely, a larger slope would indicate a steeper incline. In summary, the slope of $ \frac{1}{2} $ in this equation conveys that the line rises gently, increasing by half a unit in $ y $ for each unit increment in $ x $.
