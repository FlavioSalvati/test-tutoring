To determine the perimeter of a hexagon, you can simply multiply the length of one side by six.

A hexagon is defined as a six-sided polygon, and its perimeter is the total distance around the shape. If you know the length of one side of a regular hexagon, you can easily compute the perimeter by multiplying that length by six, as all sides in a regular hexagon are of equal length. For example, if each side measures $5 \, \text{cm}$, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 5 \, \text{cm} \times 6 = 30 \, \text{cm}
$$

In contrast, for an irregular hexagon—where the lengths of the sides vary—you must add the lengths of all six sides together. For example, if the sides of an irregular hexagon measure $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, $5 \, \text{cm}$, $6 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $8 \, \text{cm}$, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 3 \, \text{cm} + 4 \, \text{cm} + 5 \, \text{cm} + 6 \, \text{cm} + 7 \, \text{cm} + 8 \, \text{cm} = 33 \, \text{cm}
$$

Understanding how to calculate the perimeter of a hexagon is valuable in various practical scenarios. For instance, it can help you determine the amount of material needed to construct a frame for a hexagonal garden bed or the length of fencing required to enclose a hexagonal area. Remember, the essential distinction is to either multiply the side length by six for a regular hexagon or to sum all the individual side lengths for an irregular hexagon.
