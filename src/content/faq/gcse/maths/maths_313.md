title: "What is the formula for the area of a trapezium?"
summary: The area of a trapezium is calculated using the formula; $\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height.

The formula for calculating the area of a trapezium is given by:

$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h $$

A trapezium, also known as a trapezoid in some regions, is a four-sided figure characterized by having at least one pair of parallel sides. These parallel sides are referred to as the bases of the trapezium, typically labeled as $a$ and $b$. The height, denoted as $h$, is the perpendicular distance between these two bases.

To determine the area of a trapezium, follow these steps:

1. Add the lengths of the two parallel sides, $a$ and $b$.
2. Multiply this sum by the height, $h$.
3. Finally, divide the result by $2$.

This process can be succinctly represented by the area formula provided above.

For instance, consider a trapezium with parallel side lengths of $8 \, \text{cm}$ and $5 \, \text{cm}$, and a height of $4 \, \text{cm}$. To find the area, substitute the values into the formula as follows:

$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (8 + 5) \times 4 $$

Start by adding the lengths of the parallel sides:

$$ 8 + 5 = 13 $$

Next, multiply this sum by the height:

$$ 13 \times 4 = 52 $$

Finally, divide by $2$ to obtain the area:

$$ \frac{52}{2} = 26 $$

Thus, the area of the trapezium is $26 \, \text{cm}^2$. This formula is particularly valuable for solving problems related to trapeziums in your GCSE Maths examinations.
