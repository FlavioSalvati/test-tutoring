To determine what $35\%$ of $140$ is, we start by converting the percentage into a decimal. Since percentages are based on a total of $100$, we divide $35$ by $100$, which yields $0.35$. 

Next, we multiply this decimal by the number we want to find the percentage of, which in this case is $140$. Thus, we perform the calculation:

$$
0.35 \times 140
$$

When you multiply $0.35$ by $140$, the result is $49$. Therefore, we can conclude that $35\%$ of $140$ is $49$. 

This method for calculating percentages can be applied universally: simply convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply it by the specified number.

Understanding how to compute percentages is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it is relevant to a variety of topics including probability, statistics, and real-life applications such as calculating discounts and interest rates. Regular practice of these calculations will enhance your confidence in tackling various types of percentage problems.
