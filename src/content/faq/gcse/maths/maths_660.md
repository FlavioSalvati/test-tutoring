The sixth power of $1$ is $1$.

In mathematics, powers or exponents indicate how many times a number, referred to as the base, is multiplied by itself. For instance, the sixth power of a number involves multiplying that number by itself six times. This is mathematically represented as $1^6$.

Let's break this down further: the expression $1^6$ translates to the multiplication $1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1$. Since multiplying $1$ by $1$ consistently yields $1$, regardless of how many times this multiplication occurs, the outcome remains $1$. This characteristic is a unique property of the number $1$.

Grasping this concept is essential as it illustrates how exponents function with various bases. For example, if we consider a different base, such as $2$, the sixth power would be calculated as follows: 

$$
2^6 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 64.
$$

However, when the base is $1$, the result is always $1$, irrespective of the exponent applied.

This distinct property of $1$ is beneficial for simplifying expressions and solving equations, as it streamlines calculations significantly. Therefore, whenever you encounter $1$ raised to any power, you can confidently assert that the result is $1$.
