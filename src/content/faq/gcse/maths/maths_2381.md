The formula for calculating the gradient between two coordinate points is given by:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

To clarify this concept, let's break it down further. The gradient, or slope, of a line quantifies its steepness. It is determined by calculating the change in the y-coordinates (the vertical change) and dividing it by the change in the x-coordinates (the horizontal change) between two points on the line.

Consider two points on a graph: $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The gradient $m$ can be calculated using the formula stated above.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to finding the gradient:

1. Identify the coordinates of the two points. For instance, let’s take the points $(2, 3)$ and $(5, 11)$.
2. Calculate the difference in the y-coordinates by subtracting the y-coordinate of the first point from that of the second point: 
   $$ 
   11 - 3 = 8 
   $$
3. Calculate the difference in the x-coordinates by subtracting the x-coordinate of the first point from that of the second point: 
   $$ 
   5 - 2 = 3 
   $$
4. Finally, divide the difference in the y-coordinates by the difference in the x-coordinates: 
   $$ 
   \frac{8}{3} 
   $$

Thus, the gradient $m$ is equal to $\frac{8}{3}$, which is approximately $2.67$.

This formula is crucial in GCSE Maths, as it helps students grasp the relationship between two points on a graph and understand the steepness of the line connecting them. The concept of gradient is fundamental in coordinate geometry and has numerous applications, ranging from simple graph plotting to more sophisticated analyses across various fields.
