The graph of the function $ y = \sin(x) $ over the interval from $ 0^\circ $ to $ 360^\circ $ exhibits a smooth, wave-like pattern. It begins at $ 0 $, reaches a peak at $ 1 $, dips down to $ -1 $, and ultimately returns to $ 0 $.

To elucidate this behavior, let's analyze the sine function more closely. The function $ y = \sin(x) $ is periodic, meaning it repeats its values at regular intervals. Specifically, within the interval from $ 0^\circ $ to $ 360^\circ $, the sine wave completes one full cycle.

At $ 0^\circ $, we have $ \sin(0^\circ) = 0 $, indicating that the graph starts at the origin point $ (0, 0) $. As $ x $ increases, the value of the sine function rises, reaching its maximum of $ 1 $ at $ 90^\circ $. This point is referred to as the peak of the wave. 

From $ 90^\circ $ to $ 180^\circ $, the sine value decreases back down to $ 0 $. At $ 180^\circ $, $ \sin(180^\circ) = 0 $, which signifies that the graph intersects the x-axis again.

Continuing the journey from $ 180^\circ $ to $ 270^\circ $, the sine value becomes negative, attaining its minimum value of $ -1 $ at $ 270^\circ $. This point is known as the trough of the wave. Finally, as we move from $ 270^\circ $ to $ 360^\circ $, the sine value rises once more, returning to $ 0 $. At $ 360^\circ $, $ \sin(360^\circ) = 0 $, completing the cycle as the graph meets the x-axis once again.

The graph of $ y = \sin(x) $ between $ 0^\circ $ and $ 360^\circ $ demonstrates symmetry about the x-axis and maintains a smooth, continuous wave-like shape. It is crucial to recognize that the sine function is continuous, which means there are no breaks or gaps in the graph. This characteristic smooth wave pattern is a defining feature of all sine functions, highlighting its fundamental role in trigonometry.
