The probability of rolling two sixes in succession is $\frac{1}{36}$, which is approximately $2.78\%$.

To grasp this concept more clearly, let's break it down step by step. When you roll a single six-sided die, there are six possible outcomes: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$. Each of these outcomes is equally likely, which means the probability of rolling a six on any one roll is $\frac{1}{6}$.

If you aim to roll two sixes in a row, you need to consider the probability of each roll occurring independently. The probability of rolling a six on the first roll is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of rolling a six on the second roll is also $\frac{1}{6}$. To find the combined probability of both events occurring, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event. Therefore, you calculate:

$$
\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}.
$$

This indicates that out of $36$ possible outcomes when rolling two dice, only one outcome will result in a six followed by another six. In percentage terms, this equates to approximately $2.78\%$. This relatively low probability highlights why rolling two sixes in succession is viewed as a rare event in dice games.

Understanding probabilities like this is crucial in various fields of mathematics, as it allows you to analyze the likelihood of different outcomes in numerous situations. Keep practicing with different scenarios to enhance your understanding of how probabilities operate!
