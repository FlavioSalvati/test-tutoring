The mean of the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 is $6$.

To calculate the mean of a set of numbers, you first sum all the values and then divide that total by the count of numbers in the set. In this case, we have the numbers $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, and $8$. Let's begin by adding them together:

$$
4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 30.
$$

Next, we determine how many numbers are in the set. Here, there are $5$ values. To find the mean, we divide the total sum by the number of values:

$$
\frac{30}{5} = 6.
$$

Thus, the mean of these numbers is $6$.

The mean is a type of average that provides insight into the central tendency of a set of numbers. It is particularly useful as it condenses a set of data into a single representative value, making it easier to comprehend and compare different datasets. In this example, the mean indicates that if the values were evenly distributed, each would be $6$.
