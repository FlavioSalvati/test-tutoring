To find the surface area of a sphere with a diameter of $14 \, \text{cm}$, we can use the formula for the surface area, which is given by:

$$
A = 4\pi r^2
$$

where $A$ is the surface area and $r$ is the radius of the sphere. The radius is half of the diameter. Given that the diameter of the sphere is $14 \, \text{cm}$, we can calculate the radius as follows:

$$
r = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \, \text{cm}
$$

Next, we will substitute the radius into the surface area formula:

$$
A = 4\pi (7)^2
$$

Now, we need to calculate the square of the radius:

$$
7^2 = 49
$$

Then, we multiply this result by $4$:

$$
4 \times 49 = 196
$$

Finally, we multiply by $\pi$ to find the surface area:

$$
A = 196\pi
$$

If you would like an approximate numerical value, you can use the common approximation $\pi \approx 3.14$:

$$
A \approx 196 \times 3.14 \approx 615.44
$$

Thus, the surface area of the sphere is approximately $615.44 \, \text{cm}^2$. In exact terms, the surface area is $196\pi \, \text{cm}^2$. This approach helps you understand both the precise and approximate values, which can be advantageous for various types of questions you may encounter in your GCSE Maths exams.
