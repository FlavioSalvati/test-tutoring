To calculate the mean from a frequency table, you need to follow a systematic process: multiply each value by its corresponding frequency, sum these products, and then divide by the total frequency.

A frequency table displays values along with their respective frequencies, indicating how often each value appears. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to finding the mean:

1. **Multiply Each Value by Its Frequency**: For every value in the table, multiply that value by its frequency. This step yields the total contribution of each value to the overall sum.

2. **Sum These Products**: Add all the products obtained in the previous step. This sum represents the cumulative total of all values, factoring in their respective frequencies.

3. **Divide by the Total Frequency**: Calculate the total number of observations by summing all the frequencies. Finally, divide the sum of the products by the total frequency. This result is the mean of the data set.

For instance, consider a frequency table with the values $2$, $3$, and $4$, having frequencies $3$, $2$, and $1$, respectively. The calculation would proceed as follows:

- **Multiply**: 
  $$ (2 \times 3) + (3 \times 2) + (4 \times 1) = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16 $$
  
- **Sum the Frequencies**: 
  $$ 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 $$
  
- **Divide the Sum of Products by the Total Frequency**: 
  $$ \frac{16}{6} \approx 2.67 $$

Thus, the mean of this data set is approximately $2.67$.
