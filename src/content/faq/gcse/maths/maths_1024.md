The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the line described by the equation $ y = 5x + 3 $ is $ -\frac{1}{5} $.

To understand this, letâ€™s first examine the given equation: $ y = 5x + 3 $. This equation is expressed in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the gradient (or slope) of the line. In this case, the gradient $ m $ is equal to 5.

A fundamental property of perpendicular lines is that the product of their gradients equals $ -1 $. Therefore, if one line has a gradient of $ m $, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to it will be given by $ -\frac{1}{m} $.

Since the gradient of the original line is 5, we can determine the gradient of the perpendicular line by calculating the negative reciprocal of 5. The negative reciprocal of 5 is $ -\frac{1}{5} $. Thus, the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = 5x + 3 $ is $ -\frac{1}{5} $.

This concept is particularly useful in various mathematical problems involving perpendicular lines, such as finding the equation of a line that is perpendicular to a given line and passes through a specific point. Remember that the crucial step in these problems is to take the negative reciprocal of the given gradient to determine the gradient of the perpendicular line.
