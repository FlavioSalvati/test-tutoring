The probability of event $B$ given event $A$ is computed using the formula:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}.
$$

Conditional probability helps us quantify the likelihood of an event occurring, given that another related event has already taken place. In this context, we aim to determine the probability of event $B$ occurring under the condition that event $A$ has already occurred.

In the formula, $P(B|A)$ represents the conditional probability of $B$ given $A$, $P(A \text{ and } B)$ denotes the probability that both events $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously, and $P(A)$ signifies the probability of event $A$ occurring by itself.

To apply this formula, you need two key pieces of information: the probability of both events occurring together, denoted as $P(A \text{ and } B)$, and the probability of the first event occurring independently, denoted as $P(A)$. 

For instance, consider a standard deck of playing cards, and suppose you want to calculate the probability of drawing a queen (event $B$) given that you have already drawn a heart (event $A$). First, you would determine the probability of drawing a queen that is also a heart, which is represented as $P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{52}$. Next, you would find the probability of drawing a heart, denoted as $P(A) = \frac{1}{4}$. 

By substituting these values into the formula, you can calculate the conditional probability as follows:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{52}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{13}.
$$

Understanding conditional probability is invaluable in various real-life scenarios, including weather forecasting, medical diagnoses, and games of chance. It empowers us to make more informed decisions based on the information we already possess.
