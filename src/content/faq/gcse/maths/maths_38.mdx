To arrange fractions from the smallest to the largest, one can utilize one of two methods: either convert them to a common denominator or compare their decimal representations.

When sorting fractions, the initial step involves ensuring a common basis for comparison. One effective approach is to convert all fractions to have a common denominator, which is achieved by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. Upon finding the LCM, adjust each fraction so that they all share this common denominator. As an illustration, if we are to compare $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{2}{3}$, and $\frac{5}{6}$, we need to find the LCM of 4, 3, and 6, which is 12. Consequently, we convert each fraction: $\frac{1}{4}$ becomes $\frac{3}{12}$, $\frac{2}{3}$ becomes $\frac{8}{12}$, and $\frac{5}{6}$ becomes $\frac{10}{12}$. It is now evident that $\frac{3}{12} < \frac{8}{12} < \frac{10}{12}$, thus $\frac{1}{4} < \frac{2}{3} < \frac{5}{6}$.

An alternate method involves converting each fraction into its decimal equivalent, which is achieved by dividing the numerator by the denominator. For example, $\frac{1}{4}$ equals 0.25, $\frac{2}{3}$ is approximately 0.6667, and $\frac{5}{6}$ is approximately 0.8333. By directly comparing these decimals, it is clear that 0.25 < 0.6667 < 0.8333, which implies $\frac{1}{4} < \frac{2}{3} < \frac{5}{6}$.

Both methods are valid and you can opt for the one that you find most intuitive or straightforward. Using a common denominator is often the favored method in examinations, as it demonstrates a solid understanding of fraction manipulation. However, converting to decimals can be more expedient and is handy for verifying your work.
