To determine the midpoint of a line segment defined by the endpoints $(3, 5)$ and $(7, 9)$, we can apply the midpoint formula:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

This formula computes the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the segment's endpoints. For this example, the endpoints are $(3, 5)$ and $(7, 9)$.

First, we will calculate the average of the x-coordinates. The x-coordinates are $3$ and $7$. By adding these values together, we get:

$$
3 + 7 = 10
$$

Next, we divide this sum by $2$ to find the average:

$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5
$$

Now, let's calculate the average of the y-coordinates. The y-coordinates are $5$ and $9$. Adding these values gives us:

$$
5 + 9 = 14
$$

We then divide this sum by $2$ to find the average:

$$
\frac{14}{2} = 7
$$

Thus, the midpoint of the line segment is given by the coordinates $(5, 7)$. This point lies exactly halfway between the two endpoints, both horizontally and vertically. 

Understanding how to find the midpoint is a valuable skill in geometry, as it aids in solving problems related to bisecting lines and identifying centers of various shapes.
