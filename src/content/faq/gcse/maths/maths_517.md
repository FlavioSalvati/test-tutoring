The notation used to represent the probability of event $ A $ not occurring is either $ P(A') $ or $ P(\text{not } A) $.

In probability theory, when discussing the likelihood of an event failing to happen, we employ specific notation for clarity. For any event $ A $, the probability that $ A $ does not occur is denoted as $ P(A') $ or alternatively as $ P(\text{not } A) $. This is referred to as the complement of event $ A $.

The complement rule in probability states that the sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement is always equal to 1. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
P(A) + P(A') = 1.
$$

This implies that if you know the probability of event $ A $ occurring, you can easily determine the probability of it not occurring by subtracting $ P(A) $ from 1. For example, if the probability of it raining tomorrow (event $ A $) is $ 0.3 $, then the probability of it not raining (event $ A' $) is calculated as:

$$
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.
$$

Understanding this concept is essential, as it aids in solving a variety of probability problems. For instance, if you are provided with the probability of an event occurring and are required to find the probability of it not occurring, you can apply the complement rule. This notation and rule are fundamental components of probability theory and are frequently encountered in different types of probability questions you may encounter in your GCSE Maths examinations.
