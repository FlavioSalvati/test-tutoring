To determine the radius of a circle when given the arc length and the angle, you can apply the following formula:

$$
r = \frac{\text{arc length}}{\text{angle (in radians)}}
$$

To utilize this formula effectively, ensure that the angle is expressed in radians. If the angle is initially provided in degrees, you can convert it to radians by multiplying by $\frac{\pi}{180}$.

### Example:
Let's say the arc length is $10 \text{ cm}$ and the angle is $60^\circ$. First, convert the angle from degrees to radians:

$$
60^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{3} \text{ radians}
$$

Next, substitute the values into the formula to find the radius:

$$
r = \frac{10 \text{ cm}}{\frac{\pi}{3}} = \frac{10 \times 3}{\pi} = \frac{30}{\pi} \text{ cm}
$$

Thus, the radius of the circle is $\frac{30}{\pi} \text{ cm}$, which is approximately $9.55 \text{ cm}$. 

This approach works because the arc length represents a specific fraction of the circle's total circumference, while the angle in radians quantifies that fraction.
