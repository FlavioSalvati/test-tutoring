To determine the rate of change, you should divide the change in the dependent variable by the change in the independent variable.

In greater detail, the rate of change quantifies how one quantity varies in relation to another. For instance, when examining a graph, the rate of change is typically represented by the gradient (or slope) of the line. To compute it, you need two points on the line, which we will denote as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The formula for the rate of change is given by:

$$ 
\text{Rate of Change} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} 
$$

In this formula, $\Delta y$ signifies the change in the dependent variable (usually the $y$-values), while $\Delta x$ indicates the change in the independent variable (commonly the $x$-values).

For example, consider two points on a graph, specifically $(2, 3)$ and $(5, 11)$. You can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

$$ 
\text{Rate of Change} = \frac{11 - 3}{5 - 2} = \frac{8}{3} 
$$

This calculation reveals that the rate of change is $\frac{8}{3}$, which is approximately $2.67$. This interpretation means that for every $1$ unit increase in the $x$-value, the $y$-value increases by roughly $2.67$ units.

Grasping the concept of the rate of change is essential across various fields, including physics (where it relates to speed), economics (where it pertains to cost fluctuations), and biology (in the context of population growth). It enables you to analyze how quickly or slowly changes occur, offering valuable insights into the relationships between different variables.
