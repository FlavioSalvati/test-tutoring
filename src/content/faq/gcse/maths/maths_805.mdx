When £60 is divided equally among 4 people, each individual will receive £15.

To find out how much each person gets, you need to perform a division operation, where you take the total amount of money and divide it by the number of people sharing it. In this scenario, you have a total of £60 that you want to distribute evenly among 4 individuals. The mathematical operation to use here is division.

You can set up the division as follows: 

$$
60 \div 4
$$

When you divide $60$ by $4$, the result is $15$. Thus, each person will receive £15.

To verify your calculation, you can multiply the amount each person receives by the number of people. If you multiply £15 by 4, you get:

$$
15 \times 4 = 60
$$

This confirms that the division was executed correctly, as the total amount distributed matches the original amount.

This method of division ensures that everyone receives an equal share, a fundamental concept in mathematics known as fair division. Mastering the skill of dividing amounts equally is valuable in everyday situations, whether you are sharing money, food, or other resources.
