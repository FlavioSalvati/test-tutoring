The slope of a line that is parallel to the equation $ y = 2x - 4 $ is $ 2 $.

In mathematics, the slope of a line quantifies its steepness and direction. For an equation in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, the coefficient $ m $ represents the slope of the line. In the given equation $ y = 2x - 4 $, we see that the slope $ m $ is $ 2 $.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same slope. This means that any line parallel to $ y = 2x - 4 $ will also have a slope of $ 2 $. While the y-intercept (the constant term $ c $) can vary, the slope must remain constant for the lines to be parallel.

Understanding slopes is essential in GCSE Maths, as it aids in graphing linear equations and analyzing their relationships. The slope indicates how much the y-value (vertical change) changes for a unit change in the x-value (horizontal change). Specifically, a slope of $ 2 $ indicates that for every $ 1 $ unit increase in $ x $, the y-value increases by $ 2 $ units.

Thus, if you encounter any line and know its slope, you can easily determine the slope of any line that is parallel to it. This principle is widely applicable across various fields, including geometry, physics, and economics, making it a fundamental aspect of your mathematical toolkit.
