To determine the magnitude of the vector $(3, -9)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the magnitude can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

In this case, the vector $(3, -9)$ has an x-component of $3$ and a y-component of $-9$. 

To find the magnitude, we visualize the vector as a directed line segment originating from the point $(0, 0)$ and extending to the point $(3, -9)$. The magnitude represents the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the two other sides correspond to the x and y components of the vector.

Following the steps outlined by the Pythagorean theorem, we first square the x-component:

$$
3^2 = 9
$$

Next, we square the y-component:

$$
(-9)^2 = 81
$$

We then add these two results together:

$$
9 + 81 = 90
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the magnitude:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{90}
$$

This can be simplified further. Recognizing that $90 = 9 \times 10$, we can express the square root as:

$$
\sqrt{90} = \sqrt{9 \times 10} = \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{10} = 3\sqrt{10}
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(3, -9)$ is $3\sqrt{10}$. This value represents the distance from the origin to the point $(3, -9)$ in the coordinate plane.
