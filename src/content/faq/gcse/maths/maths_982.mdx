The gradient of the line that passes through the points $(2, 5)$ and $(6, 9)$ is $1$.

To calculate the gradient (or slope) of a line, we can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}
$$

This formula can also be expressed as:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

In this expression, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points through which the line passes. For our specific case, the points are $(2, 5)$ and $(6, 9)$.

First, we will calculate the changes in the $y$ and $x$ values. The change in $y$ (the vertical change) is calculated as follows:

$$
y_2 - y_1 = 9 - 5 = 4
$$

Next, we determine the change in $x$ (the horizontal change):

$$
x_2 - x_1 = 6 - 2 = 4
$$

Now, we can substitute these values into the gradient formula:

$$
m = \frac{4}{4} = 1
$$

Thus, the gradient of the line is $1$. This indicates that for every unit increase in $x$, the $y$ value increases by $1$ unit. The positive gradient signifies that the line slopes upwards from left to right. Understanding how to compute the gradient is essential for analyzing the steepness and direction of a line on a graph.
