To determine the measure of an interior angle in a regular polygon, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Interior Angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
$$

A regular polygon is defined as a shape where all sides and angles are equal. The formula above allows you to calculate the measure of each interior angle, where $n$ represents the number of sides. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the interior angles of any polygon is given by:

$$
\text{Sum of Interior Angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
$$

For example, consider a triangle, which has $3$ sides. The sum of its interior angles is $180^\circ$. A quadrilateral, which has $4$ sides, has a total interior angle sum of $360^\circ$, and this pattern continues for other polygons.

To apply the formula step-by-step, start by calculating the total sum of the interior angles using:

$$
\text{Total Sum} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
$$

This calculation gives you the total measure of all the angles inside the polygon. Next, divide this total by the number of sides $n$ to find the measure of each individual angle:

$$
\text{Interior Angle} = \frac{\text{Total Sum}}{n}
$$

For instance, if you wish to find the interior angle of a regular hexagon (which has $6$ sides), you would first calculate the total sum of the interior angles:

$$
\text{Total Sum} = (6-2) \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ
$$

Then, divide this sum by the number of sides:

$$
\text{Interior Angle} = \frac{720^\circ}{6} = 120^\circ
$$

Thus, each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures $120^\circ$.

This method is a reliable way to find the interior angle of any regular polygon, making it an essential tool for solving various geometry problems.
