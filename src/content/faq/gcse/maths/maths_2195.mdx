To create a graph based on exam scores data, follow these steps: select an appropriate graph type, plot the data points accurately, and label the axes clearly.

First, determine which type of graph will best represent your data. For displaying exam scores, a bar chart or a line graph is generally ideal. A bar chart is particularly effective for comparing scores among different students or subjects, while a line graph is more suitable for illustrating trends over time.

Next, collect and organize your data. For instance, if you have scores from various students, compile a list of their names along with their corresponding scores. If you are presenting scores from multiple exams, document the exam dates alongside the respective scores.

Now, draw your axes. The horizontal axis (x-axis) usually represents the categories being compared, such as student names or exam dates, while the vertical axis (y-axis) represents the scores. Be sure to label both axes clearly, including units if applicable (e.g., "Scores out of $100$").

For a bar chart, create a bar for each category, ensuring the height of each bar corresponds to the score. Make certain that the bars are evenly spaced and maintain a consistent width. For a line graph, plot a point for each score and connect these points with straight lines to illustrate the trend.

Finally, include a descriptive title for your graph that summarizes its content, such as "Exam Scores for Year 10 Maths." If necessary, add a legend to clarify any symbols or colors used in the graph. This will enhance the graph's readability and make it easy to understand at a glance.
