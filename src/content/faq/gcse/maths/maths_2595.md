The angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference of a circle is always $90$ degrees.

This property is a fundamental characteristic of circles. When a diameter of a circle creates an angle at the circumference, it results in a right angle, specifically $90$ degrees. This phenomenon is known as the "angle in a semicircle" theorem. To grasp the reasoning behind this theorem, consider a circle with center $O$ and a diameter $AB$. If you select any point $C$ on the circumference of the circle and draw lines $AC$ and $BC$, you form triangle $ABC$.

Since $AB$ is the diameter, it passes through the center $O$, making segments $AO$ and $BO$ the radii of the circle. Consequently, we have $AO = BO$. Triangles $AOC$ and $BOC$ are both isosceles triangles because they each have two equal sides (the radii). The angles at point $O$ in these triangles are equal. Given that the total angle around point $O$ is $360$ degrees, the sum of the angles at $O$ for triangles $AOC$ and $BOC$ equals $180$ degrees.

Since these angles are equal, each must measure $90$ degrees. Therefore, the angle $ACB$, which is the angle subtended by the diameter at the circumference, is indeed $90$ degrees. This property is extremely useful for solving various problems related to circles and is a key concept in GCSE Mathematics.
