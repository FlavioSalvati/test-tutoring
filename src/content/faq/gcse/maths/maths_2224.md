To solve the equation $ y = 2x + 5 $ graphically, we will plot the line and identify the points where it intersects the axes.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that the equation $ y = 2x + 5 $ is in linear form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ signifies the y-intercept. In this case, the slope $ m $ is $ 2 $, and the y-intercept $ c $ is $ 5 $. This indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, 5) $.

To begin plotting the line, start by marking the y-intercept on the graph. Place a point at $ (0, 5) $ on the y-axis. Next, we can utilize the slope to determine another point on the line. A slope of $ 2 $ means that for every $ 1 $ unit moved to the right along the x-axis, the line rises $ 2 $ units along the y-axis. From the point $ (0, 5) $, move $ 1 $ unit to the right to reach $ (1, 5) $, and then move $ 2 $ units up to get to $ (1, 7) $. Plot this second point at $ (1, 7) $.

With these two points, you can now draw a straight line that passes through $ (0, 5) $ and $ (1, 7) $. Extend this line across the graph, ensuring it remains straight and continues in both directions. This line represents all the solutions to the equation $ y = 2x + 5 $.

To find the point where the line intersects the x-axis, set $ y = 0 $ and solve for $ x $. Substituting $ y = 0 $ into the equation yields:

$$
0 = 2x + 5.
$$

Solving for $ x $, we rearrange the equation:

$$
2x = -5,
$$

which gives:

$$
x = -2.5.
$$

Thus, the line crosses the x-axis at the point $ (-2.5, 0) $. Be sure to mark this point on your graph as well.

By plotting these key points and drawing the line, you can visually analyze the solutions to the equation $ y = 2x + 5 $.
