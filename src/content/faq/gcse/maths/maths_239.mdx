The second derivative of the function $ y = 4x^2 $ is $ 8 $.

To determine the second derivative, we first need to calculate the first derivative of the function $ y = 4x^2 $. The first derivative, commonly represented as $ \frac{dy}{dx} $ or $ y' $, indicates the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $. We can apply the power rule for differentiation, which states that 

$$ 
\frac{d}{dx} [x^n] = nx^{n-1} 
$$ 

to differentiate $ 4x^2 $.

Using the power rule, we find:

$$ 
\frac{d}{dx} [4x^2] = 4 \cdot 2x^{2-1} = 8x 
$$ 

Thus, the first derivative of $ y = 4x^2 $ is $ 8x $.

Next, we proceed to find the second derivative, which is the derivative of the first derivative. The second derivative, denoted as $ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} $ or $ y'' $, reveals how the rate of change itself is varying. We will differentiate $ 8x $ again using the power rule.

Applying the power rule to $ 8x $:

$$ 
\frac{d}{dx} [8x] = 8 \cdot 1x^{1-1} = 8 
$$ 

Therefore, the second derivative of $ y = 4x^2 $ is $ 8 $. This indicates that the rate of change of the slope of the curve $ y = 4x^2 $ remains constant at $ 8 $.
