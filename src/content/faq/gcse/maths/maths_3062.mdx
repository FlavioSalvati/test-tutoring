To create a scatter diagram, you'll need to plot each pair of values on a graph with both an x-axis and a y-axis.

Start by drawing the x-axis (horizontal) and the y-axis (vertical) on graph paper or using graphing software. Clearly label each axis with the variables you are comparing. For instance, if you are analyzing height and weight, you should label the x-axis as "Height (cm)" and the y-axis as "Weight (kg)".

Next, establish the scale for each axis. The scale should encompass the range of your data points. For example, if your height data spans from $150 \, \text{cm}$ to $190 \, \text{cm}$, ensure that your x-axis starts slightly below $150 \, \text{cm}$ and extends slightly above $190 \, \text{cm}$. Similarly, set the scale for the y-axis based on the range of your weight data.

Now, take each pair of values from your dataset. For instance, consider the pair $(160 \, \text{cm}, 55 \, \text{kg})$. Locate $160 \, \text{cm}$ on the x-axis and $55 \, \text{kg}$ on the y-axis. Move vertically from the point on the x-axis and horizontally from the point on the y-axis until the two lines intersect. Place a small dot or cross at this intersection point.

Continue this process for all pairs of values in your dataset. Each pair will be represented by a point on the scatter diagram, so it's crucial to place the points accurately to reflect the data correctly.

Finally, take a moment to review your scatter diagram for any visible patterns or trends. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the relationship between the two variables you are examining.
