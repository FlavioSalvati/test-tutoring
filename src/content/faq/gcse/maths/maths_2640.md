The circumference of a circle with a radius of $3 \, \text{cm}$ is approximately $18.85 \, \text{cm}$.

To calculate the circumference of a circle, we use the formula

$$ C = 2\pi r $$

where $ C $ represents the circumference and $ r $ is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius $ r $ is $3 \, \text{cm}$. Substituting the radius into the formula, we find:

$$ C = 2\pi \times 3 $$

which simplifies to 

$$ C = 6\pi. $$

Knowing that $\pi$ (pi) is approximately $3.14159$, we can compute a more accurate value for the circumference by multiplying:

$$ C \approx 6 \times 3.14159 $$

This yields:

$$ C \approx 18.84954. $$

When rounded to two decimal places, the circumference is approximately $18.85 \, \text{cm}$.

Understanding this formula is essential for solving a variety of problems related to circles, whether in geometry, trigonometry, or real-world scenarios such as determining the distance around a circular track. It is important to note that $\pi$ is a fundamental mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This ratio remains constant for any circle, making $\pi$ a crucial element in calculations involving circles.
