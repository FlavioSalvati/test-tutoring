The expression $10^{-3}$ is equal to $0.001$.

When you encounter a negative exponent, it signifies that you should take the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive version of that exponent. Specifically, $10^{-3}$ means $1$ divided by $10^{3}$.

To elaborate, $10^{3}$ (also known as ten cubed) is calculated as $10 \times 10 \times 10$, which equals $1000$. Therefore, $10^{-3}$ can be expressed as $\frac{1}{1000}$. When you divide $1$ by $1000$, the result is $0.001$.

Negative exponents might initially seem confusing, but they simply indicate that you need to invert the fraction. For example, $2^{-2}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2^{2}}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{4}$ or $0.25$.

Grasping the concept of negative exponents is essential, as they frequently appear in scientific notation and various mathematical contexts. They allow us to represent very small numbers in a more convenient format. For instance, $0.001$ can be succinctly written as $10^{-3}$, making it easier to read and utilize in calculations.
