To calculate the mean of a data set, you begin by summing all the values together and then dividing the total by the number of values in the set.

The mean, commonly known as the average, serves as a measure of central tendency, providing insight into the typical value within a data set. To determine the mean, follow these steps:

1. **Sum the Values**: First, add all the numbers in your data set. For example, consider the data set consisting of the numbers $3$, $5$, $7$, $9$, and $11$. The sum is calculated as follows:
   $$
   3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35.
   $$

2. **Count the Values**: Next, count how many numbers are present in your data set. In this example, there are $5$ numbers.

3. **Calculate the Mean**: The final step is to divide the total sum by the number of values. Thus, you would perform the following calculation:
   $$
   \text{Mean} = \frac{35}{5} = 7.
   $$
   Therefore, the mean of this data set is $7$.

This method is applicable to any collection of numbers, including whole numbers, decimals, and negative values. Simply remember to sum all the values first, and then divide by the total number of entries. This straightforward process allows you to find the average, which can be particularly useful in various real-life scenarios, such as calculating your average exam score or determining the average temperature over a week.
