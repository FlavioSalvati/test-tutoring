The range of a data set, as determined from a cumulative frequency graph, is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values in that data set.

To calculate the range using a cumulative frequency graph (also known as an ogive), you must first identify both the highest and lowest values represented in the data. A cumulative frequency graph plots cumulative frequencies against the upper boundaries of the data intervals. The highest value in the data set corresponds to the upper boundary of the last interval, where the cumulative frequency reaches its maximum. Conversely, the lowest value is typically represented by the lower boundary of the first interval, where the cumulative frequency begins.

For instance, consider a cumulative frequency graph that indicates the cumulative frequency reaches its maximum at an upper boundary of $50$ and starts at a lower boundary of $10$. In this case, the highest value in the data set would be $50$, while the lowest value would be $10$. Therefore, the range can be calculated by subtracting the lowest value from the highest value:

$$
\text{Range} = 50 - 10 = 40.
$$

It is crucial to read the graph carefully and understand the intervals in order to accurately determine these boundaries. There may be instances where the graph does not start precisely at the lowest value or end exactly at the highest value, necessitating some inference based on the provided data intervals. Mastering the interpretation of cumulative frequency graphs is an essential skill in GCSE Mathematics, as it enables effective summarization and analysis of data.
