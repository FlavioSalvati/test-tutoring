To calculate an angle using the cosine ratio, you can apply the formula:

$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\right).
$$

The cosine ratio is a fundamental concept in trigonometry, connecting the angles of a right-angled triangle with the lengths of its sides. Specifically, the cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}},
$$

where $\theta$ represents the angle you wish to determine.

To isolate the angle $\theta$, you need to rearrange the formula to solve for $\theta$. This involves taking the inverse cosine (also known as arccosine) of the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. Thus, the formula becomes:

$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\right).
$$

For instance, consider a right-angled triangle where the length of the adjacent side is $3$ units and the hypotenuse is $5$ units. You can calculate the angle $\theta$ as follows:

1. First, determine the cosine ratio: 
   $$ 
   \cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6. 
   $$

2. Next, apply the inverse cosine function: 
   $$ 
   \theta = \cos^{-1}(0.6). 
   $$

You can use a scientific calculator to find the inverse cosine. Simply input the ratio ($0.6$ in this case) and press the $\cos^{-1}$ button. The calculator will provide the angle in degrees. For a ratio of $0.6$, the angle $\theta$ is approximately $53.13$ degrees.

Keep in mind that the cosine ratio and its inverse are powerful tools for solving problems related to right-angled triangles. Practice using these concepts to enhance your confidence in trigonometry!
