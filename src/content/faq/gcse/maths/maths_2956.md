To calculate the conditional probability $ P(B|A) $, you need to divide the joint probability $ P(A \text{ and } B) $ by the probability of event $ A $. Specifically, this can be expressed as follows:

$$ 
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)} 
$$

In this scenario, we are given that $ P(A) = 0.3 $ and $ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.1 $. Substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$ 
P(B|A) = \frac{0.1}{0.3} 
$$

When you perform the division $ 0.1 \div 0.3 $, the result is approximately $ 0.3333 $, which can also be expressed as the fraction $ \frac{1}{3} $.

Thus, we conclude that:

$$ 
P(B|A) = \frac{1}{3} 
$$ 

This interpretation indicates that if event $ A $ has occurred, there is a one in three chance that event $ B $ will also take place. Understanding how to compute conditional probabilities is essential in various fields of mathematics and is particularly valuable in real-life scenarios, such as forecasting outcomes based on specific conditions.
