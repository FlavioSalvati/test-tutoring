To simplify the expression $ \frac{6^3}{6^2} $, we can apply the quotient of powers property, which allows us to subtract the exponents when dividing two powers with the same base. Specifically, this property states that:

$$
\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}
$$

In our case, both the numerator and the denominator share the base of 6. Thus, we can rewrite the expression as follows:

$$
\frac{6^3}{6^2} = 6^{3-2}
$$

Calculating the exponent gives us:

$$
6^{3-2} = 6^1
$$

Since any number raised to the power of 1 is equal to the number itself, we find that:

$$
6^1 = 6
$$

Therefore, the original expression $ \frac{6^3}{6^2} $ simplifies to $ 6 $.

This simplification technique applies to any base, not just 6. For instance, if we have $ a $ as a base with exponents $ m $ and $ n $, we can express it as:

$$
\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}
$$

This rule is a valuable tool for quickly simplifying expressions and is a fundamental concept in algebra that you will frequently encounter.
