The vector representation for translating the point $(2, 3)$ by the vector $(-4, 6)$ is calculated as follows:

$$(2 - 4, 3 + 6) = (-2, 9).$$

To elaborate, translating a point in a coordinate plane involves moving it from one position to another. This movement is defined by a vector, which includes both a direction and a magnitude. In our case, the vector $(-4, 6)$ indicates the translation. The first component, $-4$, instructs us to move 4 units to the left along the x-axis, while the second component, $6$, indicates a movement of 6 units upward along the y-axis.

To determine the new coordinates after the translation, we add the components of the vector to the original coordinates of the point. Starting with the point $(2, 3)$, we perform the following calculations:

- For the x-coordinate: 
  $$2 + (-4) = 2 - 4 = -2.$$
  
- For the y-coordinate: 
  $$3 + 6 = 9.$$

Thus, the new coordinates after translating the point $(2, 3)$ by the vector $(-4, 6)$ are $(-2, 9)$. This technique of translation can be applied to any point and any translation vector, making it an invaluable tool in geometry and various fields of mathematics.
