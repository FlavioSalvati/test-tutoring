To determine the volume of a similar shape with a scale factor of $1.5$, you should multiply the original volume by $1.5^3$.

When working with similar shapes, the scale factor impacts their dimensions in a proportional manner. For instance, if you have a shape and scale it by a factor of $1.5$, each linear dimension—such as length, width, and height—will also be multiplied by $1.5$. However, it's important to note that volume is a three-dimensional measurement, which means the impact of the scale factor on volume is amplified.

To grasp this concept, consider that volume is calculated by multiplying three dimensions together (for example, length $\times$ width $\times$ height). When each dimension is scaled by a factor of $1.5$, the new volume can be found by multiplying the original volume by $1.5$ for each dimension. This relationship is mathematically represented as multiplying the original volume by $1.5^3$ (which equals $1.5 \times 1.5 \times 1.5$), resulting in a value of $3.375$.

Thus, if you know the volume of the original shape, you can simply multiply that volume by $3.375$ to obtain the volume of the new, scaled shape. For example, if the original shape has a volume of $10$ cubic units, the volume of the similar shape with a scale factor of $1.5$ would be calculated as follows: 

$$
10 \times 3.375 = 33.75 \text{ cubic units}.
$$

This principle is applicable to all similar shapes, whether they are cubes, spheres, or more complex geometric figures. Always remember that the scale factor for volume is the cube of the linear scale factor.
