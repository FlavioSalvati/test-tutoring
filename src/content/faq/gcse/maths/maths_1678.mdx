To estimate the median from a cumulative frequency curve, you'll need to locate the 50th percentile on the vertical axis of the graph.

Understanding the median is essential; it represents the middle value of a data set, indicating that 50% of the values lie below it and 50% lie above it. A cumulative frequency curve, often referred to as an ogive, is a graphical representation that displays the cumulative totals of frequencies up to each data point.

Here are the steps to estimate the median:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Data Points**: Begin by determining the total number of data points in your data set. This total is typically represented by the highest value on the cumulative frequency axis.

2. **Calculate the Halfway Point**: Find the halfway point of this total, which corresponds to the 50th percentile. For instance, if your data set contains $100$ data points, the 50th percentile would be $50$.

3. **Draw a Horizontal Line**: From the $50$th percentile value on the vertical axis, draw a horizontal line extending toward the cumulative frequency curve.

4. **Determine the Intersection**: Identify where this horizontal line intersects the cumulative frequency curve. From this intersection point, draw a vertical line down to the horizontal axis.

5. **Locate the Estimated Median**: The point where this vertical line meets the horizontal axis represents the estimated median of your data set.

This method is effective because the cumulative frequency curve provides a visual summary of your data's distribution, enabling you to pinpoint the median accurately. However, keep in mind that the precision of your estimate is contingent upon the smoothness and accuracy of the curve. If the curve appears jagged or poorly drawn, your median estimate may be less reliable.
