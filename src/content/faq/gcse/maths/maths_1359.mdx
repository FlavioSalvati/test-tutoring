The general solution for the equation $\tan(x) = 0$ is given by 

$$
x = n\pi,
$$ 

where $n$ is any integer.

To understand why this is the case, we must first revisit the definition of the tangent function. In the context of a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. When we consider the unit circle, the tangent of an angle $x$ can be expressed as the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate of a point on the circle:

$$
\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}.
$$

The tangent function equals zero when the numerator, $\sin(x)$, is zero. This occurs at specific points on the unit circle where the angle corresponds to integer multiples of $\pi$. In mathematical terms, these points can be expressed as:

$$
x = n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z},
$$ 

where $\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of all integers. Consequently, for any integer value of $n$, the angle $x$ will be a multiple of $\pi$, resulting in $\tan(x) = 0$.

To illustrate this with a few examples:
- When $n = 0$, we find that $x = 0\pi = 0$.
- When $n = 1$, then $x = 1\pi = \pi$.
- When $n = -1$, we have $x = -1\pi = -\pi$.

These values correspond to the angles where the tangent function intersects the x-axis on the unit circle, yielding a value of zero. This pattern extends infinitely in both the positive and negative directions, encompassing all possible solutions to the equation $\tan(x) = 0$.
