The probability notation for the event of drawing a red card can be expressed as $ P(\text{Red Card}) $.

In probability theory, we utilize the notation $ P(\text{Event}) $ to denote the likelihood of a specific event occurring. In this case, the event in question is drawing a red card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. A typical deck consists of 26 red cards (comprising 13 hearts and 13 diamonds) and 26 black cards (including 13 spades and 13 clubs).

To determine the probability of drawing a red card, we apply the formula:

$$
P(\text{Red Card}) = \frac{\text{Number of Red Cards}}{\text{Total Number of Cards}}
$$

By substituting the specific values into this formula, we find:

$$
P(\text{Red Card}) = \frac{26}{52}
$$

This fraction can be simplified to:

$$
P(\text{Red Card}) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Thus, the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck is $ \frac{1}{2} $, which is equivalent to 0.5. This indicates that there is a 50% chance of drawing a red card. Understanding this notation and calculation is essential for grasping how to express and compute probabilities across various scenarios.
