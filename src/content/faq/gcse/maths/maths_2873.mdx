The length of the vector $(-8, 6)$ is $10$ units.

To determine the length of a vector, we utilize the Pythagorean theorem. A two-dimensional vector, such as $(-8, 6)$, can be visualized as a right-angled triangle where the components of the vector represent the lengths of the two perpendicular sides. The length of the vector corresponds to the hypotenuse of this triangle.

The formula for calculating the length (or magnitude) of a vector $(x, y)$ is given by:

$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

For the vector $(-8, 6)$, we substitute $x = -8$ and $y = 6$ into the formula:

$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + 6^2}
$$

First, we calculate the squares of the components:

$$
(-8)^2 = 64 \quad \text{and} \quad 6^2 = 36
$$

Next, we sum these squared values:

$$
64 + 36 = 100
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the total:

$$
\sqrt{100} = 10
$$

Thus, the length of the vector $(-8, 6)$ is $10$ units. This method applies to any vector in two dimensions and represents a fundamental concept in vector mathematics. Mastering the calculation of a vector's length is crucial for various applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics.
