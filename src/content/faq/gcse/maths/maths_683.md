The smallest fraction in this set is $\frac{1}{4}$.

To identify the smallest fraction, we can compare the values of each fraction. One effective method is to convert each fraction to its decimal equivalent. For instance, the fraction $\frac{1}{4}$ is equal to $0.25$, $\frac{1}{3}$ is approximately $0.333$, $\frac{1}{2}$ is $0.5$, and $\frac{2}{3}$ is approximately $0.667$. By examining these decimal values, it is evident that $0.25$ is the smallest, which corresponds to the fraction $\frac{1}{4}$.

Alternatively, we can compare fractions by finding a common denominator. The denominators present in the set are $4$, $3$, and $2$. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is $12$. By converting each fraction to have a denominator of $12$, we obtain: $\frac{1}{4}$ becomes $\frac{3}{12}$, $\frac{1}{3}$ becomes $\frac{4}{12}$, $\frac{1}{2}$ becomes $\frac{6}{12}$, and $\frac{2}{3}$ becomes $\frac{8}{12}$. When we compare these fractions with the same denominator, it is clear that $\frac{3}{12}$ is the smallest, which again corresponds to $\frac{1}{4}$.

Understanding how to compare fractions is an essential skill in mathematics. Whether you choose to convert them to decimals or to find a common denominator, these methods allow you to analyze and determine the relative sizes of different fractions. In this instance, both approaches confirm that $\frac{1}{4}$ is indeed the smallest fraction in the set.
