To determine the image of a point after reflecting it over the line $ y = 2x $, we need to follow a specific set of transformation rules.

Reflecting a point $(x, y)$ across the line $ y = 2x $ requires several steps. First, it is important to note that the line $ y = 2x $ has a slope of $2$, indicating that it is steeper than the line $ y = x $. The reflection process involves calculating the perpendicular distance from the point to the line and then mirroring this distance on the opposite side of the line.

The formula for finding the reflected point $(x', y')$ across the line $ y = 2x $ is more intricate than the reflection across simpler lines, such as the x-axis or y-axis. The following steps outline the process:

1. **Translate the point**: Shift the point $(x, y)$ to a new coordinate system where the line $ y = 2x $ is represented as the x-axis. This transformation involves a rotation of the coordinate system.
2. **Reflect the point**: Once the point is translated, reflect the new point over the x-axis of the transformed coordinate system.
3. **Translate back**: Finally, revert the reflected point to the original coordinate system.

Mathematically, this process may involve solving a system of equations or utilizing matrix transformations. While GCSE Maths students may not need to perform these calculations by hand, grasping the underlying concepts is essential. The reflected point $(x', y')$ will be equidistant from the line $ y = 2x $ as the original point $(x, y)$, but it will be located on the opposite side of the line.

In summary, reflecting a point over the line $ y = 2x $ entails a series of geometric transformations. These transformations ensure that the reflected point retains the same perpendicular distance from the line as the original point, yet lies on the opposite side.
