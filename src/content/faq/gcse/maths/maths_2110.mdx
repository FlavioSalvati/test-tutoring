The cube root of 8 is $2$.

To comprehend why this is the case, let's begin by recalling the definition of a cube root. The cube root of a number $x$ is a number $y$ such that 

$$
y^3 = x.
$$

In simpler terms, if you multiply $y$ by itself three times, the result will be $x$. For the specific case of the number 8, we need to identify a number that, when raised to the third power, equals 8.

Letâ€™s evaluate the number $2$:
$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 = 4 \times 2 = 8.
$$

As demonstrated, since $2^3 = 8$, it follows that $2$ is indeed the cube root of $8$.

Understanding cube roots is crucial because it aids in solving equations that contain cubic terms and enhances our grasp of numerical properties. For instance, when faced with an equation such as 

$$
x^3 = 8,
$$ 

recognizing that the cube root of 8 is $2$ allows for a swift resolution of the variable $x$.

In a broader context, cube roots are beneficial across various fields of mathematics and science. For example, in geometry, they can assist in determining the dimensions of a cube when given its volume. In physics, they are often utilized to solve problems related to volume and density.
