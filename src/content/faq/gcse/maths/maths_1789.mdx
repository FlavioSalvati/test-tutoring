To express the decimal $1.25$ as a fraction, we start by recognizing that it can be broken down into its whole number and fractional components. Specifically, $1.25$ consists of $1$ whole and $0.25$, which can be represented as $1 + \frac{25}{100}$. 

Next, we simplify the fractional part, $0.25$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{25}{100}$. To simplify this fraction, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $25$ and $100$, which is $25$. By dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, we obtain:

$$
\frac{25 \div 25}{100 \div 25} = \frac{1}{4}.
$$ 

Hence, $0.25$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{4}$.

Now, we will combine the whole number part, which is $1$, with the fraction $\frac{1}{4}$. To do this, we convert the whole number $1$ into a fraction that shares the same denominator as $\frac{1}{4}$. This leads us to express $1$ as $\frac{4}{4}$.

Next, we add these two fractions:

$$
\frac{4}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4 + 1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}.
$$ 

Thus, we conclude that the decimal $1.25$ can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{5}{4}$. This fraction is classified as an improper fraction because the numerator ($5$) is greater than the denominator ($4$).
