To determine the value of $ x $ in the equation $ 3x + 4 = 10 $, we will solve the equation step by step. Our objective is to isolate $ x $ on one side of the equation.

We start with the initial equation:

$$
3x + 4 = 10
$$

The first step is to eliminate the constant term on the left side, which is $ 4 $. We achieve this by subtracting $ 4 $ from both sides of the equation:

$$
3x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
3x = 6
$$

Next, we need to isolate $ x $ by removing the coefficient of $ x $, which is $ 3 $. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by $ 3 $:

$$
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{6}{3}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = 2
$$

Thus, the value of $ x $ is $ 2 $. To confirm our solution, we can substitute $ x $ back into the original equation to verify that both sides are equal:

$$
3(2) + 4 = 10
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
6 + 4 = 10
$$

Which simplifies to:

$$
10 = 10
$$

Since both sides of the equation are indeed equal, we can confidently conclude that our solution is correct. Therefore, $ x = 2 $ is the value that satisfies the equation $ 3x + 4 = 10 $.
