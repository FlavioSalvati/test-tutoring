The largest number in this set is $7$.

To identify the greatest number in a set, we must compare each number with the others. In this particular set, we have the numbers $3$, $7$, $1$, and $5$. We can begin by comparing the first number, $3$, with the next number, $7$. Since $7$ is greater than $3$, we then compare $7$ with the next number in the set, which is $1$. It is clear that $7$ is also greater than $1$. Finally, we compare $7$ with the last number, $5$, and once again, $7$ is greater than $5$. Thus, we conclude that $7$ is the largest number in this set.

When comparing numbers, it is useful to visualize their positions on a number line. Numbers that are positioned further to the right are always greater than those to the left. For instance, if we imagine a number line with the points $1$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ marked on it, we can see that $7$ is located furthest to the right. This visualization aids in understanding why $7$ is indeed the greatest number.

In conclusion, by systematically comparing each number in the set, we can confidently assert that $7$ is the greatest number. This approach ensures that no number is overlooked and that the comparisons are thorough and accurate.
