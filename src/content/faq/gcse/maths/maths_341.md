The surface area of a similar cuboid with a scale factor of $3$ is $9$ times greater than that of the original cuboid.

When working with similar shapes, the scale factor influences various dimensions in specific ways. For a cuboid, which has three dimensions—length, width, and height—if the scale factor is $3$, each dimension of the new cuboid is $3$ times the corresponding dimension of the original cuboid. This means that if the original cuboid has dimensions $l$, $w$, and $h$, the new cuboid will have dimensions $3l$, $3w$, and $3h$.

The surface area of a cuboid is determined using the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
$$

For the original cuboid, this becomes:

$$
2lw + 2lh + 2wh
$$

For the new cuboid, with dimensions $3l$, $3w$, and $3h$, the surface area can be expressed as:

$$
2(3l \cdot 3w) + 2(3l \cdot 3h) + 2(3w \cdot 3h)
$$

Simplifying this yields:

$$
2(9lw) + 2(9lh) + 2(9wh) = 18lw + 18lh + 18wh
$$

It is noteworthy that $18lw + 18lh + 18wh$ is precisely $9$ times the original surface area $2lw + 2lh + 2wh$. Consequently, when the dimensions of a cuboid are scaled by a factor of $3$, the surface area increases by a factor of $3^2 = 9$. 

This principle holds true for all similar shapes: the surface area scales by the square of the linear scale factor.
