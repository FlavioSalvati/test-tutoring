The arc length of a circle with a diameter of $8 \, \text{cm}$ and a central angle of $180^\circ$ is approximately $12.57 \, \text{cm}$.

To calculate the arc length of a circle, you need to know both the radius and the angle measured in degrees. The formula for arc length $L$ is expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r
$$

Here, $\theta$ represents the angle in degrees, and $r$ denotes the radius of the circle. In this instance, the diameter of the circle is $8 \, \text{cm}$, which means the radius $r$ is half of the diameter:

$$
r = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \, \text{cm}
$$

Given that the angle $\theta$ is $180^\circ$, we can substitute these values into the arc length formula:

$$
L = \frac{180}{360} \times 2\pi \times 4
$$

Next, we simplify the fraction $\frac{180}{360}$, which reduces to $\frac{1}{2}$:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times 4
$$

Now, we can multiply the constants together:

$$
L = \pi \times 4
$$

Using the approximate value of $\pi \approx 3.14$, we can compute the arc length:

$$
L \approx 3.14 \times 4 = 12.56
$$

Rounding to two decimal places, we find that the arc length is approximately $12.57 \, \text{cm}$. This length represents the curved portion of the circle corresponding to a central angle of $180^\circ$, which is effectively half the circumference of the circle, since $180^\circ$ is half of a full $360^\circ$ rotation.
