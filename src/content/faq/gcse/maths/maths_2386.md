To determine the coordinates of the midpoint between two points, you need to average their x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

The midpoint of a line segment is defined as the point that lies exactly halfway between its two endpoints. Given two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, you can calculate the midpoint using the midpoint formula:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

In this formula, you add the x-coordinates of the two points together and then divide by $2$ to find the x-coordinate of the midpoint. Similarly, you add the y-coordinates together and divide by $2$ to find the y-coordinate of the midpoint.

For example, consider the points $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$. The steps to calculate the midpoint are as follows:

1. Add the x-coordinates: 
   $$2 + 4 = 6$$
2. Divide by $2$: 
   $$\frac{6}{2} = 3$$

Thus, the x-coordinate of the midpoint is $3$.

3. Add the y-coordinates: 
   $$3 + 7 = 10$$
4. Divide by $2$: 
   $$\frac{10}{2} = 5$$

Consequently, the y-coordinate of the midpoint is $5$.

Therefore, the coordinates of the midpoint are $(3, 5)$.

This method is applicable for any pair of points in a two-dimensional plane and is an essential concept in coordinate geometry. It has various applications, such as finding the center of a line segment or dividing a line segment into equal parts.
