The inverse function of $ f(x) = \frac{x}{2} $ can be expressed as $ f^{-1}(x) = 2x $.

To derive the inverse function, we must reverse the operations performed by the original function. The function $ f(x) = \frac{x}{2} $ takes an input $ x $ and divides it by 2. To reverse this operation, we need to multiply by 2.

Let's go through the steps to find the inverse function:

1. Start by substituting $ f(x) $ with $ y $:
   $$ y = \frac{x}{2} $$

2. Next, interchange $ x $ and $ y $ to find the inverse:
   $$ x = \frac{y}{2} $$

3. Now, isolate $ y $ by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
   $$ y = 2x $$

Thus, we find that the inverse function is $ f^{-1}(x) = 2x $.

In simpler terms, if the original function halves the input, the inverse function will double it. This means that if you start with a number, apply the original function, and then apply the inverse function, you will return to your original number. For instance, if you start with $ 4 $, the original function yields:
$$ f(4) = \frac{4}{2} = 2 $$ 
Then, applying the inverse function to $ 2 $ gives:
$$ f^{-1}(2) = 2 \times 2 = 4 $$ 
This result confirms that you have returned to your starting number. Therefore, we can conclude that the functions $ f $ and $ f^{-1} $ are indeed inverses of one another.
