The slope of the line given by the equation 

$$ 
y = 5x - 2 
$$ 

is $5$.

To determine the slope of a line from its equation in the standard form $y = mx + c$, you need to locate the coefficient of $x$. This format is referred to as the slope-intercept form, where $m$ denotes the slope and $c$ signifies the y-intercept. In the equation $y = 5x - 2$, the coefficient of $x$ is $5$, which indicates that the slope of the line is indeed $5$.

The slope of a line reflects both its steepness and its direction. A positive slope means that the line rises as it extends from left to right, whereas a negative slope indicates that it falls. In this instance, the slope is $5$, suggesting that the line rises sharply as you move from left to right. The greater the magnitude of the slope, the steeper the incline of the line.

Grasping the concept of slope is essential in various fields of mathematics and practical applications. It is particularly important for calculating rates of change, analyzing trends in data, and resolving problems related to linear relationships. For instance, when examining the speed of a car over time, the slope of the corresponding graph would provide insights into how quickly the car is accelerating or decelerating.
