Let's enhance the clarity and readability of the provided content while ensuring proper formatting of mathematical expressions. Here is the revised version:

The y-intercept of the equation $ y = 3x + 7 $ is 7.

To find the y-intercept of a linear equation in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, you need to identify the constant term, represented by $ c $. In the equation $ y = 3x + 7 $, the constant term is $ 7 $. The y-intercept is the point where the line intersects the y-axis, which occurs when the value of $ x $ is $ 0 $.

By substituting $ x = 0 $ into the equation, we can calculate the corresponding value of $ y $:

$$
y = 3(0) + 7 = 7.
$$

Thus, the y-intercept is $ 7 $, indicating that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, 7) $.

Understanding the y-intercept is essential because it serves as a starting point for graphing the line. Once you plot the y-intercept on a graph, you can use the slope (the coefficient of $ x $, which is $ 3 $ in this case) to determine the line's direction and steepness. The slope indicates that for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by $ 3 $ units.

With knowledge of both the y-intercept and the slope, you can easily sketch the graph of the equation. The y-intercept provides a clear reference point through which the line passes, making it simpler to visualize and draw the linear relationship described by the equation.
