Pythagoras' Theorem can be extended into three dimensions, allowing us to calculate the distance between two points in 3D space.

In three-dimensional geometry, Pythagoras' Theorem enables us to find the length of the diagonal that connects two points, which we denote as $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$. The formula for this calculation is given by:

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
$$

In this equation, $d$ denotes the distance between the two points. The terms $(x_2 - x_1)$, $(y_2 - y_1)$, and $(z_2 - z_1)$ represent the differences in the x, y, and z coordinates of the respective points.

To visualize this concept, imagine a cuboid (a three-dimensional rectangle) where you wish to calculate the diagonal length stretching from one corner of the cuboid to the opposite corner. First, you can determine the diagonal of the base of the cuboid using the two-dimensional version of Pythagoras' Theorem:

$$
\text{Base diagonal} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

Next, treat this base diagonal as one leg of a right triangle, with the height of the cuboid representing the other leg. You can then apply Pythagoras' Theorem in three dimensions again:

$$
d = \sqrt{(\text{Base diagonal})^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
$$

By substituting the expression for the base diagonal back into the equation, you arrive at the comprehensive formula for distance in three-dimensional space:

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
$$

This method provides a systematic approach to calculate the straight-line distance between any two points in three-dimensional space, making it an essential tool in both geometry and physics.
