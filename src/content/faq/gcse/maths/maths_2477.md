To calculate the surface area of a cuboid, you need to sum the areas of all six rectangular faces.

A cuboid consists of six faces, each of which is a rectangle. To determine the total surface area, you must find the area of each rectangle and then add these areas together. The formula for the surface area of a cuboid is given by:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
$$

where $ l $ represents the length, $ w $ denotes the width, and $ h $ indicates the height of the cuboid.

To begin, calculate the area of the three distinct pairs of opposite faces. The area of the face with dimensions $ l $ and $ w $ is $ lw $. Since there are two such faces, their combined area is $ 2lw $. Next, the area of the face with dimensions $ l $ and $ h $ is $ lh $, and for the two faces, it totals $ 2lh $. Finally, the area of the face with dimensions $ w $ and $ h $ is $ wh $, and for the two such faces, it sums to $ 2wh $.

By adding these areas together, you achieve the total surface area:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
$$

For example, consider a cuboid with a length of $5 \text{ cm}$, a width of $3 \text{ cm}$, and a height of $4 \text{ cm}$. You would calculate the surface area as follows:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2(5 \times 3) + 2(5 \times 4) + 2(3 \times 4)
$$
$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2(15) + 2(20) + 2(12)
$$
$$
\text{Surface Area} = 30 + 40 + 24
$$
$$
\text{Surface Area} = 94 \text{ cm}^2
$$

Thus, the surface area of the cuboid is $ 94 \, \text{cm}^2 $.
