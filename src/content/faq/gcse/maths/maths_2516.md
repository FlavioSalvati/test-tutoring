The length of a side in a similar shape with a scale factor of $2$ is twice as long as the corresponding side in the original shape.

In mathematics, particularly in geometry, the concept of a scale factor is essential when working with similar shapes. A scale factor is a numerical value that scales, or multiplies, the dimensions of one shape to derive the dimensions of another shape that is similar. When the scale factor is $2$, it indicates that every corresponding side of the new shape will be twice as long as that of the original shape.

For instance, consider a triangle with side lengths of $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, and $5 \, \text{cm}$. If we apply a scale factor of $2$, the sides of the resulting triangle will measure $6 \, \text{cm}$, $8 \, \text{cm}$, and $10 \, \text{cm}$, respectively. This transformation occurs because each side length is multiplied by the scale factor of $2$:

$$
3 \, \text{cm} \times 2 = 6 \, \text{cm}, \quad 4 \, \text{cm} \times 2 = 8 \, \text{cm}, \quad 5 \, \text{cm} \times 2 = 10 \, \text{cm}.
$$

It is important to understand that while the side lengths are indeed doubled, the overall shape remains similar. This means that the angles stay the same and the proportions of the shape are preserved. This principle is applicable to all varieties of shapes, including triangles, rectangles, and more complex polygons. Mastering the use of scale factors is a fundamental skill in geometry, particularly when analyzing and comparing similar shapes.
