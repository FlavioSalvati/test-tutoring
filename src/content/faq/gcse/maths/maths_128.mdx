To determine the start time, subtract the duration from the end time. For instance, if the end time is 5:00 PM and the duration is 3 hours, the calculation yields 2:00 PM.

To elaborate on this calculation, let's break down the process of subtracting time. The specified end time is 5:00 PM, which falls in the afternoon. The duration we need to subtract is 3 hours. To find the start time, we will count backwards from the end time by the duration.

Starting at 5:00 PM, if we subtract 1 hour, we arrive at 4:00 PM. Continuing this process, if we subtract another hour, we reach 3:00 PM. Finally, by subtracting one more hour, we arrive at 2:00 PM. Thus, $5:00 PM - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 PM$.

This method is effective because time operates in a linear fashion, and subtracting hours is analogous to subtracting numbers. You might also visualize this by imagining a clock face. Starting at the number 5, count backwards three positions: 4, 3, 2.

It's important to always clarify whether you are working in the AM (morning) or PM (afternoon/evening) to prevent any confusion. In this scenario, both the start and end times are in the PM, making the calculation straightforward.
