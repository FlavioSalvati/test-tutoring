To calculate the volumes of similar cuboids, you can use the ratio of their corresponding side lengths raised to the power of three.

When working with similar cuboids, it's crucial to recognize that the corresponding side lengths are proportional. This implies that if you know the ratio of the side lengths of two similar cuboids, you can easily determine the ratio of their volumes by cubing the side length ratio.

Assume you have two similar cuboids, with the ratio of their corresponding side lengths represented as $ \frac{a}{b} $. The volume ratio can then be calculated by cubing this ratio, resulting in:

$$
\text{Volume Ratio} = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^3.
$$

For instance, if one cuboid has side lengths that are twice as long as those of another cuboid, the side length ratio can be expressed as $ \frac{2}{1} $. Cubing this ratio yields:

$$
\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{1}.
$$

This indicates that the larger cuboid has a volume that is 8 times greater than that of the smaller cuboid.

To calculate the actual volume of a cuboid, you multiply its length, width, and height. If you know the volume of one cuboid and the ratio of their side lengths, you can find the volume of the similar cuboid by multiplying the known volume by the cubed ratio. For example, if the smaller cuboid has a volume of $10$ cubic units and the side length ratio is $ \frac{2}{1} $, the volume of the larger cuboid can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Volume of larger cuboid} = 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ cubic units}.
$$
