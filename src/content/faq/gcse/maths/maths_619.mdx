To identify the class interval from a histogram, begin by measuring the width of each bar along the x-axis.

In a histogram, the x-axis represents the range of data values that are divided into segments called class intervals or bins. Each bar corresponds to a specific class interval, and the height of the bar indicates the frequency of data points that fall within that interval. To determine the class interval, observe the range of values represented by a single bar. For instance, if a bar spans from $10$ to $20$, the class interval is $10$ units wide.

For precise measurements, it is important to check the scale of the x-axis. The axis may be labeled in increments, such as $0$, $5$, $10$, $15$, etc. In such cases, if a bar extends from $10$ to $20$, the class interval remains $10$ units. If the histogram employs different scales or if the intervals are not uniform, you may need to measure each interval individually.

Comprehending class intervals is essential for accurately interpreting histograms. They provide insight into how data is distributed across various ranges, facilitating the identification of patterns, trends, and outliers. When analyzing a histogram, always pay close attention to the class intervals to ensure a proper understanding of the data being presented.
