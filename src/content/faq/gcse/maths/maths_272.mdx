The y-intercept of the line given by the equation $y = 3x + 5$ is $5$.

To determine the y-intercept of a line defined by the equation $y = mx + c$, you need to locate the value of $c$. In the equation $y = 3x + 5$, the term $3x$ signifies the slope (or gradient) of the line, while the number $5$ represents the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

When a line crosses the y-axis, the value of $x$ is always $0$. By substituting $x = 0$ into the equation, you can find the corresponding value of $y$. For the equation at hand, substituting $x = 0$ yields:

$$
y = 3(0) + 5 = 5.
$$

Thus, the y-intercept is indeed $5$.

Graphically, this indicates that the line intersects the y-axis at the point $(0, 5)$. This point is a crucial aspect of the line and serves as a foundation for sketching its graph. The y-intercept is particularly valuable because it provides a starting point for plotting the line. From this point, you can utilize the slope—$3$ in this case—to determine additional points on the line. Specifically, for every $1$ unit you move to the right, you move up $3$ units.
