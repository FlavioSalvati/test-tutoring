To plot the linear equation $ y = -x + 5 $, we begin by selecting a range of values for $ x $ and calculating the corresponding $ y $ values. 

It is helpful to choose simple integers for $ x $, such as -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. For each selected $ x $ value, we will substitute it into the equation to determine the corresponding $ y $ value.

Let's calculate the points step by step:

1. For $ x = -2 $:
   $$
   y = -(-2) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7
   $$
   Thus, one point is $(-2, 7)$.

2. For $ x = -1 $:
   $$
   y = -(-1) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6
   $$
   Therefore, another point is $(-1, 6)$.

3. For $ x = 0 $:
   $$
   y = -(0) + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5
   $$
   This gives us another point: $(0, 5)$.

4. For $ x = 1 $:
   $$
   y = -(1) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4
   $$
   Hence, another point is $(1, 4)$.

5. For $ x = 2 $:
   $$
   y = -(2) + 5 = -2 + 5 = 3
   $$
   This results in yet another point: $(2, 3)$.

Now, we have the following points to plot: $(-2, 7)$, $(-1, 6)$, $(0, 5)$, $(1, 4)$, and $(2, 3)$. 

By plotting these points on a graph and drawing a straight line through them, we can visualize the linear relationship defined by the equation $ y = -x + 5 $. This line will exhibit a negative slope, illustrating that as $ x $ increases, $ y $ decreases.
