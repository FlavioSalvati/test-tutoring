To find a missing side in a triangle using the sine rule, you can apply the formula:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
$$

The sine rule is particularly effective for solving problems involving non-right-angled triangles. It establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the sines of its respective angles. To calculate a missing side, you need to know at least one side length along with the angles opposite to both the known side and the side you wish to find.

Consider a triangle with sides $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ opposite to angles $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ respectively. If you are given the length of side $ a $ and the measures of angles $ A $ and $ B $, and you want to determine the length of side $ b $, you can rearrange the sine rule formula as follows:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B}
$$

To isolate $ b $, rearrange the equation:

$$
b = \frac{a \cdot \sin B}{\sin A}
$$

Now, substitute the known values for $ a $, $ \sin A $, and $ \sin B $ to compute $ b $.

For example, letâ€™s assume $ a = 7 $, $ A = 30^\circ $, and $ B = 45^\circ $. First, we need to calculate the sines of the angles:

$$
\sin 30^\circ = 0.5
$$

$$
\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707
$$

Next, substitute these values into the formula:

$$
b = \frac{7 \cdot 0.707}{0.5} = \frac{4.949}{0.5} = 9.898
$$

Thus, the length of side $ b $ is approximately $ 9.898 $ units. This method can be applied to any triangle where you have the necessary known values, making the sine rule a versatile tool in trigonometry.
