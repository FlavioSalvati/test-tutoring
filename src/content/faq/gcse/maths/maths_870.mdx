To create an equation from a word problem, follow these steps: identify the variables, translate the words into mathematical expressions, and formulate the equation.

First, read the word problem carefully to grasp what is being asked. Identify the unknown quantities and assign variables to them, such as $x$ or $y$. For example, if the problem concerns the number of apples and oranges, you might designate $x$ to represent the number of apples and $y$ to signify the number of oranges.

Next, translate the relationships described in the problem into mathematical expressions. Pay attention to keywords that indicate specific mathematical operations. Words like "total," "sum," or "combined" typically suggest addition, while terms like "difference" or "less than" indicate subtraction. Multiplication may be indicated by phrases such as "times" or "product," and division can often be recognized by words like "per" or "ratio."

For instance, consider the statement: "The total cost of 3 apples and 2 oranges is £5, and each apple costs £1." You can set up the equation by translating this information. Let $x$ represent the cost of an apple and $y$ represent the cost of an orange. The resulting equation would be:

$$
3x + 2y = 5.
$$

Finally, verify that the equation accurately reflects the problem at hand. Double-check the relationships and quantities to ensure that no detail has been overlooked. This systematic approach will help you convert the word problem into a solvable mathematical equation, making it easier to find the solution.
