To write the equation of a line parallel to y = -x + 2, use the same gradient, -1.

In more detail, the equation of a line in the form y = mx + c, where m is the gradient and c is the y-intercept, helps us understand the slope and position of the line. For the given line y = -x + 2, the gradient (m) is -1. Lines that are parallel have the same gradient, meaning they rise and fall at the same rate.

To write the equation of a new line parallel to y = -x + 2, we keep the gradient the same, which is -1. The general form of the equation for any line parallel to y = -x + 2 will be y = -x + c, where c can be any constant. This constant c represents the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

For example, if you want a line parallel to y = -x + 2 that passes through the point (3, 4), you substitute x = 3 and y = 4 into the equation y = -x + c to find the new y-intercept.

So, 4 = -3 + c. Solving for c, we get c = 7. Therefore, the equation of the line parallel to y = -x + 2 that passes through (3, 4) is y = -x + 7.

Remember, the key is to keep the gradient the same and adjust the y-intercept to fit the specific conditions given in the problem.
