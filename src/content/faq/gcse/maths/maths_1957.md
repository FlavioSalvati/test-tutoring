To calculate the percentage of a part relative to a total, you can use a straightforward formula: divide the part by the total and then multiply the result by $100$.

Let's break this down step-by-step. Suppose you want to determine what percentage a specific part is of a total. Begin by dividing the part by the total. This operation yields a decimal value. For instance, if you have a part equal to $20$ out of a total of $50$, you would perform the calculation $20 \div 50$, which results in $0.4$.

Next, to convert this decimal into a percentage, you multiply it by $100$. In our example, $0.4$ multiplied by $100$ equals $40\%$. Thus, we conclude that $20$ is $40\%$ of $50$.

This method is applicable to any set of numbers. For example, if you have a part of $15$ out of a total of $60$, you would calculate $15 \div 60$, which gives you $0.25$. Then, by multiplying $0.25$ by $100$, you obtain $25\%$. Therefore, we can say that $15$ is $25\%$ of $60$.

To summarize, the formula can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Total}} \right) \times 100
$$

This simple formula allows you to quickly find the percentage of any given total. Practicing with various numbers will enhance your comfort and proficiency with this process.
