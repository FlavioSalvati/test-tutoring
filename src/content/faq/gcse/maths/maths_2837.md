The translation vector for moving a shape 7 units to the right and 2 units down is expressed as $(7, -2)$.

To elaborate, a translation vector provides a way to indicate how a shape shifts from one position to another on a coordinate plane. It is typically represented in the form $(x, y)$, where $x$ denotes the horizontal movement and $y$ denotes the vertical movement.

When we refer to "7 units to the right," we are indicating a movement of the shape 7 units in the positive $x$-direction, which is why the first component of our vector is $7$. Conversely, when we say "2 units down," we are moving the shape 2 units in the negative $y$-direction, leading to the second component of our vector being $-2$.

If we start with a point at coordinates $(a, b)$, applying the translation vector $(7, -2)$ results in new coordinates of $(a + 7, b - 2)$. This means you add $7$ to the $x$-coordinate and subtract $2$ from the $y$-coordinate.

For instance, if you have a point located at $(3, 4)$ and you apply the translation vector $(7, -2)$, the new position of the point will be calculated as follows: $(3 + 7, 4 - 2)$, which simplifies to $(10, 2)$. This translation method can be applied to any point or shape on the coordinate plane to move it according to the specified translation vector.
