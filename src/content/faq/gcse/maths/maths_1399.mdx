To calculate the height of a 3D triangle, you can apply Pythagoras' Theorem to the right-angled triangle that is formed within the structure.

Consider a 3D triangle, which is essentially a triangular face of a three-dimensional object, such as a pyramid. To determine its height, you need to identify a right-angled triangle embedded within this 3D shape. In this triangle, the height of the 3D triangle serves as one of its sides.

Begin by identifying the base of the triangular face and the point directly above the base, which together define the height. Letâ€™s denote the length of the base as $b$ and the slant height (the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle) as $s$. The height, represented by $h$, is the perpendicular distance from the base to the apex of the triangle.

According to Pythagoras' Theorem, which asserts that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ for any right-angled triangle, you can rearrange the equation to isolate the height. In this context, $a$ corresponds to the height $h$, $b$ represents half the base (since the height divides the base into two equal segments), and $c$ is the slant height $s$.

Thus, the relationship can be expressed as:

$$
h^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 = s^2
$$

To solve for $h$, rearrange the equation:

$$
h^2 = s^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2
$$

Finally, take the square root to obtain the height $h$:

$$
h = \sqrt{s^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
$$

This method allows you to effectively calculate the height of the 3D triangle using the lengths of the base and the slant height, employing Pythagoras' Theorem to analyze the right-angled triangle formed within the 3D figure.
