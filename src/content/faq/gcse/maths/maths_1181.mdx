The metric unit for measuring volume is the litre ($L$), with millilitres ($mL$) and cubic centimetres ($cm³$) also frequently used.

In the metric system, volume is primarily expressed in litres. One litre is equivalent to $1,000$ millilitres or $1,000$ cubic centimetres. This relationship simplifies conversions between these units. For instance, if you have $2,500$ millilitres of water, you can easily convert this to litres by dividing by $1,000$, resulting in $2.5$ litres.

Millilitres are typically used for smaller quantities of liquid, such as in cooking or when measuring medication. For example, a standard teaspoon of liquid holds approximately $5$ millilitres. Conversely, cubic centimetres are often employed in scientific contexts, particularly in chemistry and physics, where precise measurements are essential. Notably, one cubic centimetre is exactly equal to one millilitre, making these units interchangeable.

For larger volumes, we use kilolitres ($kL$), where $1$ kilolitre is equal to $1,000$ litres. This unit is particularly useful in scenarios such as measuring water usage in households or in industrial applications.

Understanding these units and how to convert between them is crucial for solving problems in GCSE Maths. For example, to convert $3$ litres to millilitres, you multiply by $1,000$, yielding $3,000$ millilitres. Similarly, to convert $500$ cubic centimetres to litres, you divide by $1,000$, resulting in $0.5$ litres.

By mastering these conversions and understanding the appropriate contexts for each unit, you will be well-equipped to tackle any volume-related questions in your exams.
