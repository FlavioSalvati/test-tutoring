The equation of a line that is parallel to $ y = x + 3 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 4) $ is given by $ y = x + 2 $.

To understand how we arrive at this result, let's first recall that parallel lines have identical gradients (or slopes). The line $ y = x + 3 $ can be expressed in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the gradient. In this case, we see that $ m = 1 $.

Since parallel lines have the same gradient, the line we are looking for will also have a gradient of $ 1 $. Using the general equation of a line, which is $ y = mx + c $, we can substitute $ m = 1 $ into this form, resulting in:

$$
y = x + c
$$

Next, we need to determine the value of $ c $, which represents the y-interceptâ€”the point where the line intersects the y-axis. We will use the point $ (2, 4) $, which lies on our desired line. By substituting $ x = 2 $ and $ y = 4 $ into the equation $ y = x + c $, we obtain:

$$
4 = 2 + c
$$

Solving for $ c $, we subtract $ 2 $ from both sides:

$$
c = 4 - 2
$$
$$
c = 2
$$

Thus, we conclude that the equation of the line parallel to $ y = x + 3 $ that passes through the point $ (2, 4) $ is:

$$
y = x + 2
$$

This newly derived line maintains the same gradient as the original line but has a different y-intercept, which guarantees that it is parallel and correctly intersects the specified point.
