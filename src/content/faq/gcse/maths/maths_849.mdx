To simplify the expression $4b + 6b - 2$, we start by combining like terms, resulting in $10b - 2$.

When simplifying algebraic expressions, the initial step is to identify and combine like terms. Like terms are defined as terms that share the same variable raised to the same power. In the expression $4b + 6b - 2$, the terms $4b$ and $6b$ are considered like terms because they both include the variable $b$ raised to the first power.

To combine these like terms, we add their coefficients, which are the numerical parts in front of the variables. Specifically, we sum $4$ and $6$ to obtain $10$. Consequently, we have $10b$. The term $-2$ is a constant and does not contain any variable, so it remains unchanged in the expression.

Thus, the simplified form of the expression $4b + 6b - 2$ is $10b - 2$. This process of combining like terms is essential, as it simplifies the expression, making it more manageable for solving equations or further manipulation.
