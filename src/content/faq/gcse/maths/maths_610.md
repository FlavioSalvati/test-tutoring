The lower quartile, often referred to as the first quartile or $Q_1$, in a cumulative frequency graph represents the value below which 25% of the data falls.

A cumulative frequency graph displays data in a manner that illustrates the cumulative totals of frequencies up to each data point. To determine the lower quartile, you need to identify the point at which 25% of your total data is located. This process begins by calculating the total number of data points and then finding 25% of that total.

For instance, if you have a dataset consisting of 100 points, calculating 25% of 100 yields $25$. You would then examine the cumulative frequency graph to locate the value that corresponds to a cumulative frequency of $25$. This value signifies the lower quartile. If the cumulative frequency graph has been plotted accurately, you can draw a horizontal line from the cumulative frequency of $25$ to intersect the curve, and subsequently drop a vertical line down to the x-axis to find the corresponding data value.

Understanding the lower quartile is crucial as it aids in analyzing the spread and distribution of your data. It provides insight into where the lower 25% of your data is positioned, which is valuable for various statistical analyses, including the identification of outliers and the overall comprehension of distribution patterns.
