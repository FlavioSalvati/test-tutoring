The total amount after applying a 10% discount on £100 is £90.

To calculate the total after a 10% discount on £100, it is essential to understand how percentage discounts work. A 10% discount means that you are reducing the original price by 10%. To determine 10% of £100, you multiply £100 by $0.10$, since $10\%$ can be expressed as $\frac{10}{100}$ or $0.10$.

Thus, we have:

$$
£100 \times 0.10 = £10
$$

This amount, £10, represents the discount.

Next, to find the final price, you subtract the discount from the original price:

$$
£100 - £10 = £90
$$

Therefore, after applying a 10% discount to £100, the total amount you would pay is £90. 

This method is applicable for calculating any percentage discount on any original price. Simply convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing it by $100$, multiply this decimal by the original price to find the discount, and then subtract the discount from the original price to arrive at the final total.
