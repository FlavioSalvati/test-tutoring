To find the equation of a line that is parallel to $ y = x - 4 $ and passes through the point $ (3, 5) $, we can derive it as follows:

First, let's recall that parallel lines share the same slope (or gradient). The equation $ y = x - 4 $ is expressed in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope. In this case, the slope $ m $ is $1$, as indicated by the coefficient of $ x $.

Since we are looking for a line that is parallel to the given line, it will also have a slope of $1$. Therefore, the equation of our desired line can be expressed in the form:

$$
y = x + c
$$

where $ c $ is a constant that we need to determine. 

Now, we will use the point $ (3, 5) $, through which the line passes, to find the value of $ c $. We substitute $ x = 3 $ and $ y = 5 $ into the equation $ y = x + c $:

$$
5 = 3 + c
$$

To solve for $ c $, we rearrange the equation:

$$
c = 5 - 3
$$
$$
c = 2
$$

Thus, the equation of the line that is parallel to $ y = x - 4 $ and passes through the point $ (3, 5) $ is:

$$
y = x + 2
$$

This approach guarantees that our new line maintains the same slope as the original line, ensuring they are parallel, while also passing through the specified point, fulfilling the given conditions.
