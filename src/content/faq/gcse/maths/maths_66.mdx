When performing subtraction operations with numbers in standard form, it's essential to confirm that both numbers bear the same power of 10 before proceeding. 

Numbers in standard form are commonly presented as $a \times 10^n$, where the coefficient $a$ is a number between 1 and 10, and $n$ is an integer representing the exponent. To effectively subtract two numbers in this form, we first ensure that both numbers share the same exponent. 

For instance, if we were to subtract $2 \times 10^3$ from $3 \times 10^4$, we would first need to adjust the numbers such that they both have the same exponent. This could be achieved by rewriting $2 \times 10^3$ as $0.2 \times 10^4$. Consequently, the numbers, now sharing the same power of 10, become $3 \times 10^4$ and $0.2 \times 10^4$. 

We then proceed to subtract the coefficients (the numbers preceding the powers of 10), calculating $3 - 0.2$ to yield $2.8$. As a result, the outcome of the subtraction operation becomes $2.8 \times 10^4$.

In cases where the numbers are already expressed with the same power of 10, the subtraction operation can be performed directly on the coefficients. An example would be subtracting $5.6 \times 10^7$ from $8.3 \times 10^7$, which involves merely calculating $8.3 - 5.6$ to get $2.7$, hence giving a result of $2.7 \times 10^7$.

In conclusion, the critical steps in subtracting numbers in standard form involve verifying that the exponents are the same and then subtracting the coefficients. This approach simplifies the process, making it easily manageable.
