To determine the area ratio of similar shapes, you need to square the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

When working with similar shapes, two important properties hold: their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding side lengths are proportional. This means that if you know the ratio of the side lengths of two similar shapes, you can easily compute the ratio of their areas. For example, if the ratio of the side lengths of two similar shapes is given as $a:b$, then the area ratio can be calculated by squaring this ratio, resulting in an area ratio of $a^2:b^2$.

For instance, consider two similar triangles with side lengths in the ratio of $3:4$. To find the area ratio, you would calculate $3^2:4^2$, which simplifies to $9:16$. This principle is applicable to all types of similar shapes, including triangles, rectangles, and other polygons.

Grasping this concept is essential as it enables you to solve various problems involving similar shapes. For example, if you know the area of one shape and the ratio of their side lengths, you can easily determine the area of the other shape. This approach is particularly beneficial in geometry problems and practical applications, such as map scaling and model construction.

Remember, the key takeaway is that the area ratio is the square of the side length ratio. This straightforward yet powerful concept can greatly enhance your ability to tackle questions in your GCSE Maths exams with confidence.
