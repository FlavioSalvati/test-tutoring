To multiply $3 \times 10^4$ by $2 \times 10^{-3}$, we will first multiply the coefficients and then add the exponents of the powers of 10.

When working with numbers in scientific notation, we separate the process into two parts: handling the coefficients (the numeric parts) and the powers of 10. In this case, the coefficients are $3$ and $2$. We start by multiplying these coefficients:

$$
3 \times 2 = 6.
$$

Next, we address the powers of 10. The exponents are $4$ and $-3$. When multiplying powers of 10, we add the exponents together:

$$
10^4 \times 10^{-3} = 10^{4 + (-3)} = 10^{1}.
$$

Now we combine the results from the coefficients and the powers of 10:

$$
6 \times 10^1.
$$

Since $10^1$ is simply $10$, the final result is:

$$
6 \times 10 = 60.
$$

Therefore, multiplying $3 \times 10^4$ by $2 \times 10^{-3}$ yields a final answer of $60$.
