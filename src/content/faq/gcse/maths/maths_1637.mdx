To label sectors in a pie chart, you have two primary options: adding labels directly onto the sectors or utilizing a legend.

When constructing a pie chart, each sector symbolizes a distinct category or segment of the entire dataset. One straightforward approach is to inscribe the name of each category directly on its corresponding sector. This method is intuitive and allows for immediate recognition of which sector correlates to which category. However, if the sectors are particularly small, the labels may not fit appropriately, leading to potential confusion.

An alternative and commonly used method is to employ a legend. A legend is typically a box situated alongside the pie chart that enumerates the categories, each paired with a color or pattern that corresponds to its respective sector. This approach helps maintain a clean and uncluttered appearance for the pie chart while still conveying all essential information. Each color or pattern in the legend directly relates to a sector in the pie chart, facilitating easy identification of category representation.

Furthermore, you can enhance clarity by including the percentage or value represented by each sector, either within the sector itself or adjacent to the labels in the legend. This additional information provides a clearer understanding of the proportion that each category contributes to the whole. For instance, if a sector accounts for $25\%$ of the data, you can denote "25%" on the sector or within the legend.

By employing these labeling methods, you can effectively communicate the information contained within a pie chart, ensuring it is easy to read and comprehend the data presented.
