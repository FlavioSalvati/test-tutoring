To create a time series graph, you need to plot data points on a coordinate system, where time is represented on the x-axis and the corresponding values are plotted on the y-axis.

A time series graph effectively displays data collected or recorded at specific time intervals. To begin, gather a dataset that includes both time and corresponding values. For instance, you might have data showing the temperature recorded at noon each day over the course of a month.

Start by drawing your axes. The horizontal axis, known as the x-axis, represents time, which can be measured in days, months, years, or any other relevant time unit. The vertical axis, or y-axis, represents the values being measured, such as temperature, sales figures, or population counts.

Next, label your axes clearly. Be sure to include the units of measurement, such as 'days' on the x-axis and 'degrees Celsius' on the y-axis. This labeling is crucial for helping anyone who views the graph understand what the data represents.

Now, proceed to plot your data points. For each time value, identify the corresponding value and place a dot at the intersection of these two points on the graph. For example, if the temperature on day 1 was $20^\circ \text{C}$, you would place a dot where '1' on the x-axis meets '20' on the y-axis.

Once all your data points have been plotted, connect them with straight lines. This connection visually illustrates trends over time, allowing you to see whether the temperature is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable.

Finally, provide your graph with a title that succinctly describes the data being represented. An example might be "Daily Noon Temperatures in July." A clear title enhances the graph's readability, making it easier for viewers to grasp the information at a glance.
