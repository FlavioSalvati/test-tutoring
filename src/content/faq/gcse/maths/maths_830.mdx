To rationalize the denominator of the expression $ \frac{4}{\sqrt{7}} $, we will multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $ \sqrt{7} $.

Rationalizing the denominator involves removing any square roots or irrational numbers from the denominator of a fraction. In this instance, the denominator is $ \sqrt{7} $, which is indeed an irrational number. To eliminate the square root, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $ \sqrt{7} $. This method relies on the mathematical property that states $ \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a} = a $.

Starting with the fraction $ \frac{4}{\sqrt{7}} $, we proceed by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by $ \sqrt{7} $:

$$ 
\frac{4}{\sqrt{7}} \times \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{4 \times \sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}} 
$$

In the numerator, the expression $ 4 \times \sqrt{7} $ simplifies to $ 4\sqrt{7} $. Meanwhile, in the denominator, we have $ \sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7} $, which simplifies to $ 7 $, since $ \sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7} = 7 $.

Thus, the fraction now appears as follows:

$$ 
\frac{4\sqrt{7}}{7} 
$$

This represents the rationalized form of $ \frac{4}{\sqrt{7}} $. The denominator is now a rational number, making the fraction more manageable for subsequent calculations.
