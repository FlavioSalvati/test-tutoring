To determine the original amount prior to a percentage decrease, you can divide the decreased amount by $1$ minus the percentage decrease.

When an amount has been reduced by a specific percentage, you can reverse the calculation to find the original value. Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose you have an item that costs £80 after experiencing a $20\%$ reduction. To find the original price, it's important to recognize that the £80 now reflects $80\%$ of the original price (since $100\% - 20\% = 80\%$).

First, convert the percentage decrease into a decimal. For a $20\%$ decrease, you convert $20\%$ to $0.20$. Next, subtract this decimal from $1$ (which represents $100\%$). Thus, $1 - 0.20 = 0.80$. This indicates that the current price is $80\%$ of the original price.

Now, to find the original amount, take the decreased amount (£80) and divide it by $0.80$. This calculation yields the original price before the decrease:

$$
\text{Original Price} = \frac{£80}{0.80} = £100.
$$

Therefore, the original price of the item was £100.

In summary, the formula to calculate the original amount $O$ after a percentage decrease is given by:

$$
O = \frac{\text{Decreased Amount}}{1 - \text{Percentage Decrease (as a decimal)}}.
$$

By utilizing this method, you can effectively determine the original amount before any percentage decrease, making it a valuable tool for everyday scenarios such as sales and discounts.
