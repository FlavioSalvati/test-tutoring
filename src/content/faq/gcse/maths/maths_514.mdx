The probability of an event $ A $ is denoted as $ P(A) $.

In the field of probability, $ P(A) $ represents the likelihood of event $ A $ occurring. The letter "P" signifies probability, while the specific event is enclosed in parentheses. For instance, if you roll a fair six-sided die and wish to determine the probability of rolling a 3, you would express this as $ P(\text{rolling a 3}) $.

To compute the probability of an event, you can use the following formula:

$$ 
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} 
$$

Consider a scenario where you have a bag containing 5 red balls and 3 blue balls, and you want to calculate the probability of selecting a red ball. In this case, the number of favorable outcomes (picking a red ball) is 5, while the total number of possible outcomes (picking any ball) is 8. Thus, the probability of selecting a red ball can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
P(\text{red ball}) = \frac{5}{8} 
$$

This notation and methodology can be applied to a wide variety of events, whether you are drawing a card from a deck, flipping a coin, or exploring any other situation where you need to assess the likelihood of a specific outcome. Mastering this notation is essential for effectively solving probability problems and accurately interpreting the results.
