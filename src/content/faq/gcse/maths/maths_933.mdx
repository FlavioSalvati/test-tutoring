The graph of the function $ y = e^{-x} $ represents a decreasing exponential curve that approaches zero as $ x $ increases.

To elaborate, the graph begins at the point $ (0, 1) $ when $ x = 0 $. This occurs because any number raised to the power of zero equals one, which means $ e^0 = 1 $. As $ x $ increases, the value of $ y $ declines rapidly but never actually reaches zero. This phenomenon occurs because the exponential function $ e^{-x} $ continuously decreases, approaching zero without ever intersecting the x-axis. This behavior is described as asymptotic, indicating that the graph gets infinitely close to a specific line but does not make contact with it.

For negative values of $ x $, the graph rises sharply. When $ x $ is negative, $ -x $ becomes positive, and since $ e $ (approximately equal to 2.718) is greater than 1, raising it to a positive power yields a large value. Consequently, as $ x $ becomes more negative, the function $ y = e^{-x} $ increases exponentially.

Overall, the shape of the graph is a smooth and continuous curve that starts high on the left side (for negative values of $ x $), passes through the point $ (0, 1) $, and gradually decreases toward zero as $ x $ extends to the right. This characteristic shape is emblematic of exponential decay functions, where the rate of decrease is proportional to the current value of the function itself.
