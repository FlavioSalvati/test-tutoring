The expanded form of the expression $ 4(x - 2) $ is $ 4x - 8 $.

To expand the expression $ 4(x - 2) $, we utilize the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction. This property states that for any numbers $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, the expression $ a(b - c) $ can be expressed as $ ab - ac $. In our case, the number $ 4 $ is multiplied by each term inside the parentheses, specifically $ x $ and $ -2 $.

We begin by multiplying $ 4 $ by $ x $, which yields $ 4x $. Next, we multiply $ 4 $ by $ -2 $, resulting in $ -8 $. When we combine these two products, we arrive at the expanded form: 

$$
4x - 8
$$

This process is fundamental in algebra, as it allows for the simplification of expressions and the resolution of equations. By expanding expressions, you can more efficiently combine like terms and perform various algebraic operations. It is crucial to remember that each term inside the parentheses must be multiplied by the number outside.
