To create a scatter plot that effectively illustrates the correlation between two variables, follow these steps:

**1. Gather Your Data:**  
Start by collecting pairs of values for the two variables you wish to analyze. For example, if you are investigating the relationship between hours studied and exam scores, each pair should consist of one value representing hours studied and a corresponding value for the exam score.

**2. Set Up Your Graph:**  
Draw a graph with two perpendicular axes. Label the horizontal axis (the x-axis) with one variable, such as hours studied, and the vertical axis (the y-axis) with the other variable, such as exam scores. Ensure that each axis has a scale that adequately covers the range of your data.

**3. Plot Your Data Points:**  
For each pair of values, plot a point on the graph. For instance, if a student studied for $3$ hours and scored $75$, locate $3$ on the x-axis and $75$ on the y-axis, then place a dot at the intersection of these two values.

**4. Analyze the Pattern:**  
After plotting all data points, examine the overall pattern they form. If the points tend to rise together, this indicates a positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, so does the other. Conversely, if the points tend to fall together, a negative correlation is suggested, indicating that as one variable increases, the other decreases. If the points appear scattered with no discernible pattern, this may suggest a lack of correlation.

**5. Draw a Line of Best Fit (Optional):**  
If the data points suggest a linear relationship, consider drawing a line of best fit. This line visually represents the overall trend in the data and can be used to make predictions based on the observed relationship.

By following these steps, you can effectively construct a scatter plot that showcases the correlation between two variables, making it easier to interpret and analyze the data at hand.
