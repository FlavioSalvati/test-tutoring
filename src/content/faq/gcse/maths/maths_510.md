A vector $ \mathbf{l} $ is characterized by its magnitude and the angle it forms with a reference direction.

To elaborate, a vector is a quantity that possesses both magnitude (or size) and direction. To express vector $ \mathbf{l} $ using its magnitude and direction, you need two essential pieces of information: the length of the vector (its magnitude) and the angle it makes with a reference direction, which is typically the positive x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system.

The magnitude of vector $ \mathbf{l} $ is denoted as $ |\mathbf{l}| $ and can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem, provided you know its components. For instance, if vector $ \mathbf{l} $ has components $ l_x $ and $ l_y $ along the x and y axes, respectively, its magnitude is computed as:

$$
|\mathbf{l}| = \sqrt{l_x^2 + l_y^2}.
$$

The direction of vector $ \mathbf{l} $ is indicated by the angle $ \theta $ that it makes with the positive x-axis. This angle can be calculated using trigonometric functions, specifically the tangent function:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{l_y}{l_x} \right).
$$

This angle is typically measured in either degrees or radians.

Thus, if you know the magnitude $ |\mathbf{l}| $ and the angle $ \theta $, you can completely describe the vector $ \mathbf{l} $. This representation is particularly valuable in fields such as physics and engineering, where a comprehensive understanding of both the size and direction of a vector is essential.
