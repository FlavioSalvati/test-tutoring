Enlarging a triangle by a scale factor of 4 results in a new triangle where each side is four times longer than the corresponding side of the original triangle.

When a triangle is enlarged by a scale factor of 4, every side of the original triangle is multiplied by $4$. For instance, if the original triangle has sides measuring $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, and $5 \, \text{cm}$, the enlarged triangle will have sides measuring $12 \, \text{cm}$, $16 \, \text{cm}$, and $20 \, \text{cm}$. This indicates that while the shape of the triangle remains constant, its size increases significantly.

In addition to the side lengths, other properties of the triangle are also influenced by the enlargement. Specifically, the area of the triangle increases by the square of the scale factor. Given that the scale factor is $4$, the area of the enlarged triangle will be $4^2$, or $16$ times larger than that of the original triangle. Therefore, if the original triangle has an area of $6 \, \text{cm}^2$, the area of the enlarged triangle would be $96 \, \text{cm}^2$.

It's important to note that the angles within the triangle remain unchanged during the enlargement, as this process does not affect angle measurements. Consequently, the enlarged triangle is similar to the original triangle, preserving the same shape while differing in size. This concept is fundamental in understanding similarity and scale factors in geometry, which are frequently assessed in GCSE Mathematics.

Grasping the principles of scale factors is valuable for various real-life applications, such as creating models or maps where accurate enlargements or reductions are essential. By mastering these concepts, you will be better equipped to solve problems involving similar shapes and proportional reasoning effectively.
