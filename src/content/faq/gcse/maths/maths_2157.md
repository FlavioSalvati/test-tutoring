To solve the inequality $ 6x - 2 < 10 $, we will isolate $ x $ by performing inverse operations systematically.

First, we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the inequality. We can achieve this by adding $ 2 $ to both sides:

$$
6x - 2 + 2 < 10 + 2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
6x < 12
$$

Next, we must isolate $ x $ by removing the coefficient $ 6 $. We do this by dividing both sides of the inequality by $ 6 $:

$$
\frac{6x}{6} < \frac{12}{6}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x < 2
$$

Thus, the solution to the inequality $ 6x - 2 < 10 $ is $ x < 2 $. This indicates that any value of $ x $ that is less than $ 2 $ will satisfy the inequality.

To verify our solution, we can substitute a value less than $ 2 $ back into the original inequality to see if it holds true. For instance, if we substitute $ x = 1 $:

$$
6(1) - 2 < 10
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
6 - 2 < 10
$$

Which further simplifies to:

$$
4 < 10
$$

Since this statement is true, it confirms that our solution $ x < 2 $ is indeed correct.
