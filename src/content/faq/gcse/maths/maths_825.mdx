To simplify the expression $\sqrt{32}$, we find that its simplified form is $4\sqrt{2}$.

To begin the simplification process, we identify the prime factors of $32$. Notably, $32$ can be expressed as $2^5$, which indicates that $32 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$. When simplifying square roots, we focus on pairs of prime factors, as the square root of a pair of identical factors simplifies to just one of those factors.

For $32$, we can group the factors into pairs: $(2 \times 2)$ and $(2 \times 2)$, leaving one factor of $2$ unpaired. Each pair of $2$s can be extracted from the square root as a single $2$. Therefore, we can express $\sqrt{32}$ as follows:

$$
\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{(2 \times 2) \times (2 \times 2) \times 2} = \sqrt{4 \times 4 \times 2}.
$$

Since the square root of $4$ is $2$, we can further simplify this expression:

$$
\sqrt{4 \times 4 \times 2} = 2 \times 2 \times \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}.
$$

Thus, the simplified form of $\sqrt{32}$ is $4\sqrt{2}$. This method of breaking down a number into its prime factors and simplifying the square root is a valuable technique for working with square roots in general.
