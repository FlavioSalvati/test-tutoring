The area of the triangle is $12\sqrt{3}$ square centimetres.

To calculate the area of a triangle when you know two sides and the included angle, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(C)
$$

In this formula, $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the two sides, while $C$ is the measure of the included angle. In our example, the lengths of the sides are $8$ cm and $6$ cm, and the included angle is $60^\circ$.

First, we will substitute the known values into the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 \times \sin(60^\circ)
$$

Next, we need to calculate $\sin(60^\circ)$. The sine of $60^\circ$ is given by:

$$
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

Now, we can substitute $\sin(60^\circ)$ back into the area formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

Now, let's simplify this expression step by step:

1. Start with the initial calculation:
   $$
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   $$

2. Calculate $8 \times 6$, which equals $48$:
   $$
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   $$

3. Now, multiply $\frac{1}{2} \times 48$ to get $24$:
   $$
   \text{Area} = 24 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   $$

4. Finally, divide $24$ by $2$ to arrive at $12$:
   $$
   \text{Area} = 12\sqrt{3}
   $$

Therefore, the area of the triangle is $12\sqrt{3}$ square centimetres.
