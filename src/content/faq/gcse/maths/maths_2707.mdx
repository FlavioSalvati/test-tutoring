To determine the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides measuring $8 \, \text{cm}$ and $15 \, \text{cm}$, we can apply Pythagoras' Theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

Here, $ c $ represents the hypotenuse, while $ a $ and $ b $ denote the lengths of the other two sides.

In our example, we can assign the values $ a = 8 \, \text{cm} $ and $ b = 15 \, \text{cm} $. Using Pythagoras' Theorem, we can calculate $ c $ as follows:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

Substituting in the values we have:

$$
c^2 = 8^2 + 15^2
$$
$$
c^2 = 64 + 225
$$
$$
c^2 = 289
$$

To find $ c $, we take the square root of $289$:

$$
c = \sqrt{289}
$$
$$
c = 17
$$

Thus, the hypotenuse of the triangle measures $17 \, \text{cm}$. This application of Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in GCSE Mathematics and is crucial for solving problems related to right-angled triangles. Remember to confirm that the triangle is indeed right-angled before employing Pythagoras' Theorem.
