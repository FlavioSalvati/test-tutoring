To express the ratio $3:4$ as a fraction, you can write it as 

$$\frac{3}{4}.$$

A ratio is a comparison between two quantities, illustrating the relative size of one quantity in relation to another. Specifically, the ratio $3:4$ signifies that for every $3$ units of the first quantity, there are $4$ units of the second quantity. To convert this ratio into a fraction, you arrange the first number ($3$) as the numerator and the second number ($4$) as the denominator, resulting in the fraction 

$$\frac{3}{4}.$$

Fractions serve as a means to represent parts of a whole. In the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, the numerator ($3$) indicates the number of parts you possess, while the denominator ($4$) denotes the total number of equal parts into which the whole is divided. Therefore, $\frac{3}{4}$ means you have $3$ out of $4$ equal parts.

Understanding how to convert ratios to fractions is valuable in various fields of mathematics, including proportions, probability, and algebra. This skill allows for greater flexibility in working with quantities, making it easier to perform calculations and solve problems. For instance, if you know the ratio of boys to girls in a class is $3:4$, you can express this as 

$$\frac{3}{4}$$ 

to determine the fraction of the class that consists of boys.
