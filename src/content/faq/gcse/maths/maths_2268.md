The gradient of the function $ y = \tan(x) $ at the point $ x = \frac{\pi}{4} $ is equal to $2$.

To determine the gradient at a specific point on the curve, we first need to differentiate the function. The derivative of $ \tan(x) $ is given by $ \sec^2(x) $. This derivative indicates how the function varies at any point $ x $.

Next, we evaluate the derivative at $ x = \frac{\pi}{4} $. The secant function, $ \sec(x) $, is defined as the reciprocal of the cosine function: 

$$
\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}.
$$

At $ x = \frac{\pi}{4} $, the cosine value is 

$$
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$ 

Thus, we can calculate $ \sec\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) $ as follows:

$$
\sec\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{2}.
$$

Now, to find $ \sec^2\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) $, we square the value we just obtained:

$$
\sec^2\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2.
$$ 

Consequently, the gradient of the function $ y = \tan(x) $ at $ x = \frac{\pi}{4} $ is $2$.

In simpler terms, the gradient represents the steepness of the tangent line to the curve at that specific point. For the function $ y = \tan(x) $ at $ x = \frac{\pi}{4} $, the steepness or rate of change is $2$. This implies that for a small increment in $ x $ near $ \frac{\pi}{4} $, the corresponding change in $ y $ will be approximately twice as large.
