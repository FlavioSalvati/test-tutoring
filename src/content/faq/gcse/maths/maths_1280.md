To determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, you can apply Pythagoras' Theorem, which is expressed as:

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry specifically applicable to right-angled triangles. In such triangles, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle and is always the longest side. The theorem asserts that the square of the hypotenuse's length ($c$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two other sides ($a$ and $b$). This relationship is mathematically represented as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

To find the length of the hypotenuse, you can follow these straightforward steps:

1. **Square the lengths of the two shorter sides**: If the lengths of these sides are denoted as $a$ and $b$, compute $a^2$ and $b^2$.
2. **Sum the squares**: Add the results from the previous step to obtain $a^2 + b^2$.
3. **Calculate the square root**: Finally, take the square root of the sum obtained in the previous step to find the length of the hypotenuse, denoted as $c$.

For instance, consider a triangle where one side measures 3 units and the other side measures 4 units. The calculations would proceed as follows:

$$
3^2 = 9
$$
$$
4^2 = 16
$$
$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$
$$
\sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 units. This method is applicable to any right-angled triangle, making it a reliable approach for calculating the hypotenuse length.
