The angle formed by an arc at the center of a circle is known as the central angle.

To elaborate, the central angle is created at the center of the circle by two radii that extend to the endpoints of the arc. Consider a circle with a point at its center, designated as $O$. If you draw two lines from $O$ to any two points on the circumference of the circle, these lines are the radii of the circle. The angle between these two radii represents the central angle.

The magnitude of the central angle is directly proportional to the length of the arc it subtends. For instance, if the arc completes a full circle, the central angle measures $360$ degrees. Conversely, if the arc represents half of the circle, the central angle measures $180$ degrees. For smaller arcs, the central angle will be proportionally less. For example, if the arc accounts for one-quarter of the circle, the central angle will be $90$ degrees.

To compute the central angle in degrees, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Central Angle} = \left( \frac{\text{Arc Length}}{\text{Circumference}} \right) \times 360
$$

In this formula, the circumference of the circle is calculated as $2\pi r$, where $r$ denotes the radius of the circle. This equation illustrates how the arc length and the radius of the circle together determine the central angle.

Grasping the concept of the central angle is essential for tackling various problems in geometry, particularly those involving circles, sectors, and arcs. Moreover, it serves as a foundational concept for more advanced subjects, such as trigonometry and calculus.
