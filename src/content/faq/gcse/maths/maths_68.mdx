When performing addition operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation, it's generally more straightforward if they share the same exponent in their powers of ten. 

Consider the numbers $2 \times 10^4$ and $3 \times 10^3$. In this case, observe that $10^4$ can also be expressed as $10 \times 10^3$. Therefore, by applying this conversion, we can rewrite $2 \times 10^4$ as $2 \times 10 \times 10^3$. This expression simplifies to $20 \times 10^3$.

Following this transformation, we now have two numbers, $20 \times 10^3$ and $3 \times 10^3$, which share a common power of ten. This allows us to directly add the coefficients (the numbers preceding the powers of ten).

Hence, the addition operation $20 \times 10^3 + 3 \times 10^3$ simplifies to $(20 + 3) \times 10^3 = 23 \times 10^3$.

Finally, you can either retain the answer as $23 \times 10^3$ or, if necessary, convert it back to standard form. In standard form, the result would be 23,000.
