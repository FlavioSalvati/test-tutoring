The position vector of a point in two-dimensional space is expressed as 

$$ 
\mathbf{r} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} 
$$ 

where $ x $ and $ y $ represent the coordinates of the point. 

To elaborate, a position vector is a method of specifying the location of a point using vector notation. Vectors are characterized by both magnitude and direction. In this expression, $ \mathbf{i} $ and $ \mathbf{j} $ are unit vectors: $ \mathbf{i} $ indicates the direction along the x-axis, while $ \mathbf{j} $ indicates the direction along the y-axis.

For any point with coordinates $ (x, y) $, its position vector can be written as 

$$ 
\mathbf{r} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} 
$$ 

In this vector, $ x $ denotes the component in the x-direction, and $ y $ denotes the component in the y-direction. For instance, if a point is located at $ (3, 4) $, its position vector would be 

$$ 
\mathbf{r} = 3\mathbf{i} + 4\mathbf{j} 
$$ 

This vector notation is particularly valuable in fields such as physics and engineering, as it clearly illustrates how much of the vector is directed along each axis. It also facilitates various vector operations, including addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication. 

For example, consider another point with coordinates $ (1, 2) $. The position vector for this point would be 

$$ 
\mathbf{r} = 1\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{j} 
$$ 

When you add the position vectors of the two points, you get 

$$ 
(3\mathbf{i} + 4\mathbf{j}) + (1\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{j}) = 4\mathbf{i} + 6\mathbf{j} 
$$ 

Mastering the representation and manipulation of position vectors is a fundamental skill in GCSE Mathematics, as it aids in solving a wide range of problems related to geometry and motion.
