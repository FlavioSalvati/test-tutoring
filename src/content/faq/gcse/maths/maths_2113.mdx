The fourth root of $16$ is $2$.

To determine the fourth root of $16$, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself four times, equals $16$. This is mathematically expressed as $ \sqrt[4]{16} $.

Let's start by examining the prime factorization of $16$. The number can be expressed in terms of its prime factors as follows:

$$
16 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^4.
$$

Since we are seeking the fourth root, we need to identify a number that, when raised to the power of $4$, equals $16$.

In this case, we find that 

$$
2^4 = 16.
$$ 

Therefore, the fourth root of $16$ is indeed $2$, as demonstrated by the multiplication:

$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16.
$$ 

Another way to understand this concept is through exponents. The fourth root of a number can also be represented as raising that number to the power of $ \frac{1}{4} $. Therefore, we can express $ \sqrt[4]{16} $ as 

$$
16^{\frac{1}{4}}.
$$ 

Utilizing a calculator or recognizing that 

$$
16^{\frac{1}{4}} = (2^4)^{\frac{1}{4}},
$$ 

we can simplify this expression:

$$
(2^4)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{4 \times \frac{1}{4}} = 2^1 = 2.
$$ 

Thus, we confirm that the fourth root of $16$ is $2$.
