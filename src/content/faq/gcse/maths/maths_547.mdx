The probability of rolling a double six with two dice is given by the fraction $\frac{1}{36}$.

When rolling two six-sided dice, each die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6. To calculate the probability of a specific outcome, such as rolling a double six, we need to consider both the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.

Each die operates independently, meaning that the result of one die does not influence the result of the other. Consequently, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is calculated as $6$ (the number of faces on the first die) multiplied by $6$ (the number of faces on the second die), which results in a total of $36$ possible outcomes.

A double six occurs only when both dice show the number $6$. There is only one combination that yields a double six: $(6, 6)$. Since there is just one favorable outcome out of the $36$ possible outcomes, the probability of rolling a double six can be expressed as $\frac{1}{36}$.

In decimal form, this probability is approximately $0.0278$, and as a percentage, it translates to about $2.78\%$. This implies that if you roll two dice a total of $36$ times, you can expect to roll a double six roughly once. Understanding these probabilities is essential in games and scenarios involving dice, as it provides a clearer insight into the likelihood of various outcomes.
