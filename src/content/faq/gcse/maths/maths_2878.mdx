The vector that represents the movement from the point $(1, 1)$ to the point $(4, 5)$ can be expressed as $(3, 4)$.

To determine the vector from one point to another, you subtract the coordinates of the starting point from the coordinates of the ending point. In this scenario, the starting point is $(1, 1)$ and the ending point is $(4, 5)$.

First, letâ€™s examine the x-coordinates. The x-coordinate of the ending point is $4$, while the x-coordinate of the starting point is $1$. To find the difference, subtract the starting x-coordinate from the ending x-coordinate:

$$
4 - 1 = 3.
$$

Next, we consider the y-coordinates. The y-coordinate of the ending point is $5$, and the y-coordinate of the starting point is $1$. Again, we subtract the starting y-coordinate from the ending y-coordinate:

$$
5 - 1 = 4.
$$

Thus, the vector from $(1, 1)$ to $(4, 5)$ is represented as $(3, 4)$. This indicates that to travel from the point $(1, 1)$ to the point $(4, 5)$, one must move $3$ units to the right (along the x-axis) and $4$ units upward (along the y-axis).

Vectors play a significant role in various fields of mathematics and physics, as they convey both the direction and magnitude of a movement. In this example, the vector $(3, 4)$ precisely indicates how far and in which direction you need to move to transition from the starting point to the ending point.
