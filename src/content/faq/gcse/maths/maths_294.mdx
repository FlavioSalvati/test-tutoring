To write the equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by the equation $y = x + 5$, you need to maintain the same gradient while selecting a different y-intercept.

The equation of a line can be expressed in slope-intercept form as $y = mx + c$, where $m$ denotes the gradient (or slope) and $c$ represents the y-intercept. For the line $y = x + 5$, the gradient $m$ is equal to $1$, and the y-intercept $c$ is equal to $5$.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same gradient. This means that any line parallel to $y = x + 5$ will also have a gradient of $1$. The only aspect that will vary is the y-intercept $c$. Therefore, the equation of any line parallel to $y = x + 5$ can be expressed in the form:

$$
y = x + c
$$

where $c$ can take any real number value.

For instance, if you select $c = 3$, the corresponding equation of the parallel line would be:

$$
y = x + 3.
$$

Alternatively, if you choose $c = -2$, the equation would then be:

$$
y = x - 2.
$$

In essence, you have the freedom to choose any value for $c$ to generate a different parallel line.

To summarize, to formulate the equation of a line that is parallel to $y = x + 5$, simply retain the gradient of $1$ and adjust the y-intercept $c$ to any other value.
