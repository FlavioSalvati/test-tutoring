To determine the height of a triangle using Pythagoras' Theorem, you can form a right-angled triangle within the given triangle.

Pythagoras' Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed with the formula:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Here, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the other two sides.

For example, if you have a right-angled triangle and you know the lengths of the hypotenuse and one of the other sides, you can rearrange the formula to calculate the unknown side, which could be the height. Suppose the hypotenuse $c$ measures $10 \, \text{cm}$ and one side $a$ measures $6 \, \text{cm}$. To find the height $b$, you rearrange the formula to:

$$
b^2 = c^2 - a^2
$$

Substituting the known values, we find:

$$
b^2 = 10^2 - 6^2 = 100 - 36 = 64
$$

Taking the square root of both sides yields:

$$
b = \sqrt{64} = 8 \, \text{cm}
$$

In instances where the triangle is not right-angled, you can often drop a perpendicular from one vertex to the opposite side, thereby creating two right-angled triangles. Pythagoras' Theorem can then be applied to one of these right-angled triangles to find the height.

For instance, consider an isosceles triangle with a base measuring $8 \, \text{cm}$ and equal sides measuring $5 \, \text{cm}$. Dropping a perpendicular from the top vertex to the midpoint of the base divides the base into two segments of $4 \, \text{cm}$. This setup results in two right-angled triangles, each having a hypotenuse of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and one leg measuring $4 \, \text{cm}$. 

Using Pythagoras' Theorem, the height $h$ can be calculated as follows:

$$
h^2 = 5^2 - 4^2 = 25 - 16 = 9
$$

Taking the square root gives:

$$
h = \sqrt{9} = 3 \, \text{cm}
$$

Thus, the height of the triangle is $3 \, \text{cm}$.
