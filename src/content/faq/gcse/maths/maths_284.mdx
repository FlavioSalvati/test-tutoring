To determine the equation of a line that passes through the point $(3, 4)$ with a slope of $2$, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is given by:

$$ y = mx + c $$

In this formula, $m$ represents the slope and $c$ denotes the y-intercept. Here, we know that the slope $m = 2$ and we have a point on the line, $(3, 4)$. We will substitute these values into the equation to solve for $c$.

First, we substitute the slope $m = 2$ into the slope-intercept equation:

$$ y = 2x + c $$

Next, we will use the coordinates of the point $(3, 4)$ to find the value of $c$. We do this by substituting $x = 3$ and $y = 4$ into the equation:

$$ 4 = 2(3) + c $$

Now, we simplify the equation:

$$ 4 = 6 + c $$

To isolate $c$, we subtract $6$ from both sides:

$$ c = 4 - 6 $$
$$ c = -2 $$

With the value of $c$ determined, we can now substitute $c = -2$ back into the slope-intercept form:

$$ y = 2x - 2 $$

Thus, the equation of the line that passes through the point $(3, 4)$ with a slope of $2$ is:

$$ y = 2x - 2 $$

This equation indicates that for every unit increase in $x$, the value of $y$ increases by $2$ units. Additionally, it shows that the line intersects the y-axis at the point $(0, -2)$.
