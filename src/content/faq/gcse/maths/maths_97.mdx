To determine the rate of flow, you need to divide the volume of fluid by the time it takes for that fluid to flow.

More specifically, the rate of flow quantifies how much fluid passes through a specific point over a given time period. This concept is commonly applied in scenarios such as water flowing through a pipe or air circulating in a ventilation system. The formula used to calculate the rate of flow is:

$$ 
\text{Rate of Flow} = \frac{\text{Volume}}{\text{Time}} 
$$

In this formula, the volume represents the quantity of fluid, typically measured in litres ($\text{L}$) or cubic metres ($\text{m}^3$), while the time denotes the duration over which the fluid flows, often measured in seconds ($\text{s}$), minutes ($\text{min}$), or hours ($\text{h}$).

For instance, if a hose delivers $30$ litres of water in $5$ minutes, you can calculate the rate of flow by dividing the volume ($30$ litres) by the time ($5$ minutes):

$$ 
\text{Rate of Flow} = \frac{30 \text{ L}}{5 \text{ min}} = 6 \text{ L/min} 
$$

This calculation indicates that the hose delivers water at a rate of $6$ litres per minute.

Understanding the rate of flow is crucial in various practical applications, such as optimizing water supply systems, ensuring chemical reactions in laboratories occur at the appropriate pace, and analyzing problems related to fluid dynamics in physics and engineering.
