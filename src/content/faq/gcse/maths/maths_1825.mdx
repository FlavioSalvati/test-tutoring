The quotient of $8^5$ divided by $8^3$ can be simplified to $8^2$, which is equal to 64.

To understand this simplification, we need to apply the laws of indices (or exponents). One important rule states that when dividing two powers with the same base, we subtract the exponents. In our example, both terms have the base $8$. Thus, we subtract the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator:

$$
8^5 \div 8^3 = 8^{5-3} = 8^2
$$

Next, we compute $8^2$. This involves multiplying $8$ by itself:

$$
8^2 = 8 \times 8 = 64
$$

Consequently, the quotient of $8^5$ divided by $8^3$ is indeed $64$. This method of subtracting exponents when dividing powers with the same base is a fundamental principle in GCSE Maths, and it serves to simplify numerous problems involving indices.
