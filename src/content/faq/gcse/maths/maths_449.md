The exact value of $\cos 45^\circ$ is given by 

$$
\cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

To find the exact value of $\cos 45^\circ$, we can utilize the properties of a 45°-45°-90° triangle. This type of triangle is isosceles, meaning it has two equal sides and two equal angles. In a 45°-45°-90° triangle, the lengths of the two legs (the sides that are not the hypotenuse) are equal. 

Assuming each leg has a length of $1$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to determine the length of the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. For our triangle, this can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
$$

From this, we find that the hypotenuse is:

$$
\text{Hypotenuse} = \sqrt{2}.
$$

The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case, for the $45^\circ$ angle, the length of the adjacent side is $1$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$. Thus, we can write:

$$
\cos 45^\circ = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
$$

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{2}$:

$$
\cos 45^\circ = \frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

Consequently, we conclude that the exact value of $\cos 45^\circ$ is 

$$
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$
