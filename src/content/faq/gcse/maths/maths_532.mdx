To calculate the relative frequency, you divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of trials.

Relative frequency serves as an estimate of the probability of an event occurring, derived from experimental data. In this instance, you have performed $200$ trials. To determine the relative frequency of a favorable outcome, you first need to count how many times this favorable outcome occurred during the trials. Let's denote this count as $F$.

Once you have the value of $F$, you can apply the following formula for relative frequency:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Trials}} 
$$

For example, if the favorable outcome was observed $50$ times out of the $200$ trials, you would calculate the relative frequency as follows:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{50}{200} = 0.25 
$$

This indicates that the relative frequency of the favorable outcome is $0.25$, or $25\%$.

Relative frequency is particularly valuable because it provides an empirical probability based on actual observations, as opposed to theoretical probability, which is grounded in assumptions. It helps you gauge how frequently an event is likely to occur in practice. 

For instance, if you were rolling a die and wanted to determine how often you rolled a $4$, you could roll the die $200$ times and count the occurrences of $4$. If you rolled a $4$ on $30$ of those attempts, the relative frequency would be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{30}{200} = 0.15 
$$

This result suggests that, based on your trials, you can expect to roll a $4$ approximately $15\%$ of the time.
