The gradient of the equation $ y = x - 8 $ is equal to 1.

To find the gradient of the linear equation $ y = x - 8 $, we can identify the coefficient of $ x $. In the standard form of a linear equation, $ y = mx + c $, the variable $ m $ represents the gradient, while $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. For the equation $ y = x - 8 $, we can clearly see that it is structured in this format, where $ m = 1 $ and $ c = -8 $.

The gradient, denoted as $ m $, indicates the steepness of the line. Specifically, it represents the change in $ y $ corresponding to a one-unit change in $ x $. In this instance, since $ m = 1 $, it implies that for every increase of 1 unit in $ x $, $ y $ also increases by 1 unit. This results in a line that ascends at a 45-degree angle relative to the horizontal axis.

Understanding the gradient is essential, as it allows us to visualize both the direction and steepness of the line. A positive gradient, such as 1 in this example, indicates that the line slopes upward from left to right. Conversely, if the gradient were negative, the line would slope downward. If the gradient were zero, the line would be horizontal, signifying no change in $ y $ as $ x $ varies.

In summary, by recognizing the coefficient of $ x $ in the equation $ y = x - 8 $, we conclude that the gradient is 1, indicating a line that rises steadily at a uniform rate.
