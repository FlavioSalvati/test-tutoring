To calculate the area of a compound shape consisting of a square and a triangle, we need to find the areas of both individual shapes and sum them together.

### Understanding Compound Shapes
A compound shape is formed by combining two or more simple geometric figures. In this example, we will work with a square and a triangle. To determine the total area of the compound shape, we will first compute the area of each shape separately.

### Area of the Square
The area of a square is calculated using the formula:
$$
\text{Area of square} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length}
$$
If we denote the side length of the square as $ s $, then the area can be expressed as:
$$
\text{Area of square} = s^2
$$

### Area of the Triangle
The area of a triangle is determined using the formula:
$$
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$
For a triangle with a base $ b $ and a height $ h $, the area can be calculated as:
$$
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
$$

### Calculating the Total Area
After calculating the areas of both shapes, we can find the total area of the compound shape by adding them together:
$$
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of square} + \text{Area of triangle}
$$

### Example Calculation
Letâ€™s illustrate this with an example. Suppose the side length of the square is $ 4 \, \text{cm} $, the base of the triangle is $ 4 \, \text{cm} $, and the height of the triangle is $ 3 \, \text{cm} $. We can compute the areas as follows:

1. **Area of the square**:
   $$
   \text{Area of square} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \, \text{cm}^2
   $$

2. **Area of the triangle**:
   $$
   \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = 6 \, \text{cm}^2
   $$

3. **Total area of the compound shape**:
   $$
   \text{Total area} = 16 \, \text{cm}^2 + 6 \, \text{cm}^2 = 22 \, \text{cm}^2
   $$

### Conclusion
By summing the areas of the square and the triangle, we find that the total area of the compound shape is $ 22 \, \text{cm}^2 $. This method of breaking down the problem into simpler components allows for a straightforward calculation of compound shapes.
