In mathematics, a rate is defined as a ratio that compares two quantities measured in different units.

More specifically, a rate is a unique type of ratio where the two quantities being compared have distinct units. For instance, if you drive a car and cover a distance of $60$ miles in $2$ hours, your travel rate can be calculated as follows: 

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}.
$$ 

This calculation demonstrates how dividing the distance ($60$ miles) by the time ($2$ hours) yields the rate of travel.

Rates are applicable in numerous real-life contexts. For example, when assessing a car's speed, the cost of groceries per kilogram, or the frequency of heartbeats per minute, you are analyzing rates. Understanding rates allows us to see how one quantity varies in relation to another, facilitating comparisons and analyses across different scenarios.

To calculate a rate, you simply divide the first quantity by the second. For example, if you earn £50 for $5$ hours of work, your hourly rate can be computed as:

$$
\text{Rate of Pay} = \frac{£50}{5 \text{ hours}} = £10 \text{ per hour}.
$$ 

This figure indicates how much you earn for each hour worked.

Grasping the concept of rates is essential in GCSE Maths, as it lays the groundwork for more advanced topics such as speed, density, and unit pricing. By mastering rates, you will be better equipped to tackle a variety of mathematical problems and make informed decisions in everyday situations.
