To determine the length of the segment connecting the points $(1, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$, we can utilize the distance formula.

The distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, allows us to calculate the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. The formula is expressed as:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points, we can assign the following values:

$$
x_1 = 1, \quad y_1 = 2, \quad x_2 = 4, \quad y_2 = 6
$$

First, we calculate the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates:

$$
x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 1 = 3
$$

$$
y_2 - y_1 = 6 - 2 = 4
$$

Next, we square these differences:

$$
(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 3^2 = 9
$$

$$
(y_2 - y_1)^2 = 4^2 = 16
$$

Now, we add the squared differences together:

$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the sum to find the distance:

$$
\sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Therefore, the length of the segment from $(1, 2)$ to $(4, 6)$ is $5$ units.
