To create a cumulative frequency graph for grouped data, follow these steps to ensure clarity and accuracy in your representation.

First, organize your data into a frequency table that includes class intervals along with their corresponding frequencies. To calculate the cumulative frequency for each class interval, add the frequency of the current class to the cumulative frequency of the previous class. This process generates a running total of frequencies up to each class interval.

Next, identify the upper class boundary for each interval. The upper class boundary represents the maximum value that can be included within that interval. For instance, if your class interval is $10-20$, the upper class boundary would be $20$.

Proceed by setting up a set of axes on graph paper. Label the horizontal axis with the upper class boundaries and the vertical axis with the cumulative frequencies. Make sure that the scales you choose are suitable for the range of your data.

Now, plot each cumulative frequency against its corresponding upper class boundary. For example, if the cumulative frequency for the class interval $10-20$ is $15$, you would plot a point at the coordinates $(20, 15)$.

Once all points have been plotted, connect them using a smooth curve or straight lines. This resulting curve is your cumulative frequency graph, also known as an ogive. It serves as a valuable tool for analyzing the distribution of your data and for finding medians, quartiles, and other statistical measures.

Keep in mind that the cumulative frequency graph always begins at zero and should rise as you move to the right, reflecting the accumulation of data.
