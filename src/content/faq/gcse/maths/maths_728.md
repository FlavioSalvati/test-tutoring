To round the number $0.564$ to two decimal places, we examine the third decimal place. In this case, the number is $0.564$, and the third decimal place is $4$. According to rounding rules, if the digit in the third decimal place is $5$ or greater, we round up the second decimal place by one. Conversely, if it is $4$ or lower, we retain the second decimal place as it is.

Since the third decimal place here is $4$, which is less than $5$, we do not round up the second decimal place. As a result, the second decimal place remains $6$. Thus, when rounding $0.564$ to two decimal places, we obtain $0.56$.

Rounding is an essential skill in both mathematics and everyday life. It simplifies numbers, making them easier to work withâ€”especially in contexts like finance, measurements, or any situation where an exact value is not crucial. Mastering the rules of rounding enables you to make quick and accurate estimations.
