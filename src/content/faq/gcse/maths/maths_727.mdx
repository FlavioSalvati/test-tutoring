To round the number $456$ to the nearest ten, the result is $460$.

When rounding a number to the nearest ten, it's important to focus on the digit in the units place, which is the last digit of the number. For $456$, the units digit is $6$. The rounding rule states that if this digit is $5$ or higher, you should round up the tens digit by one. Conversely, if the digit is $4$ or lower, you keep the tens digit the same and change the units digit to zero.

In the case of $456$, since the units digit is $6$, which is greater than $5$, you round up the tens digit (which is $5$) by one, resulting in $6$. You then change the units digit to zero. Therefore, $456$ rounded to the nearest ten is $460$.

This rounding technique simplifies numbers, making them more manageable for calculations and estimations. Rounding is a valuable skill in various areas of mathematics, including statistics, where it aids in making data more accessible and easier to interpret. Always remember to check the units digit to determine whether to round up or down.
