To subtract a fraction from a mixed number, the first step is to convert the mixed number into an improper fraction.

A mixed number consists of both a whole number and a fraction, such as $2 \frac{3}{4}$. To convert this mixed number into an improper fraction, you should multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fractional part and then add the numerator. For example, in $2 \frac{3}{4}$, we calculate:

$$
2 \times 4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
$$

Thus, $2 \frac{3}{4}$ can be expressed as the improper fraction $\frac{11}{4}$.

Next, ensure that both fractions have a common denominator. If the fraction you are subtracting, such as $\frac{1}{2}$, does not share the same denominator as the improper fraction, you will need to find a common denominator. In the case of $\frac{11}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, the common denominator is $4$. Therefore, convert $\frac{1}{2}$ to have this common denominator, which results in:

$$
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}
$$

Now you can proceed with the subtraction by subtracting the numerators while keeping the common denominator:

$$
\frac{11}{4} - \frac{2}{4} = \frac{9}{4}
$$

Finally, if necessary, convert the improper fraction back into a mixed number. The improper fraction $\frac{9}{4}$ can be expressed as $2 \frac{1}{4}$, since $9$ divided by $4$ equals $2$ with a remainder of $1$. Therefore, the result of the subtraction $2 \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{2}$ is 

$$
2 \frac{1}{4}.
$$
