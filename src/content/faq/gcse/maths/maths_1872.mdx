To round the number $7890$ to the nearest thousand, the result is $8000$.

When rounding to the nearest thousand, you should examine the hundreds digit of the number. In the case of $7890$, the hundreds digit is $8$. According to standard rounding rules, if the hundreds digit is $5$ or greater, you round up; if it is $4$ or less, you round down. Since $8$ is greater than $5$, you round up.

To perform the rounding, you increase the thousands digit by $1$ and change all digits to the right of it to zero. In $7890$, the thousands digit is $7$. By adding $1$ to $7$, you get $8$. Then, by replacing the digits to the right with zeros, you arrive at $8000$. Thus, when rounded to the nearest thousand, $7890$ becomes $8000$.

This method guarantees that the rounded number is as close as possible to the original value while aligning with the nearest thousand. Rounding is an essential skill used in various mathematical contexts and everyday situations, as it simplifies numbers and makes calculations more manageable.
