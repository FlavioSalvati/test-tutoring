To estimate the quotient of $123$ divided by $4$, we can start by rounding $123$ to the nearest multiple of $10$, which is $120$. This simplification makes the division process easier while still providing a reasonably close approximation to the actual quotient.

Next, we perform the division of the rounded number by $4$. Specifically, we calculate:

$$
\frac{120}{4} = 30.
$$

This method is efficient for estimating the quotient without the need for a calculator or lengthy long division. 

The effectiveness of this approach lies in the fact that $120$ is very close to $123$, and dividing by $4$ is a straightforward operation. By rounding to a nearby, more manageable number, we can quickly obtain an estimate that is useful for various practical applications, such as verifying our calculations or performing quick mental math.
