To simplify the expression $7c - 3c + 9$, we begin by combining like terms, which results in $4c + 9$.

In algebra, simplifying an expression involves the process of combining like terms to create a more concise representation. In the expression $7c - 3c + 9$, the terms $7c$ and $-3c$ are considered like terms because they both contain the variable $c$. To combine these terms, we perform the arithmetic operation indicated by their signs.

First, we subtract $3c$ from $7c$. This calculation yields:

$$
7 - 3 = 4,
$$

thus, we have $7c - 3c = 4c$. The variable $c$ remains unchanged during this operation.

Next, we consider the constant term $+9$. Since there are no other constant terms to combine it with, it remains as is.

Consequently, the simplified form of the expression $7c - 3c + 9$ is:

$$
4c + 9.
$$

This process of combining like terms not only makes the expression more manageable but also facilitates further operations, such as solving equations or performing additional manipulations.
