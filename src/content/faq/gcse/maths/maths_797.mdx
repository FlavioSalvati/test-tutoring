To find the total time when adding $3$ hours and $20$ minutes to $1$ hour and $40$ minutes, we can break the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts.

First, we add the hours together: 
$$
3 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 4 \text{ hours}.
$$

Next, we add the minutes:
$$
20 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Since $60$ minutes is equivalent to $1$ hour, we need to convert these minutes into hours. 

Now, we can add this additional hour to the $4$ hours we already calculated:
$$
4 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 5 \text{ hours}.
$$

Thus, the total time is $5$ hours.

This step-by-step approach of separating hours and minutes not only clarifies the process but also simplifies the calculations. By managing each component independently, we can easily combine them and make necessary conversions. This method is especially beneficial in GCSE Maths when solving time-related problems.
