The gradient of a sales graph represents the rate of change in sales over time.

When examining a sales graph, the gradient (or slope) indicates how quickly sales are increasing or decreasing. A positive gradient signifies that sales are on the rise, while a negative gradient indicates a decline in sales. Moreover, a steeper gradient reflects a faster rate of change, whereas a flatter gradient suggests a slower rate of change.

To calculate the gradient, you need to identify two points on the graph. Let's denote these points as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, where $x$ represents time and $y$ represents sales. The gradient can be computed using the formula:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

This formula calculates the change in sales ($y$) divided by the change in time ($x$).

For instance, if sales increase from $100$ units to $200$ units over a span of $5$ months, the gradient would be computed as follows:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{200 - 100}{5 - 0} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ units per month}
$$

This result indicates that sales are increasing by $20$ units each month.

Understanding the gradient is crucial for businesses as it aids in making informed decisions. A positive and steep gradient may suggest an opportune time to invest more in marketing efforts. Conversely, a negative gradient could prompt the business to investigate the underlying reasons for declining sales and implement corrective measures.

In summary, the gradient of a sales graph serves as a valuable tool for analyzing how sales fluctuate over time, enabling businesses to strategize effectively.
