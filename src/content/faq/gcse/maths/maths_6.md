A prime factor is defined as a factor of a number that is itself a prime number.

Prime factors function as the essential building blocks of numbers. To clarify this concept, let's break it down further. A factor of a number is any whole number that can be multiplied by another whole number to produce the original number. For instance, the factors of $12$ include $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, and $12$, as these numbers can be paired and multiplied together to yield $12$ (for example, $2 \times 6 = 12$).

Conversely, a prime number is a number greater than $1$ that has no positive divisors other than $1$ and itself. Some examples of prime numbers are $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and $11$. When we talk about prime factors, we specifically refer to those factors of a number that are prime.

To find the prime factors of a number, one can use a method known as prime factorization. This technique involves dividing the number by the smallest prime number (which is $2$) and continuing this process with the resulting quotient until reaching $1$. For example, to determine the prime factors of $60$, you would begin by dividing by $2$ (the smallest prime number):

$$
60 \div 2 = 30,
$$

$$
30 \div 2 = 15,
$$

$$
15 \div 3 = 5,
$$

$$
5 \div 5 = 1.
$$

Thus, the prime factors of $60$ are $2$, $2$, $3$, and $5$, which can also be expressed in exponential form as 

$$
2^2 \times 3 \times 5.
$$

Understanding prime factors is essential in various areas of mathematics, including simplifying fractions, determining the greatest common divisor (GCD), and solving problems related to ratios and proportions.
