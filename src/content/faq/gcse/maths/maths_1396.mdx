The formula for the diagonal of a 3D cube is given by 

$$ 
\text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{3} \times \text{side length}. 
$$

A 3D cube, also known as a regular hexahedron, features sides of equal length. To calculate the length of the diagonal that spans from one corner of the cube to the opposite corner, we apply the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.

First, let's consider the diagonal on one face of the cube. If the side length of the cube is denoted as $a$, the diagonal of one face (which is a square) can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem as follows:

$$ 
\text{Face diagonal} = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{2a^2} = a\sqrt{2}. 
$$

Next, we find the space diagonal that stretches from one corner of the cube to the opposite corner, traversing through the interior of the cube. This space diagonal forms a right triangle with the face diagonal and one of the edges of the cube. We apply the Pythagorean theorem again in three dimensions:

$$ 
\text{Space diagonal} = \sqrt{(a\sqrt{2})^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{2a^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{3a^2} = a\sqrt{3}. 
$$

Thus, the formula for the diagonal in a 3D cube can be succinctly represented as 

$$ 
\text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{3} \times \text{side length}. 
$$

This formula allows you to quickly calculate the longest distance between any two opposite corners of a cube, which is valuable for various mathematical problems and real-world applications.
