To determine the probability of an event, you divide the number of times the event occurs by the total number of trials.

Probability serves as a measure of how likely it is for a particular event to happen. When you have data from experiments or observations, you can estimate this probability using relative frequency. Relative frequency is defined as the ratio of the number of times an event occurs to the total number of trials or observations. For instance, if you flip a coin $100$ times and it lands on heads $55$ times, the relative frequency of obtaining heads is given by:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{55}{100} = 0.55
$$

To compute the probability using relative frequency, you simply take the number of successful outcomes (the event of interest) and divide it by the total number of trials. This calculation yields a value between $0$ and $1$, where $0$ indicates that the event never occurs and $1$ signifies that it always occurs. In the case of our coin flip example, the probability of getting heads is $0.55$, or $55\%$.

This approach is particularly valuable when you do not know the theoretical probability or when working with real-world data. It enables you to make predictions based on previous occurrences. Keep in mind that the accuracy of your probability estimate improves with the number of trials conducted. For example, if you flip the coin only $10$ times and it lands on heads $7$ times, the relative frequency would be:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{7}{10} = 0.7
$$

However, this estimate may be less reliable compared to flipping the coin $100$ or even $1000$ times.
