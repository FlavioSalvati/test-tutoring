To convert the scientific notation $4.7 \times 10^{-5}$ into its decimal form, we find that it is equivalent to $0.000047$.

### Understanding the Conversion Process

To grasp how to convert $4.7 \times 10^{-5}$ into a standard decimal number, let's break down the components of the expression. The term $10^{-5}$ signifies that we are working with $10$ raised to the power of $-5$. In simpler terms, this can be interpreted as $1$ divided by $10$ raised to the power of $5$. Therefore, we can express $10^{-5}$ as:

$$
10^{-5} = \frac{1}{10^5} = \frac{1}{100000} = 0.00001.
$$

### Performing the Multiplication

Next, we need to multiply $4.7$ by $0.00001$. When multiplying a number by a power of ten with a negative exponent, we effectively shift the decimal point to the left. In this case, we will move the decimal point in $4.7$ five places to the left.

Let’s illustrate this step by step:

1. Starting with $4.7$, moving the decimal point one place to the left gives us $0.47$.
2. Moving it two places to the left results in $0.047$.
3. Shifting it three places to the left yields $0.0047$.
4. Moving it four places to the left results in $0.00047$.
5. Finally, moving it five places to the left gives us $0.000047$.

### Conclusion

Thus, the conversion of $4.7 \times 10^{-5}$ results in the decimal $0.000047$. This method of converting scientific notation into a familiar decimal format is particularly useful in various mathematical applications, as it aids in comprehension and facilitates calculations.
