To determine the equation of a line that is parallel to the line described by the equation $ y = 4x - 1 $ and passes through the point $ (1, 3) $, we first recognize that parallel lines share the same slope. 

The slope (or gradient) of the given line $ y = 4x - 1 $ is $ 4 $. This is derived from the equation's standard form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope. Consequently, any line parallel to this one will also have a slope of $ 4 $.

Next, we need to find the equation of the line that specifically passes through the point $ (1, 3) $. To achieve this, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is given by:

$$ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) $$

Here, $ (x_1, y_1) $ represents a point on the line, and $ m $ is the slope. Plugging in our values—where $ m = 4 $, $ x_1 = 1 $, and $ y_1 = 3 $—we substitute into the formula:

$$ y - 3 = 4(x - 1) $$

Now, we can expand and simplify this equation:

1. Expanding the right side:
   $$ y - 3 = 4x - 4 $$

2. Adding $ 3 $ to both sides to isolate $ y $:
   $$ y = 4x - 1 $$

Thus, the equation of the line that is parallel to $ y = 4x - 1 $ and passes through the point $ (1, 3) $ is indeed $ y = 4x - 1 $. This confirms that the new line maintains the same slope and correctly intersects the specified point, verifying its parallelism to the original line.
