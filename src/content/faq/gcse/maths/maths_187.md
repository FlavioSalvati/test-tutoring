To solve the equation $3x = 12$, the first step is to isolate the variable $x$. This involves removing the coefficient of $x$, which in this case is 3. To achieve this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 3.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Start with the equation:
   $$ 3x = 12 $$

2. Divide both sides by 3:
   $$ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{12}{3} $$

3. When you divide $3x$ by 3, the 3s cancel out, simplifying to:
   $$ x = \frac{12}{3} $$

4. Now, perform the division on the right side:
   $$ x = 4 $$

Thus, the solution to the equation $3x = 12$ is $x = 4$. 

To verify this solution, substitute $x$ back into the original equation:
$$ 3(4) = 12 $$
This simplifies to:
$$ 12 = 12 $$

This confirms that the solution is indeed correct. Remember, the essential principle in solving equations is to perform the same operation on both sides, ensuring that the equation remains balanced while isolating the variable.
