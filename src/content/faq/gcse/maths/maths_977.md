To calculate the gradient between the points $(2, 3)$ and $(5, 11)$, we can utilize the formula for the gradient, which is given by the ratio of the change in the $y$-coordinates to the change in the $x$-coordinates:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.
$$

The gradient, often referred to as the slope, indicates the steepness of a line. To determine it between two points, we need to compute the change in the $y$-coordinates ($\Delta y$) and the change in the $x$-coordinates ($\Delta x$), and then divide the former by the latter.

First, let's identify the coordinates of the two points: $(2, 3)$ and $(5, 11)$. Here, the $x$-coordinates are $2$ and $5$, while the $y$-coordinates are $3$ and $11$.

Next, we calculate the change in $y$ ($\Delta y$) by subtracting the $y$-coordinate of the first point from that of the second point:

$$
\Delta y = 11 - 3 = 8.
$$

Following that, we compute the change in $x$ ($\Delta x$) by subtracting the $x$-coordinate of the first point from that of the second point:

$$
\Delta x = 5 - 2 = 3.
$$

Now we can apply the gradient formula:

$$
\text{Gradient} (m) = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{8}{3}.
$$

Thus, the gradient between the points $(2, 3)$ and $(5, 11)$ is $\frac{8}{3}$. This indicates that for every $3$ units moved horizontally to the right, the line rises by $8$ units vertically.
