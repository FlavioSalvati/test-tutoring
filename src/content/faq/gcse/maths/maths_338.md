To determine the volume of a similar shape, you must cube the scale factor that relates the two shapes.

When working with similar shapes, the corresponding dimensions are proportional. This indicates that for two similar shapes, the ratio of any pair of corresponding lengths—such as height, width, or depth—remains constant. This ratio is referred to as the scale factor. For instance, if one shape is twice the size of another in every dimension, the scale factor would be $2$.

To calculate the volume of a similar shape, you cube the scale factor. This is necessary because volume is a three-dimensional measurement, and each dimension is scaled by the same factor. For example, if the scale factor between two similar shapes is $3$, then the volume of the larger shape is given by $3^3$, which equals $27$. This means that the volume of the larger shape is $27$ times that of the smaller shape.

Consider a small cube with a volume of $8$ cubic centimeters and a larger, similar cube that has a scale factor of $2$. To find the volume of the larger cube, you would calculate $2^3$, which equals $8$. Then, you multiply the volume of the smaller cube by this factor: 

$$
8 \, \text{cm}^3 \times 8 = 64 \, \text{cm}^3.
$$

Thus, the volume of the larger cube is $64$ cubic centimeters.

Understanding this principle is essential for solving problems involving similar shapes, as it enables you to quickly and accurately determine the volume of one shape based on the volume of another.
