To calculate the gradient between the points $(0, 2)$ and $(4, 10)$, we utilize the formula for the gradient, which is defined as the ratio of the change in the y-coordinates to the change in the x-coordinates:

$$
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

Here, $m$ represents the gradient of the line, $\Delta y$ is the change in the y-coordinates, and $\Delta x$ is the change in the x-coordinates.

To find the gradient between the two specified points, we follow these steps:

1. Identify the coordinates:
   - Let $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 2)$
   - Let $(x_2, y_2) = (4, 10)$

2. Calculate the change in y-coordinates:
   $$
   \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 10 - 2 = 8
   $$

3. Calculate the change in x-coordinates:
   $$
   \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 0 = 4
   $$

4. Substitute these values into the gradient formula:
   $$
   m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
   $$

Thus, the gradient between the points $(0, 2)$ and $(4, 10)$ is $2$. This indicates that for every unit increase in $x$, the $y$ value increases by $2$ units. The positive gradient signifies that the line slopes upward as one moves from left to right.
