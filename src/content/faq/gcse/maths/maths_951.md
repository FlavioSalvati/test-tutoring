The point $(-3, 4)$ is located in the second quadrant of the Cartesian plane.

To determine the quadrant of a point in the Cartesian coordinate system, one must examine the signs of its $x$ and $y$ coordinates. The Cartesian plane is divided into four distinct quadrants:

1. **First Quadrant**: Here, both $x$ and $y$ coordinates are positive, i.e., $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.
2. **Second Quadrant**: In this quadrant, the $x$ coordinate is negative while the $y$ coordinate is positive, or $x < 0$ and $y > 0$.
3. **Third Quadrant**: Both coordinates are negative in this quadrant, represented as $x < 0$ and $y < 0$.
4. **Fourth Quadrant**: The $x$ coordinate is positive and the $y$ coordinate is negative, which can be written as $x > 0$ and $y < 0$.

For the specific point $(-3, 4)$, the $x$ coordinate is $-3$, indicating it is negative, while the $y$ coordinate is $4$, which is positive. Based on the criteria outlined above, a point with a negative $x$ coordinate and a positive $y$ coordinate is classified as being in the second quadrant. Consequently, we can conclude that the point $(-3, 4)$ resides in the second quadrant. 

This systematic approach to analyzing the signs of the coordinates allows for a quick and effective determination of the quadrant for any given point on the Cartesian plane.
