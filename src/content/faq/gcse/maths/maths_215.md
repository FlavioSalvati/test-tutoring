To create a graph from population data, follow these steps to ensure clarity and accuracy.

First, gather your population data, which should include the years alongside their corresponding population figures. It is crucial to verify that this data is both accurate and complete. Next, determine the most suitable type of graph for your data. When visualizing population changes over time, a line graph is generally the best choice, as it effectively illustrates trends and fluctuations over the years.

After selecting the type of graph, label your axes appropriately. Typically, the horizontal axis (x-axis) represents time (in years), while the vertical axis (y-axis) denotes the population. It is important to maintain a consistent scale on both axes to ensure that your graph is easy to read and interpret.

Next, plot each data point by identifying the corresponding values on the x and y axes. For instance, if you have data indicating that the population in the year 2000 was $50,000$, locate $2000$ on the x-axis and $50,000$ on the y-axis, then place a dot at the intersection of these two values.

Once all your data points are plotted, connect them with a line if you are using a line graph. This visual connection helps to highlight trends over time. Alternatively, if you are utilizing a bar graph, draw bars extending up to the appropriate population value for each year.

Finally, add a descriptive title to your graph and ensure that the axes are clearly labeled to provide essential context. This will assist viewers in understanding the data being presented. For example, you might title your graph "Population Growth from 2000 to 2020".
