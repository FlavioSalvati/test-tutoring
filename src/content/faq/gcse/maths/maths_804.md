To determine the total amount after applying a 5% interest rate to £200, we begin by calculating what 5% of £200 is. Percentages represent a portion of a whole, expressed as a fraction of 100. In this case, 5% signifies 5 parts out of every 100. To compute 5% of £200, we can multiply £200 by the decimal equivalent of 5%, which is $0.05$ (since $5\%$ is the same as $\frac{5}{100}$ or $0.05$ in decimal form).

Let’s perform the calculation:

$$ 
200 \times 0.05 = 10 
$$

Thus, 5% of £200 amounts to £10. This £10 represents the interest that will be added to the initial £200.

Next, we will add this interest to the original amount to find the total:

$$ 
200 + 10 = 210 
$$

Consequently, the total amount after incorporating 5% interest on £200 is £210. 

This method can be applied to calculate interest for any percentage and any initial amount. Remember to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100, multiply it by the initial amount to obtain the interest, and then add the interest to the initial amount to arrive at the total.
