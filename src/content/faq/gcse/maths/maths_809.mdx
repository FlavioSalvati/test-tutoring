The total cost for 6 items priced at £9.50 each amounts to £57.00.

To calculate the total cost of multiple items, you need to multiply the cost of a single item by the quantity of items you wish to purchase. In this scenario, each item costs £9.50, and you intend to buy 6 items. Therefore, you perform the multiplication:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Price per Item} \times \text{Number of Items} = 9.50 \times 6
$$

Let’s break down the calculation step-by-step:

1. Start with the price of one item: £9.50.
2. Next, multiply this by the total number of items: 
   $$ 
   9.50 \times 6 
   $$

To simplify the multiplication, you can separate the components of £9.50:
- First, calculate the whole number: 
  $$ 
  9 \times 6 = 54 
  $$
- Next, calculate the decimal portion: 
  $$ 
  0.50 \times 6 = 3.00 
  $$
- Finally, add these two results together: 
  $$ 
  54 + 3.00 = 57.00 
  $$

Thus, the total cost for purchasing 6 items at £9.50 each is indeed £57.00. This method not only provides the correct total but also reinforces your understanding of decimal multiplication and addition, which are fundamental skills in GCSE Maths.
