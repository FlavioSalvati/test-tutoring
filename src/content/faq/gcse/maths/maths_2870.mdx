The magnitude of the vector $(9, 12)$ is $15$.

To determine the magnitude of a vector, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. A two-dimensional vector, such as $(9, 12)$, can be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the vector's components correspond to the lengths of the two perpendicular sides. The magnitude of the vector is represented by the length of this hypotenuse.

The formula for calculating the magnitude of a vector $(a, b)$ is expressed as:
$$ 
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} 
$$

For the vector $(9, 12)$, we substitute $ a = 9 $ and $ b = 12 $ into the formula:
$$ 
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{81 + 144} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{225} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Magnitude} = 15 
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(9, 12)$ is indeed $15$. This implies that if you were to plot this vector on a graph, the straight-line distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the point $(9, 12)$ would measure $15$ units. Mastering the calculation of a vector's magnitude is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths, particularly in the context of geometry and physics problems.
