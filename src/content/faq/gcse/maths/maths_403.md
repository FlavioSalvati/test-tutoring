The surface area of a cube with a side length of $3 \, \text{cm}$ is $54 \, \text{cm}^2$.

To find the surface area of a cube, you first need to know the length of one of its sides. A cube consists of six faces, each of which is a square. The formula for the area of a square is the side length squared. Thus, if the side length of the cube is $3 \, \text{cm}$, the area of one face can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Area of one face} = 3 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 9 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

Since a cube has six identical faces, you multiply the area of one face by $6$ to determine the total surface area of the cube. Therefore, the total surface area is given by:

$$
\text{Surface area} = 6 \times 9 \, \text{cm}^2 = 54 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

To summarize the steps involved in this calculation:
1. Calculate the area of one face: 
   $$3 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 9 \, \text{cm}^2.$$
2. Multiply the area of one face by the number of faces:
   $$6 \times 9 \, \text{cm}^2 = 54 \, \text{cm}^2.$$

This method is applicable to any cube, regardless of its side length. Just remember to square the side length to find the area of one face and then multiply by six to obtain the total surface area.
