The probability of not drawing a heart from a standard deck of cards is given as $\frac{39}{52}$.

To find the probability of not drawing a heart from a standard deck of $52$ cards, we first need to identify the number of hearts present in the deck. A standard deck consists of $4$ suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains $13$ cards, resulting in a total of $13$ hearts in the deck.

Next, we determine the number of cards that are not hearts. Since there are $52$ cards in total and $13$ of these are hearts, the number of cards that are not hearts is calculated as:

$$
52 - 13 = 39.
$$

Probability is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. In this scenario, the number of favorable outcomes (not drawing a heart) is $39$, while the total number of possible outcomes (drawing any card) is $52$. Thus, the probability of not drawing a heart can be expressed as:

$$
P(\text{not a heart}) = \frac{39}{52}.
$$

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $13$. Performing the division gives us:

$$
\frac{39 \div 13}{52 \div 13} = \frac{3}{4}.
$$

Therefore, the probability of not drawing a heart from a deck of cards can also be expressed as $\frac{3}{4}$ or $0.75$. This indicates that there is a $75\%$ chance of not drawing a heart.
