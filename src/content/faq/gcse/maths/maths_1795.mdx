To effectively compare percentages, it is important to convert them to a common base or context before making direct comparisons.

When comparing percentages, ensure that they pertain to the same whole or context. For instance, consider the percentages $40\%$ of $200$ and $50\%$ of $150$. To understand what these percentages represent in absolute terms, we can convert them to actual numbers. Specifically, $40\%$ of $200$ can be calculated as:

$$
0.40 \times 200 = 80,
$$

while $50\%$ of $150$ is calculated as:

$$
0.50 \times 150 = 75.
$$

From this, we observe that $80$ is greater than $75$, indicating that $40\%$ of $200$ is indeed more than $50\%$ of $150$.

Another approach is to convert percentages into fractions or decimals for easier comparison. For example, $25\%$ can be expressed as $0.25$ or $\frac{1}{4}$, while $30\%$ can be represented as $0.30$ or $\frac{3}{10}$. When we compare $0.25$ and $0.30$, it is evident that $0.30$ is larger. Similarly, if we compare $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{3}{10}$, we can find a common denominator—in this case, $20$—to convert them into:

$$
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{20} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3}{10} = \frac{6}{20}.
$$

This demonstrates that $\frac{3}{10}$ (or $30\%$) is greater than $\frac{1}{4}$ (or $25\%$).

When percentages relate to different totals, it is essential to consider the context. For example, if one school has $60\%$ of its students passing an exam while another school has $70\%$, but the first school has $500$ students and the second only $200$, we can compute the actual number of students passing in each case. The first school has:

$$
0.60 \times 500 = 300
$$

students passing, whereas the second school has:

$$
0.70 \times 200 = 140
$$

students passing. Thus, despite the higher percentage in the second school, the first school has more students passing the exam.

By converting percentages into comparable forms and carefully considering their context, you can make accurate comparisons.
