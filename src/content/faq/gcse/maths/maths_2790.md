To solve for a side of a triangle using the cosine rule, you can apply the formula:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)
$$

The cosine rule is especially useful for non-right-angled triangles, as it establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides and the cosine of one of the angles. In this formula, $ c $ represents the side you are trying to find, while $ a $ and $ b $ are the lengths of the other two sides, and $ C $ is the angle opposite side $ c $.

To find the length of side $ c $, follow these steps:

1. Identify the lengths of sides $ a $ and $ b $, as well as the measure of angle $ C $ in your triangle.
2. Substitute the known values into the formula $ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C) $.
3. If necessary, calculate the value of $ \cos(C) $ using a calculator.
4. Carry out the arithmetic: square $ a $ and $ b $, compute $ 2ab \cos(C) $, and then subtract this product from the sum of $ a^2 $ and $ b^2 $.
5. Finally, take the square root of the result to determine the length of side $ c $.

As an example, if $ a = 5 $, $ b = 7 $, and $ C = 60^\circ $, you would substitute these values into the formula as follows:

$$
c^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot \cos(60^\circ)
$$

Simplifying this expression gives:

$$
c^2 = 25 + 49 - 70 \cdot 0.5
$$

This further simplifies to:

$$
c^2 = 25 + 49 - 35 = 39
$$

Taking the square root, we find:

$$
c = \sqrt{39} \approx 6.24
$$

This method enables you to calculate the length of any side in a triangle, provided you know the lengths of the other two sides and the included angle.
