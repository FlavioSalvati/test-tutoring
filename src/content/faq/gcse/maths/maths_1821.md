To add three mixed numbers, the process involves converting them into improper fractions, finding a common denominator, summing the fractions, and finally simplifying the result.

Let's break down the steps clearly:

1. **Convert Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions**: A mixed number consists of a whole number and a fraction. To convert a mixed number into an improper fraction, multiply the whole number by the denominator, then add the numerator. For instance, consider the mixed number $2 \frac{1}{3}$. Here, you would calculate:
   $$
   2 \times 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7
   $$
   Therefore, $2 \frac{1}{3}$ converts to the improper fraction $\frac{7}{3}$.

2. **Convert All Mixed Numbers**: Now, letâ€™s apply this to all three mixed numbers. Suppose we have $2 \frac{1}{3}$, $1 \frac{2}{5}$, and $3 \frac{1}{4}$. We convert each of these to improper fractions:
   - $2 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}$
   - $1 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{7}{5}$ (since $1 \times 5 + 2 = 7$)
   - $3 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{13}{4}$ (since $3 \times 4 + 1 = 13$)

3. **Find a Common Denominator**: Next, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{7}{3}$, $\frac{7}{5}$, and $\frac{13}{4}$. The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators $3$, $5$, and $4$ is $60$. Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
   $$
   \frac{7}{3} = \frac{7 \times 20}{3 \times 20} = \frac{140}{60}
   $$
   $$
   \frac{7}{5} = \frac{7 \times 12}{5 \times 12} = \frac{84}{60}
   $$
   $$
   \frac{13}{4} = \frac{13 \times 15}{4 \times 15} = \frac{195}{60}
   $$

4. **Add the Fractions**: Now that all fractions share a common denominator, we can add them together:
   $$
   \frac{140}{60} + \frac{84}{60} + \frac{195}{60} = \frac{419}{60}
   $$

5. **Simplify the Result**: Finally, we should simplify this improper fraction by converting it back to a mixed number. To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator:
   $$
   419 \div 60 = 6 \quad \text{(with a remainder of 59)}
   $$
   Thus, the mixed number representation is $6 \frac{59}{60}$.

By following these steps, you can accurately add any three mixed numbers with ease.
