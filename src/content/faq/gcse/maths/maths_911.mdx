To determine the x-intercepts of the equation $ y = 3x - 9 $, we need to set $ y $ to zero and solve for $ x $.

The x-intercepts of a graph are the points at which the graph intersects the x-axis. At these points, the value of $ y $ is equal to zero. Therefore, we begin by substituting $ y $ with zero in the equation, which leads us to the equation:

$$
0 = 3x - 9.
$$

Next, we will isolate $ x $ by solving this equation. The first step is to add $ 9 $ to both sides of the equation, allowing us to isolate the term containing $ x $:

$$
0 + 9 = 3x - 9 + 9,
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
9 = 3x.
$$

Now, to solve for $ x $, we divide both sides of the equation by $ 3 $:

$$
\frac{9}{3} = \frac{3x}{3},
$$

resulting in:

$$
3 = x.
$$

Thus, the x-intercept of the equation $ y = 3x - 9 $ is $ x = 3 $. This indicates that the graph intersects the x-axis at the point $ (3, 0) $.

In summary, to find the x-intercepts of a linear equation such as $ y = 3x - 9 $, one must set $ y $ to zero and solve for $ x $. This procedure involves fundamental algebraic operations like adding or subtracting terms and dividing by coefficients. For this specific equation, the x-intercept is located at the point $ (3, 0) $.
