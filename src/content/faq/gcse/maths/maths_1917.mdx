To calculate the unit rate, you simply divide the total quantity by the number of units.

A unit rate is a useful way to compare quantities that are measured in different units. It provides a clear understanding of how much of one item corresponds to a single unit of another item. For instance, to determine the unit rate of miles per hour, you would divide the total miles traveled by the total hours taken.

For example, if you drove a distance of $150$ miles in $3$ hours, the unit rate can be calculated by dividing $150$ miles by $3$ hours:

$$
\text{Unit Rate} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

This indicates that you are traveling at a speed of $50$ miles for every hour.

Another common scenario is calculating the cost per item. Suppose you purchased $12$ apples for £$3$. To find the unit rate, you would divide £$3$ by $12$ apples:

$$
\text{Cost per apple} = \frac{£3}{12 \text{ apples}} = £0.25 \text{ per apple}
$$

This means that each apple costs $25$ pence.

Unit rates are incredibly useful in everyday situations where you need to compare prices, speeds, densities, and other quantities. They enable you to make informed decisions by offering a standard measure for comparing various options. For instance, if one store sells $6$ pens for £$1.50$ and another sells $8$ pens for £$2$, you can calculate the unit rate for each to determine which option offers a better price per pen.

In summary, to find the unit rate, always divide the total quantity by the number of units. This straightforward calculation allows you to analyze and compare different scenarios effectively.
