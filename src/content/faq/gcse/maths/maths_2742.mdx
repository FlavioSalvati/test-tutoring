The exact value of $\tan 45^\circ$ is $1$.

To understand why $\tan 45^\circ$ equals $1$, we must explore some fundamental concepts of trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. For the angle $45^\circ$, consider a right triangle where the two sides that are not the hypotenuse are of equal length. This configuration results in an isosceles right triangle.

In an isosceles right triangle, the two angles, besides the right angle, both measure $45^\circ$. If we assume that the lengths of these two equal sides are each $1$ unit, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse. According to the theorem, the hypotenuse is given by

$$
c = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}.
$$

To find $\tan 45^\circ$, we calculate the ratio of the length of the opposite side to that of the adjacent side. Since both sides are equal (each measuring $1$ unit), the ratio is 

$$
\frac{1}{1},
$$ 

which simplifies to $1$. Hence, we conclude that 

$$
\tan 45^\circ = 1.
$$

This result can also be verified using the unit circle. In the unit circle, the coordinates of the point corresponding to an angle of $45^\circ$ (or $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians) are $\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)$. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate:

$$
\tan 45^\circ = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1.
$$

Thus, we can confidently state that the exact value of $\tan 45^\circ$ is $1$.
