The graph of the function $ y = e^x $ is characterized by its upward-sloping curve, which becomes increasingly steep as $ x $ increases.

The function $ y = e^x $ exemplifies an exponential function, where $ e $ is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $ 2.71828 $. This constant is referred to as Euler's number. Notably, the graph of $ y = e^x $ intersects the point $ (0, 1) $, since any number raised to the power of zero equals one. As $ x $ grows larger, the value of $ y $ rises rapidly, resulting in a steep ascent of the graph.

For negative values of $ x $, the graph approaches the x-axis without ever actually touching it. This phenomenon occurs because $ e $ raised to a negative exponent yields a fraction that diminishes progressively but never becomes zero. Consequently, the graph features a horizontal asymptote at $ y = 0 $.

The graph remains entirely above the x-axis, indicating that $ y $ is always positive. This property underscores the fact that $ e^x $ is always greater than zero for all real numbers $ x $. The curve is smooth and continuous, exhibiting no breaks or holes.

In summary, the graph of $ y = e^x $ begins just above the x-axis on the left side, passes through the point $ (0, 1) $, and ascends steeply as $ x $ increases. This graph is fundamental in mathematics, particularly in discussions of growth and decay, and serves to illustrate the concept of exponential growth effectively.
