When you rotate the point $(5, 0)$ by $180^\circ$ around the origin, it transforms to the point $(-5, 0)$.

Rotating a point by $180^\circ$ about the origin effectively flips it to the opposite side of the coordinate plane. This transformation changes the signs of both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. For the point $(5, 0)$, the x-coordinate is $5$ and the y-coordinate is $0$. After performing a $180^\circ$ rotation, the x-coordinate becomes $-5$, while the y-coordinate remains $0$. Thus, the new coordinates of the point are $(-5, 0)$.

To visualize this transformation, consider the point $(5, 0)$ on a graph: it is positioned $5$ units to the right of the origin. When you rotate it by $180^\circ$, it moves to the opposite side of the origin, landing $5$ units to the left. This explains the change in the x-coordinate from $5$ to $-5$. The y-coordinate remains unchanged at $0$ because the point lies on the x-axis.

This concept is a fundamental aspect of coordinate geometry, where transformations such as rotations, reflections, and translations are utilized to manipulate points and shapes within the plane. A $180^\circ$ rotation is particularly straightforward, as it merely involves negating both coordinates. This principle is applicable to any point, not just $(5, 0)$. For instance, if you rotate the point $(a, b)$ by $180^\circ$, the resulting coordinates will be $(-a, -b)$.
