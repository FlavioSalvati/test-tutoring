To solve the equation $2(x - 3) = 10$, we will isolate the variable $x$ step by step. 

First, we start by dividing both sides of the equation by $2$ to simplify it:

$$
x - 3 = \frac{10}{2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x - 3 = 5
$$

Next, to isolate $x$, we need to add $3$ to both sides of the equation:

$$
x - 3 + 3 = 5 + 3
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = 8
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation is $x = 8$. To verify this solution, we can substitute $8$ back into the original equation and check if it holds true:

$$
2(8 - 3) = 10
$$

Calculating the left side, we have:

$$
2 \times 5 = 10
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
10 = 10
$$

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is confirmed to be correct. 

By following these steps, you can solve similar linear equations by isolating the variable through basic arithmetic operations.
