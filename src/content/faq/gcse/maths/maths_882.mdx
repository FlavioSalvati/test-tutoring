To determine a side of a non-right triangle using the sine rule, you can apply the following formula:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}.
$$

The sine rule is an essential tool in trigonometry, particularly for addressing problems involving non-right triangles. It establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the sines of their corresponding angles. To effectively use the sine rule to find a missing side, you need at least one known pair of angle and side, along with either another angle or another side.

For example, consider a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, and angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ opposite these sides, respectively. If you know the lengths of sides $a$ and $b$, as well as the measure of angle $A$, you can calculate side $c$ if you also know angle $C$. The sine rule indicates that the ratio of a side's length to the sine of its opposite angle is constant for all three sides and angles in the triangle.

To solve for side $c$, you can rearrange the sine rule formula as follows:

$$
c = \frac{a \cdot \sin C}{\sin A}.
$$

Make sure that your angles are measured in either degrees or radians, depending on your calculator's settings. Use the sine function to compute the sine values. Then, substitute the known values into the equation to solve for the unknown side. This method will allow you to accurately determine the missing side, provided you have sufficient information about the other sides and angles of the triangle.
