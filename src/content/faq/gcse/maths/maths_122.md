To subtract $30$ minutes from $2$ hours, the result is $1$ hour and $30$ minutes.

When faced with the task of subtracting $30$ minutes from $2$ hours, it can be beneficial to break the problem down into smaller, manageable steps. First, remember that $1$ hour is equivalent to $60$ minutes. Therefore, $2$ hours can be converted to minutes as follows:

$$
2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Next, subtract $30$ minutes from the total of $120$ minutes:

$$
120 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Now, we need to convert the $90$ minutes back into hours and minutes. Since $1$ hour is $60$ minutes, we can determine that:

$$
90 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} + 30 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Therefore, when you subtract $30$ minutes from $2$ hours, you arrive at a result of $1$ hour and $30$ minutes. This method not only clarifies the calculation but also reinforces your understanding of the relationship between hours and minutes, making it easier to tackle similar problems in the future.
