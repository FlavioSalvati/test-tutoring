To add numbers expressed in standard form, the first step is to ensure they share the same power of ten, allowing you to then add the coefficients.

Standard form, also referred to as scientific notation, represents numbers as a product of a coefficient (a value between $1$ and $10$) and a power of ten. For example, the numbers $3 \times 10^4$ and $5 \times 10^3$ are both in standard form.

To perform the addition, you need to adjust one of the numbers so that both have the same exponent. In our example, you can convert $5 \times 10^3$ into $0.5 \times 10^4$. Now, both numbers are represented with the same power of ten: $3 \times 10^4$ and $0.5 \times 10^4$.

Next, you can add the coefficients (the numbers in front of the powers of ten). In this case, you sum $3$ and $0.5$, resulting in $3.5$. Thus, we have:

$$
3 \times 10^4 + 0.5 \times 10^4 = 3.5 \times 10^4.
$$

If the resulting coefficient exceeds the range of $1$ to $10$, you will need to convert it back into standard form. For instance, if you obtain $12 \times 10^4$, you would adjust it to $1.2 \times 10^5$.

By following these steps, you can effectively add numbers in standard form, simplifying the process of working with very large or very small values in your calculations.
