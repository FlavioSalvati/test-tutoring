To find the angle subtended by an arc at the circumference of a circle, you need to measure the angle that is formed at the edge of the circle.

More specifically, the angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is defined as the angle between two radii that extend from the center of the circle to the endpoints of the arc. There are several methods to calculate this angle, depending on the information you have.

One common approach is to utilize the properties of circles. For instance, if you know the central angle (the angle subtended by the same arc at the center of the circle), you can apply the Angle at the Centre Theorem. This theorem states that the angle at the circumference is half of the central angle. Therefore, if the central angle measures $80^\circ$, the corresponding angle at the circumference would be:

$$
\text{Angle at the circumference} = \frac{80^\circ}{2} = 40^\circ.
$$

Another useful method involves the properties of inscribed angles, particularly in cyclic quadrilaterals (four-sided figures where all vertices lie on the circle). In such quadrilaterals, opposite angles sum up to $180^\circ$. Knowing this property can help you determine the angle subtended by the arc if you have information about the other angles in the quadrilateral.

Additionally, if you have the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the two radii and the chord of the arc, trigonometry can be applied. By using the cosine rule, you can calculate the angle at the circumference based on these side lengths.

By understanding these methods and their properties, you will be well-equipped to accurately determine the angle subtended by an arc at the circumference in a variety of situations.
