The order of rotational symmetry in a regular dodecagon is $12$.

A regular dodecagon is a polygon with twelve equal sides and twelve equal angles. Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated about its center and still appear unchanged during a complete $360^\circ$ rotation. For a regular dodecagon, this means that certain rotations will yield a shape that looks identical to its initial position.

To determine the order of rotational symmetry, we divide $360^\circ$ by the number of sides. In the case of a regular dodecagon, this calculation is:

$$
\frac{360^\circ}{12} = 30^\circ.
$$

This result indicates that the dodecagon can be rotated by $30^\circ$ increments, and at each of these increments, it will appear the same as it did before the rotation. As a result, the dodecagon can be rotated a total of $12$ times (each by $30^\circ$) within a full $360^\circ$ rotation, consistently matching its original shape.

Understanding rotational symmetry is crucial for analyzing the patterns and properties of geometric shapes. It is also essential in practical applications across various fields such as design, art, and architecture, where symmetry and patterns play a significant role.
