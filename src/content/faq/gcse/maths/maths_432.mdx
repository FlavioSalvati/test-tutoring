The cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to that of the hypotenuse.

In the context of a right-angled triangle, the cosine (commonly abbreviated as "cos") of one of the angles that is not the right angle provides a relationship between the lengths of the triangle's sides. Specifically, for an angle $\theta$, the cosine is calculated by dividing the length of the side that is adjacent to $\theta$ by the length of the hypotenuse. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$ 
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} 
$$

In any right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is always the longest side and is located opposite the right angle. The adjacent side is the side that forms the angle $\theta$ with the hypotenuse but is not itself the hypotenuse.

For instance, consider a right-angled triangle where the length of the adjacent side to angle $\theta$ is $3$ units and the length of the hypotenuse is $5$ units. In this case, the cosine of angle $\theta$ can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 
$$

Understanding the cosine function is essential for solving a variety of problems in trigonometry, such as determining unknown side lengths or angles in right-angled triangles. Its applications extend beyond mathematics into fields like physics, engineering, and computer graphics. It is important to note that the cosine function is one of the three primary trigonometric ratios, alongside sine (sin) and tangent (tan), each of which relates the sides of a right-angled triangle in distinct ways.
