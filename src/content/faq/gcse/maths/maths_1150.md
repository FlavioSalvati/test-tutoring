Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.

When we refer to angles in the same segment, we mean angles that are subtended by the same arc at points on the circumference of a circle. To visualize this, imagine a circle with two chords that begin and end at the same points on the circle's edge. The angles formed at the circumference by these chords, on the same side of the arc, will be equal. This is a fundamental property of circles and is invaluable for solving various geometric problems.

For example, consider a circle with points $A$, $B$, and $C$ on its circumference. If you draw two chords, $AB$ and $AC$, the angle subtended by these chords at point $B$, denoted as $\angle ABC$, and the angle subtended at point $C$, denoted as $\angle ACB$, will be equal. This equality arises because both angles are subtended by the same arc $AC$.

This property is particularly useful in problems involving cyclic quadrilaterals, where all four vertices lie on the circumference of a circle. In such quadrilaterals, the opposite angles add up to $180^\circ$, and angles in the same segment are equal. This relationship can assist in finding missing angles and solving more complex geometric problems.

A solid understanding of this concept can also aid in proofs and constructions, as it provides a reliable method for determining angle measures and relationships within a circle. Therefore, whenever you encounter angles subtended by the same arc, you can confidently assert that they are equal!
