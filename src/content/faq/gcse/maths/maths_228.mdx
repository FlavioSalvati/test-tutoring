The equation $y = (x-2)(x+2)$ represents a parabola that opens upwards, with its roots located at $x = -2$ and $x = 2$.

To gain a deeper understanding, let's analyze the equation $y = (x-2)(x+2)$. This is a quadratic equation presented in its factored form. When we expand it, we obtain:

$$
y = x^2 - 4.
$$

This indicates that the graph is indeed a parabola, characterized by its U-shaped curve, due to the highest power of $x$ being $2$.

The roots of the equation, also referred to as the x-intercepts, are the values of $x$ that result in $y = 0$. By setting $y$ to $0$ in the equation $(x-2)(x+2) = 0$, we find:

$$
x = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2.
$$

These points are where the graph intersects the x-axis.

The vertex of the parabola, which represents its minimum point since it opens upwards, lies precisely halfway between the roots. The midpoint between $x = -2$ and $x = 2$ is $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the equation $y = x^2 - 4$, we find:

$$
y = -4.
$$

Thus, the vertex is located at the point $(0, -4)$.

The graph exhibits symmetry about the y-axis because the equation $y = x^2 - 4$ remains unchanged when $x$ is replaced with $-x$. This symmetry is beneficial for accurately sketching the graph. The y-intercept, which is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis, can be determined by setting $x = 0$, resulting in:

$$
y = -4.
$$

In summary, the graph of $y = (x-2)(x+2)$ is a parabola that opens upwards, featuring roots at $x = -2$ and $x = 2$, a vertex at the point $(0, -4)$, and exhibiting symmetry about the y-axis.
