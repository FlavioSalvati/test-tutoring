The length of the line segment connecting the points $(3, 4)$ and $(6, 8)$ is $5$ units.

To calculate the length of a line segment between two points, we can apply the distance formula. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is expressed as:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In this equation, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For the points $(3, 4)$ and $(6, 8)$, we can assign the following values:

$$
x_1 = 3, \quad y_1 = 4, \quad x_2 = 6, \quad y_2 = 8
$$

Now, we will substitute these values into the distance formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(6 - 3)^2 + (8 - 4)^2}
$$

First, let's calculate the differences in the coordinates:

$$
6 - 3 = 3
$$
$$
8 - 4 = 4
$$

Next, we square these differences:

$$
3^2 = 9
$$
$$
4^2 = 16
$$

Now, we add these squared differences together:

$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the sum to find the distance:

$$
\sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Therefore, the length of the line segment from $(3, 4)$ to $(6, 8)$ is $5$ units. This method can be applied to determine the distance between any two points on a coordinate plane.
