To determine the radius of a circle from its circumference, you can simply divide the circumference by $ 2\pi $.

The circumference $ C $ of a circle represents the total distance around the circle and is mathematically related to the radius $ r $ by the formula:

$$
C = 2\pi r
$$

To isolate the radius $ r $ when the circumference is known, we need to rearrange this formula. Start by dividing both sides of the equation by $ 2\pi $:

$$
r = \frac{C}{2\pi}
$$

For instance, consider a circle with a circumference of $ 31.4 $ cm. You can find the radius by substituting the circumference into the rearranged formula:

$$
r = \frac{31.4}{2\pi}
$$

Using the approximate value of $ \pi $ as $ 3.14 $, the calculation becomes:

$$
r = \frac{31.4}{2 \times 3.14}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
r = \frac{31.4}{6.28}
$$

Thus, you find that:

$$
r \approx 5 \text{ cm}
$$

This method is applicable to any circle, regardless of its size. Remember that $ \pi $ (pi) is a constant approximately equal to $ 3.14159 $, but for most GCSE Maths problems, using $ 3.14 $ is sufficiently accurate. Mastering this technique will enable you to efficiently and accurately calculate the radius from the circumference, a valuable skill in various geometry applications.
