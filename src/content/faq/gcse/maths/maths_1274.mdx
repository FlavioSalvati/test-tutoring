To determine the length of a leg in a right-angled triangle, you can utilize the Pythagorean theorem.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

In this equation, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides.

If you are given the length of the hypotenuse and one leg, you can rearrange the formula to solve for the missing leg. For instance, if you know the values of $c$ and $a$, you can find $b$ using the rearranged formula:

$$
b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}
$$

Similarly, if you know $c$ and $b$, you can find $a$ through the formula:

$$
a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}
$$

As an example, consider a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse measuring $10 \, \text{cm}$ and one leg measuring $6 \, \text{cm}$. To find the length of the other leg, you would use the formula for $b$:

$$
b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}
$$

Substituting the known values, you get:

$$
b = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8
$$

Thus, the length of the other leg is $8 \, \text{cm}$.

This method is highly valuable for solving various problems involving right-angled triangles, whether in the fields of geometry, trigonometry, or practical applications such as construction and navigation.
