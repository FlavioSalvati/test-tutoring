To accurately plot the point $(-5, -3)$ on a graph, follow these steps:

First, it's important to understand that a graph consists of two axes: the horizontal axis, known as the x-axis, and the vertical axis, known as the y-axis. The coordinates of the point $(-5, -3)$ are provided in the format $(x, y)$, where $-5$ represents the x-coordinate and $-3$ represents the y-coordinate.

Begin by locating $-5$ on the x-axis. The x-axis extends horizontally, with negative values positioned to the left of the origin $(0, 0)$. Move left from the origin until you reach the point $-5$.

Next, turn your attention to the y-axis to find $-3$. The y-axis stretches vertically, where negative values are situated below the origin. Move downward from the origin until you arrive at $-3$.

Now, combine these two movements. Starting from the origin, move left along the x-axis to reach $-5$. From that position, move down to $-3$ along the y-axis. The intersection of these two paths marks the location of the point $(-5, -3)$ on the graph.

To finalize, mark this point with a dot and label it as $(-5, -3)$. This clarity will help indicate its exact position. Following this method ensures that you accurately plot the point on a Cartesian plane, which is essential for graphing equations and analyzing data in mathematics.
