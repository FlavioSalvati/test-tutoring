The equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by $y = x - 2$ can be expressed as $y = x + c$, where $c$ represents any constant value.

To understand why this is the case, let's recall that parallel lines share the same slope (or gradient). The original line, $y = x - 2$, can be rewritten in the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. In this instance, the slope $m$ is equal to $1$, as the coefficient of $x$ is $1$.

For a line to be parallel to $y = x - 2$, it must also have the same slope of $1$. Thus, the general equation for any line parallel to $y = x - 2$ can be formulated as $y = 1x + c$, which simplifies to $y = x + c$. Here, the constant $c$ represents the y-intercept of the new line, and it can take any real number value.

For instance, if we set $c = 3$, the equation of the parallel line would be $y = x + 3$. Alternatively, if we choose $c = -5$, the equation would then be $y = x - 5$. Regardless of the value of $c$, all these lines will maintain the same slope as the original line, thereby confirming their parallel nature.

In summary, the essential takeaway is that for lines to be parallel, they must have identical slopes. The y-intercept, represented by the constant $c$, can vary, resulting in a family of parallel lines all described by the equation $y = x + c$.
