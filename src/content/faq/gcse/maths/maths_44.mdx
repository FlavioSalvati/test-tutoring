If you're tasked with arranging percentages in ascending order, start by transforming each percentage into a decimal or a fraction. This process simplifies the comparison between them.

To convert a percentage into a decimal, you just need to divide the percentage by 100. For instance, 25% would become $0.25$, 50% would become $0.50$, and so on. You could also turn percentages into fractions. For instance, 25% could be expressed as $\frac{25}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{4}$.

Once all the percentages have been converted into decimals or fractions, you can then commence the comparison. Begin by looking at the whole numbers. If they're identical, move on to compare the decimal places or the numerators and denominators of the fractions. For instance, if you have $0.25$, $0.50$, and $0.75$, it's apparent that $0.25$ is the smallest number, followed by $0.50$, and finally $0.75$.

After comparison, list the percentages from the smallest to the largest. If you've converted them into decimals or fractions, you might choose to convert them back into percentages for your final list. For instance, if you started with 25%, 50%, and 75%, your final sorted list should read 25%, 50%, and 75% in ascending order.

Remember, the process of arranging percentages in ascending order is no different than sorting any other set of numbers. Convert, compare, and list them from smallest to largest. This method guarantees precision and renders the task straightforward.
