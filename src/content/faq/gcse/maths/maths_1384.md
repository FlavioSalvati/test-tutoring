To calculate the area of a triangle using the sine rule, you can apply the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin(C),
$$

where $ a $ and $ b $ represent the lengths of two sides of the triangle, and $ C $ is the measure of the included angle between those two sides.

To use this formula, you need to identify the two sides and the included angle in your triangle. For instance, consider a triangle with sides $ a = 5 \, \text{cm} $, $ b = 7 \, \text{cm} $, and the included angle $ C = 30^\circ $. You can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 7 \times \sin(30^\circ).
$$

Next, recall that $ \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 $. Thus, the area calculation simplifies to:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 7 \times 0.5.
$$

Now, let's perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. Calculate $ 5 \times 7 = 35 $.
2. Then, calculate $ 35 \times 0.5 = 17.5 $.
3. Finally, calculate $ \frac{1}{2} \times 17.5 = 8.75 $.

Therefore, the area of the triangle is 

$$
\text{Area} = 8.75 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

This method is particularly advantageous when the height of the triangle is not known, yet you possess sufficient information about the sides and angles.
