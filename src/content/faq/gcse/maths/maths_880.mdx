The cosine rule is a fundamental formula used to determine the length of a side in any triangle, not just right-angled triangles. It is expressed as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)
$$

In this equation, $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of two sides of the triangle, while $c$ is the length of the side opposite the angle $C$. The cosine rule establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides and the cosine of one of the angles, making it a powerful tool in trigonometry.

To effectively apply the cosine rule, follow these steps:

1. Identify the two sides ($a$ and $b$) and the included angle ($C$) that are known.
2. Substitute the known values into the formula $ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C) $.
3. Calculate the value of $c^2$ by performing the operations on the right-hand side of the equation.
4. Finally, take the square root of the result to find the length of side $c$.

For example, consider a triangle with sides $a = 5$ cm, $b = 7$ cm, and the included angle $C = 60^\circ$. We can substitute these values into the formula:

$$
c^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot \cos(60^\circ)
$$

Now, simplifying this expression yields:

$$
c^2 = 25 + 49 - 70 \cdot 0.5 = 25 + 49 - 35 = 39
$$

Thus, the length of side $c$ can be calculated as:

$$
c = \sqrt{39} \approx 6.24 \text{ cm}
$$

This example illustrates how the cosine rule can be effectively utilized to determine the length of a side in a triangle when certain measurements are known.
