The length of the arc is given as $2\pi$ cm.

To calculate the length of an arc, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r
$$

where $\theta$ represents the angle in degrees and $r$ is the radius of the circle. In this scenario, the radius $r$ is $3$ cm and the angle $\theta$ is $120^\circ$.

Let's begin by substituting the provided values into the formula:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{120}{360} \times 2\pi \times 3
$$

Next, we simplify the fraction $\frac{120}{360}$:

$$
\frac{120}{360} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

Now, we can substitute this simplified fraction back into the equation and multiply it by $2\pi \times 3$:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{1}{3} \times 2\pi \times 3
$$

Notice that the $3$s cancel out, which simplifies our equation to:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = 2\pi
$$

Therefore, the length of the arc is $2\pi$ cm. If you wish to express this length as a numerical value, you can approximate $\pi$ as $3.14$, resulting in:

$$
2\pi \approx 2 \times 3.14 = 6.28 \text{ cm}
$$

However, for most GCSE Maths problems, it is perfectly acceptable—and often preferred—to leave the answer in terms of $\pi$.
