To determine the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

In this formula, the term 'base' refers to the length of one side of the triangle, while 'height' represents the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. This formula is applicable to all types of triangles, including scalene, isosceles, and equilateral triangles.

For instance, consider a triangle with a base of $8$ cm and a height of $5$ cm. To find the area, substitute these values into the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 20 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

If the height is not directly provided, you may need to employ different methods to determine it. In the case of right-angled triangles, the height corresponds to one of the two sides that form the right angle. For other types of triangles, you might need to utilize trigonometric ratios or the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the height.

Moreover, if you know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle, you can apply Heron's formula to find the area. First, compute the semi-perimeter ($s$) of the triangle using the formula:

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides. Then, apply Heron's formula to calculate the area:

$$
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

By understanding these methods, you will be well-equipped to tackle a variety of problems involving the area of triangles in your GCSE Maths exams.
