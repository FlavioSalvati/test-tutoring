To determine the angle of elevation, we can utilize trigonometric ratios, specifically the tangent function. The relationship is given by:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

The angle of elevation is defined as the angle formed between a horizontal line and the line of sight to an object that is positioned above this horizontal line. To compute this angle, we can apply trigonometric ratios, which are fundamental in the study of right-angled triangles. The tangent function is the most commonly used ratio for this purpose.

In a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle $\theta$ is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

For instance, if you know the height of a building (the length of the opposite side) and the distance from the building (the length of the adjacent side), you can find the angle of elevation by rearranging the formula to solve for $\theta$:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\right)
$$

This means you would use a calculator to compute the inverse tangent, denoted as $\tan^{-1}$, of the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.

Consider an example where you are standing $50$ metres away from a building that is $30$ metres tall. To find the angle of elevation $\theta$, you would calculate:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{30}{50}\right)
$$

Using a calculator, you would find that:

$$
\theta \approx 30.96^\circ
$$

This result represents the angle of elevation from your position to the top of the building.
