The next term in the sequence $3, 9, 27, 81$ is $243$.

This sequence is an example of a geometric progression, where each term is derived by multiplying the preceding term by a constant factor. In this case, the constant factor is $3$. To determine the next term, you simply multiply the last term ($81$) by $3$. Thus, $81$ multiplied by $3$ equals $243$.

To clarify further, a geometric sequence has a common ratio between consecutive terms. Here, the first term is $3$, the second term is $9$ (which is $3 \times 3$), the third term is $27$ (which is $9 \times 3$), and the fourth term is $81$ (which is $27 \times 3$). This pattern demonstrates that each term is indeed $3$ times the previous term.

If you wish to find any term in this sequence, you can utilize the formula for the $n$th term of a geometric sequence, given by:

$$
a_n = a \times r^{(n-1)},
$$

where $a$ represents the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the term number. For this specific sequence, $a$ is $3$ and $r$ is also $3$. Therefore, to calculate the $5$th term, we would compute:

$$
3 \times 3^{(5-1)} = 3 \times 3^4 = 3 \times 81 = 243.
$$

Understanding geometric sequences is beneficial in various fields of mathematics and science, as they often model phenomena like exponential growth or decay, including population growth, radioactive decay, and interest calculations.
