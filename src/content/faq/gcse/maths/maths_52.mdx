The sum of $5.4$ and $3.2$ is $8.6$.

To compute the sum of two numbers, they need to be added together. In this scenario, we are summing $5.4$ and $3.2$. It's crucial when adding decimal numbers to align the decimal points precisely to ensure the calculation's accuracy.

Let's deconstruct this process into a series of steps:

1. Write the numbers vertically, making sure the decimal points are aligned:
```
$5.4$
$+ 3.2$
```
2. Add the numbers column by column, beginning with the rightmost digit. In this instance, you add $4$ and $2$, resulting in $6$. Write $6$ in the corresponding column.
3. Proceed to the next column to the left, which contains the whole numbers. Add $5$ and $3$ to get $8$. Write $8$ in the appropriate column.

Therefore, the sum of $5.4$ and $3.2$ is $8.6$. This method ensures the correct accounting of the place value of each digit, an essential aspect when dealing with decimals.

Mastering how to add decimal numbers is a basic competency in GCSE Maths, relevant to various real-life scenarios, including managing finances, measuring distances, and data analysis. Regular practice of this skill will boost your confidence in mathematical problem-solving.
