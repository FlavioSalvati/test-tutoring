The gradient of the line given by the equation $ y = 2x - 6 $ is $ 2 $.

In the equation of a straight line, which is commonly expressed in the form $ y = mx + c $, the gradient (or slope) is denoted by the coefficient $ m $. This coefficient indicates how steep the line is. In our specific equation $ y = 2x - 6 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 2 $. Therefore, we can conclude that the gradient of this line is $ 2 $.

To clarify this concept further, let's analyze what the gradient signifies. The gradient of a line measures the change in the $ y $-value for a unit change in the $ x $-value. A gradient of $ 2 $ implies that for every $ 1 $ unit increase in $ x $, the $ y $-value increases by $ 2 $ units. This results in a positive slope, indicating that the line rises as you move from left to right.

To visualize this on a graph, if you start at any point on the line and move $ 1 $ unit to the right (along the $ x $-axis), you will then need to move $ 2 $ units up (along the $ y $-axis) to remain on the line. This consistent ratio of rise to run is what defines the gradient.

Understanding gradients is essential in GCSE Maths, as it aids in analyzing the behavior of linear functions and their corresponding graphs. Furthermore, this knowledge provides a solid foundation for more advanced mathematical topics, such as calculus and differential equations.
