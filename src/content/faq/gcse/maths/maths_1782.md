To express the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ as a percentage, we find that it is equal to $75\%$.

To convert a fraction to a percentage, the process involves multiplying the fraction by $100$. This is because the term "percent" means "per hundred," which allows us to determine how many parts of $100$ the fraction represents. For the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, the calculation is as follows:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
$$

Thus, we conclude that $\frac{3}{4}$ is equivalent to $75\%$.

Another approach to understand this conversion is through division. If you divide $3$ by $4$, the result is $0.75$. To convert a decimal into a percentage, you multiply it by $100$. Therefore, multiplying $0.75$ by $100$ also yields $75\%$:

$$
0.75 \times 100 = 75
$$

This method of conversion is applicable to any fraction. For instance, consider the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$. To convert it to a percentage, you would multiply $1$ by $100$ and then divide by $2$, resulting in $50\%$:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
$$

Similarly, for the fraction $\frac{1}{5}$, you would multiply $1$ by $100$ and then divide by $5$, which gives you $20\%$:

$$
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
$$

Mastering the conversion of fractions to percentages is a valuable skill across various fields of mathematics, including probability, statistics, and in practical situations such as calculating discounts or interest rates.
