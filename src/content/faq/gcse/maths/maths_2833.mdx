To determine the translation vector from point A to point B, you need to subtract the coordinates of point A from those of point B.

A translation vector represents the direction and distance required to move from one point to another within a coordinate system. Let's denote point A with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and point B with coordinates $(x_2, y_2)$. The translation vector is obtained by calculating the differences between the corresponding coordinates of points A and B. This involves separately determining the difference in the $x$-coordinates and the difference in the $y$-coordinates.

Mathematically, the translation vector $ \vec{T} $ from point A to point B can be expressed as:

$$
\vec{T} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1)
$$

For instance, if point A is located at $(3, 4)$ and point B is at $(7, 10)$, you would perform the following calculations:

$$
x_2 - x_1 = 7 - 3 = 4
$$

$$
y_2 - y_1 = 10 - 4 = 6
$$

Thus, the translation vector $ \vec{T} $ from point A to point B is $(4, 6)$. This indicates that to move from point A to point B, you need to shift 4 units to the right and 6 units upward.

Understanding translation vectors is essential in various fields of mathematics, as they facilitate the visualization of how shapes and points move within a coordinate plane. This concept is fundamental in geometry and is frequently applied in transformations and vector analysis.
