To solve the equation $3x + 5 = 14$, we will follow a systematic approach by first subtracting $5$ from both sides and then dividing by $3$.

Let's break the process down step by step. The equation we have is:

$$
3x + 5 = 14
$$

Our objective is to isolate the variable $x$ on one side of the equation.

**Step 1:** Begin by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting $5$ from both sides:

$$
3x + 5 - 5 = 14 - 5
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
3x = 9
$$

**Step 2:** Next, we need to isolate $x$. To achieve this, we will divide both sides of the equation by $3$:

$$
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{9}{3}
$$

This results in:

$$
x = 3
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation $3x + 5 = 14$ is $x = 3$.

To verify our solution, we can substitute $x = 3$ back into the original equation:

$$
3(3) + 5 = 14
$$

Calculating the left side, we find:

$$
9 + 5 = 14
$$
$$
14 = 14
$$

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution $x = 3$ is indeed correct. 

This method of solving linear equations by isolating the variable is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths and will prove valuable for tackling more complex problems in the future.
