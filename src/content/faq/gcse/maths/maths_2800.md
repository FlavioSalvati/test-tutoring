To perform a 90° clockwise rotation about the origin, you need to swap the coordinates of the point and then change the sign of the new y-coordinate.

When rotating a point $(x, y)$ by 90° clockwise around the origin, the new coordinates of the point will be $(y, -x)$. This transformation occurs because of how the coordinate axes are reoriented during the rotation. Visualize the x-axis and y-axis rotating 90° clockwise: the x-axis moves to the position previously occupied by the y-axis, while the y-axis shifts to where the negative x-axis was.

For instance, consider the point $(3, 4)$. To rotate this point 90° clockwise, you first swap the coordinates to obtain $(4, 3)$, and then change the sign of the new y-coordinate, resulting in $(4, -3)$. Thus, the point $(3, 4)$ transforms into $(4, -3)$ after the rotation.

This method is applicable to any point on the coordinate plane. For example, if you have the point $(-2, 5)$, swapping the coordinates yields $(5, -2)$. Changing the sign of the new y-coordinate results in $(5, 2)$. Therefore, the point $(-2, 5)$ becomes $(5, 2)$ after a 90° clockwise rotation.

It is important to note that this rule specifically applies to rotations around the origin. If you need to rotate a point around a different location, additional steps will be necessary. However, for GCSE Maths, focusing on rotations about the origin is typically sufficient.
