A point located on the x-axis has coordinates where the y-coordinate is consistently zero.

In a Cartesian coordinate system, any point on the x-axis will have a y-coordinate of zero. This is because the x-axis is defined as the horizontal line that extends left and right through the origin, which is represented by the coordinates $(0,0)$. For instance, the points $(3,0)$, $(-5,0)$, and $(7.5,0)$ all lie on the x-axis. Although the x-coordinate can be any real number—whether positive or negative—the y-coordinate must always be zero.

To visualize this, consider a graph where the x-axis and y-axis intersect at the origin. Any point placed directly on the x-axis will not deviate vertically from this line, ensuring that the y-coordinate remains zero. This principle is fundamental in coordinate geometry and is essential for comprehending how points are situated in a two-dimensional space.

When addressing problems or plotting points, it is important to remember that if a point lies on the x-axis, you can instantly assign its y-coordinate a value of zero. This simplification streamlines many calculations and aids in quickly determining the relative positions of points with respect to the axes.
