The area of a sector with a radius of $5$ cm and an angle of $90^\circ$ is given as $6.25\pi$ cm².

To determine the area of a sector, you need to know both the radius of the circle and the angle of the sector. The formula for calculating the area of a sector is:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2 
$$

where $\theta$ represents the angle in degrees and $r$ denotes the radius of the circle.

In this example, the radius $r$ is $5$ cm, and the angle $\theta$ is $90^\circ$. Substituting these values into the formula, we proceed as follows:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{90}{360} \times \pi \times (5)^2 
$$

First, we simplify the fraction $\frac{90}{360}$:

$$ 
\frac{90}{360} = \frac{1}{4} 
$$

Next, we compute $5^2$:

$$ 
5^2 = 25 
$$

Now, we multiply these results together:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \times \pi \times 25 
$$

This simplifies to:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{25}{4} \times \pi 
$$

Finally, we can express the area as:

$$ 
\text{Area} = 6.25\pi 
$$

Thus, the area of the sector is $6.25\pi$ cm². If you prefer a numerical approximation, you can use $3.14$ as an estimate for $\pi$:

$$ 
6.25 \times 3.14 \approx 19.625 
$$

Consequently, the area of the sector is approximately $19.625$ cm².
