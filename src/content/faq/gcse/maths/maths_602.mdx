To identify a negative correlation in a scatter plot, observe whether the points slope downwards from left to right.

A scatter plot is a graphical representation that displays the values of two variables for a given set of data. In this plot, each pair of variables is represented by a point on the graph. To determine the presence of a negative correlation, examine the overall trend of the points. If the points tend to descend as you move from the left side of the graph to the right, this indicates a negative correlation. In other words, as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.

For instance, consider a scenario where you plot the number of hours studied against the number of mistakes made on a test. If the scatter plot reveals that an increase in hours studied corresponds to a decrease in mistakes made, the points will create a downward slope. This downward trend serves as a clear indication of a negative correlation.

Mathematically, a negative correlation is represented by a correlation coefficient, typically denoted as $r$, that falls within the range of $(-1, 0)$. The closer the value of $r$ is to $-1$, the stronger the negative correlation. However, for GCSE Maths purposes, it is often sufficient to recognize the pattern visually without needing to calculate the exact correlation coefficient.

In summary, when analyzing a scatter plot, pay attention to the overall direction of the points. If they slope downwards from left to right, you have successfully identified a negative correlation.
