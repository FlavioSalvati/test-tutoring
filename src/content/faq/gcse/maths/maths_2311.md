The distance between the points $(1, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$ is $5$ units.

To calculate the distance between two points on a coordinate plane, we utilize the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The distance formula is expressed as:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points, we assign $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (4, 6)$.

First, we calculate the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates as follows:
$$
x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 1 = 3
$$
$$
y_2 - y_1 = 6 - 2 = 4
$$

Next, we square these differences:
$$
(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 3^2 = 9
$$
$$
(y_2 - y_1)^2 = 4^2 = 16
$$

We then sum these squared differences:
$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this result to determine the distance:
$$
\sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Thus, the distance between the points $(1, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$ is indeed $5$ units. This method can be applied to any pair of points on a coordinate plane, making it an invaluable tool in geometry.
