To find the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = 2x + 4 $ and passes through the point $ (3, 2) $, we start by determining the slope of the original line.

The slope of the given line $ y = 2x + 4 $ is $ 2 $. For a line to be perpendicular to this one, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of $ 2 $. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line is 

$$
-\frac{1}{2}.
$$

Next, we will use the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is given by 

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),
$$ 

where $ m $ is the slope and $ (x_1, y_1) $ is a point on the line. In this case, we have $ m = -\frac{1}{2} $ and the point $ (3, 2) $.

Now, we can substitute these values into the point-slope form:

$$
y - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 3).
$$

Next, we will simplify this equation. Distributing the slope on the right side yields:

$$
y - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}.
$$

To isolate $ y $, we add $ 2 $ to both sides. We can express $ 2 $ as a fraction with a common denominator:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{4}{2}.
$$

Now, we can combine the fractions on the right side:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{7}{2}.
$$

Thus, the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = 2x + 4 $ and passes through the point $ (3, 2) $ is 

$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{7}{2}.
$$
