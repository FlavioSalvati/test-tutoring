The range of the function $ y = \cos(x) $ is given by the interval $[-1, 1]$.

The cosine function, represented as $ \cos(x) $, is a fundamental trigonometric function that relates an angle $ x $ to the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. When we discuss the range of a function, we refer to all the possible output values that the function can produce. For the function $ y = \cos(x) $, the output values are confined to the interval $[-1, 1]$, inclusive. This indicates that regardless of the angle $ x $ that you input into the cosine function, the result will always fall within the range of -1 to 1.

To understand why this restriction exists, consider the unit circle, which is a circle with a radius of $1$ centered at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate plane. The cosine of an angle $ x $ corresponds to the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle associated with that angle. Since the radius of the unit circle is $1$, the x-coordinate (and consequently the cosine value) can never be less than $-1$ or greater than $1$. This geometric perspective clarifies why the range of $ y = \cos(x) $ is confined to $[-1, 1]$.

Furthermore, the cosine function exhibits periodicity with a period of $ 2\pi $. This means that the function's values repeat every $ 2\pi $ units along the x-axis. Despite this periodic behavior, the maximum value of $ \cos(x) $ remains consistently $1$, while the minimum value is consistently $-1$. This reinforces the notion that the range of the function is indeed limited to $[-1, 1]$. Understanding this property is crucial in various fields, such as wave analysis and signal processing, where recognizing the limits of a function's output is essential for accurate interpretation and application.
