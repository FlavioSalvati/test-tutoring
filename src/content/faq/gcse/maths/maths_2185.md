To determine the $ n $-th term of a sequence, it is essential to identify the underlying pattern and formulate a corresponding expression.

Begin by analyzing the sequence to ascertain whether it is arithmetic or geometric. An arithmetic sequence is characterized by a constant difference between consecutive terms, while a geometric sequence involves a constant ratio between successive terms.

For an arithmetic sequence, the $ n $-th term can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a_n = a + (n-1)d
$$

where $ a $ represents the first term and $ d $ denotes the common difference. For example, consider the sequence $ 3, 7, 11, 15 $. Here, the first term $ a $ is $ 3 $ and the common difference $ d $ is $ 4 $. Consequently, the formula for the $ n $-th term becomes:

$$
a_n = 3 + (n-1) \times 4
$$

On the other hand, in a geometric sequence, the $ n $-th term is derived using the formula:

$$
a_n = a \times r^{(n-1)}
$$

where $ a $ is the first term and $ r $ is the common ratio. For instance, in the sequence $ 2, 6, 18, 54 $, the first term $ a $ is $ 2 $ and the common ratio $ r $ is $ 3 $. Thus, the $ n $-th term formula is:

$$
a_n = 2 \times 3^{(n-1)}
$$

If the sequence does not conform to either of these simple types, you may need to investigate other patterns or calculate the differences between terms to identify a polynomial or alternative function that fits the sequence. In some cases, sequences may be more intricate, involving quadratic or higher-order terms. For such scenarios, methods like the method of differences may be necessary to accurately determine the $ n $-th term.
