The second derivative of the function $ y = x^5 $ is given by 

$$ y'' = 20x^3. $$

To derive this, we first need to compute the first derivative of $ y = x^5 $. The first derivative, denoted as $ y' $ or $ \frac{dy}{dx} $, measures the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $. We apply the power rule for differentiation, which states that if $ y = x^n $, then 

$$ y' = nx^{n-1}. $$

Using the power rule on $ y = x^5 $, we find:

$$ y' = 5x^4. $$

Next, we proceed to find the second derivative, denoted as $ y'' $ or $ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} $. The second derivative indicates how the rate of change of the first derivative is itself changing, effectively illustrating how the slope of the original function varies. To calculate $ y'' $, we differentiate $ y' = 5x^4 $ once more, applying the power rule again:

$$ y'' = 20x^3. $$

Thus, the second derivative of $ y = x^5 $ is 

$$ y'' = 20x^3. $$ 

This result reveals that the rate at which the slope of the function $ y = x^5 $ changes is proportional to $ x^3 $, with a scaling factor of 20. Understanding second derivatives is crucial for analyzing the concavity and identifying inflection points of functions, which are fundamental concepts in calculus.
