The cube root of $27$ is $3$.

To grasp this concept, let's first clarify what a cube root is. The cube root of a number can be defined as a value that, when multiplied by itself three times (or cubed), results in the original number. Mathematically, if $x$ is the cube root of $y$, then it follows that:

$$
x^3 = y
$$

For the specific case of $27$, we need to identify a number that, when raised to the power of three, equals $27$. Let's evaluate the number $3$:

$$
3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27
$$

Since this equation holds true, we can confidently conclude that the cube root of $27$ is indeed $3$.

Another perspective involves using prime factorization. We can express the number $27$ as the product of its prime factors:

$$
27 = 3 \times 3 \times 3
$$

This factorization indicates that $27$ is composed of three instances of the number $3$ multiplied together. Therefore, the cube root of $27$ is the number that appears three times in this factorization, which is $3$.

Understanding cube roots is essential in various fields of mathematics, such as solving equations and analyzing geometric shapes. For instance, if you know the volume of a cube and need to determine the length of one of its sides, you would utilize the cube root. In this scenario, if a cube has a volume of $27$ cubic units, then each side of the cube would measure $3$ units in length.
