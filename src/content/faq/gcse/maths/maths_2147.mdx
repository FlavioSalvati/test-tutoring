The equation representing half of $x$ plus $5$ can be expressed as: 

$$ 
\frac{x}{2} + 5 
$$ 

Let's break this down for clarity. The phrase "half of $x$" mathematically translates to dividing $x$ by $2$, which is represented as $ \frac{x}{2} $. Next, we add $5$ to this value. Therefore, we combine $ \frac{x}{2} $ and $5$ to arrive at the equation $ \frac{x}{2} + 5 $.

This equation is a linear expression, indicating that it will graph as a straight line on a coordinate plane. In this expression, $ \frac{x}{2} $ represents the variable component, while $5$ is the constant term. The variable changes depending on the value of $x$, while the constant remains unchanged.

To illustrate this with examples: if $x$ is $4$, then half of $4$ is $2$, and adding $5$ results in $7$. Thus, when $x = 4$, we have 

$$ 
\frac{4}{2} + 5 = 7 
$$ 

Similarly, if $x$ is $10$, then half of $10$ is $5$, and adding $5$ yields $10$. Therefore, when $x = 10$, we find 

$$ 
\frac{10}{2} + 5 = 10 
$$ 

Grasping how to formulate and interpret such equations is crucial in GCSE Maths, as it lays the foundation for solving various algebraic problems and understanding the relationships between different variables.
