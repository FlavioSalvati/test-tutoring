The expression $(5^2) \times (5^{-3})$ evaluates to $\frac{1}{5}$.

To comprehend why this is true, let's analyze it step by step. One of the fundamental rules of exponents states that when you multiply powers with the same base, you add their exponents. In our case, the base is $5$, with exponents $2$ and $-3$.

We begin with the expression $(5^2) \times (5^{-3})$. Applying the rule of exponents, we combine the exponents as follows:

$$
5^{2 + (-3)} = 5^{2 - 3} = 5^{-1}.
$$

The expression $5^{-1}$ represents the reciprocal of $5$, which can be expressed as $\frac{1}{5}$. This relationship arises because a negative exponent indicates that we take the reciprocal of the base raised to the corresponding positive exponent. In simpler terms, $5^{-1}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{(5^1)}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{5}$.

Thus, we find that $(5^2) \times (5^{-3})$ indeed equals $\frac{1}{5}$. This example effectively demonstrates how a solid understanding of the rules of exponents can simplify what may initially seem like complex expressions. Always remember: when multiplying powers with the same base, simply add the exponents; if you end up with a negative exponent, it indicates that you should take the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent.
