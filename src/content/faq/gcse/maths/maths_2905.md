To express the vector **r**, we can decompose it into its horizontal and vertical components.

A vector is defined as a quantity that possesses both magnitude (size) and direction. When breaking down a vector **r**, we focus on its components along the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) directions. These components are crucial for understanding the vector's overall behavior.

Consider a vector **r** that originates from the point (0, 0) and terminates at the point $(x, y)$. The horizontal component of this vector corresponds to the distance moved along the x-axis, which is represented by the x-coordinate. Similarly, the vertical component reflects the distance moved along the y-axis, denoted by the y-coordinate.

If the vector **r** ends at the point $(x, y)$, we can express it mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{r} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j}
$$

In this expression, the symbols $\mathbf{i}$ and $\mathbf{j}$ denote unit vectors. Specifically, $\mathbf{i}$ is the unit vector in the horizontal direction (along the x-axis), while $\mathbf{j}$ is the unit vector in the vertical direction (along the y-axis).

For instance, if the vector **r** concludes at the point $(3, 4)$, we can represent it as:

$$
\mathbf{r} = 3\mathbf{i} + 4\mathbf{j}
$$

This representation indicates that the vector **r** comprises a horizontal component of 3 units and a vertical component of 4 units. By summing these components, we obtain the complete vector **r**. This method of component analysis proves invaluable, particularly in the fields of physics and engineering, as it simplifies the manipulation and understanding of vectors in various applications.
