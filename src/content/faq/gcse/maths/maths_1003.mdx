The length of the line segment connecting the points $(0, 0)$ and $(3, 4)$ is 5 units.

To determine the length of a line segment between two points in the coordinate plane, we employ the distance formula. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is expressed as:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In our specific case, the coordinates of the two points are $(0, 0)$ and $(3, 4)$. Therefore, we have $ x_1 = 0 $, $ y_1 = 0 $, $ x_2 = 3 $, and $ y_2 = 4 $. Substituting these values into the distance formula yields:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2}
$$
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}
$$
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{9 + 16}
$$
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{25}
$$
$$
\text{Distance} = 5
$$

Thus, the length of the line segment from $(0, 0)$ to $(3, 4)$ is indeed 5 units.

This method is effective because the distance formula calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle formed by the horizontal and vertical distances between the two points. In this example, the horizontal distance (often referred to as the "run") is 3 units, while the vertical distance (known as the "rise") is 4 units. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides, thus confirming that the hypotenuse measures 5 units. This scenario is a classic illustration frequently used to demonstrate the distance formula in coordinate geometry.
