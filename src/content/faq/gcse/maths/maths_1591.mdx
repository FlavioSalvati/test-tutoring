Data is classified as ordinal when it can be ranked or ordered, but the intervals between the values are not consistent or equal.

To assess whether data is ordinal, one should check if it can be arranged in a meaningful sequence. For instance, consider restaurant ratings: poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent. These ratings can be organized from worst to best, yet the differences between each rating are not necessarily uniform. This characteristic defines the data as ordinal.

Another illustration of ordinal data is the finishing positions in a race: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so forth. While these positions can be ranked, the time differences between them are not the focus, affirming that this is also ordinal data.

Ordinal data is distinct from nominal data, which lacks a meaningful order. For example, the colors of cars (red, blue, green) represent nominal data because there is no intrinsic ranking among them. Additionally, ordinal data differs from interval data, where the distances between values are equal, such as temperature measured in degrees Celsius.

When analyzing ordinal data, it is appropriate to use measures like the median or mode. However, the mean should not be employed, as the intervals between data points are not consistent. Ordinal data is commonly encountered in surveys and questionnaires, where respondents rank their preferences or opinions.
