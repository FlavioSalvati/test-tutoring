The gradient of the line represented by the equation 

$$ 
y = -2x + 4 
$$ 

is $-2$.

In the standard form of a linear equation, expressed as 

$$ 
y = mx + c, 
$$ 

the gradient (or slope) is indicated by the coefficient $m$. This coefficient reflects the steepness and direction of the line. In the equation $y = -2x + 4$, the coefficient of $x$ is $-2$, which means the gradient of the line is $-2$.

The gradient quantifies how much the $y$-value changes in response to changes in the $x$-value. Specifically, a gradient of $-2$ indicates that for every increase of $1$ unit in $x$, the $y$-value decreases by $2$ units. This negative gradient signifies that the line slopes downward from left to right.

Grasping the concept of gradient is essential for analyzing the behavior of linear functions. A positive gradient suggests that the line inclines upwards, whereas a negative gradient indicates a downward slope. A gradient of zero would imply that the line is horizontal, indicating no change in the $y$-value as the $x$-value varies.

In summary, the gradient of $-2$ in the equation 

$$ 
y = -2x + 4 
$$ 

indicates that the line is decreasing; it falls by $2$ units vertically for every $1$ unit it moves horizontally to the right. This concept is fundamental in GCSE Maths, as it aids in graphing and interpreting linear relationships.
