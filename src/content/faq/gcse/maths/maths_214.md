The area beneath a speed-time graph represents the total distance traveled by an object.

In a typical speed-time graph, the x-axis denotes time, while the y-axis indicates speed. The area under the curve of this graph quantifies the total distance traveled during the specified time interval. This relationship exists because distance is defined as the product of speed and time. The area under the graph effectively sums these small products over the entire duration.

To compute this area, it may be necessary to decompose it into simpler geometric shapes, such as rectangles, triangles, or trapezoids, particularly when the graph is not a straightforward straight line. For instance, if the graph depicts a straight horizontal line, the area can be calculated as the product of speed and time, given by the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{speed} \times \text{time}.
$$

In cases where the graph forms a triangle, you would apply the formula for the area of a triangle:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height},
$$

where the base corresponds to the time and the height corresponds to the speed.

For more complex scenarios involving curves or multiple segments, you will need to sum the areas of the various shapes. While this process is known as integration in advanced mathematics, at the GCSE level, you can typically rely on basic geometric shapes to perform these calculations.

Grasping this concept is essential, as it enables you to analyze real-world situations, such as determining how far a car has traveled over a specific period, given its varying speeds. This skill is not only invaluable for examinations but also applicable in everyday life.
