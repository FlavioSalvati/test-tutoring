The equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by $y = 2x - 1$ can be expressed as $y = 2x + c$, where $c$ represents any constant.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same gradient (or slope). In the equation $y = mx + c$, the gradient is indicated by the coefficient of $x$, which is $m$. In the specific case of the equation $y = 2x - 1$, the gradient is $2$. Consequently, any line that is parallel to this line must also possess a gradient of $2$.

To formulate the equation of a parallel line, we maintain the same gradient and adjust the y-intercept, represented by the constant term $c$. The y-intercept is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis. For the original equation $y = 2x - 1$, the y-intercept is $-1$. For a line that is parallel, the y-intercept can take any value, denoted as $c$.

For instance, if we select $c = 3$, the equation of the parallel line would be $y = 2x + 3$. Alternatively, if we choose $c = -4$, the equation would be $y = 2x - 4$. The crucial aspect is that the gradient remains $2$, ensuring that the lines are indeed parallel.

In summary, the general form of the equation for a line parallel to $y = 2x - 1$ is $y = 2x + c$, where $c$ can be any real number. This allows for an infinite number of parallel lines, each differing in y-intercept but maintaining the same gradient.
