To estimate values using the line of best fit, you need to determine the corresponding $y$-value for a given $x$-value on the line.

The line of best fit, often referred to as the trend line, is a straight line that best represents the data points displayed in a scatter plot. To create this line, it should be positioned in such a way that it minimizes the distance to all data points. You can draw the line by eye or calculate it using statistical methods.

Once the line of best fit is established, it can be used for making predictions. For instance, if you wish to estimate the $y$-value for a specific $x$-value, locate the $x$-value on the horizontal axis. Then, move vertically until you intersect the line of best fit. From this intersection point, move horizontally to the $y$-axis to find the corresponding $y$-value. This $y$-value represents your estimated value.

This approach is particularly beneficial when you have a collection of data points and need to predict future values or fill in missing data. It is essential to note that the accuracy of your estimates relies on how well the line of best fit mirrors the data. If the data points are closely clustered around the line, your estimates are likely to be more accurate. Conversely, if the data points are widely dispersed, the estimates may be less reliable.
