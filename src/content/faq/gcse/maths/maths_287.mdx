Here is the enhanced content for clarity and readability:

The equation of the line that passes through the point $(3, 2)$ with a slope of $5$ is given by 

$$ y = 5x - 13. $$

To derive the equation of a line, we utilize the slope-intercept form, which is expressed as 

$$ y = mx + c, $$ 

where $m$ represents the slope and $c$ denotes the y-intercept. In our case, we have the slope $m = 5$ and a point on the line, $(3, 2)$. We can substitute these values into the equation to find the y-intercept $c$.

First, we substitute the slope and the coordinates of the point into the slope-intercept equation:

$$ 2 = 5(3) + c. $$

Next, we solve for $c$:

$$ 2 = 15 + c $$

Subtracting $15$ from both sides yields:

$$ c = 2 - 15 $$

Thus,

$$ c = -13. $$

With the slope $m = 5$ and the y-intercept $c = -13$ now determined, we can finalize the equation of the line:

$$ y = 5x - 13. $$

This equation indicates that for any given value of $x$, the corresponding value of $y$ can be calculated by multiplying $x$ by $5$ and then subtracting $13$. For instance, if $x = 0$, then 

$$ y = -13, $$ 

and if $x = 1$, then 

$$ y = -8. $$ 

This linear relationship is consistent with both the specified slope and the point through which the line passes.
