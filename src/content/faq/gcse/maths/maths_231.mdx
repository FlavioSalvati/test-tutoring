The domain of the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is defined as $ x \geq 0 $.

To elaborate, the domain of a function refers to the set of all possible input values (or $ x $-values) that yield a valid output. For the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $, it is essential to determine when the square root operation is defined. The square root of a number is only defined for non-negative values, which means that $ x $ must be greater than or equal to zero. If $ x $ is negative, the square root does not yield a real number, making it invalid in this context.

In simpler terms, you can input any non-negative number into the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ and receive a real number as the output. For instance, if $ x = 0 $, then $ y = \sqrt{0} = 0 $. Similarly, if $ x = 4 $, then $ y = \sqrt{4} = 2 $. However, if you attempt to input a negative number, such as $ x = -1 $, the function $ y = \sqrt{-1} $ does not produce a real number, thus it is excluded from the domain.

In conclusion, the domain of $ y = \sqrt{x} $ comprises all non-negative numbers, which can be expressed in interval notation as $ [0, \infty) $. This indicates that any value from $ 0 $ to positive infinity can be used as a valid input for $ x $.
