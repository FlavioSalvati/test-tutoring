The maximum possible error when rounding $3.45$ to two decimal places is $0.005$.

When rounding a number to a specified number of decimal places, we approximate it to the nearest value at that level of precision. For example, when we round $3.45$ to two decimal places, the original value could range from $3.445$ to $3.454999...$ (repeating). This range includes all numbers that would round to $3.45$ at two decimal places.

To determine the maximum possible error, we need to examine the midpoint between $3.445$ and $3.455$. The difference between $3.45$ and $3.445$ is $0.005$, and similarly, the difference between $3.45$ and $3.455$ is also $0.005$. Consequently, the maximum possible error when rounding $3.45$ to two decimal places is indeed $0.005$.

This implies that the true value of the number could vary by as much as $0.005$ above or below $3.45$. Understanding this concept is crucial as it allows us to assess the accuracy of our rounded values and be mindful of the small errors that can arise from rounding. This awareness is especially important in scientific calculations and measurements, where precision plays a vital role.
