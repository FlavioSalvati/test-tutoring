To find the total time of $2$ hours and $30$ minutes plus $1$ hour and $45$ minutes, we can calculate the sum step by step, resulting in a total of $4$ hours and $15$ minutes.

First, we will add the hours together. We have:

$$
2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}.
$$

Next, we will add the minutes:

$$
30 \text{ minutes} + 45 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Since $75$ minutes exceeds an hour, we need to convert this into hours and minutes. We know that there are $60$ minutes in an hour, so we can perform the conversion:

$$
75 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} + 15 \text{ minutes} \quad (\text{because } 75 - 60 = 15).
$$

Now, we combine this extra hour with the previous total of $3$ hours:

$$
3 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 4 \text{ hours}.
$$

Finally, we add the remaining $15$ minutes:

Therefore, the total time amounts to:

$$
4 \text{ hours} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ hours and } 15 \text{ minutes}.
$$

This systematic approach—adding hours first, then minutes, and converting when necessary—ensures accuracy and clarity in the calculation process.
