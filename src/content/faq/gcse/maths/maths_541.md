The probability of drawing a king followed by a queen without replacement is given by the fraction $\frac{4}{663}$, which is approximately $0.00603$.

To clarify this calculation, letâ€™s analyze the process step by step. A standard deck of cards consists of $52$ cards, divided into $4$ suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains $13$ cards, including one king and one queen. Hence, there are a total of $4$ kings and $4$ queens in the entire deck.

When you draw the first card, the probability of it being a king is calculated as follows: there are $4$ kings in a deck of $52$ cards. This probability can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{4}{52}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{13}$.

Once you have drawn a king, you do not replace it, leaving $51$ cards remaining in the deck. Among these, there are still $4$ queens. Therefore, the probability of drawing a queen following the king is $\frac{4}{51}$.

To determine the overall probability of both events occurring (drawing a king first, followed by a queen), you multiply the probabilities of each individual event:

$$
\left(\frac{1}{13}\right) \times \left(\frac{4}{51}\right) = \frac{4}{663}.
$$

This fraction represents the probability of drawing a king first and then a queen without replacement. If you prefer to express this as a decimal, you can calculate $\frac{4}{663}$, which results in approximately $0.00603$. This indicates that there is a very small chance, about $0.603\%$, of drawing a king followed by a queen in this manner.
