In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to $180$ degrees.

A cyclic quadrilateral is defined as a four-sided figure with all its vertices located on the circumference of a circle. This unique property leads to the important characteristic that the opposite angles in such a quadrilateral sum to $180$ degrees, distinguishing cyclic quadrilaterals from other types of quadrilaterals.

To grasp why this property holds, we can explore the relationships between angles and arcs in the context of circles. In a cyclic quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles subtends the same arc of the circle. According to circle theorems, the angle subtended by an arc at the center of the circle is twice the angle subtended by that arc at any point on the circumference. Consequently, when examining two opposite angles, their combined measure equals the angle subtended by the entire circle, which is $360$ degrees. Because each pair of opposite angles subtends half of the circle, their total measure is half of $360$ degrees, resulting in $180$ degrees.

This property is particularly useful for solving a variety of geometric problems and proofs. For instance, if you know the measures of three angles in a cyclic quadrilateral, you can easily determine the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the known angles from $360$ degrees. Furthermore, this relationship can be employed to demonstrate that a given quadrilateral is cyclic if you can establish that its opposite angles are supplementary.
