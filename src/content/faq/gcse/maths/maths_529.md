The expected frequency of an event can be calculated based on its probability and the total number of trials. In this case, we have an event with a probability of $0.5$ occurring over $80$ trials. 

To clarify, the expected frequency serves as a prediction of how often we anticipate the event to happen based on its probability. A probability of $0.5$ indicates that there is a $50\%$ chance of the event occurring in any given trial.

To find the expected frequency, we multiply the probability by the number of trials:

$$ 
\text{Expected Frequency} = \text{Probability} \times \text{Number of Trials} 
$$

Substituting the values, we have:

$$ 
\text{Expected Frequency} = 0.5 \times 80 
$$

Calculating this gives us:

$$ 
\text{Expected Frequency} = 40 
$$

Thus, from $80$ trials, we would expect the event to occur approximately $40$ times. It is crucial to note that this value represents an average expectation. In practice, the actual number of occurrences may vary slightly due to the randomness inherent in each trial. However, over a larger number of trials, the average outcome should converge closely to the expected frequency.

Grasping the concept of expected frequency is essential in various fields of mathematics and science, as it aids in predicting outcomes and analyzing data. For instance, if you were to flip a fair coin $80$ times, you would expect it to land on heads about $40$ times, since the probability of landing on heads is $0.5$.
