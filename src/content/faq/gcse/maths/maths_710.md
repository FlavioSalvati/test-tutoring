The number $4,500,000$ can be expressed in standard form as $4.5 \times 10^6$.

Standard form, commonly referred to as scientific notation, is a method for representing very large or very small numbers in a more concise and manageable way. This notation is particularly useful in fields such as science and engineering, where such numbers frequently arise. To convert a number into standard form, one must express it as a product of a coefficient that is at least $1$ but less than $10$, multiplied by a power of $10$.

For the number $4,500,000$, we begin by identifying the significant digits, which are $4.5$. Next, we determine how many places the decimal point must be moved to revert $4.5$ back to $4,500,000$. In this case, the decimal point needs to be moved $6$ places to the right. Consequently, we multiply $4.5$ by $10^6$ (since shifting the decimal point $6$ places to the right is equivalent to multiplying by $10^6$).

Therefore, $4,500,000$ in standard form is expressed as:

$$
4.5 \times 10^6
$$

This notation simplifies the reading, writing, and computation of very large numbers, making it particularly advantageous for mathematical calculations.
