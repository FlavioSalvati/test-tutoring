To find an angle using the cosine rule, you need to rearrange the formula to isolate the angle.

The cosine rule is a valuable tool in trigonometry for determining unknown sides or angles in any triangle, not just right-angled ones. The standard form of the cosine rule is given by:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)
$$

In this equation, $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle, while $ C $ is the angle opposite side $ c $.

To find the angle $ C $, you can rearrange the cosine rule to solve for $ \cos(C) $. Start by isolating $ \cos(C) $:

$$
\cos(C) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
$$

Once you have expressed $ \cos(C) $ in this way, you can determine the angle $ C $ by taking the inverse cosine (also referred to as arccos) of the result:

$$
C = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} \right)
$$

For instance, consider a triangle with sides $ a = 5 $, $ b = 7 $, and $ c = 8 $. You would substitute these values into the rearranged formula:

$$
\cos(C) = \frac{5^2 + 7^2 - 8^2}{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7} = \frac{25 + 49 - 64}{70} = \frac{10}{70} = \frac{1}{7}
$$

Next, to find the angle $ C $, compute the inverse cosine of $ \frac{1}{7} $:

$$
C = \cos^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{7} \right)
$$

Using a calculator, you would find that $ C \approx 81.79^\circ $. This method provides an accurate way to determine the angle, provided you know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle.
