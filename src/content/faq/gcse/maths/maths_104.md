To convert the decimal $0.25$ into a percentage, you need to multiply it by $100$ and then append the percentage symbol.

When you convert a decimal to a percentage, you are essentially determining how many parts out of $100$ the decimal represents. This is accomplished by multiplying the decimal value by $100$. For instance, if we take $0.25$, the calculation would be:

$$
0.25 \times 100 = 25
$$

Thus, $0.25$ expressed as a percentage is $25\%$.

Another way to conceptualize this conversion is by shifting the decimal point two places to the right. Starting with $0.25$, moving the decimal point two places right transforms it into $25.0$. After this adjustment, you simply add the percentage symbol ($\%$) to indicate that the value is a percentage. Therefore, $0.25$ becomes $25\%$.

Understanding this conversion process is crucial, as percentages are frequently used to express proportions and comparisons in daily life, including discounts, statistical data, and academic grades. By mastering this straightforward conversion technique, you will be better equipped to interpret and communicate numerical information in a more accessible format.
