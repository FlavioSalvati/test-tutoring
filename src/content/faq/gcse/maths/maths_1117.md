To calculate the angles in an isosceles triangle, we can utilize the properties of equal sides and the sum of the interior angles.

In an isosceles triangle, two sides are of equal length, which means that the angles opposite these equal sides are also equal. We can represent the equal angles as $ \theta $ and the third angle as $ \alpha $. According to the fundamental property of triangles, the sum of all interior angles is always $ 180^\circ $. Therefore, we can express this relationship with the following equation:

$$
2\theta + \alpha = 180^\circ
$$

If you are given the measure of the third angle $ \alpha $, you can determine the equal angles $ \theta $ by rearranging the equation:

$$
\theta = \frac{180^\circ - \alpha}{2}
$$

For example, if the third angle $ \alpha $ measures $ 40^\circ $, the calculation would proceed as follows:

$$
\theta = \frac{180^\circ - 40^\circ}{2} = \frac{140^\circ}{2} = 70^\circ
$$

Thus, each of the two equal angles would be $ 70^\circ $.

Conversely, if you know the measure of one of the equal angles $ \theta $, you can find the third angle $ \alpha $ by rearranging the original equation:

$$
\alpha = 180^\circ - 2\theta
$$

For instance, if one of the equal angles $ \theta $ is $ 65^\circ $, the calculation would be:

$$
\alpha = 180^\circ - 2 \times 65^\circ = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ
$$

Therefore, the third angle would be $ 50^\circ $.

By understanding these properties and equations, you can easily determine the angles in any isosceles triangle as long as you have sufficient information.
