A well-defined set refers to a set where each element is distinctly and unequivocally determined.

To establish a well-defined set, it is essential to eliminate any ambiguity regarding the elements included in the set. To put it in other words, for any given element, you should be able to decisively establish whether it belongs to the set or not. For instance, the set of all even numbers is well-defined because it is straightforward to verify whether a number is even or not.

Take into consideration the set of "all tall people." This set fails to be well-defined, given that the term "tall" is subjective and can vary greatly based on individual perspectives. One person might regard someone as tall if they are over $5$ feet $8$ inches, while another person might only consider someone as tall if they are over $6$ feet. Consequently, the criteria for being a member of the set lack clarity and are ambiguous.

In contrast, the set of "all people over $6$ feet tall" is well-defined. In this case, the criterion is explicit and quantifiable, which allows you to easily confirm whether any given person fits within the set.

When defining a set, it is crucial to utilize precise language and clear criteria. For instance, the set of "all prime numbers less than $20$" is well-defined because the definition of prime numbers is exact, and they can be enumerated as $\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19\}$. This level of clarity ensures that anyone can comprehend and identify the elements of the set without any confusion.
