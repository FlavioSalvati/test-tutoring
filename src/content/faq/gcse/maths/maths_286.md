The equation of the line with a slope of $4$ that passes through the point $(0, 1)$ can be expressed as 

$$ y = 4x + 1. $$

To understand how we derive this equation, let's break it down step by step. The general form of the equation of a straight line is 

$$ y = mx + c, $$ 

where $m$ represents the slope of the line and $c$ is the y-interceptâ€”the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

In our case, we are given that the slope $m$ is $4$. This indicates that for every unit increase in $x$, the value of $y$ increases by $4$ units. Additionally, we know that the line passes through the point $(0, 1)$. The coordinates $(0, 1)$ tell us that when $x = 0$, $y$ equals $1$. This specific value of $y$ at $x = 0$ is the y-intercept $c$.

By substituting the slope $m = 4$ and the y-intercept $c = 1$ into the general line equation, we obtain:

$$ y = 4x + 1. $$

This equation indicates that if you know the value of $x$, you can determine the corresponding value of $y$ by multiplying $x$ by $4$ and then adding $1$. For instance, if $x = 2$, then:

$$ y = 4(2) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9. $$

Consequently, the point $(2, 9)$ lies on the line represented by the equation $y = 4x + 1$. This approach can be employed to identify any point on the line, making it a valuable tool for graphing and analyzing linear relationships.
