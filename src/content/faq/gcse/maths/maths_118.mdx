To compute $6^2$ using a calculator, follow these steps: first input the number $6$, then press the exponentiation button, input $2$, and finally press the equals button.

Calculating $6^2$ means finding $6$ raised to the power of $2$, which involves multiplying $6$ by itself. Most scientific calculators are equipped with an exponentiation function, typically labeled as $x^y$, $y^x$, or represented by a caret symbol (^). Hereâ€™s a clear, step-by-step guide:

1. **Turn on your calculator**: Make sure your calculator is powered on and ready for use.
2. **Input the base number**: Enter the number $6$.
3. **Access the exponentiation function**: Find and press the exponentiation button. Depending on your calculator model, this button may be labeled as $x^y$, $y^x$, or similar.
4. **Input the exponent**: Enter the number $2$, which serves as the exponent.
5. **Calculate the result**: Press the equals button ($=$) to obtain the result.

For instance, on a typical scientific calculator, the sequence of button presses would be:
$$ 6 \rightarrow x^y \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow = $$

After completing these steps, the display should show $36$, which is the result of $6^2$. This method enables you to quickly and accurately compute powers of numbers, a skill often required in GCSE Maths problems. 

If your calculator lacks an exponentiation button, you can alternatively calculate the result by multiplying the base number by itself: 
$$ 6 \times 6 = 36. $$ 

This also yields the same result.
