When rounding a number to one decimal place, one needs to consider the second digit after the decimal point. For instance, consider the number $0.123$. The first digit after the decimal point is $1$, while the second digit is $2$. The rules of rounding dictate that if this second digit is less than $5$, the number should be rounded down. Conversely, if it is $5$ or greater, the number should be rounded up. 

In our case, the second digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, thereby necessitating a round-down. As such, the first digit after the decimal point remains unchanged. Consequently, $0.123$ becomes $0.1$ when rounded to one decimal place.

Rounding numbers is an invaluable mathematical skill that also finds broad utility in everyday life. It facilitates the simplification of numbers, which makes them considerably easier to handle, particularly when absolute precision is not a prerequisite. For instance, rounding can expedite calculations and make results more comprehensible in contexts such as financial transactions, measurements, or statistical analyses. Always bear in mind that the key to rounding correctly lies in examining the digit immediately following the place value to which you are rounding, in order to make the correct decision whether to round up or down.
