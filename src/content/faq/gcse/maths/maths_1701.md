To assess the spread of data using a cumulative frequency graph, you can determine the interquartile range (IQR).

Begin by plotting your cumulative frequency graph based on the provided data. This graph is a line representation that displays the cumulative totals of frequencies up to each data point. Once you have plotted the graph, you can utilize it to find the quartiles, which are essential for understanding the spread of the data.

Start by identifying the median, denoted as $Q_2$, which represents the middle value of your data set. To locate this, find the point on the cumulative frequency axis that corresponds to half of the total frequency. From this point, draw a horizontal line to the cumulative frequency curve, then drop a vertical line down to the horizontal axis to determine the median value.

Next, determine the lower quartile, $Q_1$, and the upper quartile, $Q_3$. The lower quartile is the value that corresponds to one-quarter of the total frequency, while the upper quartile corresponds to three-quarters of the total frequency. Again, draw horizontal lines from these points on the cumulative frequency axis to the curve, and then drop vertical lines to the horizontal axis to find $Q_1$ and $Q_3$.

The interquartile range (IQR) is calculated by subtracting the lower quartile ($Q_1$) from the upper quartile ($Q_3$):

$$
\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

The IQR indicates the range within which the middle 50% of your data resides, providing a measure of the data's spread. This metric is particularly valuable because it is not influenced by extreme values or outliers, offering a more reliable representation of the data's distribution.
