The inequality representing "m is no more than 10" is expressed as 

$$
m \leq 10.
$$

In mathematics, inequalities are used to illustrate the relationship between two values when they are not equal. The expression 

$$
m \leq 10 
$$ 

indicates that the value of $ m $ can be any number that is less than or equal to $10$. This includes all numbers smaller than $10$, as well as $10$ itself.

To visualize this concept more clearly, consider a number line. If you place a point at $10$ and shade all the numbers to the left of $10$, including $10$ itself, you effectively represent the inequality 

$$
m \leq 10 
$$ 

in a graphical manner. This shaded area illustrates all the potential values that $ m $ can assume.

In practical terms, imagine a scenario where $ m $ represents the number of hours you can dedicate to a project, and you are told that you cannot exceed $10$ hours. In this case, you would use the inequality 

$$
m \leq 10 
$$ 

to convey that you can allocate up to $10$ hours, but not a single minute more.

Grasping the concept of inequalities is essential in various fields of mathematics and in everyday situations. They allow us to set boundaries and define ranges for different quantities, making them a fundamental concept in GCSE Maths.
