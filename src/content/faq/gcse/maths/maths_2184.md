To accurately represent the inequality $ x \leq -4 $ on a number line, you will follow a straightforward process. Begin by identifying the point corresponding to $ -4 $ on the number line. 

1. **Draw a Filled Circle**: Place a filled (or solid) circle at $ -4 $. This filled circle signifies that $ -4 $ is included in the solution set, which is indicated by the inequality symbol $ \leq $ meaning "less than or equal to". Therefore, $ -4 $ is a valid solution.

2. **Shade to the Left**: To illustrate all values less than $ -4 $, shade the number line extending to the left of the filled circle at $ -4 $. This leftward shading visually represents all numbers that are less than $ -4 $, continuing infinitely in the negative direction. 

The combination of the filled circle and the leftward shading effectively conveys that any number less than or equal to $ -4 $ satisfies the inequality.

It is important to note that the filled circle is essential in this representation, as it indicates that $ -4 $ itself is part of the solution set. In contrast, if the inequality were expressed as $ x < -4 $, you would use an open circle at $ -4 $ to show that $ -4 $ is not included in the solution set. However, for the inequality $ x \leq -4 $, the appropriate representation is a filled circle along with shading to the left.
