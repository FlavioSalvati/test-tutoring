The interquartile range (IQR) of the dataset $10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22$ is $8$.

To determine the IQR, we need to calculate the lower quartile (Q1) and the upper quartile (Q3). The interquartile range is defined as the difference between these two quartiles, specifically:

$$
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1.
$$

### Step 1: Find the Median of the Entire Dataset

The dataset is already organized in ascending order: $10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22$. Since there are $7$ numbers in total, the median corresponds to the fourth number, which is $16$.

### Step 2: Calculate the Lower Quartile (Q1)

The lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the dataset. The lower half consists of the numbers $10, 12, 14$. The median of this subset is calculated as follows:

- Since there are $3$ numbers, the median is the second number, which is $12$.

### Step 3: Calculate the Upper Quartile (Q3)

The upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the dataset. The upper half includes the numbers $18, 20, 22$. The median of this subset is determined similarly:

- With $3$ numbers, the median is the second number, which is $20$.

### Step 4: Calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR)

Now, we can calculate the IQR using the values we found for Q1 and Q3:

$$
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 = 20 - 12 = 8.
$$

Thus, the interquartile range of the dataset $10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22$ is $8$. The IQR serves as a measure of the spread of the middle $50\%$ of the data, providing insight into the variability while minimizing the influence of extreme values.
