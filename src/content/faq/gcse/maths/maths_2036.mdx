To determine the initial amount in an exponential decay problem, we utilize the formula:

$$ A = A_0 e^{-kt} $$

Here, $ A_0 $ represents the initial amountâ€”this is the quantity present before any decay has taken place, specifically at time $ t = 0 $. In the general exponential decay formula, $ A $ denotes the remaining quantity after a time period $ t $, $ k $ is the decay constant, and $ e $ is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to $2.71828$.

To solve for $ A_0 $, you will need the remaining amount $ A $ after a specified time $ t $ and the decay constant $ k $. Rearranging the formula allows you to isolate $ A_0 $:

$$ A_0 = \frac{A}{e^{-kt}} $$

If you have the decay rate instead of the decay constant, you can convert the decay rate into the decay constant using the relationship:

$$ k = \ln(1 - \text{decay rate}) $$

For instance, suppose you know that a substance decays to $50\%$ of its original amount in $5$ years. This information can be used to calculate $ k $ and subsequently find $ A_0 $. In this scenario, since $ A $ is $50\%$ of $ A_0 $ after $5$ years, you can express this relationship mathematically as:

$$ 0.5A_0 = A_0 e^{-5k} $$

From this equation, you can solve for $ k $, and then use that value to calculate the initial amount $ A_0 $.
