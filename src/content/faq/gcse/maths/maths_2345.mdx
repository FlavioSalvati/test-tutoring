The equation of the line can be expressed as 

$$
y = -x + 4.
$$

To understand how we arrive at this equation, let's break it down into its components. The equation of a straight line is commonly represented in the form 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $ m $ denotes the slope (or gradient) of the line, and $ c $ represents the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the point where the line intersects the y-axis.

In this case, we know that the slope $ m $ is equal to $-1$. This indicates that for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ decreases by 1 unit. Additionally, the y-intercept $ c $ is given as $4$, which indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the coordinate point $ (0, 4) $.

Substituting these values into the general equation $ y = mx + c $, we replace $ m $ with $-1$ and $ c $ with $4$. This results in:

$$
y = -1 \cdot x + 4.
$$

By simplifying this expression, we obtain:

$$
y = -x + 4.
$$

This is the final equation of the line. It illustrates that if you start at the y-intercept point $ (0, 4) $ and move one unit to the right (increasing $ x $ by $1$), you will move one unit down (decreasing $ y $ by $1$), which aligns perfectly with the slope of $-1$. This linear relationship holds true for all points along the line.
