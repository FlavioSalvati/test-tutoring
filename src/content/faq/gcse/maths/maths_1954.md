The calculator button used for percentage calculations is typically labeled as "%" or "percent."

When you need to perform percentage calculations on a calculator, the "%" button is your essential tool. This button streamlines the process of determining percentages, a common requirement in GCSE Maths. For instance, if you want to find $20\%$ of $150$, you would enter "150", press the "Ã—" button, then enter "20", and finally press the "%" button. The calculator will display the result, which is $30$ in this example.

Another frequent application of the "%" button is to calculate percentage increases or decreases. For example, if you want to increase $200$ by $15\%$, you would enter "200", press the "+", then "15", and finally the "%" button. The calculator will then show the new total, which is $230$. Conversely, to calculate a decrease, you would use the "-" button instead of the "+" button.

Mastering the use of the "%" button can save you time and help reduce errors in your calculations. This skill is particularly valuable during exams when you need to quickly and accurately compute percentages. Remember, practice makes perfect, so experiment with the "%" button across various percentage problems to build your confidence and proficiency.
