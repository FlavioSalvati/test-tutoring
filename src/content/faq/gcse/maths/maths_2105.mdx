The expression $ 2a - 4a + 6 $ can be simplified to $ -2a + 6 $.

To simplify the expression $ 2a - 4a + 6 $, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are those that share the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, $ 2a $ and $ -4a $ are like terms because both contain the variable $ a $.

First, we combine the coefficients (the numerical parts) of the like terms. The coefficients of $ 2a $ and $ -4a $ are $ 2 $ and $ -4 $, respectively. Adding these coefficients yields:

$$
2 - 4 = -2
$$

Thus, $ 2a - 4a $ simplifies to $ -2a $.

Next, we look at the constant term, which is the number without a variable. In this expression, the constant term is $ +6 $. Since there are no other constant terms to combine it with, it remains unchanged.

Bringing it all together, the simplified form of the expression $ 2a - 4a + 6 $ is:

$$
-2a + 6
$$

This process of combining like terms is a fundamental skill in algebra, making expressions easier to manipulate and understand.
