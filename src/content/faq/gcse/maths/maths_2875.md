The length of the vector $(18, 80)$ is $82$ units.

To determine the length of a vector, we apply the Pythagorean theorem. A two-dimensional vector, such as $(18, 80)$, can be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the components of the vector represent the lengths of the two perpendicular sides. Thus, the length of the vector corresponds to the hypotenuse of this triangle.

The formula for calculating the length (or magnitude) of a vector $(x, y)$ is given by:

$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

For the vector $(18, 80)$, we substitute $x$ with $18$ and $y$ with $80$ into the formula:

$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{18^2 + 80^2}
$$

We begin by calculating the squares of the components:
$$
18^2 = 324
$$
$$
80^2 = 6400
$$

Next, we add these squares together:
$$
324 + 6400 = 6724
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the sum:
$$
\sqrt{6724} = 82
$$

Therefore, the length of the vector $(18, 80)$ is $82$ units. This method can be applied to any vector in two dimensions to find its length, providing insight into the distance from the origin to the point represented by the vector.
