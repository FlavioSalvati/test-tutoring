The translation vector $(3, -2)$ indicates a movement of a shape: specifically, it denotes a shift of 3 units to the right and 2 units downward.

To elaborate, a translation vector is a mathematical tool used to describe the movement of a shape or point on a coordinate grid. The vector $(3, -2)$ consists of two components: the first component, $3$, specifies the horizontal movement, while the second component, $-2$, indicates the vertical movement.

For horizontal movement, a positive value signifies a shift to the right, whereas a negative value indicates a shift to the left. In this instance, since $3$ is positive, we move 3 units to the right. Conversely, for vertical movement, a positive value means moving upward, while a negative value means moving downward. Here, since $-2$ is negative, we move 2 units down.

Let's consider a point located at the coordinates $(1, 1)$ on a graph. To apply the translation vector $(3, -2)$, you would first move the point 3 units to the right, resulting in the new position $(4, 1)$. Next, you would move this point 2 units down, bringing you to the final coordinates $(4, -1)$. Therefore, the new coordinates of the point after applying the translation are $(4, -1)$.

This concept is particularly valuable in various fields of mathematics, such as geometry and transformations, as it aids in understanding how shapes and points can be repositioned on a coordinate plane without altering their size, shape, or orientation.
