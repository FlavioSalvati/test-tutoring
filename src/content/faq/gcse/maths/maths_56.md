In simplifying the expression $(x^3)^4$, we employ the rule of exponents known as the "power of a power" rule. This rule asserts that when an exponent is raised to another exponent, the exponents are to be multiplied together. In mathematical notation, this rule can be expressed as $(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$.

Considering the expression $(x^3)^4$, we observe that the base $x$ is initially raised to the power of 3, then this entire term is further raised to the power of 4. In accordance with the "power of a power" rule, we multiply the exponents 3 and 4 together. Hence, $3 \times 4 = 12$. As a result, the expression $(x^3)^4$ simplifies to $x^{12}$.

This exponent rule proves incredibly useful when handling more intricate algebraic expressions, serving to streamline your work and make it more readable. It's crucial to remember to multiply the exponents whenever you encounter a power raised to another power, as this will expedite your calculations and enhance their accuracy.
