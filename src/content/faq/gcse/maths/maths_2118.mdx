The value of $x$ in the equation $4x - 2 = 10$ is $3$.

To determine the value of $x$, we will solve the equation step by step. The given equation is 

$$
4x - 2 = 10.
$$ 

Our objective is to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation.

First, we eliminate the constant term on the left side by adding $2$ to both sides:

$$
4x - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2.
$$ 

This simplifies to 

$$
4x = 12.
$$ 

Next, we need to isolate $x$ by removing the coefficient $4$. We achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by $4$:

$$
\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{12}{4}.
$$ 

This simplifies to 

$$
x = 3.
$$ 

Thus, the value of $x$ is $3$. To verify our solution, we can substitute $x$ back into the original equation and check for equality. 

Substituting $x = 3$ into the original equation gives:

$$
4(3) - 2 = 10.
$$ 

This simplifies to 

$$
12 - 2 = 10,
$$ 

which further simplifies to 

$$
10 = 10.
$$ 

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $4x - 2 = 10$ is indeed $3$.
