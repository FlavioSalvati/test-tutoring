The exact value of $\cos 0^\circ$ is $1$.

To understand why $\cos 0^\circ$ equals $1$, we must explore the fundamentals of trigonometry and the unit circle. The unit circle is defined as a circle with a radius of $1$, centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. In trigonometry, the cosine of an angle is defined as the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.

When the angle is $0^\circ$, the terminal side aligns with the positive x-axis. At this position, the coordinates of the intersection point are $(1, 0)$. Thus, the x-coordinate is $1$, which explains why $\cos 0^\circ$ equals $1$.

Another perspective comes from the definition of cosine in a right-angled triangle. The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. For an angle of $0^\circ$, the length of the adjacent side is equal to the length of the hypotenuse, resulting in the ratio $\frac{1}{1}$, which simplifies to $1$.

These explanations demonstrate that regardless of whether one uses the unit circle or the right-angled triangle definition, the value of $\cos 0^\circ$ consistently results in $1$. This fundamental concept is crucial for solving more complex trigonometric problems and is an essential component of the GCSE Maths curriculum.
