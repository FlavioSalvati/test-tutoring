The graph of the function $ y = \ln(x) $ is a distinctive curve that passes through the point $ (1,0) $ and exhibits a slow increase.

To identify the graph of $ y = \ln(x) $, it is essential to note that this function is only defined for $ x > 0 $. Consequently, the graph exists solely in the right half of the coordinate plane. The curve intersects the point $ (1,0) $ because the natural logarithm of 1 is equal to 0, which can be expressed as $ \ln(1) = 0 $. As the value of $ x $ increases, the corresponding value of $ y $ also rises; however, this increase occurs at a decreasing rate. This implies that the curve ascends more slowly as $ x $ becomes larger.

Another important characteristic is that as $ x $ approaches 0 from the right, $ y $ tends toward negative infinity. This behavior creates a vertical asymptote at $ x = 0 $, where the graph approaches the y-axis but never actually intersects it. Notably, the curve is always increasing; thus, it does not turn back on itself or decrease.

The overall shape of the graph is also quite remarkable. It starts off steeply near $ x = 0 $ and gradually flattens out as $ x $ increases, resulting in a characteristic "L" shape that lies on its side. The graph is concave down, indicating that it curves downward as one moves from left to right.

By recognizing these features—passing through the point $ (1,0) $, increasing slowly, exhibiting a vertical asymptote at $ x = 0 $, and having a concave down shape—you will be able to easily identify the graph of $ y = \ln(x) $.
