The gradient of a line perpendicular to y = -4x + 2 is 1/4.

To find the gradient of a line perpendicular to a given line, you need to understand the relationship between their gradients. The gradient of the given line y = -4x + 2 is -4. For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their gradients must equal -1. This means if you multiply the gradient of one line by the gradient of the other, the result should be -1.

Let's denote the gradient of the perpendicular line as m. According to the rule, -4 * m = -1. To find m, you simply solve this equation:

-4 * m = -1
m = -1 / -4
m = 1/4

So, the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to y = -4x + 2 is 1/4. This means that if you were to draw both lines on a graph, they would intersect at a right angle (90 degrees). Understanding this concept is crucial for solving problems involving perpendicular lines in coordinate geometry.
