A negatively skewed distribution is characterized by a longer or "fatter" tail on the left side of the distribution.

In this type of distribution, the majority of data points are concentrated on the right side, indicating that most values are relatively high. However, there are a few lower values that pull the mean towards the left. The mean, median, and mode are essential measures of central tendency that help us understand the overall distribution of the data. Specifically, in a negatively skewed distribution, the relationship between these measures is typically such that the mean is less than the median, which in turn is less than the mode.

For instance, consider a set of test scores from a class. If the distribution of scores is negatively skewed, it implies that most students achieved high scores, while a few students scored significantly lower. These lower scores have the effect of dragging the average (mean) down, despite the overall strong performance of the majority. Consequently, in a negatively skewed distribution, the mean will be lower than both the median and the mode.

Understanding the shape of a distribution is crucial for effective data analysis. Knowing that your data is negatively skewed can influence your choice of central tendency measure. In such cases, it may be more appropriate to use the median instead of the mean to represent central tendency, as the median is less influenced by extreme values. This approach can provide a more accurate reflection of the typical value within your dataset.
