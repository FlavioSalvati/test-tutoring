To determine the angle formed by two intersecting chords within a circle, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Angle} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{sum of intercepted arcs} \right)
$$

When two chords intersect inside a circle, they create an angle at the intersection point. This angle is intrinsically linked to the arcs that the chords intercept on the circumference of the circle. To calculate this angle, you first need to identify the arcs intercepted by the chords; we will refer to these arcs as $ \text{Arc A} $ and $ \text{Arc B} $.

The formula to find the angle formed by the intersecting chords can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Angle} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Arc A} + \text{Arc B} \right)
$$

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to apply this formula:

1. **Identify the Intercepted Arcs**: Examine the points where the chords intersect the circle. These points segment the circle into arcs. Determine the measures of these arcs. For instance, if one chord intercepts an arc measuring $80^\circ$ and the other intercepts an arc measuring $100^\circ$, these will be your intercepted arcs.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Arc Measures**: Add the measures of the intercepted arcs together. In our example, this would be:

$$
80^\circ + 100^\circ = 180^\circ
$$

3. **Use the Formula to Find the Angle**: Apply the formula to calculate the angle. To do this, divide the sum of the arcs by $2$:

$$
\text{Angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 180^\circ = 90^\circ
$$

This method effectively works because the angle formed by the intersecting chords is essentially the average of the measures of the arcs they intercept. This relationship is a fundamental property of circles and is useful in addressing various geometric problems involving circular figures.
