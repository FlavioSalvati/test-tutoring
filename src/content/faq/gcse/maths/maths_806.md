To determine the total bill with a 15% service charge applied to an initial amount of £60, you will be adding £9 to the original bill.

First, you need to calculate 15% of £60. To do this, convert the percentage into a decimal by dividing by 100. Thus, 15% is represented as $0.15$. Next, you multiply £60 by $0.15$ to find the amount of the service charge:

$$ 
60 \times 0.15 = 9 
$$

This calculation reveals that the service charge amounts to £9.

Now, you need to add this service charge to the original bill. Start with the initial amount of £60 and add the £9 service charge:

$$ 
60 + 9 = 69 
$$

Consequently, the total bill, which includes the 15% service charge, comes to £69. This approach ensures that you accurately account for the additional cost incurred due to the service charge.
