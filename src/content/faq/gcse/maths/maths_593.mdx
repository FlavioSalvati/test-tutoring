To determine the correlation coefficient, we utilize a formula that incorporates the covariance of the two variables as well as their respective standard deviations.

The correlation coefficient, commonly represented as $ r $, quantifies both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The first step in calculating $ r $ is to compute the covariance of the two variables, which reflects how much the variables vary together. The formula for covariance is given by:

$$ 
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{n - 1} 
$$

In this equation, $ X_i $ and $ Y_i $ denote the individual data points, $ \bar{X} $ and $ \bar{Y} $ represent the means of the variables, and $ n $ indicates the total number of data points.

Next, we need to calculate the standard deviations for both variables, which measure the extent of variation or dispersion within the data. The formulas for standard deviation are as follows:

$$ 
\sigma_X = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n - 1}} 
$$

$$ 
\sigma_Y = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}{n - 1}} 
$$

Finally, the correlation coefficient $ r $ can be obtained by dividing the covariance by the product of the two standard deviations:

$$ 
r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y} 
$$

The value of $ r $ ranges from $ -1 $ to $ 1 $. A value of $ 1 $ signifies a perfect positive linear relationship, $ -1 $ indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and $ 0 $ suggests that there is no linear relationship between the variables. This method provides valuable insights into the degree to which two variables are linearly related.
