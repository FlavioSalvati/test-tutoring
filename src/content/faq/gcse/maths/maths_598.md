To create a cumulative frequency plot, you will need to graph cumulative frequencies against the upper class boundaries of your data intervals.

**Step 1: Create a Cumulative Frequency Table**

Begin by constructing a cumulative frequency table from your dataset. This process involves calculating the cumulative sum of frequencies for each class interval. For instance, if your data intervals are $0-10$, $10-20$, and $20-30$ with corresponding frequencies of $5$, $7$, and $3$, the cumulative frequencies would be calculated as follows:

- For the interval $0-10$, the cumulative frequency is $5$.
- For the interval $10-20$, the cumulative frequency is $5 + 7 = 12$.
- For the interval $20-30$, the cumulative frequency is $5 + 7 + 3 = 15$.

Thus, your cumulative frequencies are $5$, $12$, and $15$.

**Step 2: Identify Upper Class Boundaries**

Next, identify the upper class boundary for each interval. The upper class boundary represents the highest value that can be included within that interval. In our example, the upper class boundaries for the intervals $0-10$, $10-20$, and $20-30$ are $10$, $20$, and $30$, respectively.

**Step 3: Prepare the Graph**

On graph paper, set up your axes. The horizontal axis (x-axis) will denote the upper class boundaries, while the vertical axis (y-axis) will represent the cumulative frequencies. Clearly label both axes and select an appropriate scale for each.

**Step 4: Plot the Points**

Now, plot the cumulative frequencies against their respective upper class boundaries. Using our example, you will plot the following points:

- $(10, 5)$
- $(20, 12)$
- $(30, 15)$

**Step 5: Draw the Cumulative Frequency Curve**

Finally, connect the plotted points with a smooth curve or straight lines. This resulting curve is referred to as the cumulative frequency curve or ogive. The ogive is a valuable tool for analyzing the distribution of data, as it allows you to easily determine medians, quartiles, and percentiles.
