To rationalize the denominator of the expression $ \frac{8}{4 + \sqrt{5}} $, we will multiply it by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $ \frac{4 - \sqrt{5}}{4 - \sqrt{5}} $.

Rationalizing the denominator means that we aim to eliminate any surds (square roots) from the denominator of a fraction. In this case, the conjugate of $ 4 + \sqrt{5} $ is $ 4 - \sqrt{5} $. By multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by this conjugate, we will be able to remove the surd from the denominator.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Start with the original fraction**:
   $$ \frac{8}{4 + \sqrt{5}} $$

2. **Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator**:
   $$ \frac{4 - \sqrt{5}}{4 - \sqrt{5}} $$

   This results in:
   $$ \frac{8 \cdot (4 - \sqrt{5})}{(4 + \sqrt{5}) \cdot (4 - \sqrt{5})} $$

3. **Expand both the numerator and the denominator**:
   - For the numerator:
   $$ 8 \cdot (4 - \sqrt{5}) = 32 - 8\sqrt{5} $$
   
   - For the denominator, we use the difference of squares formula:
   $$ (4 + \sqrt{5}) \cdot (4 - \sqrt{5}) = 4^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2 = 16 - 5 = 11 $$

4. **Combine the results to obtain the rationalized form**:
   $$ \frac{32 - 8\sqrt{5}}{11} $$

Thus, the rationalized form of $ \frac{8}{4 + \sqrt{5}} $ is:
$$ \frac{32 - 8\sqrt{5}}{11} $$
