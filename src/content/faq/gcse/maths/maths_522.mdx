The probability of drawing a black card from a standard deck of cards is $\frac{1}{2}$, which is equivalent to $50\%$.

A standard deck contains $52$ cards, categorized into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Among these, hearts and diamonds are red suits, while clubs and spades are black suits. Each suit consists of $13$ cards, resulting in a total of $13$ clubs and $13$ spades, which sums up to $26$ black cards in the entire deck.

To determine the probability of drawing a black card, we divide the number of favorable outcomes (the black cards) by the total number of possible outcomes (all the cards in the deck). In this scenario, the number of favorable outcomes is $26$ (the black cards), and the total number of possible outcomes is $52$ (the total number of cards).

The probability formula is expressed as:

$$ 
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} 
$$

By substituting the relevant values, we obtain:

$$ 
\text{Probability} = \frac{26}{52} 
$$

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $26$:

$$ 
\frac{26}{52} = \frac{26 \div 26}{52 \div 26} = \frac{1}{2} 
$$

Thus, the probability of drawing a black card from a standard deck is $\frac{1}{2}$. This can also be expressed as $0.5$ or $50\%$, indicating that there is an equal likelihood of drawing a black card or a red card from the deck.
