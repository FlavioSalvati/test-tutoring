The value of $ (2^4) \times (2^3) $ is $ 128 $.

To understand how we arrive at this result, let's break down the problem using the laws of exponents. When multiplying two numbers with the same base, we add their exponents. In this case, our base is $ 2 $. Therefore, we can simplify $ (2^4) \times (2^3) $ by adding the exponents $ 4 $ and $ 3 $ together, which gives us:

$$
2^{(4+3)} = 2^7.
$$

Next, we need to calculate $ 2^7 $. This expression represents multiplying $ 2 $ by itself $ 7 $ times:

$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2.
$$

To perform this multiplication step-by-step, we can do the following:

$$
\begin{align*}
2 \times 2 & = 4, \\
4 \times 2 & = 8, \\
8 \times 2 & = 16, \\
16 \times 2 & = 32, \\
32 \times 2 & = 64, \\
64 \times 2 & = 128.
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, we find that $ 2^7 = 128 $. Consequently, we confirm that the value of $ (2^4) \times (2^3) $ is indeed $ 128 $. 

This principle of adding exponents when multiplying powers with the same base is a fundamental rule in algebra, and it greatly simplifies many calculations.
