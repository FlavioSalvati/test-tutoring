Data collected from interviews can be classified into two main categories: qualitative and quantitative, depending on the nature of the responses received.

When conducting interviews, the type of data gathered can vary significantly. If the responses consist of words, opinions, or descriptive narratives, this is referred to as qualitative data. For instance, if you inquire about someone's feelings regarding a new school policy and they provide a detailed and expressive answer, this constitutes qualitative data. Such data is rich in detail and offers valuable insights into individuals' thoughts and emotions.

Conversely, if the responses are represented as numbers or can be easily quantified, this is classified as quantitative data. For example, if you ask how many times a week an individual engages in a specific activity and they respond with a numerical value, this is considered quantitative data. This type of data is particularly useful for performing statistical analyses and identifying patterns.

In some instances, interviews may yield both qualitative and quantitative data. For example, you might pose a question that requires a numerical response (quantitative) and follow it with a question that seeks further explanation (qualitative). This mixed-method approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter being investigated.

To analyze qualitative data, researchers typically identify common themes or patterns in the responses, a process known as coding. For quantitative data, statistical methods are employed to calculate averages, percentages, or other numerical summaries. Both qualitative and quantitative data are valuable and can complement one another, providing a more holistic view of the topic under study.
