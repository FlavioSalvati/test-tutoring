Vector $ \mathbf{j} $ can be represented as $ (0, 1) $ in two dimensions (2D) and as $ (0, 1, 0) $ in three dimensions (3D).

In mathematics, vectors are defined as quantities that possess both magnitude and direction. When we refer to vector $ \mathbf{j} $, we are specifically talking about a unit vector that points in the positive direction along the y-axis. In a 2D coordinate system, vector $ \mathbf{j} $ is expressed as $ (0, 1) $. This notation indicates that the vector has no component in the x-direction and a component of $ 1 $ in the y-direction.

In a 3D coordinate system, vector $ \mathbf{j} $ is represented as $ (0, 1, 0) $. In this case, the first number corresponds to the x-component, the second number corresponds to the y-component, and the third number corresponds to the z-component. Thus, in 3D, vector $ \mathbf{j} $ continues to have no component in either the x-direction or the z-direction, while maintaining a component of $ 1 $ in the y-direction.

Comprehending how to express vectors in terms of their components is essential in various fields of mathematics and physics. This understanding enables us to decompose complex movements and forces into simpler, more manageable parts that can be easily analyzed and manipulated. For instance, knowing the components of a vector allows for straightforward operations such as vector addition, magnitude calculation, and direction determination.
