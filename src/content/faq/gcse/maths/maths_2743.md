The exact value of $\sin 60^\circ$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

To understand why $\sin 60^\circ$ equals $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we can examine an equilateral triangle, where all angles measure $60^\circ$. By bisecting this triangle, we create two right-angled triangles. Each of these right-angled triangles will have angles measuring $30^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $90^\circ$.

Consider an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $2$ units. When we split this triangle in half, we form two right-angled triangles with a hypotenuse of $2$ units, one leg measuring $1$ unit (which is half of the base), and the other leg, which we need to determine. 

We can use the Pythagorean theorem, expressed as $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, to find the length of the missing leg. In this scenario, we have:
- $a = 1$ (the length of the leg adjacent to the $30^\circ$ angle),
- $c = 2$ (the length of the hypotenuse), and we need to find $b$ (the length of the leg opposite the $60^\circ$ angle).

Substituting our known values into the Pythagorean theorem gives us:

$$
1^2 + b^2 = 2^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
1 + b^2 = 4
$$

Subtracting $1$ from both sides results in:

$$
b^2 = 3
$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

$$
b = \sqrt{3}
$$

Thus, the length of the side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle is $\sqrt{3}$ units. 

The sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, for $\sin 60^\circ$, we have:

$$
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

This explains why the exact value of $\sin 60^\circ$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
