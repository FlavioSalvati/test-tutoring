The order of rotational symmetry for an equilateral triangle is $3$.

Rotational symmetry is defined as the number of times a shape can be rotated around its center and still appear unchanged. In the case of an equilateral triangle, which features three sides and three angles of equal measure, this concept is particularly easy to grasp.

When an equilateral triangle is rotated by $120$ degrees, it remains unchanged in appearance. This occurs because each of the triangle's three vertices can take the position of any other vertex. If we rotate the triangle again by another $120$ degrees (resulting in a total rotation of $240$ degrees), it will still look the same. Finally, a third rotation of $120$ degrees (for a total of $360$ degrees) returns the triangle to its original orientation.

As a result, an equilateral triangle has three distinct positions in which it appears identical during a complete $360$-degree rotation. This is why we say that an equilateral triangle has an order of rotational symmetry of $3$. Understanding this concept is essential, as it aids in recognizing patterns and properties of shapes, which is a fundamental aspect of geometry in GCSE Mathematics.
