To convert $1.25$ hours into hours and minutes, we find that it equals $1$ hour and $15$ minutes.

To clarify this conversion, it’s important to note that $1$ hour is equivalent to $60$ minutes. When dealing with a decimal such as $1.25$ hours, the whole number portion ($1$) indicates the full hours, while the decimal part ($0.25$) signifies a fraction of an hour. To convert this fractional part into minutes, we multiply it by $60$, since there are $60$ minutes in one hour.

Let’s perform the calculation for the decimal part:
$$
0.25 \times 60 = 15
$$

This indicates that $0.25$ hours is equal to $15$ minutes. Therefore, we can conclude that $1.25$ hours translates to $1$ hour and $15$ minutes.

This conversion method can be applied to any decimal hour. For instance, if we consider $2.5$ hours, the $2$ denotes $2$ full hours, and the $0.5$ (which represents half an hour) can be converted as follows:
$$
0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

Thus, $2.5$ hours is equivalent to $2$ hours and $30$ minutes. This systematic approach simplifies the conversion process into clear, manageable steps, making it easier to understand and apply in various situations.
