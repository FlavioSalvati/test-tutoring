title: "How do you model population growth using an exponential function?"
summary: Population growth is modeled with the exponential function $ P(t) = P_0 e^{rt} $, where $ P(t) $ represents the population at time $ t $, $ P_0 $ is the initial population, and $ r $ is the growth rate.

To model population growth, we can use an exponential function represented by the formula:

$$ P(t) = P_0 e^{rt} $$

In this equation, $ P(t) $ denotes the population at time $ t $, while $ P_0 $ is the initial population size. The constant $ e $ represents the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to $ 2.71828 $. The variable $ r $ indicates the growth rate, and $ t $ signifies the time period over which the population is growing. This formula assumes that the population grows continuously and in proportion to its current size.

To illustrate this, letâ€™s consider an initial population $ P_0 $ of $ 1000 $ individuals, with a growth rate $ r $ of $ 5\% $ per year. To convert this percentage into a decimal for use in the formula, we divide by $ 100 $, resulting in $ r = 0.05 $. If we want to calculate the population after $ 3 $ years, we can substitute these values into the formula:

$$ P(3) = 1000 \times e^{0.05 \times 3} $$

Next, we can compute $ e^{0.15} $ using a calculator, which yields approximately $ 1.1618 $. Thus, we can further calculate the population:

$$ P(3) = 1000 \times 1.1618 = 1161.8 $$

This indicates that the population would be approximately $ 1162 $ individuals after $ 3 $ years.

Exponential growth is characterized by the principle that the rate of growth is proportional to the current population size. As a result, this leads to a rapid increase over time, which is why we refer to it as "exponential" growth. Understanding this concept is essential for analyzing real-world scenarios, such as population dynamics, where limitations in resources and space can have significant impacts.
