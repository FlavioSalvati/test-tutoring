A uniform distribution indicates that every outcome within a specified range is equally likely to occur.

In more detail, a uniform distribution is a specific type of probability distribution in which all possible outcomes have the same probability of happening. For example, consider a fair six-sided die. When you roll the die, each of its six faces—namely $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$—has an equal chance of landing face up. This scenario exemplifies a uniform distribution since no single number is more likely to appear than the others.

In a uniform distribution, the data is evenly distributed across the range of possible outcomes. If you were to graph the probabilities, you would observe a flat, horizontal line, signifying that every outcome is equally probable. This contrasts with other types of distributions, such as the normal distribution, where certain outcomes are more likely than others.

Uniform distributions can be categorized into two types: discrete and continuous. A discrete uniform distribution features a finite number of outcomes, such as the result of rolling a die. Conversely, a continuous uniform distribution encompasses an infinite number of potential outcomes within a specified range. For instance, if you randomly select a number between $0$ and $1$, any number within that range has an equal probability of being chosen.

Understanding uniform distributions is crucial for analyzing scenarios in which each outcome is equally likely, facilitating predictions and enhancing comprehension of various types of data behavior.
