The hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with side lengths of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and $12 \, \text{cm}$ is $13 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, we apply Pythagoras' Theorem. This theorem asserts that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2,
$$

where $c$ represents the hypotenuse, and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides.

In our case, we can assign the values as follows: let $a = 5 \, \text{cm}$ and $b = 12 \, \text{cm}$. According to Pythagoras' Theorem, we can find $c$ using the formula:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
$$

Substituting the known values into this equation gives us:

$$
c^2 = 5^2 + 12^2,
$$
$$
c^2 = 25 + 144,
$$
$$
c^2 = 169.
$$

To solve for $c$, we take the square root of $169$:

$$
c = \sqrt{169},
$$
$$
c = 13.
$$

Thus, the hypotenuse of the triangle measures $13 \, \text{cm}$. This method is a fundamental concept in GCSE Maths and is crucial for solving problems that involve right-angled triangles. Always ensure that your triangle is indeed right-angled before applying Pythagoras' Theorem.
