To determine the x-intercept of the line defined by the equation $ y = -3x + 5 $, we set $ y $ to $ 0 $ and solve for $ x $.

The x-intercept represents the point where the graph intersects the x-axis, which occurs when $ y $ equals $ 0 $. Therefore, to find the x-intercept, we substitute $ y $ with $ 0 $ in the equation and solve for $ x $.

Starting with the equation:

$$
y = -3x + 5
$$

we set $ y $ to $ 0 $:

$$
0 = -3x + 5
$$

Next, we isolate $ x $ by moving the constant term $ 5 $ to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting $ 5 $ from both sides:

$$
-5 = -3x
$$

To solve for $ x $, we need to eliminate the coefficient of $ x $, which is $ -3 $. We achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by $ -3 $:

$$
x = \frac{-5}{-3}
$$

Simplifying the fraction yields:

$$
x = \frac{5}{3}
$$

Thus, the x-intercept of the equation $ y = -3x + 5 $ is $ \frac{5}{3} $. This indicates that the graph crosses the x-axis at the point $ \left( \frac{5}{3}, 0 \right) $. 

Understanding how to find the x-intercept is essential for graphing linear equations and analyzing their behavior.
