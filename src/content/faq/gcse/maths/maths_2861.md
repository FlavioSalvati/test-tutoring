To subtract the vectors $(7, 4)$ and $(3, 2)$, you need to subtract their corresponding components. This is done as follows: 

$$(7, 4) - (3, 2) = (7 - 3, 4 - 2) = (4, 2).$$

When subtracting vectors, it's essential to handle each component separately. Vectors are typically represented in the form $(x, y)$, where $x$ denotes the horizontal component and $y$ denotes the vertical component. 

For the vectors $(7, 4)$ and $(3, 2)$, we will subtract the $x$-components and the $y$-components individually. 

First, we start with the $x$-components: we take $7$ from the first vector and subtract $3$ from the second vector:

$$7 - 3 = 4.$$

Next, we proceed to the $y$-components: we take $4$ from the first vector and subtract $2$ from the second vector:

$$4 - 2 = 2.$$

Thus, the result of subtracting the vector $(3, 2)$ from the vector $(7, 4)$ yields the new vector $(4, 2)$. 

In a graphical representation, the vector $(4, 2)$ illustrates the difference in position between the endpoints of the original vectors. This vector subtraction process is widely applicable in various fields of mathematics and physics, including calculations involving relative positions and velocities.
