To express an equation using letters, we utilize variables to denote unknown values and constants to signify known values.

In mathematics, an equation is a statement that establishes the equality between two expressions. When formulating an equation with letters, we typically employ variables—commonly represented by letters such as $x$, $y$, or $z$—to stand for unknown quantities. Known values, or constants, are usually depicted by specific numbers or letters.

For instance, if you wish to represent the relationship between the total cost $C$ of purchasing $n$ items, each priced at $p$ pounds, you can formulate the equation as:

$$
C = n \times p
$$

In this equation:
- $C$ denotes the total cost,
- $n$ represents the number of items, and
- $p$ signifies the price per item.

Another prevalent example is the equation of a straight line, commonly expressed in the form:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

In this context:
- $y$ is the dependent variable (the value we aim to determine),
- $x$ is the independent variable (the value we know),
- $m$ indicates the gradient (slope) of the line, and
- $c$ represents the y-intercept (the point where the line intersects the y-axis).

Utilizing letters in equations enables us to generalize mathematical relationships and approach problems with greater flexibility. By substituting different values for the variables, we can explore various scenarios and derive solutions to a wide array of problems.
