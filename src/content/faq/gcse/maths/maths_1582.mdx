A box plot is an effective visual tool for summarizing the distribution of data, emphasizing key statistics such as the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

Often referred to as a box-and-whisker plot, a box plot provides a graphical representation that facilitates the understanding of both the spread and skewness of a dataset. The central box in the plot represents the interquartile range (IQR), which encompasses the middle $50\%$ of the data. The line within the box indicates the median, which is the middle value of the dataset, allowing for a quick assessment of the data's central tendency.

The "whiskers" of the box plot extend from the box to the smallest and largest values that fall within $1.5$ times the IQR from the lower and upper quartiles, respectively. These whiskers illustrate the range of the majority of the data points. Any data points that lie outside this range are classified as outliers and are typically represented by dots or asterisks on the plot.

The lower quartile, denoted as $Q_1$, is the median of the lower half of the dataset, while the upper quartile, $Q_3$, is the median of the upper half. The difference between $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ gives us the IQR, which quantifies the spread of the middle $50\%$ of the data. If the box is skewed to one side, it suggests that the data distribution is not symmetrical.

By analyzing a box plot, you can efficiently identify the central tendency, variability, and any potential outliers present in the dataset. This makes box plots a powerful tool for comparing various data sets and gaining insights into their distributions.
