The mean of a data set, often referred to as the average, represents a central value that summarizes the numbers within that set.

To compute the mean, you follow these steps: first, sum all the numbers in the data set, and then divide that total by the number of values present. For instance, consider the numbers $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and $10$. First, you add these values together, yielding a total of $30$. Next, you divide this sum by the count of values, which in this case is $5$. Therefore, the mean is calculated as:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
$$

The mean serves as a measure of central tendency, providing insight into what a typical value in the data set might be. It is particularly useful for comparing different data sets and identifying overall trends. However, it is essential to note that the mean can be significantly influenced by extreme values, known as outliers. For example, if we consider the numbers $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $100$, the calculation would yield a mean of:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 100}{5} = \frac{110}{5} = 22
$$

This mean of $22$ does not accurately reflect the majority of the numbers in the set, which cluster around much lower values.

In summary, while the mean is a valuable tool for summarizing a data set with a single numerical value, it is crucial to take the context into account and assess whether any outliers may be distorting the result.
