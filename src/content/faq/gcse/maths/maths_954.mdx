The x-coordinate of the midpoint between the points $(2, 5)$ and $(6, 9)$ is given as $4$.

To determine the x-coordinate of the midpoint between two points, we employ the midpoint formula. This formula for the midpoint $M$ of two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is expressed as:

$$
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

In our example, we have the points $(2, 5)$ and $(6, 9)$. To find the x-coordinate of the midpoint, we add the x-coordinates of these two points and then divide the sum by $2$. The calculation is as follows:

$$
\frac{2 + 6}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

Thus, the x-coordinate of the midpoint is indeed $4$. This method guarantees that you accurately determine the center point between the two x-values, which is essential for grasping the concept of midpoints in coordinate geometry. Such calculations are straightforward and represent a fundamental skill in GCSE Mathematics, aiding in the analysis and comprehension of the properties of shapes and lines on a graph.
