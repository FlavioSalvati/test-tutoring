To estimate the sum of $78$ and $45$, we can round each number to the nearest ten before performing the addition.

Rounding to the nearest ten simplifies calculations and speeds up the estimation process. For the number $78$, we round it to $80$, since $78$ is closer to $80$ than it is to $70$. In the case of $45$, we round it to $50$ because $45$ is exactly halfway between $40$ and $50$. According to rounding conventions, we typically round up in such situations.

Next, we add the rounded numbers: 

$$
80 + 50 = 130.
$$ 

Thus, the estimated sum is $130$. This estimation method provides a quick way to gauge the total without the need for precise calculations.

This technique is especially beneficial when a fast approximation is required, such as when verifying your work or making rapid decisions. While the exact sum of $78$ and $45$ is $123$, the estimated sum of $130$ is sufficiently close for many practical applications. Remember, the aim of estimation is not to find the exact answer, but to arrive at a number that is reasonably close and easier to manage.
