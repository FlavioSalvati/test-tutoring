To convert a decimal to a fraction, you can express the decimal as a fraction with a denominator of $10$, $100$, or other powers of $10$ depending on the number of decimal places.

Start by identifying the place value of the last digit in the decimal. For instance, if the decimal is $0.75$, the last digit ($5$) is in the hundredths place. This allows you to write $0.75$ as:

$$
\frac{75}{100}.
$$

Next, simplify the fraction by determining the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. In this case, the GCD of $75$ and $100$ is $25$. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by $25$ to obtain:

$$
\frac{75 \div 25}{100 \div 25} = \frac{3}{4}.
$$

Thus, the decimal $0.75$ can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$.

For repeating decimals, such as $0.333\ldots$, let $x$ represent the repeating decimal:

$$
x = 0.333\ldots.
$$

Multiply both sides of the equation by $10$ to shift the decimal point one position to the right:

$$
10x = 3.333\ldots.
$$

Next, subtract the original equation from this new equation:

$$
10x - x = 3.333\ldots - 0.333\ldots.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
9x = 3.
$$

To solve for $x$, divide both sides by $9$:

$$
x = \frac{3}{9}.
$$

Then, simplify the fraction:

$$
x = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

Therefore, the repeating decimal $0.333\ldots$ can be represented as the fraction $\frac{1}{3}$.

For more complex decimals, such as $0.125$, note that the last digit ($5$) is in the thousandths place. Consequently, you can express $0.125$ as:

$$
\frac{125}{1000}.
$$

To simplify, find the GCD of $125$ and $1000$, which is $125$. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by $125$:

$$
\frac{125 \div 125}{1000 \div 125} = \frac{1}{8}.
$$

Thus, the decimal $0.125$ can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$.

By following these steps, you can accurately convert any decimal into a fraction.
