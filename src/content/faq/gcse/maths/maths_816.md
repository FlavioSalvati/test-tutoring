To determine the amount after applying a 30% discount on £90, follow these steps. 

First, calculate what 30% of £90 is. Percentages represent a part of a whole, expressed as a fraction of 100. Thus, 30% can be written as $\frac{30}{100}$. To find 30% of £90, you multiply £90 by $\frac{30}{100}$.

Here’s the calculation broken down step-by-step:

1. Convert the percentage to a decimal: 
   $$ 30\% = 0.30 $$
   
2. Multiply the original amount by this decimal: 
   $$ £90 \times 0.30 = £27 $$

Therefore, 30% of £90 is £27.

Next, to find the new price after applying the discount, subtract £27 from the original price of £90:
$$ £90 - £27 = £63 $$

As a result, a 30% discount on £90 leaves you with £63. This method can be applied to any percentage and any amount, making it a valuable skill for everyday scenarios such as shopping sales or managing budgets.
