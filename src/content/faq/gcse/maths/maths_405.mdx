The area of the sector is $7.07 \, \text{cm}^2$.

To calculate the area of a sector, we use the formula: 

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2,
$$ 

where $\theta$ is the angle in degrees and $r$ is the radius of the circle. In this instance, the diameter of the circle is $12 \, \text{cm}$, making the radius $r$ equal to half of that, which is $6 \, \text{cm}$.

Given that the angle $\theta$ is $45^\circ$, we can substitute the values into the formula. First, we determine the fraction of the circle that the sector represents:

$$
\frac{45}{360} = \frac{1}{8}.
$$ 

This indicates that the sector occupies $\frac{1}{8}$ of the entire circle.

Next, we calculate the area of the whole circle using the formula for the area of a circle:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2.
$$ 

With $r = 6 \, \text{cm}$, the area of the circle is:

$$
\pi \times 6^2 = 36\pi \, \text{cm}^2.
$$ 

Now, to find the area of the sector, we multiply the area of the whole circle by the fraction that the sector represents:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{sector}} = \frac{1}{8} \times 36\pi = 4.5\pi \, \text{cm}^2.
$$ 

Finally, using the approximation $\pi \approx 3.14$, we find:

$$
4.5 \times 3.14 \approx 14.13 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$ 

However, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the division mentioned earlier. Since the sector size is already calculated from the entire circle using $\frac{1}{8}$, there is no need to divide by $2$. Thus, the area of the sector remains approximately $14.13 \, \text{cm}^2$. 

To summarize, the area of the sector is approximately $14.13 \, \text{cm}^2$.
