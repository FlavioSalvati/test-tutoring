Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values, whereas continuous data can take any value within a defined range.

Discrete data can be thought of as counting individual items. For example, the number of students in a classroom or the number of cars in a parking lot are discrete because these quantities can be counted one by one. Discrete data typically involves whole numbers and is commonly represented using bar charts or pie charts. Each value is distinct, and there are no intermediate values; for instance, it is not possible to have $2.5$ students or $3.7$ cars.

In contrast, continuous data relates to measurements and can assume any value within a specified range. Examples of continuous data include height, weight, or temperature. These measurements can be recorded with varying levels of precision, depending on the measuring instrument. For instance, an individual's height can be measured as $165.5$ cm, $165.55$ cm, or even more precisely. Continuous data is often visualized using histograms or line graphs, where data points can be connected to illustrate trends or patterns.

Understanding the distinction between discrete and continuous data is essential for selecting appropriate methods for data collection, analysis, and presentation. For example, when dealing with discrete data, one might use a tally chart to count occurrences. Conversely, for continuous data, tools such as rulers or thermometers may be employed to take measurements. This distinction is fundamental in statistics and plays a critical role in ensuring accurate and meaningful interpretations of data.
