To create a graph representing temperature data over time, we recommend using a line graph format, where time is displayed on the x-axis and temperature is represented on the y-axis.

**Step 1: Data Collection**
Begin by gathering your temperature data along with the corresponding time intervals. This data may be collected hourly, daily, or weekly. Ensure that your data is neatly organized in a table with two columns: one for time and another for temperature.

**Step 2: Setting Up the Graph**
Next, you will need to prepare your graph. You can either use graph paper or graphing software. Label the horizontal axis (the x-axis) as "Time" and the vertical axis (the y-axis) as "Temperature." Choose an appropriate scale for each axis. For instance, if your time data spans from $1$ to $24$ hours, you might label the x-axis from $0$ to $24$. Similarly, if your temperature data ranges from $10^\circ C$ to $30^\circ C$, consider labeling the y-axis from $0^\circ C$ to $40^\circ C$ to allow for some additional space.

**Step 3: Plotting the Data Points**
Now, plot each pair of time and temperature data points on the graph. For example, if the temperature at $1$ hour is $15^\circ C$, locate $1$ on the x-axis and $15$ on the y-axis, then place a dot where these two values intersect.

**Step 4: Connecting the Points**
Once all points have been plotted, connect them with straight lines to create a line graph. This visual representation will illustrate how temperature changes over time. If you are using graphing software, it may automatically connect the points for you.

**Step 5: Finalizing the Graph**
Finally, add a title to your graph, such as "Temperature Over Time," and ensure that all labels and scales are clear and accurately represent the data. This will enhance the readability of your graph and make it easier for others to understand the information you are presenting.
