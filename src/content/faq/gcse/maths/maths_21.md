The task is to simplify the expression $(2^3) \times (2^4)$. This involves the laws of exponents (or indices), which state that when multiplying numbers with the same base, the exponents should be added. 

Here, our base is 2. The expression $(2^3) \times (2^4)$ signifies the multiplication of $2^3$ (representing the number 2 being multiplied by itself 3 times) and $2^4$ (indicating the number 2 being multiplied by itself 4 times). 

Following the laws of exponents, we add the exponents 3 and 4 together: $3 + 4 = 7$. Hence, the expression $(2^3) \times (2^4)$ simplifies to $2^7$.

If we delve a bit deeper, $2^3$ is $2 \times 2 \times 2$, which equals 8, and $2^4$ is $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$, equating to 16. The multiplication of 8 and 16 results in 128. This is identical to the value of $2^7$, as $2^7$ (representing 2 being multiplied by itself 7 times) also equals 128. Thus, simplifying $(2^3) \times (2^4)$ to $2^7$ yields the same result, making the calculation more efficient.
