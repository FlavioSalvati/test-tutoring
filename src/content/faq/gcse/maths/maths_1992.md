The elapsed time from 6:45 AM to 9:15 AM is a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes.

To determine the elapsed time between two specified times, it can be helpful to break the calculation down into smaller, more manageable steps. Let's start by examining the interval from 6:45 AM to 7:00 AM, which is a duration of 15 minutes. Next, we consider the time from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, which lasts exactly 2 hours. Finally, we need to account for the time from 9:00 AM to 9:15 AM, which adds another 15 minutes.

Now, let's sum these individual intervals. We have:

- 15 minutes (from 6:45 AM to 7:00 AM)
- 2 hours (from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM)
- 15 minutes (from 9:00 AM to 9:15 AM)

First, we can add the minutes together: $15$ minutes plus $15$ minutes equals $30$ minutes. Then, we add the $2$ hours to this total. Thus, the overall elapsed time amounts to $2$ hours and $30$ minutes.

This method of breaking down time into smaller components can help minimize errors and simplify the calculation process. It's a practical technique that can be beneficial for tackling time-related problems you may encounter in your GCSE Maths studies.
