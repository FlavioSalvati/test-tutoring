To convert the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ into a percentage, you multiply it by $100$ and then add the percentage symbol.

Letâ€™s break down this process step by step for clarity. A fraction such as $\frac{3}{4}$ signifies a part of a whole. To express this fraction as a percentage, we need to represent it as a fraction of $100$, since percentages are fundamentally fractions out of $100$.

Starting with the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, we can convert it to a percentage by performing the following multiplication:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
$$

This calculation shows that $\frac{3}{4}$ is equivalent to $75$ out of $100$, or simply $75\%$.

Alternatively, you can approach the conversion by first changing the fraction into a decimal. To do this, divide the numerator ($3$) by the denominator ($4$):

$$
3 \div 4 = 0.75
$$

Next, to convert the decimal to a percentage, multiply it by $100$:

$$
0.75 \times 100 = 75
$$

Thus, the decimal $0.75$ corresponds to $75\%$ when expressed as a percentage.

This method can be applied to any fraction. Just remember the steps: divide the numerator by the denominator to obtain a decimal, and then multiply that decimal by $100$ to find the percentage.
