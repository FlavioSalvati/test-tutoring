Exponential decay refers to the process by which quantities decrease rapidly at first, followed by a gradual decline over time. This phenomenon is commonly observed in various real-life scenarios, one of the most notable being radioactive decay.

In radioactive decay, unstable atomic nuclei release energy by emitting radiation. The rate of this emission is directly proportional to the quantity of the radioactive substance present. For example, if you possess a sample of radioactive material, it will lose half of its radioactivity over a specific duration known as its half-life. This process is continuous; after each half-life, the material will retain half of its remaining radioactivity.

Another illustrative example of exponential decay is the cooling of hot objects, as described by Newton's Law of Cooling. According to this law, the rate at which an object loses heat is proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and its environment. For instance, if you leave a hot cup of tea in a cooler room, it will cool down rapidly at first. However, as the temperature difference between the tea and the surrounding air decreases, the rate of cooling will also slow down.

Exponential decay is also relevant in the field of finance, particularly in the context of asset depreciation. For example, a new car tends to lose its value quickly during the first few years after purchase, but this rate of depreciation diminishes over time. This occurs because the car's value decreases by a fixed percentage each year rather than a constant dollar amount.

Understanding the concept of exponential decay is crucial for analyzing and predicting how various quantities change over time. This knowledge is applicable across diverse fields, from the sciences to economics.
