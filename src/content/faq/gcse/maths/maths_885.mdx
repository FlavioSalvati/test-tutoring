To calculate the length of a diagonal in a cuboid, you can utilize the following formula:

$$
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
$$

In this formula, $l$ represents the length, $w$ denotes the width, and $h$ indicates the height of the cuboid. A cuboid is a three-dimensional geometric figure defined by these three dimensions. This formula computes the length of the diagonal that spans from one corner of the cuboid to the diagonally opposite corner, leveraging Pythagoras' Theorem in three dimensions.

To begin, let's examine the diagonal across the base of the cuboid. When considering a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$, the diagonal $d_1$ of this rectangle can be calculated using Pythagoras' Theorem:

$$
d_1 = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
$$

This relationship arises because the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and width of the rectangle.

Next, visualize this diagonal $d_1$ as one side of a right triangle, with the height $h$ of the cuboid serving as the other perpendicular side. To determine the length of the space diagonal $d$ of the cuboid, we apply Pythagoras' Theorem once more, this time taking into account all three dimensions. The formula can be expressed as:

$$
d = \sqrt{d_1^2 + h^2}
$$

By substituting $d_1$ with $\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}$, we obtain:

$$
d = \sqrt{\left(\sqrt{l^2 + w^2}\right)^2 + h^2}
$$

This expression simplifies to:

$$
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
$$

In conclusion, by applying Pythagoras' Theorem twice, you can effectively compute the length of the diagonal in a cuboid using the formula:

$$
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
$$

This method demonstrates how the dimensions of the cuboid are intricately linked to the length of its diagonal.
