To rationalize the denominator of the expression $ \frac{6}{3\sqrt{2}} $, we need to eliminate the square root from the denominator. This can be accomplished by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by $ \sqrt{2} $.

Rationalizing the denominator is the process of converting a fraction so that the denominator is a rational number, meaning it contains no square roots. Starting with the expression $ \frac{6}{3\sqrt{2}} $, we can achieve this by multiplying both parts of the fraction by $ \sqrt{2} $. This is effective because the product of $ \sqrt{2} $ and itself yields a rational number: 

$$ \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} = 2. $$

Let's perform the multiplication:

$$ \frac{6}{3\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}}. $$

Next, we simplify the denominator:

$$ 3\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} = 3 \times 2 = 6. $$

Now, substituting this back into our expression gives:

$$ \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{6}. $$

At this point, we can further simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $ 6 $:

$$ \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{6} = \sqrt{2}. $$

Thus, the rationalized form of $ \frac{6}{3\sqrt{2}} $ is:

$$ \sqrt{2}. $$
