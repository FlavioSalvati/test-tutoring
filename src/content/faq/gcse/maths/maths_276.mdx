The midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(1, 1)$ and $(3, 5)$ is $(2, 3)$.

To determine the midpoint of a line segment between two points, we utilize the midpoint formula, which is given by:

$$
\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)
$$

Here, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. In our example, the points are $(1, 1)$ and $(3, 5)$.

First, we calculate the sum of the x-coordinates of the two points:

$$
1 + 3 = 4
$$

Next, we divide this sum by $2$ to find the x-coordinate of the midpoint:

$$
\frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

Now, we move on to the y-coordinates. We add the y-coordinates of the two points:

$$
1 + 5 = 6
$$

Then, we divide this sum by $2$ to find the y-coordinate of the midpoint:

$$
\frac{6}{2} = 3
$$

Thus, the coordinates of the midpoint are $(2, 3)$. This indicates that if you were to draw a line segment between the points $(1, 1)$ and $(3, 5)$, the point $(2, 3)$ would lie exactly in the middle of that segment. This method can be applied to any pair of points to effectively find the midpoint, making it a valuable tool in geometry.
