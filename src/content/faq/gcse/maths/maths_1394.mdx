The cosine rule, essential in trigonometry, applies to non-right-angled triangles and is expressed by the formula:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)
$$

This formula is instrumental when you need to determine the length of a side or the measure of an angle in a triangle, provided you have some known information about the triangle's other parts. In this equation, $ c $ represents the length of the side opposite angle $ C $, while $ a $ and $ b $ are the lengths of the other two sides.

To effectively apply the cosine rule, you must have either of the following:

1. Two sides and the included angle (the angle formed between the two known sides). With this information, you can calculate the length of the third side.
2. All three sides of the triangle. This will enable you to determine one of the angles.

For instance, if you know the lengths of sides $ a $ and $ b $, and the measure of angle $ C $ between them, you can rearrange the cosine rule to solve for the unknown side $ c $. Conversely, if you have all three sides $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, you can find the angle $ C $ by rearranging the formula to calculate $ \cos(C) $:

$$
\cos(C) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}
$$

The cosine rule proves especially useful in scenarios where the triangle is not a right-angled triangle, making it a versatile tool in your mathematical toolkit. To gain proficiency with this formula, practice applying it with various sets of known values.
