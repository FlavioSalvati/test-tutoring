The symbol used to denote "less than" in mathematics is $\leq$.

In the realm of mathematics, inequalities serve the purpose of comparing two values or expressions. The symbol $\leq$ signifies that the value on the left side is smaller than the value on the right side. For instance, in the inequality $3 < 5$, the number $3$ is indeed less than the number $5$.

Grasping the concept of inequalities is essential across various branches of mathematics, such as algebra and number theory. When you encounter the symbol $\leq$, it indicates that the quantity preceding the symbol is not as large as the quantity that follows it. This is distinct from the "greater than" symbol, denoted as ">", which indicates that the first quantity is larger than the second.

Inequalities also find practical applications in everyday life. For example, if you possess £10 and wish to purchase an item that costs less than £10, you would seek items priced according to the inequality $ \text{price} < 10 $.

In algebraic contexts, inequalities frequently arise while solving equations. Take, for example, the inequality $2x < 8$. To solve for $x$, you can divide both sides by $2$, yielding $x < 4$. This implies that $x$ can take any value less than $4$.

It's important to remember that the $\leq$ symbol is a fundamental aspect of understanding and working with inequalities. Therefore, becoming familiar with its meaning and usage is crucial for your mathematical development.
