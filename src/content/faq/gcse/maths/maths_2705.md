The formula for Pythagoras' Theorem is given by 

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
$$

Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry, particularly concerning right-angled triangles. The theorem states that in any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this context, $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the two shorter sides, while $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse.

To apply Pythagoras' Theorem, the first step is to identify the right-angled triangle and label its sides correctly. For instance, consider a triangle with side lengths of $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, and $5 \, \text{cm}$. If you confirm that this triangle is right-angled, you can verify whether these lengths satisfy the theorem. According to the formula, you would compute $3^2 + 4^2$ and check if it equals $5^2$. Specifically, this calculation shows that 

$$
9 + 16 = 25,
$$ 

which confirms that the triangle is indeed right-angled.

This theorem is incredibly useful for solving problems where you need to determine the length of one side of a right-angled triangle, provided you know the lengths of the other two sides. It finds applications in various fields, including construction, navigation, and computer graphics. Always remember that Pythagoras' Theorem applies solely to right-angled triangles, so ensure that you are working with one before using the formula.
