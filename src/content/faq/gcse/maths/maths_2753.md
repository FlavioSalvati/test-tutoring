The amplitude of the function $ y = \cos(x) $ is $1$.

To understand how to determine the amplitude of $ y = \cos(x) $, it is essential to grasp what amplitude signifies in the realm of trigonometric functions. Amplitude refers to the maximum distance from the central axis (the horizontal line) to either the peak or the trough of the wave. For the cosine function, this distance is consistently $1$, as the highest value that $ \cos(x) $ can attain is $1$, while the lowest value is $-1$.

Mathematically, the general form of a cosine function is expressed as 

$$ 
y = A \cos(Bx + C) + D 
$$ 

where $ A $ denotes the amplitude. In the specific case of $ y = \cos(x) $, there is no coefficient multiplying the cosine, indicating that $ A = 1 $. Thus, the amplitude of this function is indeed $1$.

To visualize this concept, consider the graph of $ y = \cos(x) $. The graph oscillates between $1$ and $-1$, producing a wave-like pattern. The central line of this wave is situated at $ y = 0 $. The distance from this midline to the peak of the wave ($1$) or to the trough of the wave ($-1$) measures exactly $1$ unit, which is the amplitude.

Therefore, whenever you encounter a cosine function that lacks a coefficient, you can confidently conclude that its amplitude is $1$. This characteristic is fundamental to the cosine function and serves as a crucial foundation for understanding more complex trigonometric graphs.
