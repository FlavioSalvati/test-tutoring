To determine the length of the line segment connecting the points $(1, 1)$ and $(4, 5)$, we will employ the distance formula. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is expressed as follows:

$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} 
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points, we have:

$$ 
x_1 = 1, \quad y_1 = 1, \quad x_2 = 4, \quad y_2 = 5 
$$

We will now calculate the differences in the $x$ and $y$ coordinates:

$$ 
x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 1 = 3 
$$

$$ 
y_2 - y_1 = 5 - 1 = 4 
$$

Next, we will square these differences:

$$ 
(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 3^2 = 9 
$$

$$ 
(y_2 - y_1)^2 = 4^2 = 16 
$$

Now, we sum these squared differences:

$$ 
9 + 16 = 25 
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the distance:

$$ 
\sqrt{25} = 5 
$$

Thus, the length of the segment connecting the points $(1, 1)$ and $(4, 5)$ is $5$ units. This distance formula can be used for any two points on a coordinate plane to calculate the distance between them.
