The symbol for "greater than" in mathematics is represented as ">".

Inequalities serve the purpose of comparing two values or expressions. The symbol ">" indicates that the value on the left side is larger than the value on the right side. For instance, in the inequality $5 > 3$, it is evident that $5$ is greater than $3$.

A solid understanding of inequalities is essential across various branches of mathematics, including algebra and number theory. When you encounter the ">" symbol, it conveys that the quantity on the left is not merely different from, but specifically larger than, the quantity on the right. This is distinct from the "greater than or equal to" symbol, which is denoted as "â‰¥" and indicates that the value on the left is either greater than or equal to the value on the right.

In practical applications, the ">" symbol can be utilized to compare scores, measurements, or any other numerical data. For example, if you received a score of $85$ on a test while your friend scored $80$, you could express this relationship as $85 > 80$, demonstrating that your score is higher. This symbol is integral to expressing and solving inequalities, which represent the relationship between two expressions that may not be equal.

A helpful mnemonic to remember the function of the ">" symbol is to visualize it as an open mouth that "consumes" the larger number, always pointing toward the smaller value. This imagery can assist in recalling the correct orientation of the symbol when writing inequalities.
