To calculate $12.5\%$ of $200$ using a calculator, you should multiply $200$ by $0.125$.

To find the percentage of a number, the first step is to convert the percentage into a decimal. In this case, you can convert $12.5\%$ to a decimal by dividing $12.5$ by $100$, which results in:

$$
0.125
$$

Next, take the number for which you want to find the percentage, which is $200$, and multiply it by the decimal you just calculated. This means you will enter $200$ into your calculator and then multiply it by $0.125$. The calculation can be expressed as:

$$
200 \times 0.125
$$

When you perform this multiplication, you will find that the result is $25$. Therefore, $12.5\%$ of $200$ is equal to $25$. This method can be applied to any percentage and any number, making it a versatile and efficient approach for solving percentage problems quickly and accurately.
