To effectively interpret a 1:25 scale drawing, you should multiply the measurements from the drawing by $25$ to determine the actual dimensions in real life.

In a scale drawing with a ratio of $1:25$, each unit of measurement on the drawing corresponds to $25$ units in reality. For instance, if a length on the drawing measures $2$ cm, the actual length can be calculated as $2$ cm multiplied by $25$, resulting in an actual length of $50$ cm. This scale is frequently used in architectural and engineering drawings to depict large objects on a smaller and more manageable format.

To interpret the drawing accurately, first identify the units utilized in the drawing (for example, centimeters or millimeters). Use a ruler to measure the length, width, or height of the object depicted. Once you have the measurement, multiply it by $25$ to convert it into real-life dimensions. For example, if a wall in the drawing measures $3$ cm, the actual wall length would be calculated as $3$ cm × $25 = 75$ cm.

It is also crucial to note that this scale factor applies uniformly to all dimensions within the drawing. Therefore, if you are analyzing an area or volume, you must apply the scale factor to each dimension before performing any area or volume calculations. For instance, if a room's floor plan measures $4$ cm by $5$ cm on the drawing, the real-life dimensions would be $4$ cm × $25 = 100$ cm and $5$ cm × $25 = 125$ cm.

Gaining proficiency in interpreting scale drawings is an invaluable skill across various fields, including architecture, engineering, and design. This knowledge ensures that the actual construction aligns accurately with the intended design.
