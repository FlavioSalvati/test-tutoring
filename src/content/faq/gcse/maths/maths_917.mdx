To solve the equation $y = x^3 - x$ graphically, you will plot the function and identify the points of intersection with the x-axis.

First, it's essential to recognize that solving $y = x^3 - x$ graphically entails finding the values of $x$ for which the function equals zero, i.e., where $y = 0$. These values correspond to the x-intercepts of the graph. Begin by plotting the function on a coordinate system. You can achieve this by calculating and plotting several key points. For instance, when $x = -2$, the corresponding value of $y$ is computed as follows:

$$
y = (-2)^3 - (-2) = -8 + 2 = -6.
$$

Continue this process for other values of $x$, such as $-1$, $0$, $1$, and $2$. 

Once you have a sufficient number of points, draw a smooth curve that connects them. The resulting graph will exhibit the characteristics of a cubic function, typically resembling an 'S' shape. The following step is to locate the points where this curve intersects the x-axis, which are the points where $y = 0$.

For the function $y = x^3 - x$, you will find that the curve intersects the x-axis at three distinct points. By analyzing the graph, you will identify these intersections as $x = -1$, $x = 0$, and $x = 1$. Consequently, these values represent the solutions to the equation $x^3 - x = 0$.

In conclusion, by plotting the function $y = x^3 - x$ and identifying the x-axis intersections, you can graphically determine the solutions to the equation. This approach not only provides insight into the solutions but also enhances your understanding of the function's behavior.
