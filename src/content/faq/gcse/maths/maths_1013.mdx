The slope of a line parallel to $ y = x - 3 $ is 1.

To determine the slope of a line parallel to a given line, you need to look at the coefficient of $ x $ in the equation of the given line. The equation $ y = x - 3 $ is in the slope-intercept form, which is $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope and $ c $ represents the y-intercept. In this case, the coefficient of $ x $ is 1, so the slope $ m $ is 1.

When two lines are parallel, they have the same slope. This means that any line parallel to $ y = x - 3 $ will also have a slope of 1. The y-intercept (the $ c $ value) can be different, but the slope must remain the same for the lines to be parallel.

For example, if you have another line with the equation $ y = x + 2 $, the slope of this line is also 1, making it parallel to $ y = x - 3 $. Similarly, $ y = x - 7 $ or $ y = x + 10 $ are also parallel to $ y = x - 3 $ because they all share the same slope of 1.

Understanding the concept of slope is crucial in GCSE Maths, as it helps you analyse and compare different lines on a graph. Remember, the key to finding parallel lines is ensuring their slopes are identical.
