The length of the vector $(-6, 8)$ is $10$ units.

To determine the length of a vector, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. The vector $(-6, 8)$ can be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the lengths of the two other sides are the absolute values of the vector's components, specifically $6$ and $8$. The magnitude of the vector is computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$ 
\text{Length} = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + 8^2} 
$$

First, we calculate the square of each component:

$$ 
(-6)^2 = 36 
$$

$$ 
8^2 = 64 
$$

Next, we sum these squares:

$$ 
36 + 64 = 100 
$$

Finally, we find the square root of this sum:

$$ 
\sqrt{100} = 10 
$$

Therefore, the length of the vector $(-6, 8)$ is indeed $10$ units. This method can be applied to calculate the length of any vector in two dimensions. It is important to remember that the components of the vector represent the differences in the $x$ and $y$ coordinates from the origin to the point indicated by the vector.
