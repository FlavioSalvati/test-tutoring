To add a decimal to a fraction, you should first convert the decimal into a fraction and then proceed to add the two fractions together.

Let's start by converting the decimal into a fraction. For instance, if you have the decimal $0.5$, it can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$, since $0.5$ is equivalent to $\frac{5}{10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}$. For a more complex decimal, such as $0.75$, you can represent it as $\frac{75}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{3}{4}$.

Next, it is essential to ensure that both fractions have a common denominator. Taking the example of adding $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators here are $2$ and $4$. The least common multiple (LCM) of $2$ and $4$ is $4$. Therefore, we convert $\frac{1}{2}$ into $\frac{2}{4}$.

Now we can add the fractions. With $\frac{1}{2}$ converted to $\frac{2}{4}$, we can add it to $\frac{3}{4}$:

$$
\frac{2}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{4}
$$

If the result is an improper fraction—where the numerator exceeds the denominator—you can convert it into a mixed number. For example, $\frac{5}{4}$ can be expressed as $1 \frac{1}{4}$.

By following these steps, you can efficiently add a decimal to a fraction. Remember, the crucial steps are converting the decimal into a fraction and finding a common denominator before performing the addition.
