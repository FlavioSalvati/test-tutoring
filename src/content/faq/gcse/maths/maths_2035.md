To determine the time variable in an exponential growth equation, we can utilize logarithms to effectively isolate this variable.

The standard form of an exponential growth equation is given by 

$$
P(t) = P_0 e^{kt}
$$ 

where:

- $ P(t) $ represents the population at time $ t $,
- $ P_0 $ denotes the initial population,
- $ k $ is the growth rate, and
- $ e $ is the base of the natural logarithm.

To solve for the time $ t $, we need to rearrange the equation accordingly.

**Step 1: Isolate the Exponential Term**

First, we start by dividing both sides of the equation by $ P_0 $ to isolate the exponential term:

$$
\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = e^{kt}
$$

**Step 2: Apply the Natural Logarithm**

Next, we take the natural logarithm (denoted as $ \ln $) of both sides to eliminate the exponential:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{P(t)}{P_0}\right) = \ln(e^{kt})
$$

Using the property of logarithms that states $ \ln(e^x) = x $, we can simplify the equation to:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{P(t)}{P_0}\right) = kt
$$

**Step 3: Solve for Time $ t $**

Finally, we solve for $ t $ by dividing both sides by $ k $:

$$
t = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{P(t)}{P_0}\right)}{k}
$$

This resulting equation allows you to compute the time $ t $ when you have the initial population $ P_0 $, the population at time $ t $ denoted as $ P(t) $, and the growth rate $ k $. 

Understanding how to manipulate logarithms is crucial for solving these types of equations. To gain proficiency, practice solving problems with various values to become more comfortable with the process.
