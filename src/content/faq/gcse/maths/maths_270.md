To determine the length of a line segment, we can utilize the distance formula, which is derived from Pythagoras' theorem.

The distance formula allows us to calculate the length of a line segment between two points in a coordinate plane. Given two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the formula is expressed as:

$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} 
$$

This formula is based on Pythagoras' theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In the context of a coordinate plane, the differences in the x-coordinates $(x_2 - x_1)$ and the y-coordinates $(y_2 - y_1)$ represent the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle, with the distance between the two points serving as the hypotenuse.

For instance, consider the points $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 1)$. We can substitute these coordinates into the distance formula as follows:

$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (1 - 4)^2} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{16 + 9} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{25} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Distance} = 5 
$$

Thus, the length of the line segment connecting the points $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 1)$ is $5$ units. This method can be applied to calculate the distance between any pair of points in a coordinate plane.
