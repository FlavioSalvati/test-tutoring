To plot the graph of the equation $ y = 2x + 3 $, we will create a table of values and then plot the corresponding points on a graph.

First, it's important to recognize that $ y = 2x + 3 $ is a linear equation, which means its graph will be a straight line. The equation is structured in the form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ is the y-intercept. In this case, the slope $ m $ is $ 2 $, and the y-intercept $ c $ is $ 3 $. This indicates that the line intersects the y-axis at the point $ (0, 3) $ and rises by $ 2 $ units for every $ 1 $ unit it moves to the right.

To proceed with the graphing, we'll create a table of values. We'll select several values for $ x $ and calculate the corresponding $ y $ values using the equation $ y = 2x + 3 $. Here are a few examples:

- For $ x = -2 $:
  $$
  y = 2(-2) + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1
  $$
- For $ x = 0 $:
  $$
  y = 2(0) + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3
  $$
- For $ x = 2 $:
  $$
  y = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7
  $$

This gives us the points $ (-2, -1) $, $ (0, 3) $, and $ (2, 7) $. Next, we will plot these points on a graph with both the x-axis and y-axis.

After plotting the points, draw a straight line through them. Since we are dealing with a linear equation, the points will align perfectly. Extend the line across the graph to represent the entire range of the equation.

Finally, be sure to label both axes and include the equation of the line, $ y = 2x + 3 $, on the graph. This visual representation will help illustrate how the equation behaves, as well as how the slope and y-intercept influence the line's position and steepness.
