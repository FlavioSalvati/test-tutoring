The equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line defined by $ y = 3x - 1 $ can be expressed as $ y = -\frac{1}{3}x + c $.

To grasp the reasoning behind this, we begin by examining the slope of the given line. The equation $ y = 3x - 1 $ is presented in slope-intercept form, which is $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the slope. In this case, the slope $ m $ is equal to $3$.

When two lines are perpendicular to each other, their slopes are negative reciprocals. This means that if one line has a slope of $ m $, the slope of the line that is perpendicular to it will be $ -\frac{1}{m} $. For our line with a slope of $3$, the slope of the perpendicular line becomes $ -\frac{1}{3} $.

Next, we can write the equation of the perpendicular line using the slope-intercept form again: $ y = mx + c $. By substituting the perpendicular slope, we arrive at the equation $ y = -\frac{1}{3}x + c $, where $ c $ represents the y-intercept. The value of $ c $ can be any real number, indicating the specific point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

For instance, if the line intersects the y-axis at $2$, the equation would be $ y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 2 $. Conversely, if it crosses at $-4$, the equation would be $ y = -\frac{1}{3}x - 4 $. The crucial aspect to remember is that the slope must remain $ -\frac{1}{3} $ for the line to be perpendicular to the original line $ y = 3x - 1 $.
