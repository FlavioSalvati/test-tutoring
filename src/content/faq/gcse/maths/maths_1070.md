To create a scale drawing of a triangle, you need to apply a specific scale factor to either reduce or enlarge the original triangle.

First, determine the scale factor you will use. A scale factor is a ratio that indicates how much larger or smaller the drawing will be compared to the original triangle. For instance, a scale factor of $1:2$ means the drawing will be half the size of the original, whereas a scale factor of $2:1$ implies that the drawing will be twice as large as the original.

Next, measure the lengths of the sides of the original triangle. Suppose the original triangle has side lengths of $6 \, \text{cm}$, $8 \, \text{cm}$, and $10 \, \text{cm}$. If you opt for a scale factor of $1:2$, you will divide each side length by $2$. This results in new side lengths of $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, and $5 \, \text{cm}$ for your scale drawing.

Now, proceed to draw the scaled-down triangle using these new measurements. Begin by drawing one side of the triangle to the specified length. Then, utilize a protractor to measure the angles at each endpoint of this side, ensuring they correspond to the angles of the original triangle. Finally, draw the remaining sides to complete the triangle.

Be sure to label your drawing with the scale factor used, making it clear that this is a scaled version of the original triangle. This approach guarantees that the proportions and angles of the triangle remain accurate, even though its size has been altered.
