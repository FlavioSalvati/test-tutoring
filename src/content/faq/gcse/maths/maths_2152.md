The symbol used to represent "less than or equal to" in mathematics is denoted as "≤".

In mathematical contexts, inequalities serve to compare the relative sizes or values of two expressions. The symbol "≤" is interpreted as "less than or equal to," indicating that the value on the left side of the symbol is either smaller than or exactly equal to the value on the right side. For instance, when we express $ x \leq 5 $, it signifies that $ x $ can take any value that is less than or equal to 5. This includes numbers such as 4, 3, 0, and even 5 itself.

Mastering the use of the "≤" symbol is essential for solving inequalities, which are a key component of GCSE Maths. When faced with an inequality, the goal is often to determine the range of values that satisfy the specified condition. For example, consider the inequality $$ 2x + 3 \leq 7 $$. To solve it, you would isolate $ x $ by first subtracting 3 from both sides, yielding $$ 2x \leq 4 $$. Then, by dividing both sides by 2, you find $$ x \leq 2 $$. This result indicates that $ x $ can be any number up to and including 2.

Inequalities are not merely theoretical constructs; they have numerous practical applications in everyday life. For instance, if you have a budget of £50 and each item you wish to purchase costs £10, you can use the inequality $$ 10x \leq 50 $$ to ascertain that you can buy up to 5 items. Understanding how to manipulate inequalities empowers you to make informed decisions within the constraints and limitations you may encounter.
