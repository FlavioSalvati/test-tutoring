The first step in constructing a histogram is to collect and organize your data into a frequency table.

Begin by gathering all the data you wish to represent in your histogram. This data can originate from various sources, such as surveys, experiments, or observational studies. Once you have collected your data, the next step is to organize it into a frequency table. A frequency table allows you to easily see how often each value or range of values occurs within your dataset.

To create a frequency table, you must first determine the intervals, commonly referred to as "bins," that will group your data. These intervals should be of equal width and should encompass the entire range of your data. For instance, if you are examining the ages of students in a class, you might select intervals like $10-12$, $13-15$, and so forth.

After defining your intervals, count how many data points fall within each interval. This count is known as the frequency. Record these frequencies alongside their corresponding intervals in your table. This table will provide the foundation for your histogram.

By organizing your data into a frequency table, you enhance your ability to visualize and comprehend the distribution of your data. This step is essential, as it prepares you to create an accurate and informative histogram.
