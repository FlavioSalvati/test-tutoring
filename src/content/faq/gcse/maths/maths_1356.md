The maximum value of the function $ y = 3\sin(x) $ is $ 3 $.

To grasp this concept, let's first examine the fundamental sine function, $ y = \sin(x) $. The sine function oscillates between $ -1 $ and $ 1 $. This indicates that the highest value $ \sin(x) $ can achieve is $ 1 $, while the lowest is $ -1 $. When we multiply the sine function by a constant, such as $ 3 $ in this case, we are effectively stretching the graph vertically.

For the function $ y = 3\sin(x) $, every output value of $ \sin(x) $ is multiplied by $ 3 $. Consequently, the range of this function changes from the interval $ [-1, 1] $ to $ [-3, 3] $. Since the maximum value of $ \sin(x) $ is $ 1 $, multiplying this by $ 3 $ yields $ 3 $. Therefore, the maximum value of $ y = 3\sin(x) $ is indeed $ 3 $.

To visualize this, consider the sine wave, which typically peaks at $ 1 $ and troughs at $ -1 $. By scaling it by $ 3 $, the peaks now rise to $ 3 $ and the troughs descend to $ -3 $. It is important to note that this transformation does not alter the period or the horizontal position of the sine wave; it merely stretches it vertically.

In summary, the maximum value of $ y = 3\sin(x) $ is determined by the maximum value of the sine function, which is $ 1 $, multiplied by $ 3 $. Thus, the maximum value is $ 3 $.
