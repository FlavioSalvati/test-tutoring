The surd form of $ \sqrt{45} $ is $ 3\sqrt{5} $.

To understand why $ \sqrt{45} $ can be expressed as $ 3\sqrt{5} $, we first need to factor the number $ 45 $ into its prime components. The number $ 45 $ can be expressed as the product of $ 9 $ and $ 5 $, since $ 9 \times 5 = 45 $. Further, we can break down $ 9 $ into $ 3 \times 3 $. Thus, the prime factorization of $ 45 $ is given by:

$$
45 = 3 \times 3 \times 5.
$$

When we take the square root of $ 45 $, we can rewrite it as the square root of the product of its prime factors:

$$
\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{3 \times 3 \times 5}.
$$

Using the property of square roots, which states that $ \sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} $, we can separate the factors under the square root:

$$
\sqrt{3 \times 3 \times 5} = \sqrt{3 \times 3} \times \sqrt{5}.
$$

Since $ \sqrt{3 \times 3} $ simplifies to $ 3 $, we can further simplify the expression to:

$$
\sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}.
$$

In GCSE Maths, simplifying surds is a crucial skill. A surd is defined as an irrational number that cannot be simplified to eliminate the square root (or cube root, etc.). In this instance, $ \sqrt{5} $ remains a surd because it cannot be further simplified into a rational number. By expressing $ \sqrt{45} $ as $ 3\sqrt{5} $, we have simplified the surd to its most fundamental form, making it more manageable for subsequent calculations.
