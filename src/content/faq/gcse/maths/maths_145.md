To determine the growth rate of an exponential function, it is essential to identify the base of the exponential expression.

An exponential function is generally represented in the form:

$$
y = a \cdot b^x
$$

In this equation, $y$ denotes the output, $a$ is the initial value, $b$ is the base, and $x$ is the exponent. The growth rate is primarily influenced by the base $b$. Specifically, if $b > 1$, the function indicates exponential growth, whereas if $0 < b < 1$, it signifies exponential decay.

To calculate the growth rate, we focus on the base $b$. The growth rate $r$ can be computed using the formula:

$$
r = b - 1
$$

For instance, consider the exponential function:

$$
y = 2 \cdot 1.05^x
$$

In this case, the base $b$ is $1.05$. Consequently, the growth rate $r$ is calculated as:

$$
r = 1.05 - 1 = 0.05
$$

This results in a growth rate of $5\%$.

Understanding the growth rate is crucial for analyzing how rapidly the function's value increases over time. In practical applications, such as in the contexts of population growth or interest rates, knowledge of the growth rate enables you to make predictions and informed decisions. It is important to note that while the initial value $a$ sets the starting point of the function, the base $b$ ultimately dictates the rate of growth or decay.
