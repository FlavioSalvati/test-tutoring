The expression $\sqrt{12} \times \sqrt{3}$ simplifies to $6$.

To grasp how this simplification works, let's break it down step by step. When you multiply two square roots together, you can combine them under a single square root due to the following property: 

$$\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \times b}.$$

Applying this property to our expression, we can rewrite $\sqrt{12} \times \sqrt{3}$ as:

$$\sqrt{12 \times 3}.$$

Next, we calculate the product of the numbers inside the square root:

$$12 \times 3 = 36.$$

Thus, we can express the square root as:

$$\sqrt{12 \times 3} = \sqrt{36}.$$

Now, we can find the square root of $36$. Since $6 \times 6 = 36$, we have:

$$\sqrt{36} = 6.$$

Therefore, we conclude that:

$$\sqrt{12} \times \sqrt{3} = 6.$$

This method of combining square roots is applicable to any pair of square roots. By uniting them under a single square root and simplifying, you can easily determine the product. Understanding these properties of square roots can significantly streamline and expedite solving such problems.
