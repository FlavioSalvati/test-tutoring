Here's an enhanced version of your content for improved clarity and readability:

The cost of purchasing 3 items, each priced at £6.50, totals £19.50.

To calculate the total cost for multiple items, you need to multiply the cost of a single item by the quantity of items you wish to buy. In this scenario, since each item costs £6.50 and you are buying 3 items, you will perform the following multiplication:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of One Item} \times \text{Number of Items}
$$

Let's break down the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Identify the cost of one item**: £6.50.
2. **Determine the number of items**: 3.
3. **Perform the multiplication**: 

$$
\text{Calculation}: £6.50 \times 3 = £19.50.
$$

To simplify the multiplication process, it can be helpful to separate the whole number and decimal components:

- First, multiply the whole number part: 
$$
6 \times 3 = 18.
$$
- Next, multiply the decimal part: 
$$
0.50 \times 3 = 1.50.
$$
- Finally, add these two results together: 
$$
18 + 1.50 = 19.50.
$$

Thus, the total cost for 3 items at £6.50 each is indeed £19.50. 

This method not only clarifies the multiplication process but also demonstrates how to effectively manage both whole numbers and decimals, a valuable skill in mathematics and everyday situations.
