To find the square root of a fraction, you can simplify the process by taking the square root of the numerator and the denominator separately.

When you have a fraction, such as $\frac{a}{b}$, and you want to determine its square root, the relationship can be expressed as follows:

$$
\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}.
$$

This means that you calculate the square root of the numerator ($a$) and the square root of the denominator ($b$) individually, and then create a new fraction using these results.

For instance, consider the fraction $\frac{9}{16}$. To find its square root, you would first compute the square root of $9$, which is $3$, and the square root of $16$, which is $4$. Thus, we have:

$$
\sqrt{\frac{9}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{9}}{\sqrt{16}} = \frac{3}{4}.
$$

This method is valid due to the properties of square roots and fractions, which state that the square root of a fraction equals the fraction of the square roots. This property allows you to break down the problem into smaller, simpler parts. 

It is important to remember that this approach is applicable only when both the numerator and the denominator are non-negative. This is because the square roots of negative numbers are not considered real numbers in the context of GCSE Mathematics.
