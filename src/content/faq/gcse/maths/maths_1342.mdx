The exact value of $\sin 45^\circ$ is given by 

$$
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

To understand why $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we need to explore some fundamental concepts in trigonometry. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. For an angle of $45^\circ$, we can consider an isosceles right triangle where the two legs are of equal length.

Let us visualize a right-angled triangle with angles of $45^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. If we denote the lengths of the two equal sides (the legs) as $1$ unit each, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to determine the length of the hypotenuse. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse ($c$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides ($a$ and $b$), which can be expressed as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
$$

In our case, since both legs are $1$, we have:

$$
c^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
$$

From this, we find that:

$$
c = \sqrt{2}.
$$

Now, the sine of $45^\circ$ is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to that of the hypotenuse. In our triangle, both the opposite side and the adjacent side measure $1$ unit, while the hypotenuse measures $\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, we can express the sine as:

$$
\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
$$

To simplify this expression and rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{2}$:

$$
\sin 45^\circ = \frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

Thus, we conclude that the exact value of $\sin 45^\circ$ is 

$$
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$
