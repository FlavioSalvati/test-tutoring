To construct an isosceles triangle, begin by drawing two equal-length sides that extend from a common vertex and connect their endpoints.

### Materials Needed
To start, you will need a ruler and a compass. First, decide on the length of the two equal sides, which we will denote as $a$. Using your ruler, draw a straight line segment of length $a$. This line segment will serve as one of the equal sides of your isosceles triangle.

### Step-by-Step Construction
1. **Draw the Base**: Create a line segment of length $a$. Label the endpoints of this segment as points $A$ and $B$.

2. **Draw the Arcs**: Place the compass point on one endpoint, say point $A$. Adjust the compass to the same length $a$ and draw an arc above and below the line segment. Without altering the compass width, move the compass point to the other endpoint, point $B$, and draw another arc. The two arcs will intersect at two points.

3. **Identify the Vertex**: Choose one of the intersection points, which we will call point $C$. This point will serve as the third vertex of your isosceles triangle.

4. **Connect the Points**: Use your ruler to draw straight lines from point $C$ to points $A$ and $B$. These lines represent the other two sides of your isosceles triangle.

### Conclusion
You should now have an isosceles triangle, where the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$ are both equal to $a$, and the base $AB$ is also of length $a$. This method guarantees that the triangle has two sides of equal length, confirming its isosceles property.

You can apply this technique to create isosceles triangles with varying side lengths by simply adjusting the compass width to your desired measurement.
