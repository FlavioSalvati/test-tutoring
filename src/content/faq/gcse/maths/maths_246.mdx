An inverse function effectively reverses the action of the original function by interchanging the input and output values.

To elaborate, if you have a function denoted as $ f(x) $, which takes an input $ x $ and produces an output $ y $, the inverse function, represented as $ f^{-1}(x) $, will take $ y $ as its input and yield $ x $ as its output. In simpler terms, if $ f(a) = b $, then it follows that $ f^{-1}(b) = a $. This relationship indicates that applying a function followed by its inverse will return you to your original value: 

$$
f(f^{-1}(x)) = x 
$$ 

and 

$$ 
f^{-1}(f(x)) = x.
$$ 

To determine the inverse of a function, you generally begin by swapping the variables $ x $ and $ y $ in the equation and then solve for $ y $. For instance, consider the function $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $. You would first express it as $ y = 2x + 3 $. Next, you swap $ x $ and $ y $, resulting in $ x = 2y + 3 $. Finally, solve for $ y $ to derive the inverse: 

$$ 
y = \frac{x - 3}{2}
$$ 

Thus, the inverse function is 

$$ 
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}.
$$ 

It is essential to recognize that not all functions possess inverses. For a function to have an inverse, it must be classified as one-to-one, meaning that each output corresponds to exactly one input. This property ensures that the inverse function remains a valid function, which can be confirmed by the vertical line test (where each vertical line intersects the graph at most once).

Comprehending inverse functions is vital across various fields of mathematics, including solving equations and analyzing real-world scenarios where the reversal of processes is required.
