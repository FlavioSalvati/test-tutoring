To convert $0.45$ litres to cubic centimetres, you simply multiply by $1000$, resulting in $450$ cubic centimetres.

To elaborate, the relationship between litres and cubic centimetres is defined by the metric system, where $1$ litre is equivalent to $1000$ cubic centimetres ($\text{cm}^3$). This equivalence arises because a litre represents a volume equal to a cube with each side measuring $10$ centimetres. Thus, the conversion from litres to cubic centimetres involves multiplying the number of litres by $1000$.

For instance, if you have $0.45$ litres and wish to convert it to cubic centimetres, you would perform the following calculation:

$$
0.45 \, \text{litres} \times 1000 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{litre} = 450 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

This calculation demonstrates that $0.45$ litres is equivalent to $450$ cubic centimetres. Such conversions are particularly useful in various practical scenarios, including scientific experiments and cooking, where smaller units like cubic centimetres may be more convenient. Remembering that $1$ litre equals $1000$ cubic centimetres can facilitate quick and easy conversions between these two units.
