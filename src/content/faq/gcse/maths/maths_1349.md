The amplitude of the function $ y = 2\sin(x) $ is $ 2 $.

To determine the amplitude of a sine function, you should examine the coefficient that precedes the sine term. In the general form of a sine function, given by $ y = A\sin(x) $, the amplitude is defined as the absolute value of $ A $. The amplitude indicates the maximum distance the wave extends from its central axis, which is represented by the horizontal line around which the wave oscillates.

In the specific function $ y = 2\sin(x) $, the coefficient $ A $ is $ 2 $. Consequently, the amplitude is the absolute value of $ 2 $, which is simply $ 2 $. This indicates that the wave will attain a maximum height of $ 2 $ units above the central axis and a minimum height of $ -2 $ units below the central axis.

Understanding amplitude is crucial as it informs you about the "height" of the wave. For instance, if you were to graph $ y = 2\sin(x) $, you would observe that the peaks of the wave reach up to $ 2 $ and the troughs descend to $ -2 $. This is in contrast to the basic sine function $ y = \sin(x) $, which has an amplitude of $ 1 $, resulting in peaks and troughs that only reach $ 1 $ and $ -1 $, respectively.

In summary, whenever you encounter a sine function, simply focus on the coefficient in front of the sine term to determine the amplitude. If no coefficient is present, it implies that the amplitude is $ 1 $.
