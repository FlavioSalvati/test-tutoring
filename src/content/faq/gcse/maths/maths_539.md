To determine the probability of selecting two blue balls from a bag without replacement, we can utilize the formula for dependent events.

Let's break down the problem step by step. Assume you have a bag containing a combination of blue and other colored balls. Let the total number of balls in the bag be denoted as $ n $, and the number of blue balls as $ b $.

The probability of drawing a blue ball on the first attempt is calculated by taking the ratio of the number of blue balls to the total number of balls, which can be expressed as:

$$ P(\text{First blue ball}) = \frac{b}{n} $$

After drawing the first blue ball, it is not replaced in the bag. Consequently, the total number of balls in the bag decreases to $ n - 1 $, and the number of blue balls remaining is now $ b - 1 $.

The probability of drawing a blue ball on the second attempt, given that the first ball drawn was blue, is given by:

$$ P(\text{Second blue ball} \mid \text{First blue ball}) = \frac{b - 1}{n - 1} $$

To compute the overall probability of both events occurring (i.e., drawing two blue balls consecutively), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event. Thus, the combined probability $ P $ can be expressed as:

$$ P = \frac{b}{n} \times \frac{b - 1}{n - 1} $$

For instance, consider a scenario where you have a bag containing 5 blue balls out of a total of 10 balls. In this case, the probability of drawing two blue balls without replacement would be calculated as follows:

$$ P = \frac{5}{10} \times \frac{4}{9} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{9} = \frac{4}{18} = \frac{2}{9} $$

Therefore, the probability of selecting two blue balls from this bag without replacement is $ \frac{2}{9} $.
