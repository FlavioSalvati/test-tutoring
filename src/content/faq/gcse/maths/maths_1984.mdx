The shortcut for exponentiation on calculators typically involves using either the "^" button or the "EXP" button, depending on the specific model of the calculator.

When using a scientific calculator, the exponentiation function allows you to raise a number (the base) to the power of another number (the exponent). For instance, to compute $2^3$, you would enter "2", press the "^" button, and then enter "3". This operation will yield a result of $8$. Some calculators may utilize the "EXP" button instead, but the functionality remains the same.

On a graphing calculator, the procedure is generally identical. To calculate $5^4$, you would input "5", press the "^" button, and then enter "4", resulting in $625$.

If you are using a basic calculator that lacks a "^" or "EXP" button, you will need to perform repeated multiplication. For example, to calculate $3^3$, you would multiply $3$ by itself three times: 

$$
3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27.
$$

Mastering the use of these buttons can save you valuable time and enhance your problem-solving efficiency, particularly during exams. If you are uncertain about how to enter exponents on your calculator, be sure to consult the manual, as different models may have slightly varied methods for performing exponentiation.
