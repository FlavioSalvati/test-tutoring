The expression $9^1$ equals $9$.

When you encounter an expression like $9^1$, it signifies that $9$ is raised to the power of $1$. In mathematical terms, raising a number to the power of $1$ means that you are multiplying the number by itself only once. Therefore, $9^1$ is simply $9$. This holds true for any number, as any number raised to the power of $1$ remains unchanged.

To gain a deeper understanding, letâ€™s explore the concept of exponents. An exponent indicates how many times to multiply the base number by itself. For example, in the expression $9^2$, the exponent is $2$, which means you multiply $9$ by itself: 

$$
9 \times 9 = 81.
$$

However, when the exponent is $1$, you have only one instance of the base number, so $9^1$ is just $9$.

This principle applies universally to all numbers, not just $9$. For instance, $5^1$ equals $5$, and $100^1$ equals $100$. This fundamental property of exponents is useful in simplifying calculations and understanding more complex mathematical concepts. Therefore, whenever you see a number raised to the power of $1$, you can confidently state that it equals the number itself.
