To express a number decreased by $ y $, you can simply write it as "number - $ y $".

In mathematics, subtraction is the operation used to indicate that a number is being reduced by a specific amount. For example, if we define a number as $ x $ and we wish to decrease it by $ y $, we represent this mathematically as $ x - y $. This notation indicates that we are taking the value of $ x $ and subtracting $ y $ from it.

For instance, suppose $ x = 10 $ and $ y = 3 $. To express 10 decreased by 3, we would write $ 10 - 3 $. Performing this subtraction yields $ 7 $. Therefore, 10 decreased by 3 equals $ 7 $.

This concept is highly applicable in various mathematical problems as well as in everyday situations. For example, if you have £50 and you spend £20, you can express the remaining amount as $ 50 - 20 $, which equals £30. Understanding how to express a number decreased by another number is fundamental in algebra and plays a crucial role in solving equations and inequalities.

In summary, to express a number decreased by $ y $, simply subtract $ y $ from the number using the format "number - $ y $". This straightforward approach serves as a foundational building block in your mathematical toolkit.
