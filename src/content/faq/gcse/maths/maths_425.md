The length of the hypotenuse is $13 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides (the legs) are known, we utilize the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

In this equation, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the legs.

In our example, the lengths of the legs are $5 \, \text{cm}$ and $12 \, \text{cm}$. Substituting these values into the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

$$
5^2 + 12^2 = c^2
$$
$$
25 + 144 = c^2
$$
$$
169 = c^2
$$

To find the value of $c$, we take the square root of both sides:

$$
c = \sqrt{169}
$$
$$
c = 13
$$

Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is $13 \, \text{cm}$. This method is a fundamental concept in GCSE Maths and is invaluable for solving problems involving right-angled triangles. It is important to remember that the Pythagorean theorem is applicable only to right-angled triangles, so ensure that the triangle in question includes a right angle before employing this theorem.
