The equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by $y = 4x + 1$ can be expressed as $y = 4x + c$, where $c$ represents any constant.

To understand this more clearly, let's examine the equation $y = 4x + 1$. This equation is in the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ denotes the gradient (or slope) of the line and $b$ indicates the y-intercept. In this particular case, the gradient $m$ is $4$, and the y-intercept is $1$.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same gradient. Therefore, any line that is parallel to $y = 4x + 1$ must also have a gradient of $4$. The only aspect that can vary is the y-intercept, which is represented by the constant $c$ in the equation $y = 4x + c$.

For instance, the lines $y = 4x + 3$ and $y = 4x - 2$ are both parallel to $y = 4x + 1$ because they all maintain the same gradient of $4$. Although their y-intercepts differ, these lines will never intersect since their gradients are identical.

In summary, to formulate the equation of a line that is parallel to $y = 4x + 1$, one needs to retain the gradient of $4$ while altering the y-intercept to any other value. This leads to the general expression $y = 4x + c$, where $c$ can be any constant.
