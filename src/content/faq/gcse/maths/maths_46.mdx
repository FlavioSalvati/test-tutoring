When dividing a whole number by a fraction, it's useful to think of it as determining how many times the fraction can fit into the whole number. The process involves utilizing the reciprocal of the fraction, which is obtained by switching the fraction's numerator (the top number) and denominator (the bottom number). For instance, the reciprocal of $ \frac{3}{4} $ is $ \frac{4}{3} $.

Consider an example where you wish to divide 6 by $ \frac{2}{3} $. The first step is to identify the reciprocal of $ \frac{2}{3} $, which is $ \frac{3}{2} $. Then, proceed to multiply 6 by $ \frac{3}{2} $. When multiplying a whole number by a fraction, multiply the whole number by the numerator and then divide by the denominator. Hence, $ 6 \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{6 \times 3}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 $.

Let's consider another instance where you would like to divide 8 by $ \frac{5}{6} $. The first procedure is to find the reciprocal of $ \frac{5}{6} $, which is $ \frac{6}{5} $. Next, multiply 8 by $ \frac{6}{5} $. The result is $ 8 \times \frac{6}{5} = \frac{8 \times 6}{5} = \frac{48}{5} = 9.6 $.

It's important to remember that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Utilizing this method not only simplifies the process but also enhances understanding of the relationship between division and multiplication in terms of fractions.
