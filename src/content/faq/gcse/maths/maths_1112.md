The rotational symmetry of a regular polygon is equal to the number of its sides.

Rotational symmetry refers to the characteristic of a shape that allows it to appear unchanged after a certain degree of rotation. In the case of a regular polygon, which is defined by having equal sides and equal angles, this symmetry is particularly clear. When you rotate a regular polygon by a specific angle, it will maintain its appearance. The critical point is that the angle of rotation that results in the polygon looking the same is directly related to the number of sides it has.

For instance, consider a regular hexagon, which has six sides. If you rotate the hexagon by $60$ degrees (calculated as $360$ degrees divided by $6$), it will appear unchanged from its original position. This indicates that a regular hexagon possesses rotational symmetry of order $6$, since you can perform six rotations (each by $60$ degrees) within a complete $360$-degree rotation, and it will look identical after each rotation.

In general, a regular polygon with $n$ sides exhibits rotational symmetry of order $n$. This means you can rotate the polygon by $\frac{360}{n}$ degrees and it will remain visually unchanged. For example, a regular pentagon, which has $5$ sides, has rotational symmetry of order $5$. Thus, rotating it by $72$ degrees (which is $360/5$) will make it look the same. 

This property of rotational symmetry is valuable in various fields, such as geometry, art, and design, as it aids in the understanding of patterns and structural compositions.
