To factor the expression $ 4x + 8 $, we begin by identifying the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms involved. In this case, both $ 4x $ and $ 8 $ share a common factor of $ 4 $. This indicates that $ 4 $ is the largest number that can evenly divide both terms.

The next step is to divide each term by the GCF. For the term $ 4x $, dividing by $ 4 $ yields $ x $. Meanwhile, dividing $ 8 $ by $ 4 $ results in $ 2 $. Thus, we can rewrite the original expression as 

$$
4(x + 2).
$$

This representation, $ 4(x + 2) $, is the factorised form of $ 4x + 8 $.

Mastering the technique of factorisation is an essential skill in algebra, as it simplifies expressions and facilitates the process of solving equations. By extracting the common factor, we break down the expression into simpler components, which can be especially beneficial when tackling more complex algebraic challenges.
