To convert $12000$ grams to kilograms, you simply divide by $1000$, resulting in $12$ kilograms.

The metric system is structured around powers of ten, which simplifies the process of conversion. The basic unit of mass in this system is the gram (g), while the kilogram (kg) serves as a larger unit of mass. Specifically, the relationship between these two units is defined as:

$$
1 \text{ kg} = 1000 \text{ g}
$$

When converting grams to kilograms, you divide the number of grams by $1000$. This operation effectively groups the grams into sets of $1000$, with each set representing one kilogram. For instance, to convert $12000$ grams to kilograms, you would perform the following calculation:

$$
12000 \text{ g} \div 1000 = 12 \text{ kg}
$$

Thus, $12000$ grams is equivalent to $12$ kilograms. This conversion method applies universally; for any quantity of grams, simply divide by $1000$ to find the corresponding mass in kilograms. This principle is a fundamental aspect of GCSE Maths and is widely applicable in both scientific contexts and everyday life.
