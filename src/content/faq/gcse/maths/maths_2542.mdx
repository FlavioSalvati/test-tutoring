To determine the height of a similar cylinder, we can use the principle that the ratio of their heights is equal to the ratio of their radii.

When working with similar cylinders, it is vital to recognize that all corresponding linear dimensions are proportional. Therefore, if you have the ratio of the radii of two similar cylinders, you can utilize this ratio to find the height of one cylinder, provided you know the height of the other.

Consider two similar cylinders: Cylinder A and Cylinder B. Let the radius of Cylinder A be denoted as $ r_A $ and the radius of Cylinder B as $ r_B $. If the height of Cylinder A is $ h_A $, you can calculate the height of Cylinder B, denoted as $ h_B $, using the following relationship:

$$
\frac{h_A}{h_B} = \frac{r_A}{r_B}
$$

To isolate $ h_B $, we can rearrange this equation:

$$
h_B = h_A \times \frac{r_B}{r_A}
$$

For example, suppose Cylinder A has a radius of $3 \, \text{cm}$ and a height of $9 \, \text{cm}$, while Cylinder B has a radius of $6 \, \text{cm}$. You can find the height of Cylinder B using the formula:

$$
h_B = 9 \times \frac{6}{3} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \, \text{cm}
$$

This method is effective because similar shapes maintain consistent proportions; therefore, the ratio of their heights will always equate to the ratio of their radii. Understanding this principle is crucial for comprehending similar figures in geometry.
