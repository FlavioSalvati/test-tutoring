To bisect an angle using a compass, follow these steps carefully to ensure precision.

1. **Draw the Initial Arc**: Begin by positioning the compass point at the vertex of the angle, where the two lines converge. With the compass set to a suitable width, draw an arc that intersects both lines of the angle. This arc will create two intersection points along the angle's lines. Label these points as $A$ and $B$.

2. **Draw Arcs from Intersection Points**: Without altering the width of the compass, place the compass point on point $A$. Draw an arc within the angle. Next, move the compass to point $B$ and draw another arc that intersects with the arc drawn from point $A$. Label the intersection of these two arcs as point $C$.

3. **Bisect the Angle**: Finally, use a ruler to connect the angle's vertex to point $C$ with a straight line. This line effectively bisects the angle, dividing it into two equal smaller angles. This method not only ensures accuracy but also represents a fundamental skill in geometry. 

By following these steps, you will achieve a precise angle bisection.
