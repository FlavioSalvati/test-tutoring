To determine the unit vector in the direction of $ \mathbf{k} $, you can simply use $ \mathbf{k} $ itself, as it is already a unit vector.

A unit vector is defined as a vector that has a magnitude (or length) of $1$. In three-dimensional space, the standard unit vectors are $ \mathbf{i} $, $ \mathbf{j} $, and $ \mathbf{k} $, which correspond to the directions of the x, y, and z axes, respectively. Specifically, the vector $ \mathbf{k} $ points in the direction of the z-axis and can be represented as:

$$
\mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1).
$$

To verify that $ \mathbf{k} $ is indeed a unit vector, we can calculate its magnitude. The magnitude of a vector $ \mathbf{v} = (x, y, z) $ is computed using the formula:

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}.
$$

For the vector $ \mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1) $, the magnitude is calculated as follows:

$$
\|\mathbf{k}\| = \sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1} = 1.
$$

Since the magnitude of $ \mathbf{k} $ is $1$, we can confirm that $ \mathbf{k} $ is indeed a unit vector.

If you need to find a unit vector in the direction of any other vector $ \mathbf{v} $, you can obtain it by dividing $ \mathbf{v} $ by its magnitude. For example, if we have a vector $ \mathbf{v} = (a, b, c) $, the unit vector $ \mathbf{u} $ in the direction of $ \mathbf{v} $ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}, \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}, \frac{c}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} \right).
$$

This process will yield a vector that has a magnitude of $1$ and points in the same direction as $ \mathbf{v} $.
