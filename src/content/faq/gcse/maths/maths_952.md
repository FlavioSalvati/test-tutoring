To determine whether the function $ f(x) = 2x + 1 $ has an inverse, we must first establish if it is a one-to-one function.

A function possesses an inverse if and only if it is one-to-one, meaning that each output corresponds to exactly one input. To verify whether $ f(x) = 2x + 1 $ is one-to-one, we can employ the Horizontal Line Test. According to this test, if any horizontal line intersects the graph of the function at most once, then the function is indeed one-to-one. Given that $ f(x) = 2x + 1 $ is a linear function with a slope of 2, it follows that any horizontal line will intersect the graph at exactly one point. This confirms that the function is one-to-one.

Alternatively, we can analyze the derivative of the function. For a function to be classified as one-to-one, its derivative must not change sign. The derivative of $ f(x) = 2x + 1 $ is computed as:

$$
f'(x) = 2
$$

Since this derivative is always positive, it indicates that the function is strictly increasing. This behavior further confirms that $ f(x) $ is one-to-one.

Having established that $ f(x) = 2x + 1 $ is one-to-one, we can conclude that it indeed has an inverse function. To find the inverse, we start by exchanging $ x $ and $ y $ in the equation $ y = 2x + 1 $ and then solve for $ y $:

$$
x = 2y + 1
$$

Rearranging this equation to isolate $ y $:

$$
2y = x - 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{x - 1}{2}
$$

Thus, the inverse function is given by:

$$
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 1}{2}
$$ 

In summary, the function $ f(x) = 2x + 1 $ is one-to-one and has the inverse function $ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 1}{2} $.
