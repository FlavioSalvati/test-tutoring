When faced with the task of multiplying a fraction by a decimal, the initial step entails transforming the decimal into its fractional equivalent. Let's consider an instance where you are given the decimal $0.5$. This can be written as the fraction $1/2$, as $0.5$ represents 5 out of 10 parts, which can be simplified to $1/2$.

Having converted the decimal to a fraction, the subsequent step involves multiplying the original fraction by this new fraction. If, for instance, you have the fraction $3/4$ and wish to multiply it by $0.5$ (which we've now converted to $1/2$), this entails multiplying the numerators (the top numbers) together, and doing the same for the denominators (the bottom numbers). The resultant multiplication is:

$$ \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3 \times 1}{4 \times 2} = \frac{3}{8} $$

This final fraction is the product of the initial fraction and the decimal.

For more intricate decimals, such as $0.75$, the first step remains to convert this to its fractional form. In this case, $0.75$ is equivalent to $75/100$, which simplifies to $3/4$. From here, the multiplication process is identical. For example, if one were to multiply $2/3$ by $0.75$ (equivalent to $3/4$), the calculation would be:

$$ \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{2 \times 3}{3 \times 4} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} $$

By transposing the decimal to a fraction, the multiplication process is made more straightforward, ensuring accurate results.
