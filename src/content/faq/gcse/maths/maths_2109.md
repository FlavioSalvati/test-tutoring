To simplify the expression $$\frac{a^5}{a^2}$$, we can use the exponent rule known as the quotient rule. This rule states that when dividing two powers with the same base, you subtract the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator. 

In this case, our base is $ a $, where the numerator has an exponent of $ 5 $ and the denominator has an exponent of $ 2 $. 

Starting with the expression $$\frac{a^5}{a^2}$$, we apply the quotient rule by subtracting the exponent in the denominator, which is $ 2 $, from the exponent in the numerator, which is $ 5 $. This gives us:

$$
a^{5-2}
$$

Simplifying the exponent yields:

$$
a^3
$$

Thus, we find that $$\frac{a^5}{a^2}$$ simplifies to $ a^3 $. 

This rule is particularly useful for any similar problems involving the division of powers with the same base. It is important to remember that this rule only applies when the bases are identical; if the bases differ, a different method will need to be used for simplification.
