The graph of the function $ y = \ln(x) $ is characterized by a gently increasing curve that passes through the point $ (1, 0) $.

The natural logarithm function, $ \ln(x) $, is defined exclusively for positive values of $ x $. Consequently, its graph exists solely in the right half of the coordinate plane, where $ x > 0 $. As $ x $ approaches $ 0 $ from the right, the value of $ y = \ln(x) $ decreases indefinitely, tending towards negative infinity. This behavior results in a vertical asymptote at $ x = 0 $, indicating that the graph approaches the y-axis but never intersects it.

At the point $ x = 1 $, the natural logarithm of $ 1 $ is $ 0 $, which means the graph intersects at $ (1, 0) $. This point is crucial for accurately sketching the graph. As $ x $ increases beyond $ 1 $, the value of $ y = \ln(x) $ continues to rise, albeit at a decreasing rate. This implies that the graph ascends more slowly as $ x $ grows larger.

The overall shape of the graph is a smooth, continuous curve that starts from negative infinity as $ x $ approaches $ 0 $, passes through the point $ (1, 0) $, and continues to rise gradually as $ x $ increases. Notably, the graph never touches or crosses the y-axis and extends infinitely to the right. Familiarity with these characteristics enables one to effectively sketch the graph of $ y = \ln(x) $ and analyze its behavior in various mathematical contexts.
