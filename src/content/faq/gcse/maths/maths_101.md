The formula that describes the decay rate in physics is given by:

$$
N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
$$

This equation details how the quantity of undecayed particles or nuclei in a sample decreases over time. In this expression, $N(t)$ denotes the number of particles remaining at time $t$, while $N_0$ represents the initial quantity of particles at the starting point (when $t = 0$). The decay constant, denoted by $\lambda$, quantifies the rate of decay, and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to $2.71828$.

The decay constant $\lambda$ serves as an indicator of how rapidly the substance undergoes decay. A larger value of $\lambda$ signifies a faster decay rate. The term $e^{-\lambda t}$ highlights the exponential nature of the decay process, illustrating that the number of particles diminishes quickly at first and then decelerates over time.

To illustrate this concept, consider a sample of a radioactive substance that starts with $1000$ particles, and assume the decay constant $\lambda$ is $0.1$ per year. You can use the formula to determine how many particles remain after a specific duration. For instance, after $5$ years, the remaining number of particles would be calculated as follows:

$$
N(5) = 1000 \times e^{-0.1 \times 5}
$$

This formula is essential in various fields, including nuclear physics, archaeology (notably in carbon dating), and medicine (for analyzing the behavior of radioactive tracers). It enables scientists and researchers to estimate how long a substance will remain active and the rate at which it will decay.
