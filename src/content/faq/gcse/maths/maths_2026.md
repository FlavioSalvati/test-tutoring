When £75 is divided equally among 5 people, each person will receive £15.

To find out how much each individual gets, you need to perform a division of the total amount of money by the number of people involved. In this scenario, the total amount is £75, and it is to be shared equally among 5 individuals. The calculation you need to carry out is:

$$
\frac{75}{5}
$$

When dividing £75 by 5, you are essentially determining how many times 5 can fit into 75. This can be done either using a calculator or calculating manually. If you opt for the manual method, it would be set up as follows:

$$
75 \div 5 = 15
$$

Thus, each person will receive £15. This means that if you distribute £15 to each of the 5 individuals, you will have successfully allocated the entire £75 evenly.

To verify your calculation, you can multiply the amount each person receives by the total number of people:

$$
15 \times 5 = 75
$$

This confirms that your division was performed correctly. Understanding how to divide amounts equally is a valuable skill in everyday life, whether you are sharing money, food, or any other resources.
