Tree diagrams serve as an effective tool for solving combined event problems by systematically mapping out all possible outcomes step-by-step.

A tree diagram is a visual representation that allows you to enumerate all potential outcomes of combined events. To construct a tree diagram, begin by drawing a branch for each possible outcome of the first event. From the end of each branch, extend additional branches for the possible outcomes of the subsequent event, and continue this process as needed. This approach enables you to clearly visualize all possible combinations of outcomes.

For instance, consider the scenario where you flip a coin and then roll a die. You would initiate the tree diagram with two branches for the coin flip: one branch representing heads and the other for tails. From each of these branches, you would then draw six additional branches to illustrate the six possible outcomes of the die roll, which are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$. This results in a total of $12$ branches, with each branch representing a unique outcome of the combined events.

Each path through the tree diagram corresponds to a different sequence of outcomes. By tracing these paths, you can easily determine the total number of possible outcomes and analyze the probability of specific events. For example, to find the probability of flipping heads and rolling a $3$, you can observe that there is $1$ favorable outcome among the $12$ possible outcomes. Thus, the probability of this event occurring is given by:

$$
\frac{1}{12}.
$$

Tree diagrams are particularly valuable for visualizing and solving problems that involve independent events, where the outcome of one event does not influence the outcome of another. They help decompose complex problems into manageable components, simplifying the process of understanding and solving them.
