To determine the volume of a sphere with a diameter of $8 \, \text{cm}$, we can utilize the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is given by:

$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
$$

First, we need to calculate the radius of the sphere. The radius is half of the diameter. Given that the diameter is $8 \, \text{cm}$, the radius $ r $ can be calculated as follows:

$$
r = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \, \text{cm}
$$

Next, we substitute the radius into the volume formula:

$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
$$

Substituting $ r = 4 \, \text{cm} $ into the equation gives:

$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (4)^3
$$

We need to calculate $ 4^3 $, which represents $ 4 $ cubed (or $ 4 $ multiplied by itself three times):

$$
4^3 = 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64
$$

Now we can update our volume formula:

$$
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 64
$$

Next, we multiply $ \frac{4}{3} $ by $64$:

$$
\frac{4}{3} \times 64 = \frac{256}{3}
$$

Thus, the volume of the sphere can be expressed as:

$$
V = \frac{256}{3} \pi
$$

To obtain a numerical approximation, we can use $ \pi \approx 3.14 $:

$$
V \approx \frac{256}{3} \times 3.14 \approx 268.08 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

Therefore, the volume of the sphere is approximately $268.08 \, \text{cm}^3$.
