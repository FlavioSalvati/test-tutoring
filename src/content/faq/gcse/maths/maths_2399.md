To determine the equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by the equation $ y = -3x + 7 $, we need to use the same slope, which is $ -3 $.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same gradient (or slope). In the equation $ y = -3x + 7 $, the slope is $ -3 $. Consequently, any line that is parallel to this one will also have a slope of $ -3 $. The general form of a straight line equation is given by 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $ m $ represents the slope and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept.

To find the specific equation of a parallel line, we need a point through which this new line passes. Let's denote this point as $ (x_1, y_1) $. By substituting the coordinates of this point into the equation $ y = -3x + c $, we can solve for the new y-intercept $ c $.

For instance, if we are given the point $ (2, 4) $, we can substitute $ x = 2 $ and $ y = 4 $ into the equation:

$$
4 = -3(2) + c.
$$

Simplifying this gives:

$$
4 = -6 + c,
$$
which leads to:

$$
c = 10.
$$

Therefore, the equation of the line that is parallel to $ y = -3x + 7 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 4) $ is 

$$
y = -3x + 10.
$$

If no specific point is provided, we can express the equation of the family of lines parallel to $ y = -3x + 7 $ in the general form:

$$
y = -3x + c,
$$ 

where $ c $ can be any constant. This represents all lines that are parallel to $ y = -3x + 7 $.
