To interpret a 1:75 scale drawing, you need to multiply the measurements from the drawing by 75 to obtain the actual dimensions in real life.

When you encounter a 1:75 scale drawing, it indicates that each unit of measurement on the drawing corresponds to 75 units of the same measurement in reality. For example, if a length on the drawing measures $2$ centimeters, the actual length can be calculated as follows:

$$
2 \, \text{cm} \times 75 = 150 \, \text{cm} 
$$

This means the real-life length is $150$ centimeters, which can also be expressed as $1.5$ meters.

To interpret the drawing accurately, you can follow these simple steps:

1. **Confirm the Scale**: Verify that the scale of the drawing is indeed $1:75$.
2. **Measure the Drawing**: Utilize a ruler to obtain the dimensions from the drawing.
3. **Apply the Scale Factor**: For each measurement, multiply the value by $75$ to find the actual size.

For instance, if you measure a wall in the drawing and find it to be $4$ cm long, you would determine the real-life length as follows:

$$
4 \, \text{cm} \times 75 = 300 \, \text{cm} 
$$

Thus, the actual length of the wall is $300$ centimeters, or $3$ meters.

Keep in mind that this method is applicable to any unit of measurement, whether you are working with centimeters, millimeters, or inches. Just be sure to maintain consistency in the units you use throughout your calculations. This approach is essential for gaining a clear understanding of the true sizes of objects and spaces represented in the drawing, which is vital for tasks such as construction, design, and planning.
