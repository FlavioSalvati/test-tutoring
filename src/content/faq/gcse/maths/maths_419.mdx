To determine the area of a compound shape, you can simplify the process by dividing it into smaller, more manageable shapes and then summing their respective areas.

When working with a compound figure, such as an L-shape combined with a rectangle, the initial step is to decompose the shape into simpler components. In most cases, you can split the L-shape into two rectangles.

Begin by identifying the dimensions of each rectangle that makes up the L-shape. Typically, this will involve one vertical rectangle and one horizontal rectangle. Measure the length and width of each rectangle. For instance, if the vertical rectangle measures $5 \text{ cm}$ in length and $3 \text{ cm}$ in width, and the horizontal rectangle measures $7 \text{ cm}$ in length and $2 \text{ cm}$ in width, you can calculate their areas individually.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Therefore, for the vertical rectangle, the area would be:

$$
5 \text{ cm} \times 3 \text{ cm} = 15 \text{ cm}^2.
$$

For the horizontal rectangle, the area would be:

$$
7 \text{ cm} \times 2 \text{ cm} = 14 \text{ cm}^2.
$$

Next, sum the areas of these two rectangles to find the total area of the L-shape. In this example, the total area would be:

$$
15 \text{ cm}^2 + 14 \text{ cm}^2 = 29 \text{ cm}^2.
$$

If there is an additional rectangle attached to the L-shape, you can calculate its area in the same manner and add it to the overall total. For example, if the attached rectangle has dimensions of $4 \text{ cm}$ by $3 \text{ cm}$, its area would be:

$$
4 \text{ cm} \times 3 \text{ cm} = 12 \text{ cm}^2.
$$

Including this in your previous total, the overall area would be:

$$
29 \text{ cm}^2 + 12 \text{ cm}^2 = 41 \text{ cm}^2.
$$

By breaking down the compound shape into simpler rectangles, calculating the area of each, and then summing these areas, you can efficiently determine the total area of the compound shape.
