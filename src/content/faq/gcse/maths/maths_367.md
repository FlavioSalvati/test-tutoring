To determine the angle subtended by a chord at the circumference of a circle, we can utilize various circle theorems related to angles and chords.

More specifically, one important theorem states that the angle subtended by a chord at the circumference is equal to the angle subtended by the same chord from any other point on the circumference, as long as both angles are located on the same side of the chord. This is commonly referred to as the "Angle at the Centre Theorem."

To apply this theorem, you should first identify the chord and the points on the circumference where the angles are being measured. If the angle subtended by the chord at the center of the circle is known, you can determine the angle at the circumference by using the fact that the angle at the center is twice that at the circumference. For instance, if the angle at the center is $80^\circ$, then the angle subtended by the chord at the circumference would be:

$$
\text{Angle at Circumference} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Angle at Centre} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80^\circ = 40^\circ.
$$

Another valuable theorem is the "Alternate Segment Theorem." This theorem states that the angle formed between a chord and a tangent at one endpoint of the chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment of the circle. This theorem is particularly useful in scenarios that involve tangents.

By familiarizing yourself with and applying these theorems, you can effectively calculate the angle subtended by a chord at the circumference of a circle. Practicing a variety of problems will help reinforce your understanding of these concepts and enhance your confidence in their application.
