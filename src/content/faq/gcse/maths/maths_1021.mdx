To derive the equation of a line that is perpendicular to $ y = x + 4 $, we first need to determine the slope of the original line. 

The equation $ y = x + 4 $ is in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope. From this equation, we see that the slope $ m $ is equal to $1$. 

For a line to be perpendicular to another, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of the original slope. The negative reciprocal of $1$ is calculated as follows: the reciprocal of $1$ is still $1$, and the negative of that is $-1$. Thus, the slope of the perpendicular line is $-1$.

Next, we need a point through which the perpendicular line will pass. If no specific point is provided, any point can suffice; however, problems typically specify a point. For our example, letâ€™s use the point $(2, 3)$.

We can employ the point-slope form of the equation of a line, given by:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

Here, $(x_1, y_1)$ represents the point $(2, 3)$, and $ m $ is the slope, which we found to be $-1$. Substituting these values into the equation gives us:

$$
y - 3 = -1(x - 2)
$$

Now, we will simplify this equation to express it in slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $:

1. Start with the equation:
   $$
   y - 3 = -1(x - 2)
   $$
2. Distributing the $-1$:
   $$
   y - 3 = -x + 2
   $$
3. Adding $3$ to both sides:
   $$
   y = -x + 5
   $$

Therefore, the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = x + 4 $ and passes through the point $(2, 3)$ is:

$$
y = -x + 5
$$
