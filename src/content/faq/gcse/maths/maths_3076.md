To calculate cumulative frequency, you need to sum the frequency of each interval with the cumulative total of all preceding intervals.

Cumulative frequency provides a way to maintain a running total of frequencies throughout a data set. For instance, if you have a series of intervals—such as age ranges—and the corresponding number of individuals in each range, you can determine the cumulative frequency by following a simple process. Start with the first interval and record its frequency. For each subsequent interval, add its frequency to the cumulative total from the previous intervals. 

Consider the following example of age intervals along with their frequencies:

- 0-10 years: 5 people
- 11-20 years: 8 people
- 21-30 years: 12 people
- 31-40 years: 7 people

To find the cumulative frequency for these intervals, begin with the first one:

- For the interval $0-10$ years, the frequency is $5$, so the cumulative frequency is $5$.

Next, add the frequency of the second interval to the cumulative frequency of the first:

- For the interval $11-20$ years: $8 + 5 = 13$, which makes the cumulative frequency $13$.

Now, add the frequency of the third interval to the cumulative frequency of the second:

- For the interval $21-30$ years: $12 + 13 = 25$, resulting in a cumulative frequency of $25$.

Finally, add the frequency of the fourth interval to the cumulative frequency of the third:

- For the interval $31-40$ years: $7 + 25 = 32$, leading to a cumulative frequency of $32$.

Thus, the cumulative frequencies for the intervals are $5$, $13$, $25$, and $32$, respectively. This method not only helps you calculate the cumulative frequencies but also aids in understanding how the data accumulates across the intervals, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns.
