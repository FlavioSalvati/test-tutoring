The next term in the sequence $10, 20, 30, 40$ is $50$.

This sequence represents an arithmetic progression, where each term increases by a constant value. In this case, the common difference between consecutive terms is $10$. To determine the next term, you simply add this common difference to the last term in the sequence: $40 + 10 = 50$.

Arithmetic sequences are a fundamental concept in GCSE Mathematics. They adhere to a straightforward rule: you start with an initial term and then continually add a fixed number, known as the common difference, to obtain subsequent terms. For instance, in the provided sequence, the first term is $10$ and the common difference is $10$. Consequently, the sequence progresses as $10, 20, 30, 40$, and continues onward.

Mastering the identification and extension of arithmetic sequences is essential, as it lays the groundwork for more advanced mathematical topics, such as solving linear equations and understanding geometric sequences. By thoroughly understanding this concept, you will be better prepared to tackle a variety of problems in your GCSE Mathematics examinations.
