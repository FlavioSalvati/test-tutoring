The slope of a line that is parallel to the equation $ y = 4x - 1 $ is $ 4 $.

To find the slope of a line that is parallel to a given line, you need to examine the coefficient of $ x $ in its equation. The equation $ y = 4x - 1 $ is expressed in slope-intercept form, which is given by $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the slope and $ c $ signifies the y-intercept.

In the equation $ y = 4x - 1 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 4 $. Thus, the slope $ m $ is $ 4 $. When two lines are parallel, they share the same slope. Consequently, any line that is parallel to $ y = 4x - 1 $ will also have a slope of $ 4 $.

Grasping the concept of parallel lines is essential. Parallel lines never intersect and consistently maintain the same distance from one another. This is due to the fact that they possess identical slopes. Therefore, if you are presented with any linear equation and asked to determine the slope of a line parallel to it, simply find the coefficient of $ x $ in that equation. This coefficient represents the slope of the parallel line.

For instance, consider another line represented by the equation $ y = 4x + 3 $. In this case, the slope remains $ 4 $, which indicates that it is parallel to $ y = 4x - 1 $. The y-intercept (the constant term) does not influence the slope; thus, it may vary, but the lines will still be parallel as long as their slopes are the same.
