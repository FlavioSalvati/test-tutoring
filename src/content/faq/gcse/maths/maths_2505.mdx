To construct a right-angled triangle, you will need a ruler, protractor, and compass for accurate drawing and measurement.

Start by deciding on the lengths of the two legs (the sides that form the right angle) and the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle). For this example, we'll create a right-angled triangle with legs measuring $3 \, \text{cm}$ and $4 \, \text{cm}$.

1. **Draw the Base**: Use a ruler to draw a horizontal line segment that is $4 \, \text{cm}$ long. This line will serve as one leg of the triangle.

2. **Construct the Right Angle**: Position the protractor at one end of the $4 \, \text{cm}$ line segment. Use the protractor to mark a $90^\circ$ angle. Lightly draw a line along this angle; this will indicate the direction of the second leg.

3. **Draw the Second Leg**: From the $90^\circ$ mark, measure $3 \, \text{cm}$ along the line you just drew. This line represents the second leg of the triangle.

4. **Complete the Triangle**: Connect the endpoint of the $3 \, \text{cm}$ line to the other end of the $4 \, \text{cm}$ line using a ruler. This new line is the hypotenuse.

5. **Verify the Right Angle**: Check the right angle with the protractor to ensure its accuracy.

Additionally, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to verify the dimensions of your triangle. For a triangle with legs measuring $3 \, \text{cm}$ and $4 \, \text{cm}$, the length of the hypotenuse should be $5 \, \text{cm}$, as demonstrated by the equation:

$$
3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
$$

Measure the hypotenuse to confirm that it is indeed $5 \, \text{cm}$.

By following these steps, you will have accurately constructed a right-angled triangle, which can be useful in various applications within geometry and trigonometry.
