To divide a whole number by a decimal, you can simplify the process by multiplying both the whole number and the decimal by the same power of ten.

When faced with the task of dividing a whole number by a decimal, the first step is to eliminate the decimal point. This transformation makes the division straightforward. To achieve this, multiply both the whole number and the decimal by the same power of ten. The power you select should be sufficient to convert the decimal into a whole number. For example, if you are dividing $50$ by $0.2$, you would multiply both $50$ and $0.2$ by $10$. This is because $0.2 \times 10 = 2$. Thus, the original problem changes from $50 \div 0.2$ to $500 \div 2$.

After adjusting the numbers, proceed with the division as you would normally do with whole numbers. In our example, you divide $500$ by $2$, which yields $250$. Therefore, $50 \div 0.2$ equals $250$.

This method is effective because multiplying both the dividend (the number being divided) and the divisor (the number you are dividing by) by the same factor does not alter the outcome of the division. It merely simplifies the numbers involved.

It is important to choose the correct power of ten. If the decimal has one digit after the decimal point, multiply by $10$. If it has two digits, multiply by $100$, and so forth. This technique empowers you to tackle any division problem involving decimals with confidence and ease.
