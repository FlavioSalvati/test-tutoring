To calculate the volume of a compound solid consisting of a rectangular prism and a cylinder, you need to determine and sum the volumes of each individual shape.

First, let's clarify the problem. A compound solid is formed by two or more simple geometric shapes. In this case, we are dealing with a rectangular prism and a cylinder. To find the total volume, we will calculate the volume of each shape separately and then combine them.

For the rectangular prism, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
$$

Ensure that you have the measurements for the length, width, and height of the prism. Multiply these three dimensions together to obtain the volume of the rectangular prism.

Next, for the cylinder, the volume is determined using the formula:

$$
\text{Volume} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height}
$$

In this case, you will need the radius of the cylinder's base and its height. First, square the radius (by multiplying it by itself), then multiply that result by $\pi$ (approximately $3.14159$), and finally multiply by the height of the cylinder.

Once you have calculated the volumes of both shapes, simply add them together to find the total volume of the compound solid:

$$
\text{Total Volume} = \text{Volume of Rectangular Prism} + \text{Volume of Cylinder}
$$

It is important to maintain consistent units throughout your calculations. If your measurements are in centimeters, the resulting volume will be in cubic centimeters. Following this method will ensure that you accurately compute the volume of a compound solid made up of a rectangular prism and a cylinder.
