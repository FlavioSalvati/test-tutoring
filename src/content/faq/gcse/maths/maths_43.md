To determine the central value of a data set, it's crucial to identify the median. 

The median serves as the value which bifurcates a data set into two equal halves. Identifying the median involves arranging the data in ascending order, from the smallest to the largest value. 

For data sets with an odd quantity of values, the median is the number positioned in the middle. For instance, consider the set $\{3, 1, 4\}$. After sorting, it becomes $\{1, 3, 4\}$, and the median is $3$, the central value.

On the other hand, for a data set with an even number of values, the median is computed as the average of the two central values. For example, in the set $\{2, 4, 1, 3\}$, after sorting we get $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. The two central numbers are $2$ and $3$, hence the median becomes 

$$
\frac{{2 + 3}}{2} = 2.5
$$

The process of finding the median provides a valuable method to comprehend the central tendency of a data set. This is particularly beneficial when the data is inclusive of outliers or is not symmetrically distributed. Contrary to the mean, the median remains unaffected by extremely high or low values, rendering it a more robust measure of central tendency in such scenarios.
