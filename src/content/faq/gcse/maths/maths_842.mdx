To evaluate the expression $6u + 2$ when $u = 3$, we begin by substituting the value of $u$ into the expression. This means that we replace every occurrence of $u$ in the expression with $3$. Thus, the expression $6u + 2$ transforms into:

$$
6(3) + 2.
$$

Next, we apply the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). According to this rule, we perform multiplication before addition. 

First, we multiply $6$ by $3$, which yields $18$. Our expression now simplifies to:

$$
18 + 2.
$$

Finally, we add $2$ to $18$, resulting in:

$$
20.
$$

Therefore, the value of $6u + 2$ when $u = 3$ is $20$.

This process of substitution and simplification is a fundamental skill in algebra. It enables you to evaluate expressions for various values of variables, which is crucial for solving equations and understanding how changes in variables influence outcomes. Always remember to adhere to the order of operations to ensure accurate results.
