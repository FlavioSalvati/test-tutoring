The slope of the equation $y = -4x + 7$ is $-4$.

To clarify this, let's analyze the equation $y = -4x + 7$. This equation is expressed in the slope-intercept form, which is given by $y = mx + c$. In this representation, $m$ denotes the slope of the line, while $c$ indicates the y-interceptâ€”the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

In the specific equation $y = -4x + 7$, the coefficient of $x$ is $-4$. This coefficient represents the slope of the line. The slope provides information about the steepness and direction of the line: a positive slope indicates that the line ascends as you move from left to right, while a negative slope indicates a descent.

Thus, in the equation $y = -4x + 7$, the slope is $-4$. This indicates that for every unit you move to the right along the x-axis, the value of $y$ decreases by $4$ units. The negative sign signifies that the line slopes downward.

Grasping the concept of slope is essential, as it allows you to anticipate the behavior of the line. For instance, if you were to graph this equation, you would begin at the y-intercept, which is the point $(0, 7)$. From there, you could utilize the slope to identify additional points on the line. Starting from $(0, 7)$, you would move $1$ unit to the right and $4$ units down to locate the next point, and you would continue this pattern. This consistent approach enables you to accurately draw the line.
