To define the vector **a** that points from point **A** to point **B**, you can find it by subtracting the coordinates of **A** from those of **B**.

More specifically, if point **A** has coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and point **B** has coordinates $(x_2, y_2)$, the vector **a** from **A** to **B** is expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{a} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1)
$$

This means that to calculate the x-component of the vector, you subtract the x-coordinate of point **A** from the x-coordinate of point **B**. For the y-component, you perform a similar subtraction with the y-coordinates.

For instance, if **A** is located at $(2, 3)$ and **B** is at $(5, 7)$, you can compute the vector **a** as follows:
- For the x-component: $5 - 2 = 3$
- For the y-component: $7 - 3 = 4$

Thus, the vector **a** can be represented as:

$$
\mathbf{a} = (3, 4)
$$

This method can also be applied in three dimensions. If point **A** has coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and point **B** has coordinates $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, then the vector **a** from **A** to **B** is given by:

$$
\mathbf{a} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1)
$$

The same principle applies: for each corresponding component, subtract the coordinates of **A** from those of **B**.
