To estimate the sum of $123.45$ and $678.9$, we can round each number and then perform the addition.

When estimating sums, rounding numbers to the nearest whole number or to one decimal place simplifies calculations and makes them quicker. For the number $123.45$, if we round to the nearest whole number, it rounds to $123$. If we round to one decimal place, it becomes $123.5$. Similarly, for $678.9$, rounding to the nearest whole number yields $679$, while rounding to one decimal place keeps it as $678.9$.

If we choose to round both numbers to the nearest whole number, we have:
$$
123.45 \approx 123
$$
$$
678.9 \approx 679
$$
Adding these rounded values together, we get:
$$
123 + 679 = 802.
$$

Alternatively, if we round to one decimal place, we have:
$$
123.45 \approx 123.5
$$
$$
678.9 \approx 678.9
$$
Adding these values results in:
$$
123.5 + 678.9 = 802.4.
$$

Both methods provide a quick way to estimate the sum without the need for a calculator. The choice of rounding depends on the required precision of your estimate. For most situations, rounding to the nearest whole number is sufficient and easier to calculate. However, if you require a bit more accuracy, rounding to one decimal place serves as an effective compromise.
