To create a cumulative frequency graph, you will need to plot cumulative frequencies against the upper class boundaries of your data intervals.

**Step 1: Organize Your Data**
Begin by organizing your data into a frequency table. This table should list the data intervals alongside their corresponding frequencies.

**Step 2: Calculate Cumulative Frequencies**
Next, calculate the cumulative frequency for each interval. To do this, add the frequency of the current interval to the cumulative frequency of all preceding intervals. This process provides you with a running total of frequencies up to each interval.

**Step 3: Identify Upper Class Boundaries**
After determining the cumulative frequencies, identify the upper class boundary for each interval. The upper class boundary represents the maximum value that can be included in that interval. For instance, if your interval is $10-20$, the upper class boundary is $20$.

**Step 4: Set Up Your Graph**
Now, prepare to create your graph. On graph paper or using graphing software, draw a set of axes. Label the horizontal axis with the upper class boundaries and the vertical axis with the cumulative frequencies.

**Step 5: Plot the Points**
Plot each cumulative frequency at its corresponding upper class boundary. 

**Step 6: Connect the Points**
Once all points are plotted, connect them using a smooth curve or straight lines. This resulting curve is known as a cumulative frequency graph or an ogive. It visually represents the distribution of your data and facilitates the identification of medians, quartiles, and percentiles.

**Important Note:**
Keep in mind that the cumulative frequency graph always starts at zero and should rise as you move to the right, reflecting the accumulation of data. This visual representation is an effective tool for analyzing data distributions in a clear and intuitive manner.
