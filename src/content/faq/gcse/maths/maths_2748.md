The exact value of $\cos 90^\circ$ is $0$.

To understand why $\cos 90^\circ$ equals $0$, we need to explore the concept of the unit circle, which is fundamental in trigonometry. The unit circle is defined as a circle with a radius of $1$, centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. Angles on the unit circle are measured starting from the positive $x$-axis and moving in a counterclockwise direction.

In the context of the unit circle, the cosine of an angle corresponds to the $x$-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle. For instance, at an angle of $0^\circ$, the corresponding point is $(1, 0)$, which means that $\cos 0^\circ$ is $1$. As the angle increases, this point travels around the circle.

When the angle reaches $90^\circ$, the point is located at the top of the circle, represented by the coordinates $(0, 1)$. At this position, the $x$-coordinate is $0$, which is why $\cos 90^\circ$ equals $0$. This value is essential to remember, as it frequently appears in trigonometric problems and calculations.

Visualizing the unit circle can significantly aid in recalling these values. For key angles such as $0^\circ$, $90^\circ$, $180^\circ$, and $270^\circ$, the corresponding cosine values are particularly straightforward: $1$, $0$, $-1$, and $0$, respectively. Grasping these fundamental concepts will facilitate your understanding of more complex trigonometric problems in your GCSE Maths studies.
