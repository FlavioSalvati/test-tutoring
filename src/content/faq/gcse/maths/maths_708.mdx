To evaluate the expression $4^2 \times 4^{-1}$, we find that its value is $4$.

Let’s explore the reasoning behind this result by applying the laws of exponents. When multiplying numbers with the same base, we add their exponents. In this instance, the base is $4$. Thus, we can express the multiplication as follows:

$$
4^2 \times 4^{-1} = 4^{(2 + (-1))} = 4^{1} = 4
$$

Here’s a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. **Identify the exponents**: The first term, $4^2$, represents $4$ raised to the power of $2$. The second term, $4^{-1}$, signifies $4$ raised to the power of $-1$.
  
2. **Apply the multiplication rule for exponents**: According to the rules of exponents, when we multiply two powers with the same base, we add their exponents. Therefore, we calculate $2 + (-1)$.

3. **Simplify the exponent**: The sum $2 + (-1)$ results in $1$. Consequently, we can rewrite the expression as $4^2 \times 4^{-1} = 4^1$.

4. **Evaluate the final expression**: The expression $4^1$ simply denotes $4$ raised to the power of $1$, which evaluates to $4$.

This approach is grounded in the fundamental properties of exponents. A solid understanding of these principles will assist you in simplifying and solving a variety of mathematical problems effectively.
