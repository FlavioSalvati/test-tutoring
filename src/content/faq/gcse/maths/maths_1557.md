To calculate the probability of event $A$ given that event $B$ has occurred, you can use the formula:

$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} $$

This concept is known as conditional probability. The notation $P(A|B)$ represents the probability of event $A$ occurring under the condition that event $B$ has already taken place. The formula can be understood as follows:

- $P(A \cap B)$ is the joint probability, which indicates the likelihood that both events $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously.
- $P(B)$ is the probability of event $B$ occurring on its own.

To effectively apply this formula, you need to know both the joint probability of $A$ and $B$ happening together, as well as the probability of $B$ alone.

For instance, consider a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and you want to determine the probability of drawing an Ace (event $A$) given that you have drawn a red card (event $B$).

First, calculate $P(B)$, the probability of drawing a red card. There are 26 red cards in a standard deck of 52, so:

$$ P(B) = \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} $$

Next, compute $P(A \cap B)$, which is the probability of drawing a red Ace. In the deck, there are 2 red Aces, thus:

$$ P(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{52} = \frac{1}{26} $$

Finally, substitute these values into the conditional probability formula:

$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{26}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{13} $$

Therefore, the probability of drawing an Ace given that you have drawn a red card is $\frac{1}{13}$.
