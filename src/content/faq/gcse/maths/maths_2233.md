To determine the turning point of the function $ y = x^2 - 4x $, you can either complete the square or utilize differentiation.

### Completing the Square

Start with the equation:

$$ y = x^2 - 4x. $$

We want to rewrite it in the form:

$$ y = (x - a)^2 + b. $$

To do this, take the coefficient of $ x $, which is $ -4 $. Halve this value to get $ -2 $, and then square it to obtain $ 4 $. We will then add and subtract this square within the equation:

$$ y = x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4. $$

This can be simplified to:

$$ y = (x - 2)^2 - 4. $$

Now, the equation is in the desired form $ y = (x - 2)^2 - 4 $. From this representation, we can identify that the turning point occurs at $ (2, -4) $. The term $ (x - 2)^2 $ is always non-negative and reaches its minimum value of $ 0 $ when $ x = 2 $. At this point, the corresponding $ y $-value is $ -4 $.

### Using Differentiation

Alternatively, you can find the turning point by differentiating the function. Differentiate $ y = x^2 - 4x $ with respect to $ x $:

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x - 4. $$

To find the critical points, set the derivative equal to zero:

$$ 2x - 4 = 0. $$

Solving for $ x $:

$$ 2x = 4 $$
$$ x = 2. $$

Next, substitute $ x = 2 $ back into the original equation to determine the corresponding $ y $-value:

$$ y = (2)^2 - 4(2) $$
$$ y = 4 - 8 $$
$$ y = -4. $$

Thus, we conclude that the turning point is at $ (2, -4) $. This point represents a minimum because the coefficient of $ x^2 $ in the original equation is positive, indicating that the parabola opens upwards.
