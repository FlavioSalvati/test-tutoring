To find an unknown side of a triangle using the sine rule, you can utilize the formula:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}
$$

The sine rule is a valuable concept in trigonometry, particularly for solving problems involving non-right-angled triangles. It asserts that the ratio of the length of any side of a triangle to the sine of its opposite angle remains constant across all three sides and angles. In the formula, $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent the lengths of the sides, while $A$, $B$, and $C$ denote the angles opposite those respective sides.

To determine an unknown side, you must know at least one side length along with the angles corresponding to both the known and unknown sides. For instance, if you have the length of side $a$ and the measures of angles $A$ and $B$, and you wish to calculate side $b$, you can rearrange the sine rule to isolate $b$:

$$
b = \frac{a \cdot \sin(B)}{\sin(A)}
$$

Before proceeding, ensure that your angles are measured in degrees (or radians, depending on your calculator's settings). Next, substitute the known values into the formula. Use your calculator to compute the sine of the angles, followed by the necessary multiplication and division. This process will yield the length of the unknown side.

It's important to note that the sine rule is especially effective in scenarios where you have either two angles and one side (AAS or ASA) or two sides and a non-included angle (SSA). This makes the sine rule an essential component of your toolkit for solving problems in GCSE Maths, helping you to find missing sides or angles efficiently.
