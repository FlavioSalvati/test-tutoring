To substitute the value $3$ for the variable $x$ in the expression $2x + 5$, you need to replace every instance of $x$ with $3$ and then simplify the expression accordingly.

Start by substituting $3$ for $x$ in the expression $2x + 5$. This results in:

$$
2(3) + 5
$$

Next, perform the multiplication. Multiply $2$ by $3$, which yields:

$$
6
$$

Now, your expression is simplified to:

$$
6 + 5
$$

The final step is to add the numbers together. Adding $6$ and $5$ gives you:

$$
11
$$

Therefore, when you substitute $3$ for $x$ in the expression $2x + 5$, the simplified result is $11$.

This substitution process is a fundamental skill in algebra, as it allows you to evaluate expressions by inserting specific values for their variables. Understanding how changes in variable values affect the overall expression is crucial. Remember to adhere to the order of operations: execute any multiplications or divisions first, followed by additions or subtractions.
