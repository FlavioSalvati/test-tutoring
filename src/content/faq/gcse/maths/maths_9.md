A proper fraction is defined as a fraction in which the numerator is less than the denominator. 

In a proper fraction, the overall value is always less than $1$. For example, in the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, the numerator $3$ is smaller than the denominator $4$, which confirms it as a proper fraction. This is in contrast to an improper fraction, where the numerator is either equal to or greater than the denominator, such as in the cases of $\frac{5}{4}$ or $\frac{7}{7}$.

Proper fractions are commonly encountered in everyday situations, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a pizza into slices. They are easily recognizable because the numerator (the top number) is consistently smaller than the denominator (the bottom number). This relationship indicates that the fraction represents a part of a whole, rather than a whole number or more.

When working with proper fractions, you may need to simplify them by identifying the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator. For instance, the fraction $\frac{6}{8}$ can be simplified to $\frac{3}{4}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is $2$.

Understanding proper fractions is essential for solving a variety of mathematical problems, including the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions. Moreover, they provide a foundational understanding for more complex concepts such as mixed numbers and improper fractions. By mastering proper fractions, you establish a solid groundwork for further studies in mathematics.
