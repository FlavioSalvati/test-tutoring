The formula for determining combined event probabilities using a tree diagram involves calculating the product of the probabilities along the branches of the diagram.

To utilize a tree diagram for finding the probability of combined events, begin by drawing branches for each possible outcome of the first event. From each of these initial branches, extend further branches to represent the possible outcomes of the second event, and continue this process for any additional events. Each branch should be labeled with the probability of the corresponding outcome.

To calculate the probability of a specific combined event, trace the path along the branches that represent that event and multiply the probabilities along this path. For instance, if you have two events, $A$ and $B$, and you aim to determine the probability of both $A$ and $B$ occurring, you would multiply the probability of $A$ by the conditional probability of $B$ given that $A$ has occurred.

Consider a scenario where you flip a coin followed by rolling a die. The probability of flipping heads (denoted as $H$) is $\frac{1}{2}$, while the probability of rolling a 4 (denoted as $R$) is $\frac{1}{6}$. To find the probability of flipping heads and then rolling a 4, you multiply the two probabilities together:

$$
P(H \text{ and } R) = P(H) \times P(R) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{12}.
$$

Tree diagrams are particularly effective because they visually decompose complex problems into simpler, more manageable components. Each path through the tree represents a unique sequence of events, and by multiplying the probabilities along these paths, you can readily compute the combined probabilities. This systematic approach enables you to analyze all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities comprehensively.
