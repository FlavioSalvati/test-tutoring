To divide the vector $(9, -12)$ by the scalar $3$, you will divide each component of the vector by $3$. This results in the new vector $(3, -4)$.

When dividing a vector by a scalar (a single number), the process involves dividing each component of the vector individually by that scalar. In this example, the vector is $(9, -12)$ and the scalar is $3$.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Start with the x-component of the vector, which is $9$. When you divide $9$ by $3$, you obtain $3$.
2. Next, consider the y-component of the vector, which is $-12$. Dividing $-12$ by $3$ gives you $-4$.

Thus, after performing the division, the resulting vector is $(3, -4)$.

This procedure is akin to dividing each term in an algebraic expression by a number. It is crucial to note that each component of the vector is treated independently during this operation. 

This method has practical applications in various fields, including physics and engineering, where vectors are used to represent quantities such as force or velocity. By dividing the vector, you are effectively scaling it down by the factor of the scalar, thereby reducing its magnitude while maintaining its direction.
