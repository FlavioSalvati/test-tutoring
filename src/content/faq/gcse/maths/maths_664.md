To add fractions, the first step is to ensure that the denominators (the numbers on the bottom) are the same. If they are not, you will need to find a common denominator. A straightforward method to do this is to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. 

For example, consider adding the fractions $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{6}$. The LCM of $4$ and $6$ is $12$.

Next, convert each fraction into an equivalent fraction that has this common denominator. For $\frac{1}{4}$, multiply both the numerator (the top number) and the denominator by $3$ to obtain $\frac{3}{12}$. For $\frac{1}{6}$, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $2$ to get $\frac{2}{12}$. Now, both fractions are expressed with the same denominator: $\frac{3}{12}$ and $\frac{2}{12}$.

Once the fractions share a common denominator, you can add the numerators while keeping the denominator unchanged. In this instance, $\frac{3}{12} + \frac{2}{12}$ equals $\frac{5}{12}$.

Finally, verify whether the resulting fraction can be simplified. A fraction is considered simplified when the numerator and the denominator share no common factors other than $1$. In our example, $\frac{5}{12}$ is already in its simplest form, as $5$ and $12$ do not have any common factors besides $1$.

By following these steps, you can add any fractions, regardless of how different their denominators may be. Remember the essential steps: find a common denominator, add the numerators, and simplify if necessary!
