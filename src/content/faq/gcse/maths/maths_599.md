A scatter diagram, commonly referred to as a scatter plot, is a graphical tool used to display and analyze the relationship between two numerical variables.

In more detail, a scatter diagram plots individual data points on a two-dimensional plane. Each point corresponds to a pair of values, with one value from each of the two variables being compared. For instance, you might create a scatter plot to examine the relationship between the height and weight of a group of individuals, allowing you to visually assess any correlation between these two measurements.

The primary objective of a scatter diagram is to assess visually whether a correlation exists between the variables. Correlation describes how one variable changes in relation to the other. If the points on the scatter diagram tend to align in a recognizable pattern—such as a straight line or a curve—it suggests a relationship between the variables. Conversely, if the points are distributed randomly without any discernible pattern, it indicates that there is little to no correlation.

Scatter diagrams can illustrate various types of relationships: 
- **Positive correlation** occurs when both variables increase together.
- **Negative correlation** arises when one variable increases while the other decreases.
- **No correlation** reflects a lack of a clear pattern between the variables.

Additionally, scatter diagrams allow for the identification of outliers, which are data points that do not conform to the general trend. Recognizing these outliers is essential for understanding anomalies or potential errors in the dataset.

In summary, scatter diagrams serve as a crucial tool in statistics for exploring and comprehending the relationships between variables. They are fundamental components of data analysis, particularly in GCSE Mathematics.
