To express the probability of an event in terms of odds, we can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Odds} = \frac{\text{Probability}}{1 - \text{Probability}}
$$

Converting probability to odds provides a different perspective on the likelihood of an event occurring. Probability quantifies how likely an event is to happen, represented as a value between $0$ and $1$. For instance, a probability of $0.75$ indicates that there is a $75\%$ chance the event will occur.

To transform this probability into odds, we apply the aforementioned formula. Let's illustrate this with an example. Assume the probability of an event occurring is $0.75$. First, we subtract this probability from $1$:

$$
1 - 0.75 = 0.25
$$

Next, we divide the probability by this result:

$$
\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3
$$

Thus, the odds of the event occurring are $3$ to $1$. This means that for every $3$ occurrences of the event, we expect it not to occur $1$ time.

Odds are commonly used in betting and gambling to indicate the potential winnings relative to the initial stake. Understanding how to convert probability to odds can enhance your ability to analyze scenarios where odds are presented instead of probabilities.
