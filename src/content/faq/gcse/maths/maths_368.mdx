The angle in a segment of a circle is defined as the angle subtended by a chord at the circumference of the circle.

To elaborate, a segment of a circle refers to the area enclosed by a chord and the corresponding arc. The angle within this segment is specifically the angle formed at the circumference by two points on the chord. This angle is commonly referred to as the "angle subtended by the chord at the circumference."

To visualize this, consider a circle with a chord denoted as $AB$. The segment in question is the region enclosed by the chord $AB$ and the arc connecting points $A$ and $B$. If we select any point $C$ on the arc (but not on the chord), the angle $ACB$ represents the angle in the segment. Remarkably, this angle remains constant, regardless of the position of point $C$ along the arc, due to the inherent properties of circles.

This concept is particularly important in the context of circle theorems, which form a significant part of GCSE Maths. One notable theorem related to this is the "Angle in a Semicircle" theorem. This theorem asserts that the angle in a semicircle is always a right angle, specifically $90^\circ$. This situation arises when the chord is the diameter of the circle.

Grasping the concept of the angle in a segment is essential for solving various problems associated with circles, such as determining missing angles or proving that certain lines are either parallel or perpendicular. It serves as a foundational principle that underpins more advanced geometric concepts.
