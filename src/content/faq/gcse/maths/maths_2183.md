The inequality that represents the statement "n is at most 4" is given by 

$$ 
n \leq 4 
$$ 

In mathematics, inequalities express the relationship between two values when they are not equal. The phrase "n is at most 4" indicates that the value of $ n $ can take on the value of 4 or any number less than 4. We represent this relationship using the inequality symbol $ \leq $, which means "less than or equal to." Therefore, the inequality $ n \leq 4 $ signifies that $ n $ can be any of the following values: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, or any negative number.

Grasping the concept of inequalities is essential for solving numerous mathematical problems, particularly in algebra. Whenever you encounter the phrase "at most," it consistently translates to the $ \leq $ symbol. This is because "at most" includes the maximum allowable value (in this case, 4) and all values that are lower than it.

For instance, if you are tasked with finding all possible values of $ n $ that meet the condition "n is at most 4," you would compile a list of all numbers that are less than or equal to 4. This concept finds practical applications in various real-life situations, such as budgeting. For example, if you say you can spend "at most £50," it means you can spend £50 or any amount below that threshold.

In summary, the key to mastering inequalities lies in understanding the symbols and their meanings. The symbol $ \leq $ is particularly important when dealing with "at most" conditions.
