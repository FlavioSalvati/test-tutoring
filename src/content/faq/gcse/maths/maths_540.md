The probability of flipping heads twice in a row is $1$ in $4$, which is equivalent to $25\%$.

To grasp this concept more clearly, let's break it down. When you flip a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Each outcome occurs with equal probability, specifically $\frac{1}{2}$ or $50\%$. Importantly, the outcomes of each flip are independent; this means that the result of the first flip does not influence the result of the second flip.

To determine the probability of getting heads on both flips, we multiply the probability of getting heads on the first flip by the probability of getting heads on the second flip. Since each flip has a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$, the calculation is as follows:

$$
\text{Probability of heads on first flip} = \frac{1}{2} 
$$
$$
\text{Probability of heads on second flip} = \frac{1}{2} 
$$
$$
\text{Combined probability} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} 
$$

Thus, the probability of flipping heads twice in succession is $\frac{1}{4}$, which can also be expressed as $0.25$ or $25\%$. This indicates that if you were to flip a coin twice repeatedly, you would expect to achieve heads on both flips approximately $25\%$ of the time.
