The range of the function $ f(x) = x^2 $ consists of all non-negative real numbers, denoted as $ [0, \infty) $.

To determine the range of $ f(x) = x^2 $, we must analyze the possible values that this function can achieve. The function is a quadratic equation, and its graph represents a parabola that opens upwards. This characteristic indicates that for any real number $ x $, the value of $ x^2 $ will always be greater than or equal to zero.

Letâ€™s explore this in more detail: when $ x = 0 $, we have 

$$ 
f(x) = 0^2 = 0. 
$$ 

As $ x $ takes on positive or negative values, $ x^2 $ increases. For instance, if $ x = 1 $, then 

$$ 
f(x) = 1^2 = 1, 
$$ 

and if $ x = -1 $, then 

$$ 
f(x) = (-1)^2 = 1. 
$$ 

This illustrates that squaring a negative number also yields a positive result. Consequently, the function $ f(x) $ can never produce a negative value.

Since $ x^2 $ can equal zero (specifically when $ x = 0 $) or take on any positive value for any other real number $ x $, the minimum value of $ f(x) $ is $ 0 $, while there is no upper limit as $ x $ increases or decreases indefinitely. Therefore, we conclude that the range of $ f(x) = x^2 $ encompasses all non-negative real numbers, represented as 

$$ 
[0, \infty).
