The surface area of a cube with a side length of $6 \, \text{cm}$ is $216 \, \text{cm}^2$.

To calculate the surface area of a cube, you first need to determine the length of one of its sides. A cube consists of six identical square faces. The area of a single square face can be calculated by squaring the side length. In this instance, with a side length of $6 \, \text{cm}$, the area of one face is given by:

$$
6 \times 6 = 36 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

Since a cube has six identical faces, the total surface area is found by multiplying the area of one face by $6$. Thus, the total surface area of the cube is:

$$
6 \times 36 = 216 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

This calculation method is applicable to any cube, irrespective of its side length. Just remember to square the side length to find the area of one face, and then multiply by $6$ to account for all six faces. The formula for the surface area can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 6a^2,
$$

where $a$ represents the side length of the cube. For our specific cube with a side length of $6 \, \text{cm}$, the formula becomes:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 6 \times 6^2 = 6 \times 36 = 216 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$
