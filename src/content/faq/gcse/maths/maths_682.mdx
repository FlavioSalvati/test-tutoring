The median value of the given set is $15$.

To determine the median, we first need to arrange the numbers in ascending order. The original set consists of the numbers $10$, $5$, $15$, $20$, and $25$. When we organize these numbers from smallest to largest, we obtain the sequence: 

$$5, 10, 15, 20, 25.$$

The median is defined as the middle number in a sorted list. Since there are five numbers in this set, the median corresponds to the third number in the ordered sequence. Counting from the left, we find that the third number is $15$. Thus, the median value is $15$.

In cases where the dataset contains an even number of values, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers. For instance, if the set were $5$, $10$, $15$, $20$, $25$, and $30$, we would identify the two middle numbers, which are $15$ and $20$. To find the median, we would compute their average as follows:

$$\text{Median} = \frac{15 + 20}{2} = 17.5.$$

However, since our current set has an odd number of values, the median is simply the middle number, which is $15$.
