To determine the expected frequency of selecting a black card, you can calculate it by multiplying the probability of drawing a black card by the total number of trials.

In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, there are 26 black cards (comprising spades and clubs) and 26 red cards (hearts and diamonds). Therefore, the probability of selecting a black card in a single trial is given by the ratio of black cards to the total number of cards:

$$
\text{Probability of selecting a black card} = \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5.
$$

To find the expected frequency of drawing a black card 26 times out of 52 trials, you multiply the probability of selecting a black card by the total number of trials. Since you are conducting 52 trials, the calculation is as follows:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \text{Probability} \times \text{Number of Trials}
$$

Substituting the values, we have:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = 0.5 \times 52 = 26.
$$

Thus, the expected frequency of selecting a black card 26 times out of 52 trials is $26$. This implies that, on average, you would expect to draw a black card $26$ times if you were to repeat this experiment numerous times.
