The notation for the probability of not drawing a spade can be expressed as $ P(\text{not spade}) $.

In the field of probability, events are typically represented using capital letters, and the probability of an event occurring is denoted as $ P(\text{Event}) $. When considering the event of not drawing a spade from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, we are actually examining the complement of the event of drawing a spade. The complement of an event $ A $ is conventionally indicated as $ A' $ or $ \text{not } A $. Thus, the event of not drawing a spade can be formally represented as $ P(\text{not spade}) $.

A standard deck consists of 52 cards, which are divided into four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Each suit contains 13 cards, meaning there are 13 spades in the deck. The probability of drawing a spade is denoted as $ P(\text{spade}) $. Since there are 13 spades, the probability of drawing a spade can be calculated as:

$$
P(\text{spade}) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}.
$$

To find the probability of the complementary event—namely, not drawing a spade—we subtract the probability of drawing a spade from 1. This is based on the principle that the total probability of all possible outcomes must equal 1. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

$$
P(\text{not spade}) = 1 - P(\text{spade}).
$$

Given that $ P(\text{spade}) = \frac{1}{4} $, we can calculate:

$$
P(\text{not spade}) = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.
$$ 

In summary, the probability of not drawing a spade from a standard deck of cards is $ \frac{3}{4} $.
