To subtract mixed numbers with unlike denominators, follow these steps: convert the mixed numbers into improper fractions, find a common denominator, and then perform the subtraction.

Begin by converting each mixed number into an improper fraction. For instance, consider the mixed numbers $2 \frac{1}{3}$ and $1 \frac{1}{4}$. Converting these yields:
- $2 \frac{1}{3}$ becomes $\frac{7}{3}$, and 
- $1 \frac{1}{4}$ becomes $\frac{5}{4}$.

Next, identify a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators in this case are $3$ and $4$. The least common multiple (LCM) of $3$ and $4$ is $12$. Therefore, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
- $\frac{7}{3}$ is converted to $\frac{28}{12}$, and 
- $\frac{5}{4}$ is converted to $\frac{15}{12}$.

Now, you can subtract the fractions:
$$
\frac{28}{12} - \frac{15}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.
$$

If necessary, convert the result back to a mixed number. Here, $\frac{13}{12}$ can be expressed as $1 \frac{1}{12}$.

Thus, the final result of the subtraction is:
$$
2 \frac{1}{3} - 1 \frac{1}{4} = 1 \frac{1}{12}.
$$
