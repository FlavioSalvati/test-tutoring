To subtract fractions with different denominators, follow these steps: find a common denominator, convert the fractions to equivalent fractions, and then subtract the numerators.

The first step in subtracting fractions with different denominators is to determine a common denominator. This is typically the least common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators. For instance, if you are subtracting $\frac{3}{4}$ from $\frac{5}{6}$, the denominators are $4$ and $6$. The LCM of $4$ and $6$ is $12$.

Next, convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction that has the common denominator. To achieve this, divide the common denominator by the original denominator and multiply both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by this quotient. For the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, you would multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $3$ (since $12 \div 4 = 3$), resulting in the equivalent fraction $\frac{9}{12}$. For the fraction $\frac{5}{6}$, you would multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $2$ (since $12 \div 6 = 2$), giving you $\frac{10}{12}$.

Now that both fractions share the same denominator, you can subtract the numerators while keeping the denominator unchanged. Therefore, the calculation becomes:

$$
\frac{10}{12} - \frac{9}{12} = \frac{1}{12}.
$$

Finally, check if the resulting fraction can be simplified. In this case, $\frac{1}{12}$ is already in its simplest form. By following these steps, you can accurately subtract any fractions with different denominators.
