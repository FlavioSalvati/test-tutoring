The expression $$\frac{a^2}{a^4}$$ simplifies to $$\frac{1}{a^2}$$. 

To clarify this process, let's break it down step by step. When dividing powers that share the same base, we subtract the exponents. In this case, the base is $a$. Therefore, we can rewrite $$\frac{a^2}{a^4}$$ as $$a^{2-4}$$. By performing the subtraction, we obtain $$a^{-2}$$.

Now, what does $$a^{-2}$$ signify? A negative exponent indicates that we take the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent. Thus, $$a^{-2}$$ is equivalent to $$\frac{1}{a^2}$$. Consequently, we conclude that $$\frac{a^2}{a^4} = \frac{1}{a^2}$$.

This principle is part of the laws of exponents, which are essential rules for manipulating powers in mathematics. These laws are particularly useful for simplifying expressions and solving equations that involve exponents. To remember:

- When multiplying powers with the same base, we add the exponents.
- When dividing, we subtract the exponents.
- Negative exponents indicate reciprocals.
- A zero exponent always equals one.

In summary, the expression $$\frac{a^2}{a^4}$$ simplifies to $$\frac{1}{a^2}$$ by applying the exponent subtraction rule and understanding the implication of negative exponents.
