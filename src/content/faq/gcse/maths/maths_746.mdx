The lower bound for rounding $78.9$ to one decimal place is $78.85$.

When rounding a number to one decimal place, we focus on the value nearest to the tenths. To identify the lower bound, we must determine the smallest number that, when rounded to one decimal place, results in $78.9$.

To accomplish this, we examine the digit in the second decimal place. Although the second decimal place is not explicitly shown in $78.9$, we can represent it as $78.90$. The smallest number that will round to $78.9$ is $78.85$. Any number below $78.85$ will round down to $78.8$ when rounded to one decimal place.

In other words, any number that lies in the range between $78.85$ and $78.95$ (excluding $78.95$) will round to $78.9$. Thus, the lower bound is established as $78.85$. Understanding this concept is crucial in various mathematical applications, particularly when dealing with measurements and the precision of data.
