After translating the point $(3, 3)$ by the vector $(2, -4)$, the resulting coordinates are $(5, -1)$.

To clarify this process, let's break down the concept of translation. In geometry, translation refers to moving a point or shape a specified distance in a particular direction. This movement is defined by a vector, which consists of both a direction and a magnitude. Here, the vector $(2, -4)$ indicates that we should move 2 units to the right (in the positive x-direction) and 4 units downward (in the negative y-direction).

Starting with the point $(3, 3)$, we apply the translation vector $(2, -4)$. This is accomplished by adding the x-component of the vector to the x-coordinate of the point, and the y-component of the vector to the y-coordinate of the point. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
(x, y) \rightarrow (x + a, y + b)
$$

where $(x, y)$ represents the original point, and $(a, b)$ denotes the translation vector.

For our specific example, we have:

$$
(3, 3) \rightarrow (3 + 2, 3 - 4)
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
(3, 3) \rightarrow (5, -1)
$$

Thus, after translating the point $(3, 3)$ by the vector $(2, -4)$, we arrive at the new coordinates $(5, -1)$. This indicates that the point has moved 2 units to the right and 4 units down from its initial position. 

Grasping this concept is essential for tackling various problems in coordinate geometry, as it enhances our ability to visualize and manipulate points and shapes on a graph.
