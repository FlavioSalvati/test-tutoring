To determine the diagonal of a rectangle, we can apply Pythagoras' Theorem, which states:

$$ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} $$

Pythagoras' Theorem indicates that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In the case of a rectangle, the diagonal acts as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, with the rectangle's length $l$ and width $w$ representing the other two sides.

Letâ€™s break down the process step-by-step. Assume you have a rectangle with a length $l$ and a width $w$. To find the length of the diagonal $d$, visualize a right-angled triangle inside the rectangle, where the diagonal serves as the hypotenuse. According to Pythagoras' Theorem, the relationship between the sides is expressed as:

$$ d^2 = l^2 + w^2 $$

To solve for $d$, take the square root of both sides of the equation:

$$ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} $$

For instance, if the length of the rectangle is $3$ units and the width is $4$ units, the calculation for the diagonal would proceed as follows:

$$ d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 $$

Thus, the diagonal of a rectangle with a length of $3$ units and a width of $4$ units measures $5$ units. This method is universally applicable to any rectangle, irrespective of its dimensions, making it an essential and versatile tool in the study of geometry.
