Outliers in a scatter diagram are defined as points that significantly deviate from the overall pattern of the data.

In a scatter diagram, each point represents a pair of values, typically corresponding to two variables. To identify outliers, begin by examining the general trend or pattern formed by the majority of the points. This trend may manifest as a straight line, a curve, or a cluster of points. Outliers are those points that lie far removed from this established trend. For instance, if most points align along a straight line, a point that is considerably above or below this line would be classified as an outlier.

Another effective method for identifying outliers involves calculating the mean (average) and standard deviation of the dataset. Points that lie more than two or three standard deviations away from the mean are often designated as outliers. Although this method is more precise, it does require some calculations.

Additionally, a visual method known as the "box plot" or "box-and-whisker plot" can be employed to help detect outliers. In a box plot, outliers are typically represented as individual points that fall outside the "whiskers" of the plot. These whiskers extend to a range of values that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the quartiles.

Finally, various software tools and calculators are available that can automatically highlight outliers in a scatter diagram, simplifying the process of identification without the need for manual calculations. It is crucial to identify outliers, as they can significantly influence the results of your analysis and may indicate errors or unique cases within your data.
