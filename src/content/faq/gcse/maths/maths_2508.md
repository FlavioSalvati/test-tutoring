To determine the actual length from a scale drawing, you need to multiply the length indicated on the drawing by the scale factor.

A scale drawing is a representation of an object or space that is proportionally scaled down or scaled up from its true dimensions. The scale factor is the ratio that relates the dimensions of the drawing to those of the actual object. For instance, a scale of $1:50$ indicates that $1$ unit on the drawing corresponds to $50$ units in real life.

To calculate the actual length, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Length**: First, measure the length on the scale drawing.
2. **Determine the Scale Factor**: This information is typically found in the drawing's key or legend. For example, if the scale is $1:50$, it means that each $1$ unit on the drawing represents $50$ units in reality.

Next, multiply the length obtained from the drawing by the scale factor. For example, if a line on the drawing measures $3$ cm and the scale is $1:50$, the calculation for the actual length would be:

$$
\text{Actual Length} = 3 \, \text{cm} \times 50 = 150 \, \text{cm} \quad \text{(or } 1.5 \, \text{m)}
$$

It is important to maintain consistent units throughout the calculation. If the length on the drawing is measured in centimeters, the resulting actual length will also be in centimeters, unless a conversion is performed. This method ensures that you accurately derive the real-world dimensions from a scaled representation.
