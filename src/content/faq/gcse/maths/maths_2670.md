The surface area of a cylinder with a radius of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and a height of $12 \, \text{cm}$ is approximately $534.07 \, \text{cm}^2$.

To calculate the surface area of a cylinder, we need to determine both the lateral surface area and the area of the two circular bases. The formula for the total surface area $A$ of a cylinder is:

$$
A = 2\pi r (r + h)
$$

where $r$ represents the radius and $h$ represents the height of the cylinder.

Let's identify the values we have:
- Radius: $r = 5 \, \text{cm}$
- Height: $h = 12 \, \text{cm}$

We can now substitute these values into the formula:

$$
A = 2\pi \times 5 \times (5 + 12)
$$

Next, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

$$
5 + 12 = 17
$$

Now, we rewrite the equation with this simplification:

$$
A = 2\pi \times 5 \times 17
$$

Calculating step-by-step, we first multiply:

$$
2 \times 5 = 10
$$

Then, we continue with:

$$
10 \times 17 = 170
$$

Thus, we can express the area as:

$$
A = 170\pi
$$

Using the approximation $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we can compute:

$$
A \approx 170 \times 3.14159
$$

This results in:

$$
A \approx 534.07
$$

In conclusion, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately $534.07 \, \text{cm}^2$. This total includes the areas of the two circular bases as well as the curved surface that encircles the sides.
