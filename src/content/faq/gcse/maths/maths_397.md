The area of a circle with a diameter of $8$ cm is $50.24$ square centimeters.

To calculate the area of a circle, you can use the formula 

$$ A = \pi r^2 $$ 

where $A$ represents the area, $\pi$ (pi) is approximately $3.14$, and $r$ is the radius of the circle. The radius is half of the diameter. Given that the diameter is $8$ cm, we can determine the radius $r$ as follows:

$$ r = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ cm}. $$

Next, we can substitute the radius into the area formula:

$$ A = \pi r^2 $$

Substituting for $r$:

$$ A = \pi (4)^2 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ A = \pi \times 16 $$

Calculating the area using the approximate value of $\pi$:

$$ A = 3.14 \times 16 $$

Thus, we find:

$$ A = 50.24. $$

Therefore, the area of the circle is $50.24$ square centimeters. 

This method can be applied to any circle as long as you know either the diameter or the radius. Remember, the key steps are to first find the radius if you are given the diameter, and then apply the area formula. This principle is fundamental in geometry and has numerous practical applications, such as in the design of circular objects or spaces.
