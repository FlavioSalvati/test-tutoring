The coordinates of the midpoint between two points are $(-1, 2)$.

To determine the midpoint of two given points, we utilize the midpoint formula:

$$
\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right).
$$

This formula calculates the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two points.

In this particular instance, the points provided are $(1, -1)$ and $(-3, 5)$. To compute the x-coordinate of the midpoint, we add the x-coordinates of the two points and then divide by 2:

$$
\frac{1 + (-3)}{2} = \frac{1 - 3}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1.
$$

Next, to find the y-coordinate of the midpoint, we sum the y-coordinates of the two points and divide by 2:

$$
\frac{-1 + 5}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2.
$$

Thus, the coordinates of the midpoint are $(-1, 2)$. This point lies precisely halfway between $(1, -1)$ and $(-3, 5)$ on a coordinate plane. Understanding how to find the midpoint is valuable in various fields of geometry, as it aids in solving problems related to line segments and distances.
