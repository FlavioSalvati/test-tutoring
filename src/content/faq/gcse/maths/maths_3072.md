To calculate the cumulative frequency, you need to add the frequency of the current class interval to the cumulative frequency of the previous class interval.

Cumulative frequency represents a running total of frequencies for each class in a frequency distribution table. The calculation begins with the first class interval, where the cumulative frequency is simply equal to the frequency of that interval. For subsequent class intervals, you add the frequency of the current interval to the cumulative frequency of the previous interval. This process is repeated for all class intervals.

For instance, consider a frequency distribution table that lists class intervals along with their corresponding frequencies. You would start by recording the frequency of the first class interval as its cumulative frequency. For the second class interval, you add its frequency to the cumulative frequency of the first interval. This yields the cumulative frequency for the second interval. You continue this process for each class interval.

Here is an example of a frequency distribution table:

| Class Interval | Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|
| $0-10$         | $5$       |
| $10-20$       | $7$       |
| $20-30$       | $3$       |
| $30-40$       | $6$       |

The corresponding cumulative frequency table would be:

| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| $0-10$         | $5$       | $5$                  |
| $10-20$       | $7$       | $12$                 | ($5 + 7$)          |
| $20-30$       | $3$       | $15$                 | ($12 + 3$)         |
| $30-40$       | $6$       | $21$                 | ($15 + 6$)         |

By following this systematic approach, you can easily determine the cumulative frequency for any class interval in your dataset.
