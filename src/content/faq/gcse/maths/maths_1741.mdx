A proper subset is defined as a set that includes some, but not all, elements of another set.

To elaborate, let's consider two sets, $ A $ and $ B $. Set $ A $ is classified as a proper subset of set $ B $ if every element of $ A $ is also an element of $ B $, and $ B $ contains at least one element that is not present in $ A $. This relationship is denoted as $ A \subset B $, which is read as "A is a proper subset of B."

For example, let $ B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} $ and $ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $. In this case, $ A $ is a proper subset of $ B $ because all elements of $ A $ (specifically, 1, 2, and 3) are included in $ B $, while $ B $ contains an additional element, namely 4, that is not part of $ A $.

It is essential to distinguish between a proper subset and a subset. A subset can be identical to the original set, meaning it may contain all elements of that set. For instance, $ \{1, 2, 3, 4\} $ is a subset of $ \{1, 2, 3, 4\} $, but it is not a proper subset because it includes every element of the original set.

Understanding proper subsets is crucial in various fields of mathematics, including set theory, probability, and logic. This concept facilitates the analysis of relationships between different sets and enhances our comprehension of how they interact with one another.
