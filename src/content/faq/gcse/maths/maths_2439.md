The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the equation $ y = -3x + 4 $ is given as $\frac{1}{3}$.

To clarify why this is the case, let's first examine the gradient of the original line. The equation $ y = -3x + 4 $ is expressed in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the gradient. In this instance, the gradient $ m $ is $-3$.

A fundamental property of perpendicular lines is that the product of their gradients equals $-1$. Thus, if we denote the gradient of one line as $ m $, the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to it can be determined using the formula:

$$
m_{\text{perpendicular}} = -\frac{1}{m}.
$$

In our case, since the gradient of the given line is $ -3 $, we can calculate the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to it by taking the negative reciprocal of $-3$. The reciprocal of $-3$ is $-\frac{1}{3}$, and taking the negative of that gives us:

$$
m_{\text{perpendicular}} = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

Consequently, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to $ y = -3x + 4 $ is indeed $\frac{1}{3}$. This indicates that for every 3 units moved horizontally along the perpendicular line, there will be a corresponding vertical movement of 1 unit. Understanding this relationship is crucial for visualizing how the slopes of perpendicular lines interact on a graph.
