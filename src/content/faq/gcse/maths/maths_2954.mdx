The probability of event $A$ occurring given that event $B$ has occurred, denoted as $P(A|B)$, is $0.4$.

To calculate $P(A|B)$, we utilize the formula for conditional probability:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}.
$$

In this scenario, we have the values $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.2$ and $P(B) = 0.5$. 

By substituting these values into the formula, we can compute $P(A|B)$:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.5}.
$$

Dividing $0.2$ by $0.5$ yields $0.4$. Thus, the probability of event $A$ occurring, given that event $B$ has already occurred, is $0.4$.

This indicates that if we know event $B$ has taken place, there is a $40\%$ chance that event $A$ will also occur. 

Understanding conditional probability is essential as it allows us to analyze situations where events are interdependent, and the occurrence of one event influences the probability of another.
