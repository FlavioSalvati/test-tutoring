To convert a percentage into a fraction, let's take the example of $45\%$. The first step is to express the percentage as a fraction over $100$, since "percent" literally means "per hundred." Hence, we can write:

$$
45\% = \frac{45}{100}
$$

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator ($45$) and the denominator ($100$).

To identify the GCD, we list the factors of both numbers. The factors of $45$ are $1$, $3$, $5$, $9$, $15$, and $45$. The factors of $100$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, $10$, $20$, $25$, $50$, and $100$. The largest common factor between these two sets is $5$.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

$$
\frac{45 \div 5}{100 \div 5} = \frac{9}{20}
$$

Thus, we can conclude that:

$$
45\% = \frac{9}{20}
$$

This shows that $45\%$ is equivalent to the fraction $\frac{9}{20}$. 

Understanding how to simplify fractions is a vital skill in mathematics, as it makes calculations easier and enhances comprehension. Always remember to check if a fraction can be simplified further by determining the GCD of the numerator and the denominator.
