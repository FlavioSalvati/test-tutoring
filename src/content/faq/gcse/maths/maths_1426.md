To reflect the point $(1, 2)$ over the line $y = -x$, we need to follow a straightforward procedure that involves two key steps: swapping the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, and then negating both coordinates.

Starting with the point $(1, 2)$, we first swap the coordinates, resulting in $(2, 1)$. Next, we negate both coordinates, transforming $(2, 1)$ into $(-2, -1)$. Thus, the reflection of the point $(1, 2)$ over the line $y = -x$ is $(-2, -1)$.

This method is effective because the line $y = -x$ is a diagonal line that extends from the upper left to the lower right of the coordinate plane. Reflecting a point over this line can be visualized as flipping the point across the diagonal. This process inherently involves swapping the $x$ and $y$ values and then changing their signs to correctly orient the reflected point. This technique can be universally applied to any point to determine its reflection over the line $y = -x$.
