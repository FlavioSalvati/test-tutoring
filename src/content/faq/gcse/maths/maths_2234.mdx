The graph of the function $ y = x^2 - 4 $ represents a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex located at the point $ (0, -4) $.

To delve deeper, the equation $ y = x^2 - 4 $ is a specific instance of a quadratic function. The standard form of a quadratic function is given by 

$$ 
y = ax^2 + bx + c 
$$ 

In this case, the coefficients are $ a = 1 $, $ b = 0 $, and $ c = -4 $. The value of the coefficient $ a $ determines the direction in which the parabola opens. Since $ a $ is positive ($ 1 $), the parabola opens upwards.

The vertex of the parabola is the point at which it changes direction. For the function $ y = x^2 - 4 $, we can determine the vertex using the vertex formula:

$$ 
x = -\frac{b}{2a} 
$$ 

Here, $ b = 0 $, which gives us an x-coordinate for the vertex of $ 0 $. Plugging $ x = 0 $ back into the equation yields:

$$ 
y = 0^2 - 4 = -4 
$$ 

Thus, the vertex is located at the point $ (0, -4) $.

The graph also features two x-intercepts, which are the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. These intersections occur when $ y = 0 $. To find the x-intercepts, we set the equation to zero:

$$ 
x^2 - 4 = 0 
$$ 

This simplifies to 

$$ 
x^2 = 4 
$$ 

Taking the square root of both sides gives us the solutions $ x = 2 $ and $ x = -2 $. Therefore, the x-intercepts of the graph are at the points $ (2, 0) $ and $ (-2, 0) $.

The y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis, occurring when $ x = 0 $. Substituting $ x = 0 $ into the equation yields:

$$ 
y = -4 
$$ 

Thus, the y-intercept is at the point $ (0, -4) $.

In summary, the graph of $ y = x^2 - 4 $ is a symmetrical, U-shaped curve with its lowest point at $ (0, -4) $, intersecting the x-axis at $ (2, 0) $ and $ (-2, 0) $.
