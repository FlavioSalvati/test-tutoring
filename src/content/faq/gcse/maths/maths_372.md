To convert $5$ metres to centimetres, you simply multiply $5$ by $100$, resulting in $500$ centimetres.

The metric system is structured around powers of ten, which simplifies the process of unit conversion. The metre serves as the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI), and it is defined such that one metre is equal to $100$ centimetres. This relationship is fundamental for converting between these two units.

To convert from metres to centimetres, you rely on the fact that $1$ metre is equivalent to $100$ centimetres. Therefore, to determine how many centimetres are contained in $5$ metres, you multiply the number of metres by $100$. This can be mathematically expressed as:

$$ 5 \text{ metres} \times 100 \text{ centimetres/metre} = 500 \text{ centimetres} $$

This conversion method is applicable to any quantity expressed in metres. For instance, if you have $3$ metres, you would perform the multiplication:

$$ 3 \text{ metres} \times 100 \text{ centimetres/metre} = 300 \text{ centimetres} $$

Similarly, for $7.5$ metres, the calculation would be:

$$ 7.5 \text{ metres} \times 100 \text{ centimetres/metre} = 750 \text{ centimetres} $$

Understanding how to convert between these units is crucial for various real-world applications, such as measuring distances, heights, or lengths in differing units. It is particularly relevant in fields like physics, engineering, and everyday situations where accurate measurements are essential. The key takeaway is to remember that $1$ metre equals $100$ centimetres, allowing you to simply multiply by $100$ to convert metres to centimetres effectively.
