The intercepts of the quadratic equation $y = 2x^2 - 3x + 1$ can be identified as follows: the y-intercept occurs at the point $(0, 1)$, and the x-intercepts are located at the points $(1, 0)$ and $(0.5, 0)$.

To determine the y-intercept, we set $x = 0$ and solve for $y$. By substituting $x = 0$ into the equation, we have:

$$
y = 2(0)^2 - 3(0) + 1 = 1.
$$

Thus, the y-intercept is at the coordinate $(0, 1)$.

Next, to find the x-intercepts, we set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$. This requires resolving the quadratic equation:

$$
2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0.
$$

We will apply the quadratic formula, which is given by 

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
$$ 

where $a = 2$, $b = -3$, and $c = 1$. Substituting these coefficients into the formula, we obtain:

$$
x = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(2)(1)}}{2(2)}.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}}{4},
$$
$$
x = \frac{3 \pm 1}{4}.
$$

From this, we derive two solutions:

$$
x = \frac{3 + 1}{4} = 1,
$$
$$
x = \frac{3 - 1}{4} = 0.5.
$$

Consequently, the x-intercepts of the graph are at the points $(1, 0)$ and $(0.5, 0)$.

In summary, the y-intercept indicates where the graph intersects the y-axis, while the x-intercepts show where it crosses the x-axis. For the quadratic equation $y = 2x^2 - 3x + 1$, the intercepts are located at the points $(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(0.5, 0)$, respectively.
