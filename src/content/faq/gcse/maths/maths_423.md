The volume of a compound solid that consists of a prism and a cone is simply the sum of their individual volumes.

To determine the total volume of a compound solid made up of a prism and a cone, you must first calculate the volume of each shape separately and then combine these volumes. Let's go through the process step by step.

### Step 1: Volume of the Prism

To calculate the volume $ V_{\text{prism}} $ of a prism, you need to know the area of its base and its height. The formula for the volume of a prism is:

$$ 
V_{\text{prism}} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} 
$$

For example, consider a rectangular prism with a base length of $ 5 \, \text{cm} $ and a width of $ 3 \, \text{cm} $, and a height of $ 10 \, \text{cm} $. The area of the base would be:

$$ 
\text{Base Area} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \, \text{cm}^2 
$$

Consequently, the volume of the prism is calculated as follows:

$$ 
V_{\text{prism}} = 15 \times 10 = 150 \, \text{cm}^3 
$$

### Step 2: Volume of the Cone

Next, to find the volume $ V_{\text{cone}} $ of the cone, you need the radius of its base and its height. The formula for the volume of a cone is:

$$ 
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h 
$$

where $ r $ represents the radius of the base and $ h $ is the height. For example, if the radius of the cone's base is $ 2 \, \text{cm} $ and the height is $ 6 \, \text{cm} $, the volume can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (2)^2 (6) 
$$

Calculating this step by step:

$$ 
= \frac{1}{3} \pi (4)(6) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (24) = 8\pi \approx 25.13 \, \text{cm}^3 
$$

### Step 3: Total Volume of the Compound Solid

Finally, to obtain the total volume $ V_{\text{total}} $ of the compound solid, you simply add the volumes of the prism and the cone:

$$ 
V_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{prism}} + V_{\text{cone}} 
$$

Using our previously calculated values, we have:

$$ 
V_{\text{total}} = 150 + 25.13 \approx 175.13 \, \text{cm}^3 
$$

In summary, by calculating the volumes of the individual shapes and summing them, you can effectively determine the volume of the compound solid.
