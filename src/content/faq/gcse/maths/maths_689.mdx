To add two fractions, the first step is to make sure that their denominators (the bottom numbers) are the same. If the denominators differ, you need to find a common denominator, which is a number that both denominators can evenly divide into. A straightforward method to find a common denominator is to multiply the two denominators together. However, you may sometimes find a smaller common multiple that works.

For instance, consider adding the fractions $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{6}$. Here, the denominators are $4$ and $6$. The smallest common multiple of $4$ and $6$ is $12$. Next, you will convert each fraction into an equivalent fraction that has a denominator of $12$. 

To convert $\frac{1}{4}$, multiply both the numerator (the top number) and the denominator by $3$, resulting in $\frac{3}{12}$. For $\frac{1}{6}$, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $2$ to obtain $\frac{2}{12}$.

Now that both fractions have the same denominator, you can proceed to add the numerators together:

$$
\frac{3}{12} + \frac{2}{12} = \frac{5}{12}.
$$

The denominator remains unchanged, and only the numerators are added.

Finally, it's important to check if the resulting fraction can be simplified. In this case, $\frac{5}{12}$ is already in its simplest form. If simplification is possible, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

By following these steps, you can accurately and effectively add any two fractions, ensuring that your final answer is both correct and simplified.
