The probability scale for assessing the likelihood of events ranges from $0$ to $1$. An event with a probability of $0$ is deemed impossible, indicating that it will never occur. Conversely, an event with a probability of $1$ is considered certain, meaning it will definitely happen. Most events, however, fall somewhere between these two extremes.

When we refer to an event as "unlikely," we imply that it has a low chance of occurring. On the probability scale, this value is closer to $0$ but not exactly $0$. For instance, if you roll a fair six-sided die, the probability of rolling a $1$ is given by the fraction $\frac{1}{6}$, which is approximately $0.167$. This value is classified as unlikely since it is much nearer to $0$ than to $1$.

In everyday language, when something is described as unlikely, it typically refers to a probability of less than $0.5$. This indicates that it is more probable that the event will not occur than that it will. For example, if a weather forecast predicts a $20\%$ chance of rain, this corresponds to a probability of $0.2$, which is indeed considered unlikely.

Grasping the probability scale enhances your ability to analyze and interpret the likelihood of various events, whether you are engaging with simple games of chance or navigating more intricate real-world scenarios.
