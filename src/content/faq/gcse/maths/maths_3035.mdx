To create a histogram with unequal class intervals, it is essential to use frequency density rather than simple frequency for the y-axis.

The first step in this process is to calculate the frequency density for each class interval. Frequency density is determined by dividing the frequency of each class by the width of that class interval. This approach ensures that the area of each bar in the histogram accurately represents the frequency of the data, even when the class widths vary.

For example, consider a class interval of $10-20$ with a frequency of $15$, and another class interval of $20-50$ with a frequency of $30$. The frequency densities for these intervals can be calculated as follows:

- For the $10-20$ interval: 
$$
\text{Frequency Density} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Class Width}} = \frac{15}{20-10} = 1.5
$$

- For the $20-50$ interval: 
$$
\text{Frequency Density} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Class Width}} = \frac{30}{50-20} = 1
$$

Once the frequency densities have been calculated, you can proceed to plot the histogram. Place the class intervals on the x-axis and the corresponding frequency densities on the y-axis. Each bar should be drawn for its respective class interval, with the height of the bar reflecting the calculated frequency density. The width of each bar should align with the width of its respective class interval.

This method guarantees that the area of each bar is proportional to the frequency of the data within that interval, thereby providing a clear and accurate visual representation of the data distribution, even when class intervals are unequal.
