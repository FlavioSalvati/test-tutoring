To determine the length of a side in a triangle using the cosine rule, you can apply the following formula:

$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cdot \cos(A)
$$

The cosine rule is particularly advantageous for solving problems involving non-right-angled triangles. This formula establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the cosine of one of its angles. In the formula, $a$ represents the side you wish to calculate, while $b$ and $c$ are the lengths of the other two sides, and $A$ is the angle opposite side $a$.

To effectively use this formula, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sides and angle**: Label the sides of the triangle as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Designate the angle opposite side $a$ as $A$.
2. **Substitute known values**: Insert the values of $b$, $c$, and $A$ into the formula.
3. **Perform calculations step-by-step**:
   - Begin by squaring the lengths of sides $b$ and $c$.
   - Next, calculate $2bc \cdot \cos(A)$.
4. **Calculate the result**: Subtract the result from the sum of the squares of $b$ and $c$.
5. **Find the length of side $a$**: Finally, take the square root of the result to determine the length of side $a$.

For example, letâ€™s consider a scenario where $b = 5$, $c = 7$, and $A = 60^\circ$. We can apply the cosine rule as follows:

$$
a^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot \cos(60^\circ)
$$

Calculating this step-by-step:

$$
a^2 = 25 + 49 - 70 \cdot 0.5
$$

$$
a^2 = 74 - 35
$$

$$
a^2 = 39
$$

Taking the square root gives:

$$
a = \sqrt{39} \approx 6.24
$$

Thus, the length of side $a$ is approximately $6.24$ units.
