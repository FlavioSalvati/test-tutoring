To calculate the angles in a regular nonagon, you begin by dividing the total sum of interior angles, which is $1260$ degrees, by the number of angles, which is $9$.

A regular nonagon is defined as a polygon with nine sides where all sides and angles are congruent. To find the measure of each interior angle, you first need to determine the total sum of all interior angles. The formula for calculating the sum of the interior angles in any polygon is given by:

$$
(n-2) \times 180
$$

where $n$ represents the number of sides. For a nonagon, since $n = 9$, the calculation becomes:

$$
(9-2) \times 180 = 7 \times 180 = 1260 \text{ degrees.}
$$

Since a regular nonagon has all angles equal, you can find the measure of each interior angle by dividing the total sum of the interior angles by the number of angles:

$$
\frac{1260}{9} = 140 \text{ degrees.}
$$

Now, let's consider the exterior angles. It is important to note that the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always $360$ degrees. For a regular nonagon, where all exterior angles are equal, you can find the measure of each exterior angle by dividing $360$ degrees by $9$:

$$
\frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ degrees.}
$$

In summary, for a regular nonagon, each interior angle measures $140$ degrees, while each exterior angle measures $40$ degrees.
