A rational number is defined as any number that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers.

More specifically, a rational number can be represented in the form $ \frac{a}{b} $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are integers and $ b $ is not equal to zero. This definition encompasses whole numbers, fractions, and both finite and repeating decimals. For instance, the number $3$ is rational because it can be expressed as $ \frac{3}{1} $. Similarly, the fraction $ \frac{1}{2} $ and the repeating decimal $ 0.333... $ (which is equivalent to $ \frac{1}{3} $) are also classified as rational numbers.

Rational numbers belong to the broader category of real numbers, which also includes irrational numbers. Unlike rational numbers, irrational numbers cannot be represented as a simple fraction of two integers. Notable examples of irrational numbers include $ \pi $ and the square root of $2$, both of which possess non-repeating and non-terminating decimal expansions.

A solid understanding of rational numbers is essential in GCSE Maths, as they serve as the foundation for numerous topics such as algebra, ratios, and proportions. When working with rational numbers, you can perform standard arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (with the exception of division by zero). Recognizing and manipulating rational numbers is vital for solving equations and grasping more complex mathematical concepts.

Thus, whenever you encounter a number that can be neatly expressed as a fraction, you can confidently identify it as a rational number!
