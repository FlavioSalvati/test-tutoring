To calculate the surface area of a similar shape, you can utilize the square of the scale factor that relates the two shapes.

When working with similar shapes, it is crucial to recognize that their corresponding dimensions are proportional. This means that if you know the scale factor (the ratio of any two corresponding lengths) between the original shape and the similar shape, you can use this information to determine the surface area of the similar shape.

First, identify the scale factor. This can be accomplished by dividing a length of the similar shape by the corresponding length of the original shape. For instance, if one side of the original shape measures $3 \, \text{cm}$ and the corresponding side of the similar shape measures $6 \, \text{cm}$, the scale factor is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Scale Factor} = \frac{6}{3} = 2.
$$

Next, to find the surface area of the similar shape, square the scale factor. In our example, since the scale factor is $2$, squaring it yields:

$$
\text{Squared Scale Factor} = 2^2 = 4.
$$

This indicates that the surface area of the similar shape is $4$ times greater than that of the original shape.

Finally, to obtain the surface area of the similar shape, multiply the surface area of the original shape by the squared scale factor. For example, if the original shape has a surface area of $10 \, \text{cm}^2$, the surface area of the similar shape can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Surface Area of Similar Shape} = 10 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 4 = 40 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

It is important to remember that this method is effective because surface area is a two-dimensional measurement. When scaling shapes up or down, each dimension is influenced by the scale factor, which necessitates squaring it to find the corresponding change in surface area.
