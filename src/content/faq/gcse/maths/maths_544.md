To calculate the probability of drawing two face cards without replacement, we can multiply the probabilities of each individual draw.

First, let's clarify what face cards are. In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, face cards consist of Jacks, Queens, and Kings. Each of the four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) contains three face cards, resulting in a total of 12 face cards in the deck.

When drawing cards without replacement, the total number of cards decreases after each draw. For the first draw, the probability of selecting a face card is calculated as the ratio of the number of face cards to the total number of cards. Thus, the probability of drawing a face card on the first attempt is given by:

$$ P(\text{first face card}) = \frac{12}{52}. $$

If you successfully draw a face card on the first try, there will now be 11 face cards remaining and only 51 cards left in the deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing a face card on the second draw becomes:

$$ P(\text{second face card}) = \frac{11}{51}. $$

To determine the overall probability of both events occurring (drawing a face card first, followed by another face card), we multiply the probabilities of each event. Thus, the overall probability is:

$$ P(\text{two face cards}) = P(\text{first face card}) \times P(\text{second face card}) = \left(\frac{12}{52}\right) \times \left(\frac{11}{51}\right). $$

Now, we can simplify this expression:

$$ \left(\frac{12}{52}\right) \times \left(\frac{11}{51}\right) = \left(\frac{3}{13}\right) \times \left(\frac{11}{51}\right) = \frac{33}{663} = \frac{1}{20}. $$

Consequently, the probability of drawing two face cards in succession without replacement is 

$$ \frac{1}{20}, $$ 

which is equivalent to 5%.
