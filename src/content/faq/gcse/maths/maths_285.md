The y-intercept is the value of $y$ when $x$ is equal to zero. In the equation 

$$ y = 2x + 3, $$ 

the y-intercept indicates the point where the line intersects the y-axis. This intersection occurs specifically when $x$ takes the value of zero. To determine the y-intercept, we substitute $x = 0$ into the equation. This gives us:

$$ y = 2(0) + 3, $$ 

which simplifies to 

$$ y = 3. $$ 

Thus, the y-intercept is $3$.

The y-intercept is a crucial characteristic of a linear equation because it provides a starting point for graphing the line. In this case, the line crosses the y-axis at the point $(0, 3)$. This indicates that regardless of the value of $x$, the line will always intersect this point when $x$ is zero.

Additionally, understanding the y-intercept can enhance our interpretation of real-world scenarios. For example, if the equation models a relationship between time and distance, the y-intercept would represent the initial distance at the moment when time is zero. In this way, the y-intercept offers valuable insights into the initial conditions of the relationship described by the equation.

In conclusion, the y-intercept in the equation 

$$ y = 2x + 3 $$ 

is $3$. This value provides essential information about where the line crosses the y-axis, serving as an important reference point for both graphing and comprehending the linear relationship.
