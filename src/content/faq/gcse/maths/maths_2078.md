The expression $6a - 3a - 9$ can be simplified to $3a - 9$.

To simplify the expression $6a - 3a - 9$, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are those that contain the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, $6a$ and $-3a$ are like terms since both include the variable $a$.

Let's start by focusing on the terms that contain $a$. We have $6a$ and $-3a$. When we combine these terms, we subtract $-3a$ from $6a$, which results in $3a$. This is because $6 - 3$ equals $3$, and the variable $a$ remains unchanged.

Next, we consider the constant term, which is $-9$. Since there are no other constant terms to combine with it, $-9$ stays as it is.

Putting everything together, the simplified form of the expression is $3a - 9$. Mastering the process of combining like terms is a fundamental skill in algebra, as it makes expressions more manageable and easier to understand.
