The formula for the sine rule, applicable to non-right-angled triangles, is expressed as:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
$$

The sine rule, also known as the law of sines, is an essential concept in trigonometry that aids in solving problems related to non-right-angled triangles. It establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the sines of its angles. In this formula, $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the lengths of the sides opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.

To effectively utilize the sine rule, you need to know either two angles and one side (AAS or ASA) or two sides alongside a non-included angle (SSA). For instance, if you have the lengths of sides $a$ and $b$ and the measure of angle $A$, you can apply the sine rule to determine either angle $B$ or the length of side $c$.

Let's consider a practical example: Suppose you have a triangle with side lengths $a = 7$ cm, $b = 9$ cm, and angle $A = 30^\circ$. To find angle $B$, you can rearrange the sine rule to isolate $\sin B$:

$$
\frac{7}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{9}{\sin B}
$$

Since we know that $\sin 30^\circ = 0.5$, the equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{7}{0.5} = \frac{9}{\sin B}
$$

This further reduces to:

$$
14 = \frac{9}{\sin B}
$$

From here, we can express $\sin B$ as:

$$
\sin B = \frac{9}{14}
$$

To find angle $B$, we take the inverse sine:

$$
B = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{9}{14}\right)
$$

Using a calculator, you can compute the value of $B$. The sine rule proves particularly advantageous when working with oblique triangles, where conventional right-angle trigonometric methods are not applicable.
