The elapsed time from 10:15 AM to 1:45 PM is a total of 3 hours and 30 minutes.

To determine the elapsed time between two specific times, it can be helpful to break the calculation down into smaller, more manageable steps. First, letâ€™s evaluate the time from 10:15 AM to 12:00 PM. 

From 10:15 AM to 11:15 AM is exactly 1 hour. Then, from 11:15 AM to 12:00 PM is an additional 45 minutes. Thus, the total elapsed time from 10:15 AM to 12:00 PM is:

$$
1 \text{ hour} + 45 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 45 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Next, we need to calculate the time from 12:00 PM to 1:45 PM. This calculation is more straightforward, as it involves a direct count of hours and minutes. From 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM is 1 hour, and from 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM is 45 minutes. Therefore, the total time from 12:00 PM to 1:45 PM is:

$$
1 \text{ hour} + 45 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 45 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Now, we will combine the two intervals we have calculated. The first interval was 1 hour and 45 minutes, and the second interval was also 1 hour and 45 minutes. We can add these two together as follows:

1. Adding the hours:
$$
1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}.
$$

2. Adding the minutes:
$$
45 \text{ minutes} + 45 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Since 90 minutes can be converted to hours, we know that:

$$
90 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 30 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Now we can combine this with the 2 hours we already have:

$$
2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour and } 30 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours and } 30 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Thus, the total elapsed time from 10:15 AM to 1:45 PM is indeed:

$$
3 \text{ hours and } 30 \text{ minutes}.
$$
