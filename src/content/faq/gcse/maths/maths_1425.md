Translating a shape using the vector $(-3, -4)$ results in a shift of the shape 3 units to the left and 4 units downward.

When a shape is translated by a vector, every point of the shape is moved by the same specified amount. In this instance, the vector $(-3, -4)$ indicates the direction and distance of the translation. The first component of the vector, $-3$, signifies a movement of 3 units to the left, while the second component, $-4$, indicates a movement of 4 units down.

Consider a point on the shape with coordinates $(x, y)$. After translating by the vector $(-3, -4)$, the new coordinates of this point will be $(x - 3, y - 4)$. This rule applies universally to all points on the shape, ensuring that while the position changes, the size and orientation of the shape remain the same.

For instance, take a triangle with vertices located at $(2, 3)$, $(5, 3)$, and $(4, 6)$. After applying the translation vector $(-3, -4)$, the new positions of these vertices will be $(-1, -1)$, $(2, -1)$, and $(1, 2)$, respectively. This transformed set of points represents the same triangle, merely relocated to a different position on the coordinate plane.

Mastering the concept of translating shapes using vectors is a fundamental skill in geometry. It enables you to manipulate and analyze shapes effectively in various mathematical contexts.
