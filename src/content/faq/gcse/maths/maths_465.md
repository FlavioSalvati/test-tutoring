The area of the triangle is approximately $42.43$ square centimeters.

To calculate the area of a triangle when you know two sides and the included angle, you can use the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \times \sin(C) 
$$

In this equation, $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the two sides, while $C$ is the measure of the included angle.

For our specific triangle, the lengths of the sides are $10$ cm and $12$ cm, and the included angle is $45^\circ$. Substituting these values into the formula gives us:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12 \times \sin(45^\circ) 
$$

First, we need to calculate $\sin(45^\circ)$. The sine of $45^\circ$ is known to be 

$$ 
\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} 
$$ 

which is approximately $0.7071$. Now, we can substitute this value back into the area formula:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12 \times 0.7071 
$$

Next, we perform the multiplication step-by-step:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 120 \times 0.7071 
$$

Calculating further, we have:

$$ 
\text{Area} = 60 \times 0.7071 
$$

This results in:

$$ 
\text{Area} \approx 42.426 
$$

Rounding this value to two decimal places, we find that the area of the triangle is approximately $42.43$ square centimeters. 

This method is particularly advantageous in trigonometry when working with non-right-angled triangles.
