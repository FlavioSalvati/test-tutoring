The derivative of the function $ y = x^3 + 2x $ is given by:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 2.
$$

To compute the derivative of a function, we apply the rules of differentiation. Differentiation is a fundamental process in calculus that allows us to determine the rate at which a function is changing at any specific point. For the function $ y = x^3 + 2x $, we will differentiate each term individually.

Let's begin with the first term, $ x^3 $. According to the power rule of differentiation, if we have a term of the form $ x^n $, its derivative is expressed as $ nx^{n-1} $. Therefore, applying this rule to $ x^3 $, we find:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^{3-1} = 3x^2.
$$

Next, we differentiate the second term $ 2x $. The derivative of a constant multiplied by a variable is simply the constant itself. Thus, for the term $ 2x $, we obtain:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2.
$$

Now, we can combine these results to determine the derivative of the entire function. By adding the derivatives of each term, we arrive at:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 2.
$$

Consequently, the derivative of $ y = x^3 + 2x $ is $ 3x^2 + 2 $. This expression indicates how the function $ y $ changes with respect to $ x $. For instance, if you wish to find the rate of change of $ y $ at the point where $ x = 1 $, you can substitute $ x = 1 $ into the derivative to determine that rate.
