To determine the limits of accuracy for a rounded value, it is essential to identify the range within which the original number could have fallen prior to rounding.

When a number is rounded to a specific degree of accuracy—such as to the nearest whole number, tenth, or hundredth—it implies that the original number could reside within a designated range. For instance, if a number is rounded to the nearest whole number, say $5$, the original value could range from $4.5$ to $5.5$, excluding $5.5$ itself. This range is referred to as the limits of accuracy.

To ascertain these limits, consider the smallest and largest values that would round to the specified number. Specifically, when rounding to the nearest whole number, the lower limit is determined by subtracting half of the rounding unit from the rounded value, while the upper limit is found by adding half of the rounding unit to the rounded value. For example, if a number is rounded to the nearest $10$, resulting in a rounded value of $50$, the lower limit would be $45$ ($50 - 5$), and the upper limit would be $55$ ($50 + 5$).

The same principle applies when rounding to decimal places. For example, if a number is rounded to one decimal place, such as $3.4$, the original number could have been between $3.35$ and $3.45$. In this case, you subtract and add half of the smallest place value ($0.05$) to the rounded number to establish the limits of accuracy.

Understanding these limits is crucial for analyzing the precision of measurements and calculations. It ensures that you are aware of the possible range of the original values.
