The probability of flipping heads on a fair coin is $\frac{1}{2}$, which can also be expressed as $50\%$.

To grasp why this is true, letâ€™s first define what a fair coin is. A fair coin is one that exhibits no bias, meaning it has an equal likelihood of landing on heads or tails. When you flip a fair coin, there are only two possible outcomes: heads or tails. Since these are the only outcomes and they are equally likely, the probability of each outcome is identical.

Probability quantifies how likely an event is to occur and is determined by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. For a fair coin flip, there is one favorable outcome for heads and one for tails, resulting in a total of two possible outcomes. Thus, the probability of flipping heads can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\text{Probability of heads} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes for heads}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{1}{2} 
$$

The fraction $\frac{1}{2}$ can also be represented as $0.5$ or $50\%$, indicating an equal chance of landing on heads or tails. This principle is fundamental in the study of probability and serves as a building block for understanding more complex scenarios involving multiple outcomes. It is essential to remember that a fair coin has no preference for either heads or tails, thus making each flip an independent event with an equal probability of resulting in either outcome.
