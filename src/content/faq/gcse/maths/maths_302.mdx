The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the line described by the equation $y = 4x - 3$ is $-\frac{1}{4}$.

To determine the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to another line, it is essential to understand the relationship between their gradients. The gradient, which indicates the steepness of a line, is represented by the coefficient of $x$ in the linear equation of the form $y = mx + c$, where $m$ denotes the gradient. For the line given by the equation $y = 4x - 3$, the gradient $m$ is equal to $4$.

When two lines are perpendicular, the product of their gradients is always $-1$. This means that if you multiply the gradient of one line by the gradient of its perpendicular counterpart, the result will be $-1$. In mathematical terms, if $m_1$ represents the gradient of the first line and $m_2$ represents the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to it, then the relationship can be expressed as:

$$
m_1 \times m_2 = -1
$$

Given that the gradient $m_1$ of the line $y = 4x - 3$ is $4$, we can find the gradient $m_2$ of the perpendicular line by solving the equation:

$$
4 \times m_2 = -1
$$

To isolate $m_2$, we divide both sides of the equation by $4$:

$$
m_2 = -\frac{1}{4}
$$

Thus, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to $y = 4x - 3$ is $-\frac{1}{4}$. This negative reciprocal relationship guarantees that the two lines intersect at a right angle, confirming their perpendicularity.
