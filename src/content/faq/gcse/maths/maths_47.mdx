In order to subtract one decimal number from another, it's important to align the decimal points and then proceed with subtraction just like you would with whole numbers.

Subtracting decimal numbers involves a few crucial steps. Firstly, arrange the numbers in a vertical format, ensuring the decimal points are perfectly aligned. This alignment plays a pivotal role as it ensures that each digit is correctly placed in its respective place value column (units, tenths, hundredths, and so on). If the decimal numbers have different lengths, you can append zeroes at the end of the shorter number to make it equal in length to the longer number, which assists in avoiding any confusion.

For instance, let's consider subtracting $3.75$ from $8.4$. You would arrange it as:

```
$8.40$
$- 3.75$
```

Proceed to subtract each column, initiating from the rightmost digit (just as you would do with whole numbers). If a digit in the top number is smaller than the corresponding digit in the bottom number, you will need to borrow from the next column to the left. In our example:

```
$8.40$
$- 3.75$
```

Starting from the rightmost column (hundredths), $0$ is less than $5$, so you borrow $1$ from the tenths column, making it $10 - 5 = 5$. Now, the tenths column is $3$ (since you borrowed $1$), and $3 - 7$ necessitates borrowing again from the units column. This makes it $13 - 7 = 6$. Lastly, subtract the units column: $7 - 3 = 4$. Hence, the result is:

```
$4.65$
```

By adhering to these steps, you can accurately subtract any two decimal numbers.
