To determine the midpoint between the points $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$, we can use the midpoint formula, which is given by:

$$
\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right).
$$

The midpoint formula provides a method for finding the precise center point between two coordinates on a Cartesian plane. In this scenario, the points we are considering are $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$. The formula calculates the midpoint by averaging the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates of the points individually.

Letâ€™s start by calculating the $x$-coordinates. We have the two $x$-values: $2$ and $4$. Adding these together gives us:

$$
2 + 4 = 6.
$$

Next, we divide the sum by $2$ to find the average:

$$
\frac{6}{2} = 3.
$$

This result gives us the $x$-coordinate of the midpoint.

Now, we will repeat the process for the $y$-coordinates. The $y$-values are $3$ and $7$. Adding these yields:

$$
3 + 7 = 10.
$$

Dividing this sum by $2$ to find the average gives us:

$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5.
$$

This value represents the $y$-coordinate of the midpoint.

Therefore, the midpoint between the points $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$ is $(3, 5)$. This point is precisely halfway between the two original points on the graph, thereby serving as the midpoint.
