The change you receive after purchasing an item that costs £15 with a £20 note is £5.

To determine the amount of change, you need to subtract the cost of the item from the total amount of money you initially have. In this scenario, you begin with £20, and the item costs £15. Therefore, you perform the subtraction: 

$$
20 - 15 = 5
$$

This calculation reveals that you will receive £5 as change.

Understanding how to calculate change is an essential life skill, especially when handling money. This process involves basic arithmetic, specifically subtraction. When you make a purchase, you provide the cashier with a certain amount of money. If this amount exceeds the price of the item, the cashier returns the difference to you as change.

For instance, if you visit a store and buy a book priced at £15 and pay with a £20 note, the cashier will return £5 to you. This is because you have given more money than the book costs, and the difference between the amount you paid and the book's price is your change.

Practicing these calculations can enhance your confidence in managing money, ensuring you consistently receive the correct change. It also helps when reviewing receipts to verify that you have not been overcharged. So, the next time you make a purchase, try to calculate the change in your head before the cashier does—it’s an excellent way to keep your math skills sharp!
