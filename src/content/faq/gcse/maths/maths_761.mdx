To determine the value of $x$ in the proportion $\frac{5}{9} = \frac{10}{x}$, we can use a technique known as cross-multiplication.

When working with a proportion like $\frac{5}{9} = \frac{10}{x}$, cross-multiplication involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction. Specifically, you will multiply $5$ by $x$ and $9$ by $10$. This results in the equation:

$$
5x = 90.
$$

Next, we need to solve for $x$. To isolate $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by $5$:

$$
x = \frac{90}{5}.
$$

Performing the division yields:

$$
x = 18.
$$

Thus, the value of $x$ that satisfies the proportion is $18$.

Cross-multiplication is an effective technique for solving proportions because it simplifies the process. This method works under the principle that if two fractions are equal, their cross-products must also be equal. It is particularly useful in GCSE Maths, allowing you to quickly and accurately find missing values in proportional relationships.
