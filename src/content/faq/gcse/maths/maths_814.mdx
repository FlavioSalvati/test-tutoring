To solve an exponential decay problem, you can utilize the formula given by 

$$ N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt} $$

Exponential decay describes the process by which a quantity decreases over time at a rate that is proportional to its current value. This formula, $ N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt} $, allows us to determine the remaining amount $ N(t) $ after a specific time $ t $. In this expression, $ N_0 $ represents the initial quantity, $ k $ is the decay constant, and $ e $ is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to $ 2.718 $.

To begin, identify the initial quantity $ N_0 $ and the decay constant $ k $. The decay constant $ k $ is typically provided in the problem statement or can be derived from the available data. If you know the half-life of the substance (the time required for the quantity to reduce to half its initial value), you can calculate $ k $ using the formula 

$$ k = \frac{\ln(2)}{\text{half-life}} $$

Next, substitute the known values into the exponential decay formula. For example, suppose you start with $ 100 $ grams of a substance that has a decay constant of $ 0.03 $ per year, and you want to find out how much remains after $ 5 $ years. In this case, you would set $ N_0 = 100 $, $ k = 0.03 $, and $ t = 5 $. Plugging these values into the formula gives:

$$ N(5) = 100 e^{-0.03 \times 5} $$

Finally, perform the calculation using a calculator. For our example, we find:

$$ N(5) = 100 e^{-0.15} \approx 100 \times 0.8607 \approx 86.07 $$ 

Thus, after $ 5 $ years, approximately $ 86.07 $ grams of the substance will remain.
