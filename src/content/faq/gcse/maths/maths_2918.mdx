The formula for calculating relative frequency is given by:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Frequency of a Specific Event}}{\text{Total Number of Events}}.
$$

Relative frequency serves as a measure of how often a specific event occurs in relation to the total number of events. It is a valuable concept in statistics and probability, allowing us to gauge the likelihood of various outcomes. To compute relative frequency, simply divide the number of times a specific event occurs by the total number of events observed.

For instance, consider the scenario of rolling a six-sided die. If you roll the die $60$ times and the number $3$ appears $10$ times, the relative frequency of rolling a $3$ can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency of 3} = \frac{10}{60} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167.
$$

This outcome indicates that, based on your experiment, the number $3$ appears approximately $16.7\%$ of the time.

Relative frequency can be represented in different formats: as a fraction, a decimal, or a percentage. This versatility makes it an effective tool for estimating probabilities, particularly when analyzing large datasets. By examining relative frequencies, one can make informed predictions about future events based on historical data. This application is especially beneficial in fields such as science, business, and everyday decision-making.

It is important to note that the accuracy of your relative frequency improves with the quantity of data collected. For example, if you only roll the die a few times, the results may not be very reliable. However, if you roll it hundreds or even thousands of times, the relative frequency will provide a much clearer picture of the true probability of each outcome.
