To determine an equivalent ratio, you can multiply or divide both terms of the ratio by the same non-zero number.

Ratios serve as a means to compare two quantities. For instance, a ratio of $2:3$ indicates that for every $2$ units of the first quantity, there are $3$ units of the second quantity. To derive an equivalent ratio, you must multiply or divide both components of the ratio by the same non-zero number, thereby preserving the relationship between the two quantities.

Consider the ratio $2:3$. If you multiply both terms by $2$, you obtain the ratio $4:6$. This is indeed an equivalent ratio, as the relationship between the two quantities remains unchanged. Alternatively, if you divide both terms by $2$, you arrive at the ratio $1:1.5$, which is also equivalent.

Letâ€™s examine another example: the ratio $5:10$. If you divide both terms by $5$, you get $1:2$. Conversely, if you multiply both terms by $3$, you obtain $15:30$. Both $1:2$ and $15:30$ are equivalent to the original ratio $5:10$.

It is crucial to remember that you must use the same number for multiplication or division on both terms. If you apply different numbers to each term, the resulting ratio will not be equivalent. This concept is applicable in various areas of mathematics, including proportions, scaling, and probability. Mastering the technique of finding equivalent ratios can significantly aid in solving a wide range of mathematical problems with greater ease.
