To calculate the perimeter of a compound shape, you need to sum the lengths of all its outer edges.

A compound shape is composed of two or more simple geometric figures. To find the perimeter, start by carefully analyzing the shape and breaking it down into its individual components, which may include rectangles, triangles, circles, or other shapes.

Begin by measuring or recording the lengths of all the sides that form the outer boundary of the compound shape. It is essential to avoid including any internal sides that do not contribute to the perimeter. For instance, if the compound shape consists of two rectangles that share a common side, do not count that shared side more than once.

If any side lengths are unknown, utilize the properties of the shapes involved to determine them. For example, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, if you know one side's length, you can easily find the length of the opposite side. In the case of right-angled triangles, you can apply the Pythagorean theorem to calculate any missing side lengths.

After gathering all the necessary measurements, add them together to obtain the total perimeter. It is a good practice to double-check your calculations to ensure that you have included all the outer edges and that your total is accurate. By following this method, you can confidently determine the perimeter of any compound shape, no matter how complex it may be.
