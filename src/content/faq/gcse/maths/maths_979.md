The gradient of the linear equation $ y = -3x + 6 $ is $-3$.

To determine the gradient of a linear equation expressed in the form $ y = mx + c $, one must identify the coefficient of $ x $, which is denoted by $ m $. In the case of our equation $ y = -3x + 6 $, the term $-3x$ signifies the slope or gradient of the line. The gradient $ m $ indicates both the steepness of the line and its direction: a positive gradient indicates an upward slope, while a negative gradient indicates a downward slope.

In this equation, the coefficient of $ x $ is $-3$. This implies that for each unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ decreases by $ 3 $ units. Therefore, the gradient is $-3$, which indicates that the line slopes downward from left to right.

Understanding the gradient is essential, as it allows you to visualize the steepness and direction of the line on a graph. If you were to graph this equation, you would begin at the y-intercept, which is $ 6 $ (the constant term), and then move down $ 3 $ units for every $ 1 $ unit you move to the right. This consistent rate of change is what characterizes the gradient of the line.
