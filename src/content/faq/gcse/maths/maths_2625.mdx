To convert $0.035$ kilometres to metres, you need to multiply by $1,000$, which results in $35$ metres.

When converting from kilometres to metres, it's essential to remember that $1$ kilometre is equivalent to $1,000$ metres. The prefix 'kilo-' in the metric system signifies a factor of $1,000$. Thus, to convert any measurement in kilometres to metres, you simply multiply the number of kilometres by $1,000$.

In our example, we have $0.035$ kilometres. To perform the conversion to metres, we multiply $0.035$ by $1,000$:

$$
0.035 \, \text{km} \times 1,000 = 35 \, \text{m}
$$

Therefore, $0.035$ kilometres is equal to $35$ metres. This conversion method applies universally when switching between kilometres and metres. Just keep in mind this fundamental relationship: $1$ kilometre is equal to $1,000$ metres. This understanding makes it straightforward to convert in either directionâ€”by multiplying or dividing by $1,000$, depending on whether you are converting to or from kilometres.
