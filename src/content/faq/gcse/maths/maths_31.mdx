To simplify fractions, we must divide the numerator and the denominator by their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).

The process of simplifying fractions is essential as it makes them more manageable and easier to comprehend. The initial step is to determine the GCD of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is the number on the top while the denominator is the number at the bottom of a fraction. The GCD is defined as the largest number that can evenly divide both the numerator and the denominator without leaving any remainder.

For instance, consider the fraction $\frac{18}{24}$. The first thing to do is to list down the factors of both numbers. The factors of 18 include 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. For 24, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Among these, the largest factor common to both is 6, hence the GCD of 18 and 24 is 6.

The next step involves dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD. In the case of $\frac{18}{24}$, we divide both 18 and 24 by 6:

$$ \frac{18 \div 6}{24 \div 6} = \frac{3}{4} $$

Therefore, the fraction $\frac{18}{24}$ simplifies to $\frac{3}{4}$.

If finding the GCD poses a challenge, one can resort to the Euclidean algorithm, which entails repeated division. Alternatively, prime factorisation can also be helpful: decompose both numbers into their prime factors and then multiply the common factors.

Remember, a fraction is deemed fully simplified when the numerator and the denominator have no common factors aside from 1. Mastering the art of simplifying fractions is a valuable skill, especially for solving problems in algebra, geometry, and even in everyday life.
