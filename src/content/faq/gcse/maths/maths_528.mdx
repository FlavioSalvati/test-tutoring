Relative frequency is determined by dividing the frequency of a specific event by the total number of trials conducted.

In essence, relative frequency provides insight into how often an event occurs relative to the overall number of trials or observations. To calculate the relative frequency, you first need to count the number of times the event of interest occurs; this count is referred to as the frequency. Next, you must identify the total number of trials or observations in your experiment.

The formula for calculating relative frequency is:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Frequency of the Event}}{\text{Total Number of Trials}} 
$$

For instance, consider the scenario of rolling a die and wanting to find the relative frequency of rolling a 4. If you roll a 4 a total of 15 times out of 100 rolls, you would compute the relative frequency as follows:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{15}{100} = 0.15 
$$

This result indicates that the relative frequency of rolling a 4 is $0.15$, which corresponds to $15\%$. 

Understanding relative frequency is valuable because it provides a proportion that can be compared across various experiments or situations, regardless of the total number of trials. This concept is instrumental in making predictions and assessing the likelihood of events in practical, real-world contexts.
