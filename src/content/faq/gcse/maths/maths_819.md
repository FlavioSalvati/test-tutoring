The formula for continuous exponential decay is given by 

$$ 
N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt} 
$$ 

In this equation, $N(t)$ represents the quantity remaining at time $t$, while $N_0$ denotes the initial quantity. The symbol $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to $2.71828$. The parameter $k$ is known as the decay constant, and $t$ indicates the time elapsed. This formula effectively models scenarios where a quantity decreases continuously at a rate proportional to its current value, such as in the cases of radioactive decay or the cooling of an object.

To gain a clearer understanding, let's break down the components of the formula. The initial quantity, $N_0$, is the starting amount before any decay has taken place. The decay constant, $k$, plays a crucial role in determining the rate of decrease; a higher value of $k$ signifies a faster rate of decay. The expression $e^{-kt}$ illustrates how the quantity diminishes over time. As time $t$ increases, $e^{-kt}$ decreases, leading to a smaller value of $N(t)$.

For instance, consider a substance that starts with an initial amount of 100 grams and has a decay constant of $0.1$ per hour. To calculate the remaining amount after $5$ hours, we can apply the formula as follows:

$$ 
N(5) = 100 e^{-0.1 \times 5} 
$$ 

By simplifying this, we obtain:

$$ 
N(5) = 100 e^{-0.5} \approx 100 \times 0.6065 = 60.65 
$$ 

Thus, after $5$ hours, approximately $60.65$ grams of the substance would remain.

This formula is particularly powerful as it allows for predictions regarding how much of a substance will remain after any specified duration, provided that the initial amount and the decay constant are known.
