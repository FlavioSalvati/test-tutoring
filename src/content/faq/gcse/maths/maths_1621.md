A high interquartile range (IQR) signifies a substantial level of variability or spread within a data set.

The interquartile range is a statistical measure that quantifies how dispersed the values in a data set are. It is determined by subtracting the first quartile ($Q_1$) from the third quartile ($Q_3$). The first quartile, $Q_1$, represents the median of the lower half of the data, while the third quartile, $Q_3$, is the median of the upper half. Essentially, the IQR delineates the range that encompasses the middle 50% of the data.

When the IQR is high, it indicates that the middle 50% of the data points are distributed over a larger range of values. This suggests a considerable degree of variability within the central portion of the data set. In other words, the data points are not tightly clustered but are more widely spread apart.

For instance, consider a scenario where you are analyzing the test scores of a class. If you observe a high IQR, it indicates that the scores of the middle-performing students vary significantly. This could imply that while some students are achieving moderately well, others in the same performance range are either scoring much lower or much higher, reflecting inconsistency in performance.

Understanding the IQR is crucial as it provides insights into the data's spread without being influenced by extreme values or outliers. Unlike the overall range, which considers only the highest and lowest values, the IQR concentrates on the central portion of the data, offering a more robust measure of variability.
