The surd form of $\sqrt{75}$ is expressed as $5\sqrt{3}$.

To understand how $\sqrt{75}$ can be simplified to $5\sqrt{3}$, we first need to factor the number $75$ into its prime components. The number $75$ can be factored into $3$ and $25$, where $25$ is a perfect square (since $25 = 5 \times 5$). Therefore, we can express $75$ as:

$$
75 = 3 \times 25.
$$

When we take the square root of $75$, we can utilize the property of square roots that states $\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}$. Applying this property, we find:

$$
\sqrt{75} = \sqrt{3 \times 25} = \sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{25}.
$$

Since $\sqrt{25}$ simplifies to $5$, we can rewrite our expression as:

$$
\sqrt{75} = \sqrt{3} \times 5 = 5\sqrt{3}.
$$

Thus, the simplified surd form of $\sqrt{75}$ is $5\sqrt{3}$. 

Surds are particularly useful in mathematics because they allow us to represent irrational numbers in a more manageable way. By expressing square roots in their simplest form, we can more easily perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with other surds.
