To identify a prime number using factorization, it is essential to verify that it has only two distinct factors: $1$ and the number itself.

A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than $1$ that cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller natural numbers. To determine if a number is prime, you must check whether it can be evenly divided by any natural number other than $1$ and itself. This process is referred to as factorization.

Begin by testing the smallest prime numbers—$2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and so on—to see if they divide the number without leaving a remainder. For instance, to ascertain whether $29$ is a prime number, you would check if it can be divided evenly by $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$. Since none of these divisions yield a whole number, we conclude that $29$ is indeed a prime number.

In contrast, if a number can be evenly divided by any natural number other than $1$ and itself, it is classified as a composite number and not prime. For example, the number $28$ can be divided by $2$, $4$, $7$, and $14$, indicating that it is not a prime number.

A helpful guideline is to test divisors only up to the square root of the number in question. For instance, to check if $37$ is prime, you only need to test divisors up to approximately $6$ (since $\sqrt{37} \approx 6.08$). If none of these smaller numbers divide $37$ evenly, then $37$ is confirmed to be a prime number.

By following these systematic steps, you can effectively determine whether a number is prime through factorization.
