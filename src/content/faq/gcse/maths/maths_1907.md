The ratio of $9$ to $3$ can be expressed as $3:1$.

To gain a clearer understanding of this concept, let's break it down further. A ratio serves as a means to compare two quantities, illustrating how many times one value contains or is contained within the other. In this instance, we are comparing the number $9$ with the number $3$. To determine the ratio, we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). For $9$ and $3$, the GCD is $3$.

When we divide $9$ by $3$, we obtain $3$. Likewise, when we divide $3$ by $3$, the result is $1$. Consequently, the ratio of $9$ to $3$ simplifies to $3:1$. This indicates that for every $3$ units of the first quantity, there is $1$ unit of the second quantity.

Ratios are commonly used in various real-world scenarios, such as cooking recipes, mixing paints, or comparing speeds. Mastering how to simplify and interpret ratios is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it facilitates the efficient and accurate resolution of problems. Always remember to identify the GCD in order to simplify ratios to their most basic form.
