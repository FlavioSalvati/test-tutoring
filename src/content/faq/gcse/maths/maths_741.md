The number $123.456$ rounded to the nearest whole number is $123$.

When rounding a number to the nearest whole number, it is essential to consider the digit in the tenths place, which is the first digit to the right of the decimal point. In the case of $123.456$, the tenths place is occupied by the digit $4$. According to standard rounding rules, if this digit is $5$ or greater, you round up the whole number. Conversely, if it is $4$ or lower, you round down.

Since the digit in the tenths place is $4$, we round down. This means that the whole number part of $123.456$ remains unchanged. Therefore, $123.456$ rounded to the nearest whole number is $123$.

Rounding is a valuable skill in mathematics, as it simplifies numbers, making them easier to handle, particularly in mental arithmetic or when an approximate value suffices. Remember, the crucial step is to identify the digit in the tenths place and determine whether to round up or down based on its value.
