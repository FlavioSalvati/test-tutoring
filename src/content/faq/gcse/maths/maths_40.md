When arranging a collection of decimal numbers, the process involves comparing each digit from left to right, beginning with the integer component. 

To order decimal numbers accurately, the initial step is to examine the integer part of each number. The decimal with the smallest integer component is considered the smallest overall. If the integer parts are identical, shift your attention to the digits immediately following the decimal point and compare these in sequence from left to right.

Let's consider an example where we need to order the decimal numbers $3.45$, $3.5$, and $3.405$. Begin by comparing the integer components, which in this case are all $3$, necessitating a move to the digits following the decimal point. The first digits to compare after the decimal point are $4$, $5$, and $4$. Given that $3.405$ has a $0$ at the second decimal place, it is smaller than $3.45$, making $3.405$ the smallest. The next step is to compare $3.45$ and $3.5$. Since $4$ is less than $5$, $3.45$ is smaller than $3.5$. Hence, the ordered sequence is $3.405$, $3.45$, and $3.5$.

If the decimal numbers you're comparing have different lengths, you have the option to append zeros to the end of the shorter decimals until they match in length. For example, to compare $0.6$ and $0.56$, you can consider $0.6$ as $0.60$. Now, comparing $0.60$ and $0.56$, since $60$ is greater than $56$, $0.6$ is larger than $0.56$.

By adhering to these steps, you can successfully order any set of decimal numbers from the smallest to the largest.
