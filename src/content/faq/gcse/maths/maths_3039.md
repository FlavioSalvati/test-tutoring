To construct a box plot using quartiles, you will need to plot five key statistics on a number line: the minimum, the first quartile ($Q_1$), the median ($Q_2$), the third quartile ($Q_3$), and the maximum.

A box plot, also referred to as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation that illustrates the distribution of a dataset. It is based on five critical values that divide the data into four equal parts: the minimum, the first quartile ($Q_1$), the median ($Q_2$), the third quartile ($Q_3$), and the maximum. 

Begin by drawing a number line that encompasses the full range of your data. Mark the minimum value on this line. Next, identify and mark $Q_1$, which represents the median of the lower half of your dataset. Following that, mark the median ($Q_2$), which is the middle value of the entire dataset. After marking $Q_2$, proceed to mark $Q_3$, the median of the upper half of the dataset. Finally, mark the maximum value.

Once these points are plotted, draw a box that extends from $Q_1$ to $Q_3$. This box illustrates the interquartile range (IQR), which captures the middle 50% of your data. Inside the box, draw a line to indicate the median ($Q_2$); this line signifies the central tendency of your dataset. Next, extend "whiskers" from the edges of the box (at $Q_1$ and $Q_3$) to the minimum and maximum values, respectively. These whiskers depict the spread of the remaining data points.

By following these steps, you can effectively create a box plot that visually summarizes your dataset, facilitating a clearer understanding of both its spread and central tendency.
