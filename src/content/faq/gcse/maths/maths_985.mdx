The slope of the line that connects the points $(3, 2)$ and $(7, 6)$ is equal to 1.

To determine the slope of a line defined by two points, we utilize the formula:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points, we can assign the following values: $(x_1, y_1) = (3, 2)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (7, 6)$.

By substituting these values into the slope formula, we can calculate:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{6 - 2}{7 - 3} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
$$

Thus, the slope of the line is indeed 1. This indicates that for each unit increase in the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate also increases by 1 unit. In graphical terms, this means that the line ascends at a 45-degree angle, reflecting a consistent and linear relationship between the x and y values.

Mastering the calculation of slope is essential in GCSE Maths, as it aids in analyzing the steepness and direction of a line on a graph.
