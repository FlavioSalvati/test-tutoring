To determine the volume of a compound solid that consists of a sphere and a cone, we calculate the individual volumes of each shape and then sum them.

The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:

$$
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
$$

where $r$ represents the radius of the sphere. For a cone, the volume is calculated using the formula:

$$
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
$$

In this formula, $r$ is the radius of the cone's base, and $h$ is the height of the cone.

Letâ€™s illustrate this with an example. Consider a sphere with a radius of $3 \, \text{cm}$ and a cone that has the same radius of $3 \, \text{cm}$ and a height of $5 \, \text{cm}$. 

First, we will compute the volume of the sphere:

$$ 
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 = 36 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 
$$

Next, we calculate the volume of the cone:

$$ 
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 (5) = \frac{1}{3} \pi \times 9 \times 5 = 15 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 
$$

Now, we can find the total volume of the compound solid by adding the two volumes together:

$$ 
V_{\text{total}} = 36 \pi + 15 \pi = 51 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 
$$

Thus, the total volume of the compound solid is 

$$ 
51 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 
$$

It is important to consistently use the same units for all measurements and to retain $\pi$ in your final answer unless instructed to use a specific numerical approximation for $\pi$.
