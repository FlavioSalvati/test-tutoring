To simplify the ratio $24:36$, we begin by determining the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The GCD is defined as the largest number that can divide both values without leaving a remainder. 

For the numbers $24$ and $36$, we can identify their factors:
- The factors of $24$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24$.
- The factors of $36$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36$.

From this list, we can see that the largest common factor is $12$. 

Next, we simplify the ratio by dividing both numbers by their GCD. Specifically, we perform the following calculations:
- Dividing $24$ by $12$ yields $2$.
- Dividing $36$ by $12$ yields $3$.

Thus, the simplified ratio of $24:36$ is $2:3$.

Simplifying ratios is akin to simplifying fractions. This process not only makes comparisons more straightforward but also enhances our understanding of the relationship between the quantities involved. In this instance, for every $2$ parts of the first quantity, there are $3$ parts of the second quantity. This method can be applied to any ratio, allowing us to express it in a simpler and more manageable form.
