To convert $2.5$ hours into minutes, we start with the understanding that there are $60$ minutes in one hour. This is a fundamental unit conversion that is frequently applied in everyday scenarios as well as in various mathematical contexts. 

To determine how many minutes are in $2.5$ hours, we use the following calculation:

$$
2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}
$$

We can break this down further by considering $2.5$ hours as the sum of $2$ hours and $0.5$ hours. Let's convert each part step-by-step.

First, we convert the $2$ hours:

$$
2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
$$

Next, we convert the $0.5$ hours:

$$
0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

Now, we can combine the results from both conversions:

$$
120 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes}
$$

Thus, we confirm that $2.5$ hours equals $150$ minutes. 

This step-by-step approach can be particularly beneficial when dealing with more complex time conversions or when you simply want to verify your calculations. Mastering these basic conversions is crucial for solving a variety of problems in GCSE Maths, whether they pertain to time management, scheduling, or even certain physics applications.
