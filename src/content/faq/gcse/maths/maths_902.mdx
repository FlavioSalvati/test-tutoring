A steep slope on a distance-time graph signifies a high speed or velocity.

In a distance-time graph, the slope (or gradient) represents the speed of an object. A steep slope indicates that the distance covered in a specific time interval is substantial, which corresponds to a high speed. Conversely, a gentle slope reflects a slower speed, as it shows that the distance covered in the same time period is smaller.

To clarify this concept further, let's analyze it in detail. The gradient of a line on a distance-time graph is determined by dividing the change in distance (represented on the vertical axis) by the change in time (depicted on the horizontal axis). This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$ \text{Gradient} = \frac{\text{Change in Distance}}{\text{Change in Time}} $$

When the gradient is steep, the numerator (change in distance) is considerably larger than the denominator (change in time), indicating that the object is moving rapidly. For instance, if a car travels $100$ metres in $10$ seconds, the gradient is calculated as follows:

$$ \text{Gradient} = \frac{100 \text{ metres}}{10 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ metres per second} $$

This steep gradient illustrates that the car is moving quickly. In contrast, if the car only covers $20$ metres in the same $10$ seconds, the gradient becomes:

$$ \text{Gradient} = \frac{20 \text{ metres}}{10 \text{ seconds}} = 2 \text{ metres per second} $$

This gentler slope indicates a reduced speed.

In conclusion, the steeper the slope on a distance-time graph, the faster the object is moving. This principle is essential for analyzing motion in physics and provides a foundational understanding of how speed can vary over time.
