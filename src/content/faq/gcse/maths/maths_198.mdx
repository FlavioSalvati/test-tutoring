The next term in the sequence $2, 4, 6, 8$ is $10$.

This sequence is an example of an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant amount. In this case, the common difference is $2$. To determine the next term, you simply add the common difference to the last term in the sequence: $8 + 2 = 10$.

Arithmetic sequences are a fundamental concept in GCSE Maths. They follow a straightforward rule: each term is derived from the previous term by adding a fixed number, known as the common difference. For the sequence $2, 4, 6, 8$, the common difference is $2$. This means that to find any term in the sequence, you can start with the first term and continually add $2$.

Understanding arithmetic sequences is crucial as it aids in various areas of mathematics, including algebra and problem-solving. For instance, if you know the first term and the common difference, you can find any term in the sequence using the formula:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

where $a_n$ represents the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. In our sequence, $a_1 = 2$ and $d = 2$. Therefore, to find the 5th term, we can calculate:

$$
a_5 = 2 + (5-1) \times 2 = 2 + 8 = 10.
$$

By mastering arithmetic sequences, you will be better equipped to tackle more complex mathematical problems with confidence.
