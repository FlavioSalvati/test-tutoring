The gradient of the function $ y = \sin(x) $ at the point $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $ is $ 0 $.

To understand this better, we first need to recall that the gradient of a function at a specific point is determined by the value of its derivative at that point. For the sine function, the derivative is given by 

$$
y' = \cos(x).
$$

This indicates that the gradient of $ y = \sin(x) $ at any point $ x $ is equal to the cosine of $ x $.

Next, we need to evaluate $ \cos(x) $ at $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $. The cosine function, $ \cos(x) $, represents the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle corresponding to the angle $ x $. At $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $, which corresponds to $ 90^\circ $, the point on the unit circle is $ (0, 1) $. Hence, we have 

$$
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0.
$$

Since the gradient of $ y = \sin(x) $ at $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $ is calculated as $ \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) $, it follows that the gradient is $ 0 $. This implies that at $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $, the sine curve features a horizontal tangent line, indicating that the slope of the curve at this point is flat. This concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of trigonometric functions and their derivatives.
