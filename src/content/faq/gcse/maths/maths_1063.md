To construct a perpendicular line from a given point to an existing line, you can utilize a compass and straightedge. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for clarity:

1. **Position the Point and Line**: Begin by placing the point $ P $ either above or below the line $ L $. 

2. **Draw an Arc**: Adjust the compass to a width greater than half the distance from point $ P $ to line $ L $. Position the compass point on $ P $ and draw an arc that intersects line $ L $ at two distinct points. Denote these points of intersection as $ A $ and $ B $.

3. **Create Intersecting Arcs**: Without altering the compass width, move the compass point to point $ A $ and draw an arc either above or below line $ L $. Next, place the compass point on point $ B $ and draw another arc that intersects the arc created from point $ A $. Label the intersection of these arcs as point $ C $.

4. **Draw the Perpendicular Line**: Finally, use a straightedge to connect point $ P $ to point $ C $. The line you create is perpendicular to line $ L $ and passes through point $ P $. This ensures that the angle formed is exactly $ 90^\circ $, fulfilling the definition of perpendicularity.

This construction leverages the properties of circles, particularly that the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of the circle. By employing a compass and straightedge, you can achieve precise geometric constructions without the need to measure angles directly. This technique is fundamental in geometry and serves as a valuable tool in various mathematical problems and proofs.
