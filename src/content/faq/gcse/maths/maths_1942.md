To determine your heart rate, simply count the number of heartbeats within one minute.

To measure your heart rate accurately, you can use either a stopwatch or a clock with a second hand. Start by locating your pulse. The most common sites for checking your pulse are the wrist (known as the radial pulse) and the neck (known as the carotid pulse). 

To find your radial pulse, place two fingers (not your thumb) on the inside of your wrist, just below the base of your thumb. For the carotid pulse, position two fingers on your neck, to the side of your windpipe.

Once you have located your pulse, count the number of beats you feel over a span of 15 seconds. Use a stopwatch or a clock to ensure accurate timing. To convert this count into beats per minute (bpm), multiply the number of beats you counted by 4. For instance, if you counted 20 beats in 15 seconds, your heart rate would be calculated as:

$$
20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ bpm}
$$

Alternatively, for a more straightforward measurement, you can count the number of beats for a full 60 seconds. This method provides an accurate reading without the need for multiplication; simply count the beats over the entire minute.

It's important to note that your heart rate can fluctuate based on various factors such as activity level, stress, and overall health. For most adults, a resting heart rate—measured when you are calm and relaxed—typically falls between 60 and 100 bpm. Regularly monitoring your heart rate can provide valuable insights into your cardiovascular health.
