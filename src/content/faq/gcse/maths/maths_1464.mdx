The formula for calculating the magnitude of a vector involves taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

To clarify this concept, letâ€™s break it down. A vector is defined as a quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction. In a two-dimensional space, a vector can be represented as $\mathbf{v} = (x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ correspond to its components along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The magnitude of this vector, denoted as $|\mathbf{v}|$, represents the length of the vector extending from the origin to the point $(x, y)$.

This magnitude is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. If we visualize a right triangle where the vector serves as the hypotenuse, the legs of the triangle will be the components $x$ and $y$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse (which represents the magnitude of the vector) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

In the case of a three-dimensional vector $\mathbf{v} = (x, y, z)$, the same principle applies, but we now also include the $z$-component. The formula for the magnitude extends to:

$$
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$

This concept can be generalized to any number of dimensions. For a vector $\mathbf{v} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ in $n$-dimensional space, the magnitude is given by:

$$
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}
$$

Understanding how to compute the magnitude of a vector is essential in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it plays a crucial role in determining distances and analyzing the properties of vectors.
