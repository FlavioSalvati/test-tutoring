To calculate the standard deviation of a data set, you begin by finding the square root of the variance.

1. **Calculate the Mean**: Start by determining the mean (average) of your data set. To do this, sum all the data points and then divide by the total number of data points, denoted as $n$. The mean can be expressed mathematically as:

   $$
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
   $$

   where $x_i$ represents each individual data point.

2. **Find Deviations**: Next, for each data point, subtract the mean from the data point to find the deviation from the mean. This step helps you understand how much each value differs from the average.

3. **Square the Deviations**: To eliminate any negative values, square each of these deviations. This ensures that all squared deviations are positive:

   $$
   \text{Squared Deviation} = (x_i - \text{Mean})^2
   $$

4. **Sum the Squared Deviations**: Add all the squared deviations together to obtain the total squared deviation:

   $$
   \text{Total Squared Deviation} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \text{Mean})^2
   $$

5. **Calculate the Variance**: For a sample data set, divide the total squared deviation by $n - 1$ (where $n$ is the number of data points) to compute the sample variance. If you are working with a population data set, divide by $n$ instead. The variances can be expressed as:

   - Sample Variance:

   $$
   s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \text{Mean})^2}{n - 1}
   $$

   - Population Variance:

   $$
   \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \text{Mean})^2}{n}
   $$

   The variance provides insight into how spread out the data points are around the mean.

6. **Calculate the Standard Deviation**: Finally, take the square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation. This measure indicates, on average, how much each data point differs from the mean. The formulas for standard deviation are:

   - Sample Standard Deviation:

   $$
   s = \sqrt{s^2}
   $$

   - Population Standard Deviation:

   $$
   \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
   $$

A smaller standard deviation suggests that the data points are closely clustered around the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that the data points are more widely dispersed.
