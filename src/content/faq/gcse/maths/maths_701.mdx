The expression $ 3^4 \times 3^2 $ simplifies to $ 3^6 $, which equals $ 729 $.

To grasp why this is true, we need to refer to the rules governing indices (or exponents). When multiplying two numbers that share the same base, we add their exponents. In this scenario, both terms have the base of $ 3 $. The first term, $ 3^4 $, represents $ 3 $ multiplied by itself $ 4 $ times: 

$$ 
3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 
$$ 

The second term, $ 3^2 $, indicates $ 3 $ multiplied by itself $ 2 $ times:

$$ 
3^2 = 3 \times 3 
$$ 

According to the rule of indices, when we multiply these two expressions together, we simply add the exponents: 

$$ 
4 + 2 
$$ 

Thus, $ 3^4 \times 3^2 $ can be rewritten as $ 3^{4+2} $, which simplifies to $ 3^6 $.

Next, let's compute $ 3^6 $. This expression means $ 3 $ multiplied by itself $ 6 $ times:

$$ 
3^6 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 
$$ 

We can evaluate this step by step:

- First, $ 3 \times 3 = 9 $
- Next, $ 9 \times 3 = 27 $
- Then, $ 27 \times 3 = 81 $
- After that, $ 81 \times 3 = 243 $
- Finally, $ 243 \times 3 = 729 $

Thus, we find that $ 3^6 $ equals $ 729 $. This example illustrates how a solid understanding of the rules of indices can simplify seemingly complex multiplication tasks.
