To determine the probability of drawing two aces consecutively without replacement, we can multiply the probabilities of each individual draw.

When drawing cards without replacement, the total number of cards in the deck decreases with each draw. A standard deck contains $52$ cards, which includes $4$ aces.

First, we calculate the probability of drawing an ace on the first attempt. Since there are $4$ aces in a deck of $52$ cards, the probability is given by:

$$
P(\text{first ace}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}.
$$

Next, if you successfully draw an ace, there will be $51$ cards remaining in the deck, along with $3$ aces still available. The probability of drawing a second ace at this point is:

$$
P(\text{second ace} \mid \text{first ace}) = \frac{3}{51} = \frac{1}{17}.
$$

To find the overall probability of both events occurring—drawing an ace first and then drawing a second ace—we multiply the probabilities of the two individual events:

$$
P(\text{two aces}) = P(\text{first ace}) \times P(\text{second ace} \mid \text{first ace}) = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51}.
$$

Carrying out this multiplication, we have:

$$
P(\text{two aces}) = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{1}{13} \times \frac{1}{17} = \frac{1}{221}.
$$

Therefore, the probability of drawing two aces in succession without replacement is 

$$ 
\frac{1}{221}. 
$$
