The general solutions for the equation $\cos(x) = 0.5$ can be expressed as:

$$
x = 60^\circ + 360^\circ n \quad \text{or} \quad x = 300^\circ + 360^\circ n
$$

where $n$ is any integer.

To grasp this concept, it's essential to remember that the cosine function is periodic with a period of $360^\circ$. This means that the values of cosine repeat every $360^\circ$. When we solve the equation $\cos(x) = 0.5$, we are seeking all angles $x$ that satisfy this condition.

First, we identify the principal solutions within one complete cycle, which spans from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$. We know that $\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5$, so one solution is $x = 60^\circ$. Additionally, cosine is positive in the fourth quadrant, where the corresponding angle is calculated as $360^\circ - 60^\circ = 300^\circ$. Thus, the two principal solutions are $x = 60^\circ$ and $x = 300^\circ$.

Since the cosine function repeats every $360^\circ$, we can add any integer multiple of $360^\circ$ to these principal solutions to uncover all possible solutions. Hence, the general solutions are:

$$
x = 60^\circ + 360^\circ n \quad \text{and} \quad x = 300^\circ + 360^\circ n
$$

where $n$ can be any integer (positive, negative, or zero).

In radian measure, the general solutions can be expressed as:

$$
x = \frac{\pi}{3} + 2\pi n \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5\pi}{3} + 2\pi n
$$

where again, $n$ is any integer. This conversion is based on the fact that $60^\circ$ is equivalent to $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians and $300^\circ$ corresponds to $\frac{5\pi}{3}$ radians.

Understanding these solutions is crucial for solving trigonometric equations and analyzing periodic functions, which are vital skills in GCSE Mathematics.
