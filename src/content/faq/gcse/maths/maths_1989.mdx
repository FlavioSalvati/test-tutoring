To convert minutes into hours and minutes, it's essential to remember that there are $60$ minutes in one hour. This knowledge allows you to easily transform any number of minutes into the corresponding hours and remaining minutes.

When you want to convert a given number of minutes into hours, you can use the following method: divide the total number of minutes by $60$. The quotient will tell you how many full hours are contained within that time, while the remainder will represent the leftover minutes.

For instance, let's consider $90$ minutes. By dividing $90$ by $60$, we find:

$$
90 \div 60 = 1 \quad \text{(with a remainder of } 30\text{)}
$$

Here, the quotient $1$ indicates that there is 1 full hour, and the remainder $30$ signifies that there are 30 leftover minutes. Therefore, we conclude that $90$ minutes is equivalent to $1$ hour and $30$ minutes.

This method can be universally applied to any quantity of minutes. For example, if you have $150$ minutes, you would perform the same division:

$$
150 \div 60 = 2 \quad \text{(with a remainder of } 30\text{)}
$$

In this case, the quotient $2$ indicates that there are $2$ full hours, and the remainder $30$ tells us there are still $30$ minutes left over. Consequently, $150$ minutes can be expressed as $2$ hours and $30$ minutes.

This straightforward technique of division and finding the remainder not only simplifies the conversion process but also proves to be a valuable skill when tackling time-related problems, particularly in GCSE Maths.
