To make $y$ the subject of the formula $z = 5y + 7$, we can rearrange the equation to express $y$ as follows:

$$y = \frac{z - 7}{5}.$$

Letâ€™s walk through the steps to achieve this transformation clearly.

First, we start with the original equation:

$$z = 5y + 7.$$

Our goal is to isolate the term that contains $y$. To do this, we need to eliminate the constant $7$ from the right side of the equation. We can achieve this by subtracting $7$ from both sides:

$$z - 7 = 5y.$$

Now, we have $5y$ isolated on one side of the equation, with $z - 7$ on the other side. The next step is to isolate $y$ itself. Since $y$ is currently being multiplied by $5$, we will perform the opposite operation, which is division. We divide both sides of the equation by $5$:

$$\frac{z - 7}{5} = y.$$

To present it in a more conventional form, we can rearrange it to:

$$y = \frac{z - 7}{5}.$$

And there you have it! By following these systematic steps, we have successfully rearranged the formula to make $y$ the subject. This process involves fundamental algebraic operations: subtraction and division. 

Keep in mind that the key to solving such equations is to perform the same operation on both sides to maintain balance. This technique can be applied to rearranging various types of equations. With practice, you will become proficient in these skills!
