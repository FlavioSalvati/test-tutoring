The graph of the equation $ y = -x^3 $ represents a cubic curve that is reflected across the x-axis.

To elaborate, the equation $ y = -x^3 $ defines a cubic function characterized by a negative coefficient for the $ x^3 $ term. This negative coefficient causes the graph to be a mirror image of the graph of $ y = x^3 $ across the x-axis. Typically, the graph of a cubic function exhibits an S-shaped curve; however, for $ y = -x^3 $, the graph starts in the top left quadrant, passes through the origin, and extends into the bottom right quadrant.

At the point where $ x = 0 $, the corresponding value of $ y $ is also $ 0 $, indicating that the graph intersects the origin at the coordinate $ (0, 0) $. As $ x $ increases, $ y $ decreases, resulting in more negative values. Conversely, as $ x $ decreases, $ y $ takes on more positive values. This behavior establishes a downward slope from left to right.

Moreover, the graph is symmetric regarding the origin, meaning that if it is rotated 180 degrees around the origin, it remains unchanged. This property is indicative of odd functions, of which $ y = -x^3 $ is a prime example. Additionally, the steepness of the curve intensifies as you move away from the origin, reflecting the inherent cubic nature of this function.

Gaining an understanding of the graph of $ y = -x^3 $ enhances one's ability to visualize how modifications to the equation influence the shape and direction of the curve, a crucial skill in GCSE Mathematics.
