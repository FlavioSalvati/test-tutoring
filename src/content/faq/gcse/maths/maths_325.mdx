To bisect a $90^\circ$ angle, you can use a compass and straightedge to create two equal $45^\circ$ angles.

Begin by constructing the $90^\circ$ angle. You can do this by either using a protractor or by creating a perpendicular line from a chosen point on a straight line. Label the vertex of the angle as point $A$, and designate the points where the angle's arms meet the lines as points $B$ and $C$.

Next, position the compass point at vertex $A$ and draw an arc that intersects both arms of the angle. Label the points where this arc intersects the arms as points $D$ and $E$.

Without altering the compass width, place the compass point on point $D$ and draw an arc within the angle. Repeat this step by placing the compass point on point $E$, ensuring that the two arcs intersect. Label the intersection point of these arcs as point $F$.

Finally, use a straightedge to draw a line from point $A$ through point $F$. This line bisects the $90^\circ$ angle, resulting in two equal $45^\circ$ angles.
