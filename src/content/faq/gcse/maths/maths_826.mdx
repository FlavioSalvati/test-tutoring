To add $ \sqrt{2} $ and $ \sqrt{8} $, we begin by simplifying $ \sqrt{8} $ to $ 2\sqrt{2} $. Then, we can proceed to add them, resulting in $ 3\sqrt{2} $.

When working with surds, it is essential to simplify them first. A surd refers to an irrational number that cannot be simplified to eliminate the square root. In our case, we have $ \sqrt{2} $ and $ \sqrt{8} $. The first step is to simplify $ \sqrt{8} $.

To simplify $ \sqrt{8} $, we find its prime factors. The number $ 8 $ can be expressed as $ 4 \times 2 $, where $ 4 $ is a perfect square, specifically $ 2^2 $. Thus, we can rewrite $ \sqrt{8} $ as follows:

$$
\sqrt{8} = \sqrt{4 \times 2} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}.
$$

Now, we have the expressions $ \sqrt{2} $ and $ 2\sqrt{2} $. These are like terms because they both contain the surd $ \sqrt{2} $. To add them, we simply combine their coefficients—the numbers in front of the surd. The coefficient of $ \sqrt{2} $ is $ 1 $ (since $ 1\sqrt{2} $ is equivalent to $ \sqrt{2} $), and the coefficient of $ 2\sqrt{2} $ is $ 2 $. 

Adding these coefficients together gives us:

$$
1 + 2 = 3.
$$

Therefore, we conclude that:

$$
\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2} = 3\sqrt{2}.
$$

This expression, $ 3\sqrt{2} $, represents the simplified form of the sum of $ \sqrt{2} $ and $ \sqrt{8} $.
