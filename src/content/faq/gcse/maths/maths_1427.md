The image of a rectangle after a $90^\circ$ clockwise rotation about the origin remains a rectangle.

When you rotate a rectangle $90^\circ$ clockwise around the origin, each vertex of the rectangle shifts to a new position. To illustrate this, let's denote the coordinates of the original rectangle's vertices as $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, and $(x_4, y_4)$. Following a $90^\circ$ clockwise rotation, the updated coordinates of these vertices will be $(y_1, -x_1)$, $(y_2, -x_2)$, $(y_3, -x_3)$, and $(y_4, -x_4)$.

This transformation effectively swaps the $x$ and $y$ coordinates and inverts the sign of the new $x$ coordinate. Consequently, while the shape of the rectangle remains unchanged, its orientation is altered. Specifically, the sides that were initially parallel to the $x$-axis will now align parallel to the $y$-axis, and vice versa.

For instance, consider a rectangle with vertices located at $(2, 3)$, $(5, 3)$, $(5, 6)$, and $(2, 6)$. After performing a $90^\circ$ clockwise rotation, the new vertices will be at $(3, -2)$, $(3, -5)$, $(6, -5)$, and $(6, -2)$. It is evident that the shape remains a rectangle, but its orientation and position have changed.

Grasping this concept is essential for tackling problems involving rotations in coordinate geometry. It enhances your ability to visualize how shapes move and alter their orientation, which is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths.
