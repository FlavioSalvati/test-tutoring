To derive the equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by the equation $ y = 3x + 2 $, we need to maintain the same gradient (or slope), which in this case is $ 3 $.

A fundamental property of parallel lines is that they share the same gradient. In the equation $ y = 3x + 2 $, the gradient is represented by the coefficient of $ x $, which is $ 3 $. Consequently, any line that is parallel to this one will also have a gradient of $ 3 $.

To express the equation of a parallel line, we can use the slope-intercept form given by $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the gradient and $ c $ represents the y-intercept. Since we want the gradient $ m $ to be $ 3 $ for parallelism, the equation will take the form:

$$
y = 3x + c
$$

Here, $ c $ can be any real number.

For instance, if we want to find a specific parallel line that passes through the point $ (1, 4) $, we can substitute this point into the equation to solve for $ c $. Using the coordinates $ (1, 4) $:

$$
4 = 3(1) + c
$$

Simplifying the equation:

$$
4 = 3 + c
$$

By isolating $ c $, we find:

$$
c = 1
$$

Thus, the equation of the line parallel to $ y = 3x + 2 $ that passes through the point $ (1, 4) $ is:

$$
y = 3x + 1
$$

In summary, to determine the equation of a line parallel to $ y = 3x + 2 $, maintain the same gradient of $ 3 $ and adjust the y-intercept $ c $ as necessary based on any specific points through which the line must pass.
