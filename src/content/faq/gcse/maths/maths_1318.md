The exact value of $\sin 45^\circ$ is 

$$
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

To understand why $\sin 45^\circ$ equals $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we can examine a right-angled isosceles triangle. In such a triangle, the two non-right angles each measure $45^\circ$. If we assume that the lengths of the two equal sides are both $1$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse $c$ can be calculated as follows:

$$
c = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}.
$$

In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For the $45^\circ$ angle in our isosceles triangle, the length of the opposite side is $1$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, we have:

$$
\sin 45^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
$$

To simplify $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{2}$. This results in:

$$
\frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

Thus, we confirm that the exact value of $\sin 45^\circ$ is 

$$
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
$$

This value is significant in trigonometry and frequently appears in various mathematical problems and proofs. Remembering that $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ can greatly assist in solving many trigonometric equations and in understanding the properties of special angles.
