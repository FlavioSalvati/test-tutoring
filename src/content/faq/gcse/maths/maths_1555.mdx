The probability of event $A$ given event $B$, denoted as $P(A|B)$, cannot be determined with the information currently available.

To compute the conditional probability $P(A|B)$, we use the following formula:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

In this formula, $P(A \cap B)$ represents the probability that both events $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously. However, the information provided only specifies the individual probabilities: $P(A) = 0.6$ and $P(B) = 0.4$. These values indicate the likelihood of events $A$ and $B$ occurring independently.

Without the value of $P(A \cap B)$, we are unable to calculate $P(A|B)$ directly. For instance, if we were given that $P(A \cap B) = 0.2$, we could substitute this into the formula to obtain:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.4} = 0.5
$$

However, since we do not have the joint probability $P(A \cap B)$, we cannot proceed with the calculation.

In conclusion, although we have the individual probabilities of events $A$ and $B$, we lack the essential information regarding their joint probability. This joint probability is critical for determining the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$.
