The mathematical expression $5^{-1}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{5}$ or $0.2$.

A negative exponent implies taking the reciprocal of the base number. Here, our base number is $5$, and the exponent is $-1$. The reciprocal of $5$ is $\frac{1}{5}$. Thus, $5^{-1}$ is identical to $\frac{1}{5}$.

Let's dissect this further for improved comprehension. Generally, with a positive exponent, one multiplies the base number by itself for as many times as the exponent specifies. For instance, $5^2$ indicates $5 * 5$, resulting in $25$. However, a negative exponent prompts the contrary action: divide $1$ by the base number raised to the absolute value of the exponent. Hence, $5^{-1}$ signifies $\frac{1}{5^1}$, which is $\frac{1}{5}$.

In terms of decimals, $\frac{1}{5}$ equals $0.2$. This is because dividing $1$ by $5$ yields $0.2$. Therefore, $5^{-1}$ can alternatively be expressed as $0.2$.

Comprehending negative exponents is crucial due to their frequent occurrence in diverse mathematical contexts, including scientific notation and algebra. Always bear in mind, a negative exponent instructs you to take the reciprocal of the base number raised to the equivalent positive exponent.
