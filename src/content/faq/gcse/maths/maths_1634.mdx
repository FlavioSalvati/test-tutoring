To create a frequency polygon, you will first need to plot the midpoints of each class interval and connect these points with straight lines.

### Step 1: Create a Frequency Table
Begin by constructing a frequency table from your data. This table should include the class intervals along with their corresponding frequencies. For instance, if you have data on the heights of students, your class intervals might range from $140-149$ cm, $150-159$ cm, and so on, with the frequencies indicating the number of students within each interval.

### Step 2: Calculate Midpoints
Next, calculate the midpoint of each class interval. The midpoint is found by adding the lower and upper boundaries of the interval and then dividing by two. For example, for the interval $140-149$ cm, the midpoint can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Midpoint} = \frac{140 + 149}{2} = 144.5 \text{ cm}.
$$

### Step 3: Plot the Points
After determining the midpoints, plot these values on a graph. The midpoints will be represented on the x-axis while the frequencies will be plotted on the y-axis. For each class interval, place a point at the corresponding midpoint and its frequency. For instance, if the frequency for the $140-149$ cm interval is $5$, you would plot a point at $(144.5, 5)$.

### Step 4: Connect the Points
Once all points are plotted, connect them with straight lines. Start from the first midpoint and draw a line to the next, continuing this process until all points are linked. To finalize the frequency polygon, extend the lines to the x-axis at both the beginning and the end of your data range, ensuring that the shape is closed.

### Conclusion
This visual representation allows for an easier analysis of the distribution and trends present within your data set. It provides a clear overview of how frequencies vary across different intervals, making it a valuable tool for data interpretation.
