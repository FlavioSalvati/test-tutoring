The product of $7$ and $8$ is $56$.

To understand why $7$ multiplied by $8$ equals $56$, let's break it down. Multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. When you multiply $7$ by $8$, you are essentially adding the number $7$ to itself a total of $8$ times. Thus, the expression can be represented as:

$$
7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 56.
$$

Another way to visualize this concept is by using a multiplication table. This table is a grid that allows you to easily find the product of two numbers. By locating the row for $7$ and the column for $8$, you will find their intersection at $56$.

You can also apply the distributive property to gain further insight into this multiplication. For instance, you can decompose $8$ into $5$ and $3$, then multiply $7$ by each of these components separately and sum the results:

$$
7 \times 8 = 7 \times (5 + 3) = (7 \times 5) + (7 \times 3) = 35 + 21 = 56.
$$

A solid understanding of multiplication is essential, as it serves as the foundation for more advanced mathematical concepts. Practicing different methods of multiplication will reinforce your comprehension and help you solve problems more efficiently and accurately.
