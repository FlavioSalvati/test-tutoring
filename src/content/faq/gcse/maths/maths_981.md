The slope of the linear equation $ y = 4x - 3 $ is 4.

To find the slope of the equation $ y = 4x - 3 $, we need to identify the coefficient of $ x $. In the general form of a linear equation, $ y = mx + c $, the variable $ m $ denotes the slope, while $ c $ signifies the y-intercept. In this case, the equation is already expressed in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m = 4 $ and $ c = -3 $. Therefore, the slope $ m $ is equal to 4.

The slope of a line represents both its steepness and its direction. A positive slope, such as 4, indicates that the line ascends as it moves from left to right. Specifically, for every 1 unit that you move to the right along the x-axis, the corresponding y-value increases by 4 units. This concept is essential for understanding how linear equations graphically illustrate relationships between variables.

In conclusion, by identifying the coefficient of $ x $ in the equation $ y = 4x - 3 $, we can easily ascertain that the slope is 4. This information reveals how the y-value changes concerning the x-value, which is fundamental for graphing and interpreting linear relationships.
