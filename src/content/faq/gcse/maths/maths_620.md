To calculate the total frequency represented in a histogram, you simply need to sum the frequencies of all the individual bars.

In a histogram, each bar corresponds to a specific range of values, known as a class interval, and its height indicates the frequency of data points that fall within that range. To determine the total frequency, add together the frequencies of all the bars.

For example, consider a histogram with five bars whose frequencies are $3$, $7$, $5$, $6$, and $4$. You would calculate the total frequency by performing the following addition:

$$
3 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 25
$$

Thus, the total frequency is $25$.

When interpreting a histogram, pay close attention to the vertical axis, which typically represents frequency. The height of each bar reflects the number of data points within its respective class interval. In some cases, the frequencies may be displayed directly above or within the bars, simplifying the process of summation.

If the histogram presents relative frequencies (expressed as percentages) instead of absolute frequencies, you can still calculate the total frequency by converting the percentages back into actual counts, provided you know the overall number of data points. For instance, if a bar indicates $20\%$ of the data and you have a total of $50$ data points, you can find the corresponding count for that bar by calculating:

$$
0.20 \times 50 = 10
$$

In summary, the total frequency is simply the sum of all individual frequencies, representing the complete number of data points depicted in the histogram.
