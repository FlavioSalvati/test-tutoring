The equation of a line perpendicular to $ y = 3x + 5 $ through $ (1, 2) $ is $ y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{3} $.

To find the equation of a line perpendicular to $ y = 3x + 5 $, we first need to determine the gradient (slope) of the given line. The gradient of $ y = 3x + 5 $ is 3. For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their gradients must be -1. Therefore, the gradient of the perpendicular line will be the negative reciprocal of 3, which is $ -\frac{1}{3} $.

Next, we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is $ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) $, where $ m $ is the gradient and $ (x_1, y_1) $ is a point on the line. Substituting $ m = -\frac{1}{3} $ and the point $ (1, 2) $, we get:
$$ y - 2 = -\frac{1}{3}(x - 1) $$

Now, we simplify this equation:
$$ y - 2 = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} $$
$$ y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} + 2 $$
$$ y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{6}{3} $$
$$ y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{3} $$

Thus, the equation of the line perpendicular to $ y = 3x + 5 $ and passing through the point $ (1, 2) $ is $ y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{3} $.
