To calculate the length of the space diagonal in a cube, you can use the formula:

$$
d = \sqrt{3} \times \text{side length}
$$

To elaborate, a cube contains three types of diagonals: face diagonals, which lie flat on the cube's surfaces, and space diagonals, which traverse through the interior of the cube. The space diagonal connects two opposite vertices, extending through the center of the cube. To determine the length of this diagonal, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.

Consider a cube with a side length of $a$. The length of a face diagonal, which lies on one of the cube's faces, can be calculated using the two-dimensional Pythagorean theorem. The formula for the length of a face diagonal is:

$$
\text{Face diagonal} = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{2a^2} = a\sqrt{2}.
$$

Next, to find the length of the space diagonal $d$, we apply the Pythagorean theorem again, this time in three dimensions. The space diagonal forms a right triangle with the face diagonal and one side of the cube. Therefore, the length of the space diagonal can be expressed as:

$$
d = \sqrt{(a\sqrt{2})^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{2a^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{3a^2} = a\sqrt{3}.
$$

In conclusion, the length of the space diagonal in a cube is $ \sqrt{3} $ times the side length of the cube. This formula is convenient and can be readily applied as soon as you know the side length of the cube.
