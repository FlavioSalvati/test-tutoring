The distance between the points $(-3, -4)$ and $(0, 0)$ is $5$ units.

To determine the distance between two points on a coordinate plane, we utilize the distance formula, which is based on Pythagoras' theorem. The distance formula is expressed as:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

For our specific case, the points are $(-3, -4)$ and $(0, 0)$. We define the coordinates as follows: $ x_1 = -3 $, $ y_1 = -4 $, $ x_2 = 0 $, and $ y_2 = 0 $. Substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (0 - (-4))^2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(0 + 3)^2 + (0 + 4)^2}
$$

Continuing with the simplification, we find:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}
$$
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{9 + 16}
$$
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{25}
$$
$$
\text{Distance} = 5
$$

Thus, the distance between the points $(-3, -4)$ and $(0, 0)$ is indeed $5$ units. This distance formula can be applied to find the distance between any two points on a coordinate plane. Simply substitute the respective coordinates into the formula and simplify the expression step by step.
