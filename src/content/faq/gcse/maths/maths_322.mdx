To construct a $120^\circ$ angle, you can utilize a compass and straightedge to create an equilateral triangle.

Begin by drawing a straight line segment; this will serve as one side of the equilateral triangle. Label the endpoints of this segment as points $A$ and $B$. Next, place the point of the compass on point $A$ and draw an arc above the line segment. Without altering the compass width, move the compass to point $B$ and draw another arc that intersects the first arc. Label the intersection point of the arcs as point $C$.

Now, use the straightedge to draw line segments $AC$ and $BC$. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, which implies that each internal angle measures $60^\circ$. To create a $120^\circ$ angle, extend one of the sides of the triangle. For instance, extend the line segment $AB$ beyond point $B$. The angle formed between the extended line and the line segment $BC$ will measure $120^\circ$ because it represents the external angle of the equilateral triangle.

This method guarantees precision and employs fundamental geometric tools, making it particularly suitable for GCSE Maths students.
