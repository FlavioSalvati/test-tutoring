The formula for calculating the joint probability of two events $A$ and $B$ using conditional probability is given by:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B|A).
$$

This formula allows us to determine the likelihood of both events $A$ and $B$ occurring simultaneously. Let's break it down for better understanding. Here, $P(A)$ represents the probability that event $A$ occurs, while $P(B|A)$ is the conditional probability that event $B$ occurs given that event $A$ has already taken place. By multiplying these two probabilities, we obtain the probability that both events $A$ and $B$ happen together.

To illustrate this concept, imagine you have a standard deck of playing cards. Let event $A$ be the act of drawing a red card, and let event $B$ be the act of drawing a heart. If you know that you have drawn a red card (event $A$), the probability of drawing a heart (event $B$) is affected, as hearts are a subset of red cards. This is where the concept of conditional probability becomes relevant.

To calculate the probability of drawing a red card that is also a heart, you first determine the probability of drawing a red card, $P(A)$, which is $\frac{26}{52}$, or $\frac{1}{2}$. Next, given that you have drawn a red card, you find the probability of it being a heart, $P(B|A)$, which is $\frac{13}{26}$, or $\frac{1}{2}$. Multiplying these two probabilities together yields:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
$$

This formula is extremely useful in various real-life scenarios where the occurrence of one event influences the probability of another. A solid understanding of this concept can significantly enhance your ability to analyze complex problems effectively.
