To determine the expected frequency of rolling a 2 on a fair six-sided die during 180 rolls, you can simply multiply the number of rolls by the probability of rolling a 2.

When rolling a fair six-sided die, each of the faces—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6—has an equal chance of landing face up. The probability of rolling a 2 is given by:

$$
P(2) = \frac{1}{6}
$$

This probability arises because there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 2) among six possible outcomes.

To calculate the expected frequency of rolling a 2, you multiply the total number of rolls by the probability of the desired outcome. In this scenario, you wish to find out how many times you can expect to roll a 2 in 180 rolls. The formula for expected frequency can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Expected frequency} = \text{Total number of rolls} \times \text{Probability of rolling a 2}
$$

Substituting the values into the equation:

$$
\text{Expected frequency} = 180 \times \frac{1}{6}
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
\text{Expected frequency} = 30
$$

Thus, you can expect to roll a 2 approximately 30 times in 180 rolls of a fair die.

This approach utilizes the concept of expected value, a fundamental principle in probability theory. Expected value allows you to predict the average outcome over a large number of trials. Although you may not roll exactly 30 twos in every set of 180 rolls, this figure represents the average expected outcome if you were to repeat the experiment multiple times.
