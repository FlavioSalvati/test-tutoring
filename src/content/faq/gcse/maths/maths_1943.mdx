When you burn a total of 240 calories over a span of 30 minutes, this equates to a rate of $8$ calories per minute.

To determine the rate of calorie burn, you simply divide the total number of calories by the total time in minutes. In this case, you have burned $240$ calories during a $30$-minute period. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

$$
\frac{240 \text{ calories}}{30 \text{ minutes}} = 8 \text{ calories per minute}
$$

This indicates that for each minute of activity, you are expending $8$ calories.

Understanding rates is a fundamental aspect of GCSE Maths, as it enables you to analyze how quantities evolve over time. In this scenario, the rate provides insight into the speed at which calories are being burned. If you were to sustain this activity for a longer duration, you could use this rate to estimate the total calories burned. For example, if you continued for $60$ minutes, the calculation would be:

$$
8 \text{ calories per minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ calories}
$$

This principle is applicable to a variety of real-life contexts, such as calculating speed (distance per time), flow rates (volume per time), and other situations where it's essential to understand how one quantity changes in relation to another. By mastering the calculation of rates, you can make more informed decisions and predictions based on the data available to you.
