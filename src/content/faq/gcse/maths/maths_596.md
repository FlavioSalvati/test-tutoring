To effectively label the axes on a line graph, follow these steps: identify the variables, select appropriate scales, and add descriptive labels.

The first step in creating a line graph is to determine the variables you will be plotting. Typically, the independent variable, which you control or manipulate, is placed along the horizontal axis (the x-axis). The dependent variable, which you measure, is positioned on the vertical axis (the y-axis). For instance, if you are plotting time against temperature, time should be represented on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis.

Next, choose suitable scales for each axis. The scale should encompass the full range of your data and be divided into equal intervals. For example, if your temperature data spans from $0$ to $100$ degrees Celsius, you might select intervals of $10$ degrees. It is important to ensure that the scale is easy to read and appropriately reflects the data you are presenting.

After you have determined the scales, add clear and descriptive labels to each axis. These labels should explicitly indicate what each axis represents, including the units of measurement. For example, you might label the x-axis as "Time (minutes)" and the y-axis as "Temperature (Â°C)". This clarity helps readers understand the significance of the data points on the graph.

Finally, ensure that your labels are neatly written and aligned parallel to the axes. This attention to detail makes your graph more readable and interpretable. By following these guidelines, you can effectively label the axes of a line graph, enhancing the clarity and comprehensibility of your data presentation.
