To determine the range of a data set, you subtract the smallest value from the largest value.

The range serves as a measure of the dispersion or spread of values within a data set. To calculate it, you first need to identify the smallest value (also known as the minimum) and the largest value (also known as the maximum) in your data set. For instance, consider the data set consisting of the numbers $3, 7, 8, 2,$ and $10$. Here, the smallest value is $2$, and the largest value is $10$.

Next, you perform the subtraction of the smallest value from the largest value. Continuing with our example, you would compute:

$$
10 - 2 = 8.
$$

Thus, the range of this data set is $8$.

The range provides a quick insight into the variability of your data. However, it does not convey any information about how the values are distributed between the minimum and maximum. For example, a data set comprising the values $1, 1, 1, 1,$ and $10$ has the same range as another data set with values $1, 3, 5, 7,$ and $10$, even though the distributions of values are significantly different.

It is important to remember that the range is just one method for analyzing data. While it is helpful for gaining a basic understanding of the spread of values, for a more comprehensive analysis, you may also want to consider other statistical measures such as the mean, median, and mode.
