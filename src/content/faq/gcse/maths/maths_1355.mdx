To sketch the graph of $ y = -\cos(x) $, you can start by plotting the cosine graph and then reflecting it across the x-axis.

First, let's recall the basic shape of the cosine function, $ y = \cos(x) $. The graph begins at the point $ (0, 1) $, reaches $ \left(\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right) $, dips down to $ (\pi, -1) $, rises back to $ \left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, 0\right) $, and finally returns to $ (2\pi, 1) $. This pattern repeats every $ 2\pi $ units.

Now, for the function $ y = -\cos(x) $, we reflect the graph of $ y = \cos(x) $ across the x-axis. This reflection means that every point on the $ y = \cos(x) $ graph will have its $ y $-coordinate multiplied by -1. For instance, the point $ (0, 1) $ on the $ y = \cos(x) $ graph transforms to $ (0, -1) $ on the $ y = -\cos(x) $ graph.

Begin by plotting the following key points for $ y = -\cos(x) $: 
- $ (0, -1) $ 
- $ \left(\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right) $ 
- $ (\pi, 1) $ 
- $ \left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, 0\right) $ 
- $ (2\pi, -1) $

Once you have these points, connect them with a smooth, continuous wave. The resulting graph will dip down to -1 and rise back up to 1, creating a mirror image of the cosine wave.

It's important to note that the graph of $ y = -\cos(x) $ retains the same period of $ 2\pi $ and the same amplitude of 1, but it is inverted. This inversion means that the peaks of the $ y = \cos(x) $ graph become the troughs of the $ y = -\cos(x) $ graph, and vice versa. By following these steps, you can accurately sketch the graph of $ y = -\cos(x) $.
