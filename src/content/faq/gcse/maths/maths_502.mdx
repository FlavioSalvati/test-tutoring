The vector notation for the movement from the point $(2, 3)$ to the point $(5, 7)$ is given by 

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
$$

To determine the vector from one point to another, you subtract the coordinates of the starting point from the coordinates of the ending point. In this scenario, the starting point is $(2, 3)$ and the ending point is $(5, 7)$.

First, calculate the change in the x-coordinates: 

$$
5 - 2 = 3.
$$

This result gives you the x-component of the vector. Next, find the change in the y-coordinates: 

$$
7 - 3 = 4.
$$

This result provides the y-component of the vector.

Thus, the vector from $(2, 3)$ to $(5, 7)$ is expressed as 

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
$$

This notation signifies that to move from the point $(2, 3)$ to the point $(5, 7)$, you must move $3$ units to the right (along the x-axis) and $4$ units up (along the y-axis).

Vectors are commonly represented in column form to clearly illustrate the direction and magnitude of movement. In this representation, the top number indicates the horizontal change, while the bottom number denotes the vertical change. This method of notation is particularly beneficial in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it aids in visualizing and calculating movements and forces.
