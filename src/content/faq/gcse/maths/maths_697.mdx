To find the sum of the fractions $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$, we first need to determine a common denominator. The denominators in this case are $4$ and $3$. The least common multiple (LCM) of $4$ and $3$ is $12$. Therefore, we will convert both fractions to have a denominator of $12$.

Starting with $\frac{3}{4}$, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $3$:

$$
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{9}{12}.
$$

Next, for $\frac{2}{3}$, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $4$:

$$
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{8}{12}.
$$

Now that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add them together:

$$
\frac{9}{12} + \frac{8}{12} = \frac{17}{12}.
$$

Since $\frac{17}{12}$ is an improper fraction (the numerator is greater than the denominator), we can also express it as a mixed number. To convert it, we divide $17$ by $12$, which yields $1$ with a remainder of $5$. Thus, we can represent $\frac{17}{12}$ as:

$$
1 \frac{5}{12}.
$$

In conclusion, the sum of $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$ is $\frac{17}{12}$, which can also be expressed as the mixed number $1 \frac{5}{12}$.
