Temperature data can be categorized into two main types: qualitative and quantitative, with further distinctions between continuous and discrete data.

Typically, temperature data is classified as quantitative because it consists of numerical values that indicate the degree of heat or cold. Quantitative data can be measured and expressed in numerical form, making it amenable to mathematical analysis. For instance, temperature values such as $20^\circ C$, $25^\circ C$, and $30^\circ C$ are numerical representations that can be used in various calculations.

Within the realm of quantitative data, temperature is specifically considered continuous. Continuous data can assume any value within a specified range, including decimals and fractions. For example, temperatures can be recorded as $22.5^\circ C$ or $23.7^\circ C$, not limited to whole numbers. This contrasts with discrete data, which can only take on specific, separate values, such as the count of students in a classroom.

Temperature data can also be categorized based on the scale of measurement. The most commonly used scales are Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Each of these scales has its own method for measuring temperature, yet they all yield continuous data. For example, water freezes at $0^\circ C$, $32^\circ F$, and $273.15 \, K$, but these values can be further subdivided into smaller units, such as $0.1^\circ C$ or $0.01^\circ F$.

In summary, temperature data is both quantitative and continuous, allowing for thorough and precise analysis. This classification is essential for understanding how to manage and interpret temperature measurements in various scientific and mathematical contexts.
