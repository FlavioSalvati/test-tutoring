The period of the function $ y = -\tan(x) $ is $ \pi $ radians.

In trigonometry, the period of a function refers to the length of the interval over which the function's values repeat. For the tangent function $ \tan(x) $, the period is $ \pi $ radians. This indicates that the function's values will repeat every $ \pi $ radians. When we analyze the function $ y = -\tan(x) $, the negative sign in front of the tangent function reflects the graph across the x-axis; however, it does not alter the period. Thus, the period remains $ \pi $ radians.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, consider the graph of $ y = \tan(x) $. The tangent function has vertical asymptotes located at $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi $, where $ k $ is an integer. The function exhibits a repeating pattern every $ \pi $ radians. When we reflect the graph to obtain $ y = -\tan(x) $, the shape of the graph remains unchanged, but it is inverted. The locations of the asymptotes and the repeating interval do not vary, which means the period is still $ \pi $ radians.

In conclusion, the period of $ y = -\tan(x) $ is $ \pi $ radians, just as it is for $ y = \tan(x) $. This characteristic is a fundamental property of the tangent function and its transformations.
