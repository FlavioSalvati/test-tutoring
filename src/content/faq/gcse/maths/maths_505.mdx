To express vector $\mathbf{d}$ in component form, we write it as $\mathbf{d} = (d_x, d_y)$ in two-dimensional (2D) space or $\mathbf{d} = (d_x, d_y, d_z)$ in three-dimensional (3D) space.

Vectors are mathematical entities characterized by both magnitude and direction. The component form of a vector breaks it down into its individual components along the coordinate axes. In 2D space, we utilize the x-axis and y-axis, so the component form of vector $\mathbf{d}$ is represented as $\mathbf{d} = (d_x, d_y)$, where $d_x$ denotes the component along the x-axis, and $d_y$ denotes the component along the y-axis.

When we extend our consideration to 3D space, we also include the z-axis. In this scenario, the component form of vector $\mathbf{d}$ is expressed as $\mathbf{d} = (d_x, d_y, d_z)$, where $d_z$ represents the component along the z-axis. These components can be viewed as the "steps" taken along each axis to reach the point represented by the vector, starting from the origin.

For instance, if vector $\mathbf{d}$ points from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the point $(3, 4)$ in 2D space, its component form is $\mathbf{d} = (3, 4)$. This indicates a movement of 3 units along the x-axis and 4 units along the y-axis. Similarly, in 3D space, if vector $\mathbf{d}$ points to the coordinates $(3, 4, 5)$, its component form is $\mathbf{d} = (3, 4, 5)$, signifying movements of 3 units along the x-axis, 4 units along the y-axis, and 5 units along the z-axis.

Grasping the component form of vectors is essential for carrying out operations such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication, as it allows for independent manipulation of each dimension.
