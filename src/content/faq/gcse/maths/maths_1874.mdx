To express a number with a specified level of accuracy, you can round it to the desired number of decimal places or significant figures.

When you are asked to express a number with a certain accuracy, it is important to clarify whether you are dealing with decimal places or significant figures. 

**Decimal Places:** This term refers to the number of digits located to the right of the decimal point. For instance, if you need to round the number $3.14159$ to two decimal places, you examine the third decimal place (which is $1$). Since $1$ is less than $5$, you will round down, resulting in $3.14$.

**Significant Figures:** This concept encompasses all non-zero digits, any zeros that are situated between non-zero digits, and any trailing zeros that appear in the decimal portion of the number. For example, when rounding $0.004567$ to three significant figures, you focus on the first three non-zero digits, which gives you $0.00457$. If the next digit is $5$ or greater, you will round up the last significant figure.

To round a number effectively, first identify the digit at the required place value, and then look at the digit immediately to its right. If this digit is $5$ or greater, you increase the identified digit by one. Conversely, if it is less than $5$, you leave the identified digit unchanged. For example, when rounding $76.854$ to two decimal places, you consider the third decimal place (which is $4$). Since $4$ is less than $5$, the number rounds to $76.85$.

Understanding these rounding rules is essential for accurately expressing numbers, which is particularly important in scientific calculations and everyday measurements.
