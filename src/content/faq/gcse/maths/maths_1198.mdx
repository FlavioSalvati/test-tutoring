The perimeter of a circle, commonly referred to as its circumference, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
C = 2\pi r
$$

In this formula, $ C $ denotes the circumference, $ \pi $ (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $3.14159$, and $ r $ represents the radius of the circle.

For a circle with a radius of $3$ cm, we can substitute this value into the formula:

$$
C = 2 \pi \times 3
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
C = 6\pi
$$

Next, to find the approximate value of the circumference, we substitute $ \pi $ with its approximate value:

$$
C \approx 6 \times 3.14159
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
C \approx 18.84954
$$

When rounded to two decimal places, the circumference is approximately $18.85$ cm. This means that if you walked around the edge of the circle, you would cover a distance of about $18.85$ cm.

Understanding how to calculate the circumference is valuable in various practical situations, such as determining the length of material needed to encircle a circular object or calculating the distance around a circular track.
