To convert seconds into minutes, you need to divide the total number of seconds by $60$.

Understanding the relationship between seconds and minutes is crucial for this conversion. Specifically, there are $60$ seconds in a single minute. Therefore, to determine how many minutes a specific number of seconds represents, you simply perform the division of the number of seconds by $60$. For instance, if you have $120$ seconds and wish to convert it to minutes, you would calculate 

$$
\frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes}.
$$

This conversion formula is particularly useful in various real-life scenarios, such as timing events, cooking, or tracking performance in sports. For example, if a race lasts $300$ seconds, you can quickly ascertain that it is equivalent to 

$$
\frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}.
$$

It's important to note that the result of the division may not always be a whole number. For example, if you have $90$ seconds, dividing by $60$ yields 

$$
\frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \text{ minutes}.
$$ 

This indicates that $90$ seconds is equal to $1$ minute and $30$ seconds. Grasping this conversion enables you to break down time into more manageable units, which facilitates easier analysis and application in various contexts.
