The cumulative frequency for the final class interval represents the total number of data points present in the dataset.

In statistics, cumulative frequency refers to the running total of frequencies across the various class intervals in a frequency distribution. To determine the cumulative frequency for the last class interval, you simply sum the frequencies of all preceding class intervals, including the last one. This process yields the overall number of data points in the entire dataset.

For instance, consider a frequency table that lists class intervals alongside their corresponding frequencies. You would begin by adding the frequency of the first class interval to that of the second class interval. Next, you would take this sum and add it to the frequency of the third class interval, continuing this process until you reach the last class interval. Ultimately, the cumulative frequency for the last class interval will equal the total of all frequencies in the table.

Let's examine a specific frequency table:

| Class Interval | Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|
| $0-10$         | $5$      |
| $10-20$       | $7$      |
| $20-30$       | $3$      |
| $30-40$       | $10$     |

To calculate the cumulative frequency for the last class interval ($30-40$), you would add all the frequencies together: 

$$
5 \, (0-10) + 7 \, (10-20) + 3 \, (20-30) + 10 \, (30-40) = 25.
$$

Thus, the cumulative frequency for the last class interval is $25$, indicating that there are a total of $25$ data points in the dataset.
