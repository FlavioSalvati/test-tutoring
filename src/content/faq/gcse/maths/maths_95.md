To convert from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s), you simply divide the speed by $3.6$.

Understanding the relationship between these units is essential for accurate conversions. Specifically, one kilometer equals $1,000$ meters, and one hour equals $3,600$ seconds. Thus, to convert a speed from km/h to m/s, you first convert kilometers to meters by dividing by $1,000$, and then convert hours to seconds by dividing by $3,600$. By simplifying this process, you find that dividing the speed in km/h by $3.6$ will yield the equivalent speed in m/s.

For instance, if you have a speed of $72 \, \text{km/h}$ and want to convert it to m/s, you would carry out the following calculation:

$$ 
72 \, \text{km/h} \div 3.6 = 20 \, \text{m/s} 
$$

This indicates that a speed of $72 \, \text{km/h}$ is equivalent to $20 \, \text{m/s}$.

This conversion is particularly useful in various real-world scenarios, such as interpreting speed limits, calculating travel times, and analyzing motion in physics problems. By remembering the conversion factor of $3.6$, you can quickly and accurately switch between these units as needed.
