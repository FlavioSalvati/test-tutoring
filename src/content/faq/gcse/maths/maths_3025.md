The range of the numbers $12$, $15$, $18$, $22$, and $25$ is $13$.

To determine the range of a set of numbers, you subtract the smallest number in the set from the largest number. In this instance, the smallest number is $12$, and the largest number is $25$. Therefore, to calculate the range, you perform the following subtraction: 

$$
25 - 12 = 13.
$$

The range serves as a measure of how spread out the numbers in a set are, indicating the difference between the highest and lowest values. In this example, the numbers $12$, $15$, $18$, $22$, and $25$ span a total range of $13$ units.

Understanding the range can enhance your data analysis skills. For example, when evaluating test scores, a larger range may suggest greater variability in student performance, whereas a smaller range could indicate that the scores are more consistent.

In conclusion, the range is a straightforward yet valuable statistical tool that helps you comprehend the distribution of a data set. By learning how to calculate and interpret the range, you can gain important insights into the characteristics of the data you are analyzing.
