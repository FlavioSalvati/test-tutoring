To find the union of three sets, you need to combine all unique elements from each set into a single set.

The union of sets is a fundamental concept in set theory, a branch of mathematics. When tasked with finding the union of three sets, your goal is to create a new set that includes every element present in any of the three sets, ensuring there are no duplicates.

Letâ€™s denote the three sets as $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $. The union of these sets is represented as $ A \cup B \cup C $. To determine this union, you follow these steps:

1. Start by listing all the elements in set $ A $.
2. Next, add the elements from set $ B $, including only those that are not already in set $ A $.
3. Finally, include the elements from set $ C $, again only adding those that are not already in the combined set of $ A $ and $ B $.

For instance, consider the sets defined as $ A = \{1, 2, 3\} $, $ B = \{3, 4, 5\} $, and $ C = \{5, 6, 7\} $. The union $ A \cup B \cup C $ would be $ \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} $. Notice that although the number $ 3 $ appears in both sets $ A $ and $ B $, and $ 5 $ appears in both sets $ B $ and $ C $, each number is included only once in the union.

This method guarantees that the resulting union set contains all distinct elements from the original sets, providing a complete collection of items without repetition. Understanding how to find the union of sets is beneficial in various fields of mathematics and practical applications, such as data analysis and probability.
