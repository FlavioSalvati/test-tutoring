The volume of a pyramid is calculated as one-third of the area of its base multiplied by its height. 

To determine the volume of a pyramid, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
$$

In this formula, the **Base Area** refers to the area of the shape at the bottom of the pyramid, which could be a square, rectangle, triangle, or any other polygon. The **Height** is defined as the perpendicular distance from the base to the apex, which is the top point of the pyramid.

For instance, consider a pyramid with a square base where each side measures $4 \, \text{cm}$. The area of the base can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Base Area} = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} = 16 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

If the height of the pyramid is $9 \, \text{cm}$, you can substitute these values into the volume formula:

$$
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times 16 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 9 \, \text{cm} = 48 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

This volume formula is applicable to any type of pyramid, whether it has a triangular base (like the iconic pyramids in Egypt) or any other polygonal base. It is crucial to always use the perpendicular height of the pyramid rather than the slant height, which is the length of the edge from the base to the apex. By following this method, you can accurately calculate the volume of space contained within the pyramid.
