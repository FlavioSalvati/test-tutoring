To compute $7^3$ using a calculator, follow these steps: first, enter the number $7$. Next, press the exponentiation button, which may be labeled as $x^y$, $y^x$, or simply as a caret symbol (^). After pressing the exponentiation button, enter $3$ to specify the exponent. Finally, press the equals button (=) to obtain the result.

In summary, the sequence of button presses on most scientific calculators will be: $7$, $x^y$, $3$, $=$. Once you complete this sequence, the calculator will display the result, which is $343$. Therefore, we conclude that $7^3 = 343$.

If you are using a basic calculator that does not have an exponentiation function, you can still calculate $7^3$ by performing repeated multiplication. Start by entering $7$, then press the multiplication button (Ã—) and enter $7$ again. Press equals (=) to get the product, and then multiply that result by $7$ once more. This method will also yield $343$.

Mastering the use of the exponentiation function on your calculator is a valuable skill, particularly for GCSE Maths. This proficiency allows you to solve problems involving powers and indices quickly and accurately.
