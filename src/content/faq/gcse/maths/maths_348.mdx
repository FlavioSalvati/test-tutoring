A parallelogram is characterized by the absence of any lines of symmetry.

In geometry, a line of symmetry is defined as a line that divides a shape into two identical halves, where one half is the mirror image of the other. For a shape to possess a line of symmetry, each point on one side of the line must have a corresponding point on the opposite side, equidistant from the line.

However, a parallelogram does not satisfy this condition. Unlike rectangles or squares—both of which are specific types of parallelograms that do have lines of symmetry—a general parallelogram lacks this feature. This is primarily because, although the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length and parallel, the angles are not necessarily right angles, and the lengths of adjacent sides can differ. Consequently, there is no way to draw a line through a parallelogram that results in two mirror-image halves.

To illustrate this concept, consider the act of attempting to fold a parallelogram along any line. Regardless of where you place the fold, the two halves will never align perfectly. This contrasts with shapes such as rectangles or squares, where folding along their lines of symmetry yields two congruent halves. Therefore, while a parallelogram possesses many intriguing properties, having a line of symmetry is not one of them.
