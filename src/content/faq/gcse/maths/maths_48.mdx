When multiplying a fraction by a whole number, the process essentially involves scaling the fraction by that specific number. This can be better understood with an example. 

Consider the fraction $ \frac{3}{4} $, and let's say we want to multiply it by 5. The fraction $ \frac{3}{4} $ is composed of a numerator (3) and a denominator (4).

To multiply $ \frac{3}{4} $ by 5, the operation is carried out on the numerator only, while the denominator remains unchanged. Hence, the multiplication process is as follows:

$$ \frac{3 \times 5}{4} = \frac{15}{4} $$

The result is $ \frac{15}{4} $, which is classified as an improper fraction because the numerator exceeds the denominator. If required, this improper fraction can be transformed into a mixed number. This is done by dividing the numerator by the denominator:

$$ 15 \div 4 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 $$

Therefore, $ \frac{15}{4} $ can be represented as the mixed number $ 3 \frac{3}{4} $.

The primary step to remember is to multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number. This technique is applicable for any fraction and any whole number. If the outcome is an improper fraction, it can be converted into a mixed number for a more simplified response. Understanding how fractions and whole numbers interact is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths, and this process assists in building that understanding.
