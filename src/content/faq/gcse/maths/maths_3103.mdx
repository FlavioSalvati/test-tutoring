To determine the mode from a histogram, you need to identify the bar that displays the highest frequency.

A histogram is a specific type of bar chart that illustrates the frequency distribution of a data set. Each bar in the histogram corresponds to a range of values, referred to as a bin, and the height of the bar reflects the number of data points that fall within that range. The mode is defined as the value or range of values that occurs most frequently in the data set.

To locate the mode, begin by examining the histogram and identifying the tallest bar. The height of each bar indicates the frequency of data points within that particular bin. The tallest bar signifies the bin with the highest frequency, which contains the greatest number of data points. Consequently, the mode corresponds to the value or range of values represented by this tallest bar.

For instance, consider a histogram displaying the test scores of a class. If the tallest bar corresponds to the range of scores from $70$ to $80$, then the mode of the test scores falls within this $70$-$80$ range. This indicates that more students scored between $70$ and $80$ than in any other score range.

It is important to note that the mode is a valuable measure for understanding the most common value or range in your data set, and histograms offer a visual method for quickly identifying this mode.
