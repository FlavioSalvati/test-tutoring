To graph the equation $ y = -x + 8 $, you will create a straight line characterized by a y-intercept of $8$ and a slope of $-1$.

First, recognize that the equation $ y = -x + 8 $ is expressed in slope-intercept form, which is given by $ y = mx + c $. In this case, $ m $, the slope, is $-1$, and $ c $, the y-intercept, is $8$. This indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, 8) $.

Next, plot the y-intercept on the graph. Locate the point $ (0, 8) $ on the y-axis and mark it; this serves as your starting point.

Now, utilize the slope to identify another point on the line. A slope of $-1$ signifies that for every $1$ unit you move to the right along the x-axis, you should move $1$ unit down the y-axis. Starting from $ (0, 8) $, move $1$ unit to the right to reach $ (1, 8) $, and then move $1$ unit down to arrive at $ (1, 7) $. Mark the point $ (1, 7) $ on the graph.

To enhance accuracy, let's find a third point. From the point $ (1, 7) $, move another $1$ unit to the right to $ (2, 7) $ and then $1$ unit down to $ (2, 6) $. Mark this point $ (2, 6) $ on your graph.

Finally, draw a straight line that passes through the points $ (0, 8) $, $ (1, 7) $, and $ (2, 6) $. Extend this line in both directions, ensuring it intersects all the marked points. This line represents the equation $ y = -x + 8 $.
