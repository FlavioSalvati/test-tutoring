An equilateral triangle is defined by having all three sides of equal length and all three internal angles measuring exactly $60^\circ$.

To determine whether a triangle is equilateral, begin by measuring the lengths of its sides. If all three sides are equal, the triangle is classified as equilateral. This characteristic is a fundamental property of equilateral triangles and can be easily verified using a ruler or by examining given measurements.

Next, inspect the internal angles of the triangle. In an equilateral triangle, each of the three angles measures precisely $60^\circ$. This is derived from the fact that the sum of the internal angles in any triangle is $180^\circ$. Dividing this sum evenly among the three angles results in $60^\circ$ for each angle. You can measure the angles with a protractor or apply geometric principles if the side lengths are known.

Moreover, equilateral triangles exhibit symmetrical properties. They are symmetric about any of their three altitudesâ€”the lines drawn from a vertex perpendicular to the opposite side. This symmetry serves as a useful visual indicator when identifying an equilateral triangle.

In summary, to recognize an equilateral triangle, verify that all sides are of equal length and that each angle measures $60^\circ$. These distinctive properties set equilateral triangles apart from other types of triangles.
