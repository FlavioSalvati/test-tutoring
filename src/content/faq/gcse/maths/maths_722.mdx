The standard form of the number $0.0036$ is expressed as $3.6 \times 10^{-3}$.

Standard form, commonly referred to as scientific notation, is a method for representing very large or very small numbers in a more compact and manageable way. This format is especially beneficial in fields like science and engineering. To convert a number into standard form, you need to express it as a product of a number between $1$ and $10$ and a power of $10$.

For the number $0.0036$, we begin by identifying the significant figures, which are $3$ and $6$. We then place the decimal point after the first significant figure, resulting in $3.6$. Next, we count how many places the decimal point has shifted from its original position to its new position. In this instance, the decimal point has moved three places to the right.

Since we moved the decimal point to the right, we will use a negative exponent. Thus, $0.0036$ can be written as:

$$
3.6 \times 10^{-3}
$$

The negative exponent signifies that the original number is less than one. This method not only simplifies calculations but also facilitates the comparison and analysis of extremely small or large numbers.
