To determine the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(3, 5)$ and $(7, 9)$, we will utilize the midpoint formula, which is expressed as:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

The midpoint formula allows us to find the precise center point between two coordinates on a Cartesian plane. In this case, the coordinates are $(3, 5)$ and $(7, 9)$. Here, $(x_1, y_1)$ corresponds to $(3, 5)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ corresponds to $(7, 9)$.

**Step 1: Calculate the x-coordinate of the midpoint.**  
First, add the x-coordinates of the two points:
$$
3 + 7 = 10
$$  
Next, divide this sum by $2$ to compute the average:
$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5
$$  
Thus, the x-coordinate of the midpoint is $5$.

**Step 2: Calculate the y-coordinate of the midpoint.**  
Now, add the y-coordinates of the two points:
$$
5 + 9 = 14
$$  
Then, divide this sum by $2$ to find the average:
$$
\frac{14}{2} = 7
$$  
Therefore, the y-coordinate of the midpoint is $7$.

Combining these results, we find that the midpoint of the segment from $(3, 5)$ to $(7, 9)$ is 
$$(5, 7)$$. 

This point represents the exact halfway mark between the two original points, both horizontally and vertically. Utilizing the midpoint formula simplifies the process of finding this central point, which proves to be invaluable in various mathematical contexts as well as in practical applications in real life.
