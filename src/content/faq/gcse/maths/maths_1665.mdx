To calculate the mean from a frequency table, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\Sigma fx}{\Sigma f}
$$

The mean is a crucial measure of central tendency, representing the average value of a dataset. When working with a frequency table, the data is organized into distinct categories or intervals, each associated with a frequency ($f$) that indicates how often each value or interval appears.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to calculating the mean:

1. **Identify the values ($x$) and their frequencies ($f$)**: Review your frequency table and record the values along with their corresponding frequencies.

2. **Calculate the products of each value and its frequency ($fx$)**: For each value in the table, multiply it by its frequency. This step yields the total contribution of each value to the overall sum.

3. **Sum all the products ($\Sigma fx$)**: Add together all the products calculated in the previous step. This gives you the total sum of all values, weighted by their frequencies.

4. **Sum all the frequencies ($\Sigma f$)**: Add together all the frequencies. This provides the total number of data points in your dataset.

5. **Compute the mean**: Finally, divide the total sum of the products ($\Sigma fx$) by the total number of data points ($\Sigma f$). This calculation yields the mean.

To illustrate, let’s consider a frequency table where the values $2$, $3$, and $4$ occur $1$, $2$, and $3$ times, respectively. The mean can be calculated as follows:

- Values ($x$): $2$, $3$, $4$
- Frequencies ($f$): $1$, $2$, $3$
- Products ($fx$): 
  - For $2$: $2 \times 1 = 2$
  - For $3$: $3 \times 2 = 6$
  - For $4$: $4 \times 3 = 12$
  
Thus, we have:
- $\Sigma fx = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20$
- $\Sigma f = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$

Finally, we find the mean:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{20}{6} \approx 3.33
$$

Therefore, the mean of this dataset is approximately $3.33$.
