To find the x-intercept of the equation $ y = 4x - 6 $, we begin by setting $ y $ equal to 0 and then solving for $ x $.

The x-intercept is defined as the point where the graph of the equation intersects the x-axis. At this intersection, the value of $ y $ is always zero. Therefore, to determine the x-intercept of the equation $ y = 4x - 6 $, we substitute $ y = 0 $ and solve for $ x $.

Starting with the equation:

$$
y = 4x - 6
$$

we set $ y $ to 0:

$$
0 = 4x - 6
$$

Next, we will solve for $ x $. To isolate the term containing $ x $, we add 6 to both sides of the equation:

$$
6 = 4x
$$

Now, we divide both sides by 4 to find $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{6}{4}
$$

Simplifying this expression gives:

$$
x = 1.5
$$

Thus, the x-intercept of the equation $ y = 4x - 6 $ occurs at the point $ (1.5, 0) $. This indicates that the graph of the equation intersects the x-axis at $ x = 1.5 $. Understanding how to calculate the x-intercept is essential for graphing linear equations and analyzing their characteristics.
