The compositions of the functions $ f(x) $ and $ g(x) $ are defined as follows: 

$$
f(g(x)) = x^2 - 2 
$$ 

and 

$$
g(f(x)) = (x - 2)^2.
$$ 

When we discuss the composition of functions, we are essentially substituting one function into another. For the composition $ f(g(x)) $, we begin by taking the function $ g(x) = x^2 $ and substituting it into $ f(x) $. This means that $ f(g(x)) $ involves replacing $ x $ in $ f(x) = x - 2 $ with $ g(x) = x^2 $. Consequently, we obtain 

$$
f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = x^2 - 2.
$$ 

Conversely, for the composition $ g(f(x)) $, we take the function $ f(x) = x - 2 $ and substitute it into $ g(x) $. In this case, $ g(f(x)) $ involves replacing $ x $ in $ g(x) = x^2 $ with $ f(x) = x - 2 $. Thus, we find 

$$
g(f(x)) = g(x - 2) = (x - 2)^2.
$$ 

To clarify the steps involved in these compositions, let's examine each one in detail:

1. For $ f(g(x)) $:
   - Start with $ g(x) = x^2 $.
   - Substitute $ x^2 $ into $ f(x) $: 
   $$
   f(x^2) = x^2 - 2.
   $$

2. For $ g(f(x)) $:
   - Begin with $ f(x) = x - 2 $.
   - Substitute $ x - 2 $ into $ g(x) $: 
   $$
   g(x - 2) = (x - 2)^2.
   $$

These compositions illustrate how functions can be combined to yield new functions, a fundamental concept that is widely applicable in various fields of mathematics.
