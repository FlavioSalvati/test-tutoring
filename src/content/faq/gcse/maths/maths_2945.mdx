The relative frequency of an event is $0.25$, or $25\%$.

Relative frequency is a statistical measure that expresses the frequency of an event occurring in relation to the total number of trials conducted. To compute this measure, you divide the number of times the event occurs by the total number of trials. In this specific scenario, the event occurs $15$ times out of $60$ trials. Therefore, the relative frequency can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of times the event occurs}}{\text{Total number of trials}} = \frac{15}{60} = 0.25 
$$

This indicates that the event occurs $25\%$ of the time. 

Relative frequency is particularly valuable because it provides a proportion or percentage, facilitating comparisons between different events or probabilities. For instance, if another event occurs $30$ times out of $60$ trials, its relative frequency would be $0.5$ or $50\%$, which exceeds the $0.25$ or $25\%$ of the first event.

Understanding relative frequency is crucial for data analysis and predictive modeling. When conducting experiments or surveys, being aware of the relative frequencies of various outcomes can help identify patterns and support informed decision-making. For example, if you were rolling a die and wanted to determine how frequently you roll a $3$, you could apply relative frequency based on your collected data from the trials.
