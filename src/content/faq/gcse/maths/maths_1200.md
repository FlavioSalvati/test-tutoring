The perimeter of a rhombus with a side length of $6 \, \text{cm}$ is $24 \, \text{cm}$.

To calculate the perimeter of a rhombus, you only need to know the length of one of its sides. A rhombus is a special type of quadrilateral in which all four sides are of equal length. Thus, if you have the length of one side, you can easily determine the perimeter by multiplying that length by $4$.

In this instance, the side length of the rhombus is provided as $6 \, \text{cm}$. Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, you can compute the perimeter by multiplying $6 \, \text{cm}$ by $4$.

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side length} = 4 \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 24 \, \text{cm}
$$

Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus is $24 \, \text{cm}$. This method is applicable to any rhombus, regardless of its dimensions, as long as you know the length of one side. It is essential to remember that the defining characteristic of a rhombus is that all its sides are equal, which simplifies the perimeter calculation.
