To calculate the surface area of a cone, you can use the formula:

$$ A = \pi r (r + l) $$

where $ l $ represents the slant height of the cone.

First, you need to determine the slant height ($ l $). The slant height can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem, as the radius ($ r $), height ($ h $), and slant height form a right triangle. The formula for calculating the slant height is given by:

$$ l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} $$

In this scenario, if the radius ($ r $) is $ 3 \, \text{cm} $ and the height ($ h $) is $ 4 \, \text{cm} $, you can substitute these values into the formula:

$$ l = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \, \text{cm} $$

Now that we have determined the slant height to be $ 5 \, \text{cm} $, we can proceed to calculate the surface area using the surface area formula for a cone. The surface area ($ A $) is given by:

$$ A = \pi r (r + l) $$

Substituting the values for the radius ($ r = 3 \, \text{cm} $) and the slant height ($ l = 5 \, \text{cm} $) into the formula yields:

$$ A = \pi \times 3 \times (3 + 5) = \pi \times 3 \times 8 = 24\pi \, \text{cm}^2 $$

Thus, the surface area of the cone is $ 24\pi \, \text{cm}^2 $. If you require a numerical value, you can approximate $ \pi $ as $ 3.14 $:

$$ A \approx 24 \times 3.14 = 75.36 \, \text{cm}^2 $$

Therefore, the surface area of the cone is approximately $ 75.36 \, \text{cm}^2 $.
