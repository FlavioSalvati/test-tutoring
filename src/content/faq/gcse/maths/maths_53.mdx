The process of multiplying two mixed numbers involves converting them into improper fractions, performing the multiplication, and then simplifying the result.

Let's first clarify what mixed numbers and improper fractions are. A mixed number includes a whole number combined with a fraction, such as $2 \frac{1}{3}$. Meanwhile, an improper fraction is characterized by a numerator that exceeds its denominator, as in $\frac{7}{3}$.

The conversion of a mixed number into an improper fraction requires you to multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction and then add the numerator. For instance, to convert $2 \frac{1}{3}$ into an improper fraction, we calculate:
$$ 2 \times 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 $$
So, $2 \frac{1}{3}$ is equivalent to $\frac{7}{3}$.

Carry out this process for both mixed numbers you wish to multiply. Let's assume we have $2 \frac{1}{3}$ and $1 \frac{2}{5}$. Converting $1 \frac{2}{5}$, we get:
$$ 1 \times 5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 $$
Hence, $1 \frac{2}{5}$ is equivalent to $\frac{7}{5}$.

The next step is to multiply the two improper fractions:
$$ \frac{7}{3} \times \frac{7}{5} = \frac{7 \times 7}{3 \times 5} = \frac{49}{15} $$

Lastly, if possible, simplify the result. In this situation, $\frac{49}{15}$ is already in its simplest form. If necessary, it can be converted back to a mixed number by dividing the numerator by the denominator:
$$ 49 \div 15 = 3 \text{ remainder } 4 $$
Therefore, $\frac{49}{15}$ can be expressed as $3 \frac{4}{15}$.

By adhering to these steps, you can accurately multiply any pair of mixed numbers.
