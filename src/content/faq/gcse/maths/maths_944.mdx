To find the inverse of the function $ f(x) = x + 5 $, we follow a systematic process that involves swapping the variables $ x $ and $ y $ and then solving for $ y $.

We begin by expressing the function $ f(x) = x + 5 $ in terms of $ y $. Thus, we rewrite it as:

$$
y = x + 5.
$$

Next, to determine the inverse, we swap the roles of $ x $ and $ y $. This means we replace $ y $ with $ x $ and $ x $ with $ y $, resulting in the equation:

$$
x = y + 5.
$$

Now, we need to isolate $ y $ in this equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:

$$
y = x - 5.
$$

Consequently, we can express the inverse function, denoted as $ f^{-1}(x) $, as follows:

$$
f^{-1}(x) = x - 5.
$$

In summary, the process of finding the inverse function consists of three key steps: first, rewriting the original function with $ y $; second, swapping $ x $ and $ y $; and finally, solving for $ y $. This approach is applicable to many simple functions and helps illustrate how to reverse the operations of the original function. For the function $ f(x) = x + 5 $, the inverse function $ f^{-1}(x) = x - 5 $ effectively negates the addition of 5, returning us to the original input value.
