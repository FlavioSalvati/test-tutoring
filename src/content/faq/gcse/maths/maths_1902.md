To determine the bounds for a measured value, it is essential to identify both the smallest and largest possible values that it could represent.

When you perform a measurement, the resulting value is frequently rounded to a specific degree of accuracy. For instance, if you measure a length and obtain $5.3 \, \text{cm}$, the actual length could lie anywhere between $5.25 \, \text{cm}$ and $5.35 \, \text{cm}$. These limits are referred to as the lower and upper bounds. The lower bound is defined as the smallest value that would round up to your observed measurement, while the upper bound is the largest value that would round down to that same measurement.

To accurately calculate these bounds, you must first understand the degree of accuracy associated with your measurement. If a value is rounded to the nearest whole number, the bounds can be determined by adding and subtracting half of the smallest unit of measurement. For example, if a length is measured as $7 \, \text{cm}$ to the nearest centimeter, the lower bound would be $6.5 \, \text{cm}$ and the upper bound would be $7.5 \, \text{cm}$.

In cases where measurements are rounded to the nearest tenth, such as $4.2 \, \text{cm}$, you would add and subtract $0.05$ (which is half of $0.1$) to ascertain the bounds. Thus, the lower bound would be $4.15 \, \text{cm}$ and the upper bound would be $4.25 \, \text{cm}$. This approach guarantees that you encompass the potential range of the actual value, thereby providing a clearer understanding of the precision of your measurement.
