The magnitude of the vector $(-5, -12)$ is $13$.

To determine the magnitude of a vector, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. The vector $(-5, -12)$ can be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the components $-5$ and $-12$ represent the lengths of the two perpendicular sides. The magnitude corresponds to the length of this hypotenuse.

The formula for the magnitude of a vector $(a, b)$ is given by 

$$
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$ 

In this instance, we have $a = -5$ and $b = -12$. First, we square each component: 

$$
(-5)^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad (-12)^2 = 144.
$$ 

Next, we sum these squares:

$$
25 + 144 = 169.
$$ 

Finally, we take the square root of this sum:

$$
\sqrt{169} = 13.
$$ 

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(-5, -12)$ is indeed $13$. This value represents the distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the point $(-5, -12)$ on a coordinate plane. Mastering the calculation of a vector's magnitude is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, particularly when engaging with vector quantities in fields such as physics and engineering.
