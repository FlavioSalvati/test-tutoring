The simplified form of $ 5\sqrt{18} $ is $ 15\sqrt{2} $.

To simplify $ 5\sqrt{18} $, we first need to simplify the square root of $ 18 $. The number $ 18 $ can be factorized into its prime factors: 

$$
18 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 2 \times 3^2.
$$

This allows us to express the square root of $ 18 $ as:

$$
\sqrt{18} = \sqrt{2 \times 3^2}.
$$

Utilizing the property of square roots, which states that $ \sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} $, we can separate this into:

$$
\sqrt{18} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{3^2}.
$$

Since the square root of a squared number is simply the number itself, we find that:

$$
\sqrt{3^2} = 3.
$$

Thus, we can simplify $ \sqrt{18} $ to:

$$
\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}.
$$

Next, we multiply this simplified form by $ 5 $. Therefore, we can express $ 5\sqrt{18} $ as:

$$
5\sqrt{18} = 5 \times 3\sqrt{2}.
$$

Multiplying the coefficients outside the square root gives us:

$$
5 \times 3 = 15.
$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$
5\sqrt{18} = 15\sqrt{2}.
$$

In summary, the simplified form of $ 5\sqrt{18} $ is $ 15\sqrt{2} $.
