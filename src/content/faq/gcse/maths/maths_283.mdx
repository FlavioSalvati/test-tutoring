The equation of the line can be expressed as 

$$ y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2. $$

To formulate the equation of a line, it is essential to identify two key components: the slope (or gradient) and the y-intercept. The general equation of a line is given by 

$$ y = mx + c, $$ 

where $ m $ represents the slope and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. In this scenario, the slope $ m $ is $ \frac{1}{2} $ and the y-intercept $ c $ is $ -2 $.

The slope indicates the steepness of the line. A slope of $ \frac{1}{2} $ signifies that for every $ 2 $ units you move horizontally to the right, the line ascends by $ 1 $ unit vertically. The y-intercept indicates the point at which the line intersects the y-axis; here, the line crosses the y-axis at $ -2 $.

By substituting the given slope and y-intercept into the general form, we arrive at 

$$ y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2. $$ 

This equation allows you to calculate the corresponding value of $ y $ for any given value of $ x $ by multiplying $ x $ by $ \frac{1}{2} $ and then subtracting $ 2 $. For instance, if we take $ x = 4 $, we can find $ y $ as follows:

$$ y = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0. $$

This equation is particularly useful for graphing the line or determining specific points along it. It is important to remember that the slope and y-intercept are fundamental elements in understanding the behavior of the line.
