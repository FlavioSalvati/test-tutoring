The slope of a line parallel to the equation $ y = 5x + 3 $ is $ 5 $.

In mathematics, the slope of a line quantifies its steepness and direction. For a linear equation expressed in the form $ y = mx + c $, the coefficient $ m $ denotes the slope. In the specific equation $ y = 5x + 3 $, the slope $ m $ is equal to $ 5 $.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same slope. Therefore, any line that is parallel to $ y = 5x + 3 $ will also have a slope of $ 5 $. While the y-intercept (the $ c $ value) may vary, the slope must remain constant for the lines to be considered parallel.

Understanding slopes is essential in GCSE Maths, as it aids in graphing linear equations and analyzing the relationships between variables. The slope illustrates how much the $ y $-value changes in response to a unit change in the $ x $-value. A positive slope, such as $ 5 $, indicates that as $ x $ increases, $ y $ also increases.

Consequently, if you encounter any line represented by the equation $ y = 5x + b $, where $ b $ can be any real number, you can confidently assert that it is parallel to $ y = 5x + 3 $ due to their shared slope of $ 5 $.
