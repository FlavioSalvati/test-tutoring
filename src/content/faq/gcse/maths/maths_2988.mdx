An example of qualitative data is the color of cars in a parking lot.

Qualitative data refers to non-numerical information that describes specific qualities or characteristics. In contrast to quantitative data, which focuses on numbers and measurements, qualitative data emphasizes descriptions and observations. For instance, when observing the cars in a parking lot, you may notice that some are red, others are blue, and some are black. These colors exemplify qualitative data because they convey a characteristic of the cars without relying on numerical values.

Another illustration of qualitative data could be the types of cuisine that individuals prefer, such as Italian, Chinese, or Indian. This type of data aids in understanding preferences and trends without the need for counting or measuring. Similarly, if you were to conduct a survey asking people their opinions about a new school policy, responses like "happy," "angry," or "indifferent" would represent qualitative data.

Qualitative data is typically collected through various methods, including interviews, surveys, and observations. This data is valuable for gaining insights into peopleâ€™s behaviors, opinions, and experiences. For example, a teacher might ask students to describe their favorite part of a lesson. Responses such as "group activities" or "watching videos" provide qualitative data that can help the teacher enhance future lessons.

In summary, qualitative data encompasses the qualities and characteristics that cannot be measured numerically yet are crucial for understanding the complete context of a situation or phenomenon.
