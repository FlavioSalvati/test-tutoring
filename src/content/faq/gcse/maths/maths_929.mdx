The graph of the function $ y = -2^x $ represents a downward-sloping exponential curve that approaches zero but never intersects it.

To elaborate, the equation $ y = -2^x $ exemplifies an exponential function characterized by a negative coefficient. This implies that as the value of $ x $ increases, the value of $ y $ decreases exponentially. The base of the exponent is 2, indicating that the function decays at a rate proportional to powers of 2. However, due to the negative sign preceding $ 2^x $, the graph is reflected across the x-axis relative to the graph of $ y = 2^x $.

When $ x = 0 $, we find that $ y = -2^0 = -1 $. This gives us the y-intercept at the coordinate point $ (0, -1) $. As $ x $ takes on positive values, $ y $ rapidly becomes more negative. For instance, when $ x = 1 $, $ y = -2^1 = -2 $, and when $ x = 2 $, $ y = -2^2 = -4 $. This demonstrates that the graph descends steeply as $ x $ increases.

In contrast, when $ x $ takes on negative values, $ y $ approaches zero from the negative side. For example, when $ x = -1 $, we have $ y = -2^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2} $, and when $ x = -2 $, $ y = -2^{-2} = -\frac{1}{4} $. This behavior indicates that the graph gets increasingly closer to the x-axis without ever touching it, thereby establishing a horizontal asymptote at $ y = 0 $.

In summary, the graph of $ y = -2^x $ is a steep, downward-sloping curve that begins at $ y = -1 $ when $ x = 0 $ and decreases rapidly as $ x $ increases, while it approaches zero as $ x $ decreases.
