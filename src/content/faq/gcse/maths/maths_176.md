To simplify the expression $7m - 4m + 6$, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are those that have the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, $7m$ and $4m$ are like terms because they both contain the variable $m$.

First, let's focus on the terms that include the variable $m$. We start with $7m$ and subtract $4m$ from it. The calculation is as follows:

$$
7m - 4m = (7 - 4)m = 3m.
$$

Thus, the expression $7m - 4m$ simplifies to $3m$.

Next, we examine the constant term, which is $+6$. Since there are no other constant terms to combine with $+6$, it remains unchanged.

By combining these results, we obtain the simplified form of the entire expression:

$$
3m + 6.
$$

Therefore, the original expression $7m - 4m + 6$ can be rewritten in a more manageable form as $3m + 6$. This simplification makes it easier to use in further calculations or equations.
