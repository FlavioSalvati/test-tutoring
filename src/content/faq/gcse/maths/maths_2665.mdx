The area of the sector is $26.18 \, \text{cm}^2$.

To calculate the area of a sector, you need to know two key pieces of information: the radius of the circle and the angle of the sector. The formula for the area of a sector is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
$$

where $\theta$ represents the angle in degrees and $r$ is the radius of the circle.

First, we need to determine the radius of the circle. Given that the diameter is $10 \, \text{cm}$, the radius $r$ can be calculated as half of the diameter, which is:

$$
r = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{cm}
$$

Next, we substitute the known values into the formula. In this case, the angle $\theta$ is $120^\circ$. Therefore, the formula for the area of the sector becomes:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{120}{360} \times \pi \times 5^2
$$

We can simplify the fraction $\frac{120}{360}$ to $\frac{1}{3}$:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 25
$$

Now, we can compute the area:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{3} \times 25\pi = \frac{25\pi}{3}
$$

Using the approximation $\pi \approx 3.14$, we can further calculate the area:

$$
\text{Area} \approx \frac{25 \times 3.14}{3} = \frac{78.5}{3} \approx 26.18 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Thus, the area of the sector is approximately $26.18 \, \text{cm}^2$.
