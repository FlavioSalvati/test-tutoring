The arc length of a circle with a radius of $9 \, \text{cm}$ and an angle of $90^\circ$ is approximately $14.14 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the arc length of a circle, we can use the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Arc Length} = \theta \times r 
$$

In this formula, $\theta$ represents the angle in radians, and $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since the angle is provided in degrees, we must first convert it to radians. The conversion factor from degrees to radians is given by $\frac{\pi}{180}$.

Starting with the angle of $90^\circ$, we can convert it to radians as follows:

$$ 
90^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{2} \, \text{radians} 
$$

Now that we have $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$$ \text{ radians}$ and $r = 9 \, \text{cm}$, we can substitute these values into the arc length formula:

$$ 
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\pi}{2} \times 9 
$$

Simplifying this expression yields:

$$ 
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{9\pi}{2} 
$$

To find its numerical value, we can approximate $\pi$ as $3.14$:

$$ 
\text{Arc Length} \approx \frac{9 \times 3.14}{2} = \frac{28.26}{2} = 14.13 \, \text{cm} 
$$

Rounding to two decimal places, we find that the arc length is approximately $14.14 \, \text{cm}$. This method provides an accurate calculation of the arc length using the specified radius and angle.
