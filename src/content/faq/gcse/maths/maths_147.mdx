To determine the total cost of purchasing $10$ items priced at £$1.75$ each, you can calculate it by multiplying the number of items by the cost of a single item.

In this scenario, you have $10$ items, and each item costs £$1.75$. Therefore, the multiplication can be expressed as:

$$
10 \times 1.75
$$

To simplify the calculation, you can decompose £$1.75$ into its components: £$1$ and £$0.75$. This allows you to split the multiplication into two parts:

1. Calculate the cost of £$1$ for $10$ items:
$$
10 \times 1 = 10
$$

2. Calculate the cost of £$0.75$ for $10$ items:
$$
10 \times 0.75 = 7.5
$$

Next, add these two results together to find the total cost:

$$
10 + 7.5 = 17.5
$$

Thus, the total cost of purchasing $10$ items at £$1.75$ each is £$17.50$.

This method can be applied to calculate the total cost for any quantity of items at any price per item. Simply multiply the number of items by the unit price, and if necessary, break down the multiplication into simpler parts to facilitate the calculation. This approach ensures that you consistently arrive at the correct total cost.
