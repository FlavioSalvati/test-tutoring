To factor the expression $12x + 6$, we start by identifying the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms involved. The GCF is the largest number that can divide the coefficients (the numerical parts in front of the variables) without leaving a remainder. In this case, the coefficients are $12$ and $6$. The GCF of $12$ and $6$ is $6$.

Once we have determined the GCF, we proceed by dividing each term in the expression by this factor. For the term $12x$, dividing by $6$ gives us $2x$, and for the constant term $6$, dividing by $6$ results in $1$. Therefore, when we factor out the GCF, we can rewrite the expression as:

$$
12x + 6 = 6(2x + 1).
$$

This indicates that $12x + 6$ can be expressed as $6$ multiplied by the quantity $(2x + 1)$. Factoring in this manner is advantageous because it simplifies the expression, making it easier to work with, especially when solving equations. Mastering the skill of factorization is essential in algebra, as it aids in simplifying expressions and solving equations more efficiently.
