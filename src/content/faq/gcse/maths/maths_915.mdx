To sketch the graph of the function $ y = x^2 $, you need to plot specific points and then draw a smooth, upward-opening parabola.

First, recognize that $ y = x^2 $ is a quadratic function, which means its graph takes the shape of a parabola. The vertex of this parabola is located at the origin $(0,0)$, and it opens upwards since the coefficient of $ x^2 $ is positive.

Next, create a table of values to identify some key points for plotting. You can select values for $ x $ such as $-2$, $-1$, $0$, $1$, and $2$. Now, calculate the corresponding $ y $-values:

- When $ x = -2 $, $ y = (-2)^2 = 4 $
- When $ x = -1 $, $ y = (-1)^2 = 1 $
- When $ x = 0 $, $ y = 0^2 = 0 $
- When $ x = 1 $, $ y = 1^2 = 1 $
- When $ x = 2 $, $ y = 2^2 = 4 $

Now, plot these points on a set of axes: $(-2, 4)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$, and $(2, 4)$. You should notice that these points form a symmetric pattern around the $ y $-axis.

Next, draw a smooth curve that connects these points to form the parabola. Ensure that the curve is symmetrical and passes through the vertex at the origin. The arms of the parabola should extend upwards as they move away from the vertex.

Keep in mind that the graph of $ y = x^2 $ is a U-shaped curve that becomes steeper as $ |x| $ increases. This fundamental shape is essential for recognizing and sketching other quadratic functions.
