The graph of the function $y = \sqrt{x}$ is a curve that begins at the origin and ascends to the right.

More specifically, the graph of $y = \sqrt{x}$ consists of all points $(x, y)$ where $y$ is defined as the positive square root of $x$. This implies that for every non-negative value of $x$, there exists a corresponding $y$ value equal to the square root of $x$. The graph starts at the origin, represented by the point $(0, 0)$, since the square root of $0$ is $0$. As $x$ increases, $y$ also increases, though the rate of increase diminishes. This results in a curve that rises to the right, becoming less steep as $x$ grows larger.

The function is defined only for $x \geq 0$, since the square root of a negative number is not a real number. Consequently, the graph does not appear in the left half of the coordinate plane. The shape of the curve is gentle, flattening out as you move further to the right. This behavior occurs because the rate at which the square root function increases slows down as $x$ increases. For instance, the square root of $1$ is $1$, the square root of $4$ is $2$, and the square root of $9$ is $3$, illustrating that larger values of $x$ lead to smaller increments in $y$.

Understanding the shape of this graph is crucial for solving problems related to square roots and for visualizing the behavior of the function. It is important to recognize that the graph is confined to the first quadrant and will never fall below the x-axis or extend into the negative values of $x$.
