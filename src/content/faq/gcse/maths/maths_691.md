The result of dividing $12.6$ by $2$ is $6.3$.

To clarify this process, let's break down the division step by step. When you divide $12.6$ by $2$, you are essentially determining how many times $2$ fits into $12.6$. Division is one of the four fundamental operations in arithmetic, and it involves finding how many times one number is contained within another.

First, let’s focus on the whole number part of $12.6$, which is $12$. When we divide $12$ by $2$, we obtain $6$. Next, we need to address the decimal portion, which is $0.6$. Dividing $0.6$ by $2$ results in $0.3$. By combining these two results—$6 + 0.3$—we arrive at $6.3$.

Alternatively, we can approach this problem by converting the decimal into a fraction. The number $12.6$ can be expressed as $\frac{126}{10}$. When we divide $126$ by $2$, we get $63$. Since the original number was divided by $10$, we must place the decimal point back, yielding the final result of $6.3$.

Understanding how to perform division with decimals is essential for GCSE Maths, as it serves as a foundation for solving more complex problems involving ratios, proportions, and algebraic expressions. Regular practice of these calculations will enhance your confidence and accuracy when working with decimal numbers.
