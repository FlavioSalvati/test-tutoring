The result of the expression is $2^7$, which evaluates to $128$.

To grasp the reasoning behind this, let's break it down step by step. When multiplying powers that share the same base, you add the exponents. This principle is known as the "Product of Powers" rule. In our example, the base is $2$, and the exponents are $3$ and $4$. Therefore, we add the exponents together: 

$$
3 + 4 = 7.
$$

As a result, the expression $2^3 \times 2^4$ simplifies to $2^7$.

Next, letâ€™s compute $2^7$. The exponent indicates how many times to multiply the base (which is $2$) by itself. Thus, $2^7$ means we perform the following multiplication:

$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2.
$$

If we carry out this multiplication step by step, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
2 \times 2 & = 4, \\
4 \times 2 & = 8, \\
8 \times 2 & = 16, \\
16 \times 2 & = 32, \\
32 \times 2 & = 64, \\
64 \times 2 & = 128.
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, $2^7$ indeed equals $128$. Mastering the technique of adding exponents when multiplying powers with the same base can significantly streamline your calculations, especially for larger numbers. This is an essential rule to remember for your GCSE Maths exams!
