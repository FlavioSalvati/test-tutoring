To subtract mixed numbers, you should follow a systematic process: convert each mixed number into an improper fraction, find a common denominator, perform the subtraction, and finally simplify the result.

### Step 1: Convert Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions

A mixed number is composed of a whole number and a fractional part. To convert a mixed number into an improper fraction, multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fractional part and then add the numerator. This sum will serve as the new numerator, while the denominator remains unchanged.

For example, to convert the mixed number $2 \frac{3}{4}$, you would calculate:

$$
2 \times 4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
$$

Thus, $2 \frac{3}{4}$ is equivalent to the improper fraction $\frac{11}{4}$.

### Step 2: Find a Common Denominator

The next step is to identify a common denominator for the fractions involved. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the fractions you are working with. 

For instance, if you are subtracting $\frac{11}{4}$ and $\frac{5}{6}$, the denominators are 4 and 6. The LCM of 4 and 6 is 12. 

Now, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
- For $\frac{11}{4}$, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

$$
\frac{11}{4} = \frac{11 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{33}{12}
$$

- For $\frac{5}{6}$, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

$$
\frac{5}{6} = \frac{5 \times 2}{6 \times 2} = \frac{10}{12}
$$

### Step 3: Subtract the Improper Fractions

With both fractions now having a common denominator, you can subtract the numerators while keeping the common denominator:

$$
\frac{33}{12} - \frac{10}{12} = \frac{33 - 10}{12} = \frac{23}{12}
$$

### Step 4: Simplify the Result

Finally, simplify the resulting improper fraction if possible. If the improper fraction can be converted back into a mixed number, do so. 

For the fraction $\frac{23}{12}$, divide the numerator by the denominator:

$$
23 \div 12 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 11
$$

This means $\frac{23}{12}$ can be expressed as the mixed number:

$$
1 \frac{11}{12}
$$

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively subtract mixed numbers and simplify your answer, ensuring clarity and accuracy in your calculations.
