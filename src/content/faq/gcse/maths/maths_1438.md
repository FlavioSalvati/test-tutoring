The magnitude of the vector $(0, 5)$ is $5$.

To calculate the magnitude of a vector, we apply the Pythagorean theorem. The vector $(0, 5)$ can be visualized as a point on a Cartesian plane, where the x-coordinate is $0$ and the y-coordinate is $5$. The magnitude of a vector represents the length of the line segment that extends from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the point $(0, 5)$.

The formula for determining the magnitude of a vector $(x, y)$ is given by:

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
$$

For our specific vector, we have $x = 0$ and $y = 5$. Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$
\sqrt{0^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{0 + 25} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(0, 5)$ is $5$. This indicates that the distance from the origin to the point $(0, 5)$ is $5$ units. Understanding the magnitude of vectors is crucial in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it aids in grasping the size and direction of vectors.
