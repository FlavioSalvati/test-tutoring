To round the number $0.0345$ to two decimal places, the result is $0.03$.

When rounding a number to a specified number of decimal places, it is essential to examine the digit immediately following the place to which you are rounding. In this instance, we are rounding to two decimal places, so we must consider the third decimal place. The number $0.0345$ consists of the digits $0$, $3$, $4$, and $5$ in its decimal representation, where the third decimal place is $4$.

The rule for rounding is straightforward: if the digit you are assessing (which is the third decimal place in this case) is $5$ or greater, you round up the second decimal place by one. Conversely, if it is less than $5$, you keep the second decimal place unchanged. In this case, since the third decimal place is $4$, which is less than $5$, we do not round up the second decimal place.

Thus, the number $0.0345$ rounded to two decimal places remains $0.03$. This rounding process simplifies numbers, making them easier to work with, particularly in calculations where extreme precision is not required. Remember, rounding is a valuable skill applicable in various fields of mathematics and in everyday situations, from estimating expenses to simplifying measurements.
