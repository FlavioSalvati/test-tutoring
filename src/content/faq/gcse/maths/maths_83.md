To clarify and enhance the content, here is the revised version:

The limits of accuracy for the number $56.789$, when rounded to three decimal places, are $56.7885$ and $56.7895$.

When rounding a number to three decimal places, we focus on the thousandths place. In the case of $56.789$, the digit in the thousandths place is $9$. To establish the limits of accuracy, we need to identify the smallest and largest values that would round to $56.789$ when rounded to three decimal places.

The smallest number that rounds to $56.789$ is $56.7885$. This is because any number less than $56.7885$ will round down to $56.788$ when rounded to three decimal places. For instance, $56.7884$ would round to $56.788$, not $56.789$.

Conversely, the largest number that rounds to $56.789$ is $56.7894999\ldots$, which continues indefinitely. However, for practical applications, we often refer to this as $56.7895$. Any number that is equal to or greater than $56.7895$ will round up to $56.790$ when rounded to three decimal places. For example, $56.7895$ itself rounds to $56.790$.

Thus, the range of numbers that round to $56.789$ when rounded to three decimal places spans from $56.7885$ to just under $56.7895$. This range ensures that any number within these limits will round to $56.789$, thereby maintaining the desired accuracy of three decimal places.
