A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than $1$ that has no positive divisors other than $1$ and itself.

To determine if a number is prime, check whether it can be evenly divided by any integer other than $1$ and itself. Begin by testing divisibility with $2$. If the number divides evenly by $2$ (i.e., it leaves a remainder of $0$), then it is not a prime number. If it does not divide evenly, proceed to the next odd integer, which is $3$, and continue testing with subsequent odd numbers ($5$, $7$, $11$, etc.) up to the square root of the number you are evaluating.

For instance, let's investigate whether $29$ is a prime number. First, we check if $29$ is divisible by $2$. Since $29$ is odd, it cannot be evenly divided by $2$. Next, we test divisibility by $3$. The sum of the digits of $29$ is $11$ (calculated as $2 + 9$), and since $11$ is not divisible by $3$, it follows that $29$ is also not divisible by $3$. Moving on to $5$, since $29$ does not end in $0$ or $5$, it is not divisible by $5$. The next number to check is $7$. Dividing $29$ by $7$ yields a non-integer result, confirming that $29$ is not divisible by $7$.

Having tested all prime numbers up to the square root of $29$ (approximately $5.39$) and found that none divide $29$ evenly, we can confidently conclude that $29$ is indeed a prime number.

In summary, the essential steps to determine whether a number is prime involve testing for divisibility by all prime numbers up to its square root. This systematic method enables an efficient assessment of a number's primality.
