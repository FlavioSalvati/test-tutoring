To plot the point $(3, 4)$ on a Cartesian plane, begin by identifying the position of $3$ on the x-axis and $4$ on the y-axis.

A Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular lines: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis. The intersection of these axes is known as the origin, represented by the coordinates $(0, 0)$. Each point on this plane is defined by a pair of numbers $(x, y)$, where $x$ denotes the horizontal coordinate and $y$ denotes the vertical coordinate.

To accurately plot the point $(3, 4)$, start at the origin. From there, move $3$ units to the right along the x-axis, since the x-coordinate is $3$. Next, from this new position, move $4$ units upwards along the y-axis, as indicated by the y-coordinate being $4$. The location where you arrive is the point $(3, 4)$ on the Cartesian plane.

For enhanced precision while plotting, it can be beneficial to draw light guiding lines or use a ruler when navigating along the axes. This approach will help ensure that you accurately determine the position of the point. Keep in mind that the x-coordinate indicates how far to move horizontally from the origin, while the y-coordinate indicates how far to move vertically from that new position.
