To expand the expression $(3x + 2)(x - 1)$, we will apply the distributive property, which involves multiplying each term in the first bracket by every term in the second bracket.

Let's break down the process step by step. The distributive property is often referred to as the FOIL method for binomials, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, and Last. This method guides us in multiplying the terms systematically.

1. **First**: Multiply the first terms from each bracket:
   $$3x \times x = 3x^2$$

2. **Outer**: Multiply the outer terms from the brackets:
   $$3x \times -1 = -3x$$

3. **Inner**: Multiply the inner terms from the brackets:
   $$2 \times x = 2x$$

4. **Last**: Multiply the last terms from each bracket:
   $$2 \times -1 = -2$$

Now, we combine all these results:
$$3x^2 - 3x + 2x - 2$$

Next, we simplify the expression by combining like terms. The like terms in this case are $-3x$ and $2x$:
$$3x^2 - 3x + 2x - 2 = 3x^2 - x - 2$$

Thus, the expanded form of the expression $(3x + 2)(x - 1)$ is:
$$3x^2 - x - 2$$

This method ensures that you accurately distribute each term and combine like terms to arrive at the final expanded expression.
