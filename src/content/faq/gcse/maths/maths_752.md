To compare two ratios effectively, you can convert them into fractions and either find a common denominator or use cross-multiplication.

The first step in comparing two ratios is to express each one as a fraction. For instance, if you have the ratios $3:4$ and $5:6$, you can write them as $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{5}{6}$. This transformation makes it easier to analyze the relationship between the two quantities.

Next, you have two options: you can either find a common denominator or apply cross-multiplication to compare the fractions. 

Finding a common denominator involves adjusting both fractions so that they share the same denominator. For example, the least common denominator of $4$ and $6$ is $12$. Therefore, you would convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to $\frac{9}{12}$ and $\frac{5}{6}$ to $\frac{10}{12}$. Now, itâ€™s straightforward to see that $\frac{9}{12}$ is less than $\frac{10}{12}$, which indicates that the ratio $3:4$ is less than the ratio $5:6$.

Alternatively, you can use cross-multiplication. This method involves multiplying the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction, and vice versa. For the fractions $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{5}{6}$, you would compute $3 \times 6 = 18$ and $4 \times 5 = 20$. Since $18$ is less than $20$, it follows that the ratio $3:4$ is smaller than $5:6$.

Both methods are valid and effective, so you can choose the one that you find more intuitive. Mastering these techniques will enhance your ability to compare ratios accurately across a variety of mathematical contexts.
