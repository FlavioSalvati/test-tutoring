To calculate the relative frequency of a specific outcome, you divide the number of occurrences of that outcome by the total number of trials.

Relative frequency provides insight into how frequently a particular event occurs in relation to the total number of events. For instance, suppose you roll a die 50 times and want to determine the relative frequency of rolling a 4. First, count how many times you rolled a 4. Letâ€™s say you rolled a 4 exactly 8 times out of those 50 rolls.

Next, you take the number of times the outcome (rolling a 4) occurred, which is $8$, and divide it by the total number of trials, which is $50$. The calculation is as follows:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{8}{50} = 0.16
$$

Thus, the relative frequency of rolling a 4 is $0.16$, or $16\%$.

Relative frequency can be represented in several forms: as a fraction, a decimal, or a percentage. This concept is useful for analyzing the likelihood of various outcomes in an experiment. For example, if you conducted a survey to find out how many people prefer chocolate ice cream over vanilla, and $30$ out of $100$ respondents indicated a preference for chocolate, the relative frequency of people who prefer chocolate ice cream would be:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{30}{100} = 0.3 \quad \text{or} \quad 30\%
$$

Understanding relative frequency is valuable because it offers a practical method for estimating probabilities based on actual data rather than theoretical predictions. This approach is particularly beneficial in real-world situations where decisions must be made based on observed outcomes.
