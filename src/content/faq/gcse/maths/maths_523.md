The formula for calculating the expected frequency of an event is given by:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = (\text{Probability of Event}) \times (\text{Total Number of Trials}).
$$

In essence, the expected frequency provides a way to predict how often a specific event is likely to occur in a probability experiment. To compute the expected frequency, you need two key pieces of information: the probability of the event occurring and the total number of trials or experiments performed.

For instance, consider the scenario of rolling a fair six-sided die. The probability of rolling a 3 is $\frac{1}{6}$. If you roll the die $60$ times, you can apply the formula to determine the expected frequency of rolling a 3. In this case, the probability of rolling a 3 is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the total number of trials is $60$. Therefore, the expected frequency can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 60 = 10.
$$

This indicates that you would expect to roll a 3 approximately $10$ times over the course of $60$ rolls.

This concept is particularly valuable in the fields of statistics and probability, as it allows for predictions of outcomes across a large number of trials. It is important to note that the expected frequency is a theoretical value. In practical experiments, the actual frequency may vary slightly due to random fluctuations. However, as the number of trials increases, the actual frequencies tend to converge towards the expected frequencies.
