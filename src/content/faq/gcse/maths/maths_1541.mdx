To determine the probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously, you simply multiply the probabilities of each event.

Independent events are those in which the outcome of one event does not influence the outcome of the other. For instance, flipping a coin and rolling a die are independent events because the result of the coin flip has no impact on the result of the die roll.

Consider a scenario where you want to calculate the probability of flipping a coin and obtaining heads (Event A) while simultaneously rolling a die and getting a 4 (Event B). First, you need to determine the probability of each event occurring individually. The probability of getting heads in a coin flip is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling a 4 on a six-sided die is $\frac{1}{6}$.

To find the probability of both events happening together, you multiply the probabilities of each event:

$$ P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) $$

Substituting the individual probabilities, we have:

$$ P(\text{heads and 4}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{12} $$

Thus, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads while rolling a die and obtaining a 4 is $\frac{1}{12}$.

This method can be applied to any pair of independent events. Just ensure that the events are genuinely independent, meaning the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other. If this condition holds, you can simply multiply their individual probabilities to find the combined probability.
