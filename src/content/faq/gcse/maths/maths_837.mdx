To determine the value of the expression $2m + 3$ when $m = 4$, we start by substituting $m$ with $4$. This means we replace every instance of $m$ in the expression with $4$. Consequently, the expression $2m + 3$ becomes:

$$
2(4) + 3.
$$

Next, we apply the order of operations, commonly referred to as BIDMAS/BODMAS (which stands for Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). In this case, we perform the multiplication first. Thus, we calculate:

$$
2 \times 4 = 8.
$$

Now, the expression simplifies to:

$$
8 + 3.
$$

Finally, we perform the addition:

$$
8 + 3 = 11.
$$

Therefore, when $m$ is equal to $4$, the value of the expression $2m + 3$ is $11$.

This procedure of substituting a specific value into an algebraic expression and simplifying it step by step is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths. It enhances our understanding of variables and how to manipulate algebraic expressions to compute particular values.
