To determine the midpoint of the line segment defined by the endpoints $(2, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$, we can use the midpoint formula, which is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right).
$$

This formula allows us to compute the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the endpoints. Here, our endpoints are $(2, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$.

First, we will calculate the average of the x-coordinates. The x-coordinates are $2$ and $4$. Adding these values together, we have:

$$
2 + 4 = 6.
$$

Next, we divide this sum by $2$ to find the average:

$$
\frac{6}{2} = 3.
$$

Thus, the x-coordinate of the midpoint is $3$.

Now, we will find the average of the y-coordinates. The y-coordinates are $2$ and $6$. Adding these together results in:

$$
2 + 6 = 8.
$$

We then divide this sum by $2$ to obtain the average:

$$
\frac{8}{2} = 4.
$$

Therefore, the y-coordinate of the midpoint is $4$.

In conclusion, the midpoint of the segment with endpoints $(2, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$ is $(3, 4)$. This point represents the exact halfway location between the two endpoints in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. This method can be applied to any two points to find the midpoint of the line segment that connects them.
