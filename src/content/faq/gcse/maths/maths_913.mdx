To plot the function $ y = |x - 3| $, you will create a V-shaped graph with its vertex located at the point $ (3, 0) $.

First, it's important to recognize that the absolute value function inherently produces a V-shape. The expression contained within the absolute value, $ x - 3 $, results in a horizontal shift of the graph. Specifically, this shift moves the vertex of the V from the origin $ (0, 0) $ to the point $ (3, 0) $. This occurs because the absolute value of zero is zero, and the equation $ x - 3 = 0 $ is satisfied when $ x = 3 $.

Next, let's examine the behavior of the function on either side of the vertex. For values of $ x \geq 3 $, the absolute value function $ |x - 3| $ simplifies to $ x - 3 $. Consequently, for $ x $ values greater than or equal to 3, the graph is represented by a straight line with a slope of 1, extending upward to the right from the vertex $ (3, 0) $.

Conversely, for values of $ x < 3 $, the absolute value function $ |x - 3| $ simplifies to $ -(x - 3) $, which is equivalent to $ 3 - x $. Therefore, for $ x $ values less than 3, the graph forms a straight line with a slope of -1, rising upward to the left from the vertex $ (3, 0) $.

In summary, begin by plotting the vertex at the point $ (3, 0) $. Then, draw a line with a positive slope of 1 to the right of the vertex and a line with a negative slope of -1 to the left of the vertex. This construction will yield the distinctive V-shape characteristic of the absolute value function.
