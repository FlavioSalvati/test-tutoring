To derive the equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by the equation $ y = -x + 7 $, we begin by noting that parallel lines share the same gradient. In this case, the gradient $ m $ of the given line is $ -1 $.

The general form of a line can be expressed as $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the gradient and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. Since the gradient of the line $ y = -x + 7 $ is $ -1 $, any line that is parallel to it will also have a gradient of $ -1 $.

To write the equation of a parallel line, we maintain the same gradient while altering the y-intercept $ c $. The y-intercept is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis. For example, if we desire a parallel line that crosses the y-axis at $ y = 3 $, we would keep the gradient as $ -1 $ and set the new y-intercept to $ 3 $. Consequently, the equation of this parallel line would be:

$$
y = -x + 3.
$$

You can select any value for the y-intercept to generate various parallel lines. For instance, if the y-intercept is chosen to be $ -2 $, the resulting equation would be:

$$
y = -x - 2.
$$

The essential point to remember is that the gradient must remain $ -1 $ in order for the lines to be parallel.
