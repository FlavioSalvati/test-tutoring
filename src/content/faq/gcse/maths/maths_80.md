To determine the range of possible values, it is essential to identify both the minimum and maximum values within a given set or function.

First, let's clarify what the range of possible values signifies. In mathematics, the range refers to the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of numbers or the output values of a function. For a numerical set, the process is straightforward: simply identify the smallest and largest numbers. For instance, consider the set $\{3, 7, 2, 9, 5\}$. Here, the minimum value is $2$, and the maximum value is $9$. Consequently, the range of this set is from $2$ to $9$.

When working with functions, the approach requires a bit more analysis. For example, if we have a function defined as $f(x) = 2x + 3$, we must determine the possible output values of $f(x)$. This often entails examining the domain, which is the set of all allowable input values, and then assessing the output values generated by these inputs. For linear functions like $f(x) = 2x + 3$, the range encompasses all real numbers. This is because as $x$ varies over all real numbers, $f(x)$ will also span all real numbers.

In the case of more complex functions, such as quadratic functions like $f(x) = x^2 - 4$, the analysis involves locating the vertex of the parabola to ascertain the minimum or maximum value. In this example, the vertex is positioned at $(0, -4)$, indicating that the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $-4$. Since the parabola opens upwards, the range of this function is all values of $y$ such that $y \geq -4$.

In summary, finding the range requires identifying the smallest and largest values in a set, or analyzing the output values of a function based on its domain.
