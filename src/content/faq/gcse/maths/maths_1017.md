To determine the equation of a line perpendicular to $ y = x - 4 $, find the negative reciprocal of the slope.

The given line $ y = x - 4 $ has a slope of 1, as it can be written in the form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ is the slope. For a line to be perpendicular to another, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of the original line's slope. The negative reciprocal of 1 is -1. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line is -1.

Next, we use the point-slope form of a line's equation, which is $ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) $, where $ m $ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. Suppose we want the perpendicular line to pass through a specific point, say $(2, 3)$. Substituting $ m = -1 $ and the point $(2, 3)$ into the point-slope form, we get:

$$ y - 3 = -1(x - 2) $$

Simplifying this, we get:

$$ y - 3 = -x + 2 $$
$$ y = -x + 5 $$

Thus, the equation of the line perpendicular to $ y = x - 4 $ and passing through the point $(2, 3)$ is $ y = -x + 5 $. If no specific point is given, the general form of the perpendicular line's equation will be $ y = -x + c $, where $ c $ is the y-intercept that can vary depending on the specific point through which the line passes.
