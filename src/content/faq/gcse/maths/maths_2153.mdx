To represent the inequality $ x < -2 $ on a number line, follow these steps for clarity:

1. **Draw the Number Line**: Begin by sketching a horizontal line to represent the number line. 

2. **Mark the Point**: Clearly indicate the point at $ -2 $ on the line. 

3. **Use an Open Circle**: Since the inequality is $ x < -2 $, place an open circle at $ -2 $. This open circle signifies that $ -2 $ is not included in the solution set. In contrast, a closed circle would indicate that the endpoint is included.

4. **Shade to the Left**: Next, shade the portion of the number line that lies to the left of $ -2 $. This shading represents all values that are less than $ -2 $. Ensure that the shading extends indefinitely to the left, reflecting the absence of a lower limit on the numbers.

By employing an open circle and shading to the left, you effectively convey that any number less than $ -2 $ satisfies the inequality $ x < -2 $. This visual representation is a clear and effective method for illustrating inequalities on a number line, enhancing understanding and analysis of the possible values for $ x $.
