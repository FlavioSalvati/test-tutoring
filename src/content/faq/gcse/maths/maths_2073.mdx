In the equation $ z^2 + 2z = 8 $, the variable $ z $ represents the values that satisfy this equation.

To solve for $ z $, we first need to rearrange the equation into the standard quadratic form, which is expressed as $ az^2 + bz + c = 0 $. We can achieve this by subtracting $ 8 $ from both sides of the equation:

$$
z^2 + 2z - 8 = 0
$$

Now, we have a quadratic equation in the standard form $ az^2 + bz + c = 0 $, where the coefficients are $ a = 1 $, $ b = 2 $, and $ c = -8 $. To find the values of $ z $, we will utilize the quadratic formula, given by:

$$
z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Next, we substitute the values of $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ into the formula:

$$
z = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-8)}}{2 \cdot 1}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
z = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 32}}{2}
$$

Continuing with the simplification, we have:

$$
z = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2}
$$

This further simplifies to:

$$
z = \frac{-2 \pm 6}{2}
$$

From this expression, we can derive two potential solutions for $ z $:

1. For the positive root:
   $$
   z = \frac{-2 + 6}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   $$

2. For the negative root:
   $$
   z = \frac{-2 - 6}{2} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4
   $$

Consequently, the values of $ z $ that satisfy the equation $ z^2 + 2z = 8 $ are $ z = 2 $ and $ z = -4 $.
