The next term in the sequence $1, 3, 5, 7$ is $9$.

This sequence is an example of an arithmetic sequence, characterized by a constant increase between each term. In this particular case, the common difference is $2$. To determine the next term, you simply add this common difference to the last term in the sequence. Starting with $1$, you add $2$ to obtain $3$, then add $2$ again to reach $5$, and continue this process. When you add $2$ to $7$, you arrive at $9$.

Arithmetic sequences are a fundamental concept in GCSE Maths. They consist of a series of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms remains constant. This constant difference is referred to as the common difference. In our sequence, the common difference is $2$, indicating that each term is $2$ greater than the one preceding it. Grasping how to identify and extend arithmetic sequences is essential, as it aids in recognizing patterns and simplifies problem-solving.

To generalize, if you know the first term $a$ and the common difference $d$ of an arithmetic sequence, you can calculate any term in the sequence using the formula:

$$ a_n = a + (n-1)d $$

where $a_n$ represents the $n$th term. In our sequence, the first term $a$ is $1$ and the common difference $d$ is $2$. Thus, the $n$th term can be computed as:

$$ a_n = 1 + (n-1) \times 2. $$

For instance, to find the 5th term, we use:

$$ a_5 = 1 + (5-1) \times 2 = 1 + 8 = 9. $$
