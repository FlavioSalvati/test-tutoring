To construct a triangle with specified measurements, you'll need a ruler, a compass, and a protractor to accurately draw the sides and angles.

Start by drawing a base line that is equal to one of the given side lengths using your ruler. Label the endpoints of this line as points $A$ and $B$. Next, adjust your compass to the length of the second side. Place the compass point on point $A$ and draw an arc. Without altering the compass width, place the compass point on point $B$ and draw another arc that intersects the first arc. Label the intersection point as point $C$.

At this stage, you have two sides of the triangle. Use the ruler to draw lines connecting point $C$ to points $A$ and $B$, thus completing the triangle. If you need to construct a triangle based on an angle measurement rather than a side length, use the protractor to measure the specified angle at the appropriate vertex. For instance, if you are to create a triangle with base $AB$, an angle at $A$, and side $AC$, first draw the base $AB$. Then, utilize the protractor to measure the given angle at point $A$. Draw a line from $A$ at this angle, and mark the point where this line intersects the arc (which has a radius equal to the given side length) as point $C$.

Finally, verify your construction by measuring the sides and angles to ensure they correspond with the provided measurements. This method not only guarantees accuracy but also helps you grasp the geometric principles involved in triangle construction.
