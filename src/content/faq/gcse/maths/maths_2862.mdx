The formula for the magnitude of a vector represented by the components $(a, b)$ is given by 

$$
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$

To elaborate, the magnitude of a vector serves as a measure of its length. When you consider a vector defined by its components $(a, b)$, it can be visualized as a point in a two-dimensional space, where $a$ represents the horizontal component and $b$ signifies the vertical component. To calculate the magnitude, we employ the Pythagorean theorem, which connects the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle to the length of its hypotenuse.

Picture a right-angled triangle where one side measures $a$ units and the other side measures $b$ units. The hypotenuse of this triangle, which corresponds to the magnitude of the vector, can be determined using the formula:

$$
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$

This formula derives from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

For instance, if you have a vector $(3, 4)$, you would compute its magnitude as follows:

$$
\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
$$

This calculation indicates that the length of the vector $(3, 4)$ is $5$ units. This method is applicable to any vector in two-dimensional space, making it an invaluable tool in both mathematics and physics.
