The simplified form of $ 3\sqrt{27} $ is $ 9 $.

To understand how $ 3\sqrt{27} $ simplifies to $ 9 $, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to determine the cube root of $ 27 $. The cube root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself three times, yields the original number. In this case, the cube root of $ 27 $ is $ 3 $ because:

$$
3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27
$$

Next, we multiply this cube root by the coefficient outside the radical, which is $ 3 $ in this instance. Thus, we perform the following multiplication:

$$
3 \times 3 = 9
$$

Therefore, we conclude that $ 3\sqrt{27} $ simplifies to $ 9 $. This process involves recognizing that $ 27 $ is a perfect cube, specifically $ 3^3 $, and then applying basic multiplication to arrive at the final result. Mastering the simplification of expressions involving roots is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it aids in solving more intricate algebraic problems.
