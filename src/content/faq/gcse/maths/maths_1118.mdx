The formula for calculating the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by:

$$(n-2) \times 180^\circ$$

To better understand this formula, let’s break it down. A polygon is defined as a two-dimensional shape with straight sides, and the number of sides in the polygon is represented by $n$. For example, a triangle has $3$ sides, a quadrilateral has $4$ sides, and so forth. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon varies based on the number of sides it possesses.

The formula $(n-2) \times 180^\circ$ is derived from the concept of dividing the polygon into triangles. Any polygon can be partitioned into $(n-2)$ triangles. For instance, a quadrilateral can be divided into $2$ triangles, a pentagon into $3$ triangles, and this pattern continues. Since the sum of the angles in each triangle is always $180^\circ$, multiplying the number of triangles by $180^\circ$ yields the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon.

Let’s consider a pentagon, which has $5$ sides, as an illustrative example. To use the formula, we substitute $n$ with $5$:

$$
(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
$$

Thus, the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is $540^\circ$.

This formula is particularly useful for solving problems related to polygons, especially when determining unknown angles. It is important to note that this formula applies only to simple polygons—those that do not intersect themselves. By grasping and applying this formula, you can effectively analyze and solve a variety of geometric problems involving polygons.
