The area of a similar shape with doubled sides is four times that of the original area.

When you double the sides of a shape, you are effectively scaling the shape by a factor of $2$. For similar shapes, the area scales according to the square of the scale factor. Specifically, if the scale factor is $2$, you square it: $2^2 = 4$. Thus, the area of the new shape is four times the area of the original shape.

To illustrate this principle, let's consider a straightforward example. Imagine you have a square with a side length of $3$ units. The area of this square can be calculated as the side length squared:

$$
\text{Area} = 3^2 = 9 \text{ square units}.
$$

When you double the side length, the new side length becomes $6$ units. The area of the new square is then calculated as:

$$
\text{New Area} = 6^2 = 36 \text{ square units}.
$$

Notice that $36$ is indeed four times $9$, confirming that the area has increased by a factor of $4$.

This principle holds true for all similar shapes, not just squares. For example, consider a triangle with a base of $4$ units and a height of $3$ units. The area of this triangle is calculated as:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = 6 \text{ square units}.
$$

If we double the dimensions, the base becomes $8$ units and the height becomes $6$ units. The area of the new triangle is:

$$
\text{New Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 = 24 \text{ square units}.
$$

Again, we see that $24$ is four times $6$, further demonstrating that the area has increased by a factor of $4$.

Grasping this concept is essential for solving problems related to similar shapes and their areas in GCSE Maths.
