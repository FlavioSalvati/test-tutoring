To determine the maximum point of the quadratic function $ y = -x^2 + 2x + 1 $, we can either complete the square or apply the vertex formula. The general form of a quadratic equation is given by 

$$
y = ax^2 + bx + c,
$$ 

where in our case, $ a = -1 $, $ b = 2 $, and $ c = 1 $.

### Using the Vertex Formula

The vertex formula states that the $ x $-coordinate of the vertex (which can be a maximum or minimum point) of a parabola defined by the equation $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $ is calculated as:

$$
x = -\frac{b}{2a}.
$$

Substituting the values of $ a $ and $ b $:

$$
x = -\frac{2}{2(-1)} = 1.
$$

Next, we substitute $ x = 1 $ back into the original equation to find the corresponding $ y $-coordinate:

$$
y = -1^2 + 2(1) + 1 = -1 + 2 + 1 = 2.
$$

Thus, the maximum point of the function is at $ (1, 2) $.

### Completing the Square

Alternatively, we can find the maximum point by completing the square. Starting with the equation:

$$
y = -x^2 + 2x + 1,
$$

we factor out $-1$ from the quadratic terms:

$$
y = -(x^2 - 2x) + 1.
$$

Next, we complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses:

$$
y = -[(x - 1)^2 - 1] + 1.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
y = -(x - 1)^2 + 1 + 1 = -(x - 1)^2 + 2.
$$

This form clearly indicates that the maximum value of $ y $ occurs when $ (x - 1)^2 = 0 $, which happens at $ x = 1 $. Substituting this back, we find:

$$
y = 2.
$$

Therefore, the maximum point of the function is again confirmed to be $ (1, 2) $.
