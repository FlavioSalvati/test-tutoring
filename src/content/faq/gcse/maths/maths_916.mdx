The graph of the function $ y = 3^x $ represents an exponential curve that increases rapidly as $ x $ takes on larger values.

To delve deeper, the graph of $ y = 3^x $ exemplifies the characteristics of an exponential function. One of the most notable features is that the curve intersects the point $ (0, 1) $; this occurs because any non-zero number raised to the power of $ 0 $ equals $ 1 $, as seen with $ 3^0 = 1 $.

As $ x $ increases, the value of $ y $ escalates sharply. For instance, when $ x = 1 $, $ y = 3 $; when $ x = 2 $, $ y = 9 $; and when $ x = 3 $, $ y = 27 $. This swift increase is a defining characteristic of exponential growth.

Conversely, as $ x $ becomes negative, the value of $ y $ approaches $ 0 $ but never actually reaches it. For example, at $ x = -1 $, $ y = \frac{1}{3} $; at $ x = -2 $, $ y = \frac{1}{9} $; and so forth. This behavior indicates that the graph gets ever closer to the x-axis without touching it, thereby establishing a horizontal asymptote at $ y = 0 $.

Moreover, the curve remains entirely above the x-axis, which signifies that $ y $ is always positive for all real values of $ x $. The graph is also continuous and smooth, lacking any breaks or sharp corners. Recognizing these features is essential for accurately sketching the graph and identifying similar exponential functions.
