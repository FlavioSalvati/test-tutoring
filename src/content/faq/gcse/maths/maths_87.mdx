To determine the lower bound of a measurement, you need to subtract half of the measurement's precision from the reported value.

When making a measurement, the precision is defined by the smallest unit that can be reliably measured. For instance, if you measure a length to the nearest centimeter, the precision is $1 \, \text{cm}$. To calculate the lower bound, it is essential to consider the potential error in your measurement, which is represented by half of the precision.

For example, if you have a measurement of $10 \, \text{cm}$, rounded to the nearest centimeter, the precision is $1 \, \text{cm}$. Consequently, half of this precision is $0.5 \, \text{cm}$. To find the lower bound, you subtract this half-precision from your measurement:

$$
10 \, \text{cm} - 0.5 \, \text{cm} = 9.5 \, \text{cm}.
$$

Thus, the lower bound for a measurement of $10 \, \text{cm}$, when rounded to the nearest centimeter, is $9.5 \, \text{cm}$.

This approach allows you to account for the smallest possible value that could have been rounded up to your specified measurement. It provides a useful framework for understanding the range within which the true value of your measurement is likely to fall. Always remember that the lower bound is calculated as the given measurement minus half of the precision, ensuring that you do not underestimate the potential range of your measurement.
