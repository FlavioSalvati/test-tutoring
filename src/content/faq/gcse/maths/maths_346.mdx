The order of rotational symmetry for a regular hexagon is $6$.

Rotational symmetry describes how many times a shape can align with itself during a full $360$-degree rotation. For a regular hexagon, which features six equal sides and angles, it can be rotated in increments of $60$ degrees (calculated as $360$ degrees divided by $6$) and still maintain its appearance.

To visualize this concept, consider placing a regular hexagon on a piece of paper and marking one of its vertices. When you rotate the hexagon by $60$ degrees, the marked vertex will shift to the position of the next vertex, and the hexagon will appear unchanged from its original orientation. This rotation can be repeated five additional times, with each rotation being another $60$ degrees, resulting in a total of six orientations in which the hexagon looks identical. Therefore, the order of rotational symmetry is $6$.

Understanding rotational symmetry is essential in geometry as it aids in comprehending the properties of shapes and their symmetries. Regular polygons, such as the hexagon, are frequently utilized in symmetry-related problems due to their equal sides and angles, which render them predictable and easier to analyze. Additionally, knowing the order of rotational symmetry has practical applications in various fields, including pattern design, tiling, and even the study of molecular structures in chemistry.
