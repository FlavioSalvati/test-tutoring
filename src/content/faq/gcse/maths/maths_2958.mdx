To calculate the probability of both events A and B occurring, denoted as $ P(A \text{ and } B) $, you can use the relationship between conditional probability and joint probability. Specifically, you can compute this using the formula:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)
$$

Here, $ P(A|B) $ represents the conditional probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred. 

For this example, we are provided with the following probabilities: $ P(A|B) = 0.4 $ and $ P(B) = 0.2 $. To find $ P(A \text{ and } B) $, you simply multiply these two probabilities together:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08
$$

This result indicates that there is an 8% chance that both events A and B will occur simultaneously.

This approach is particularly useful because it simplifies what might otherwise be a complex probability problem into more manageable parts. By understanding the relationship between conditional and joint probabilities, you can tackle a wide variety of probability questions with greater ease. Remember, the key is to accurately identify the given probabilities and apply the appropriate formula.
