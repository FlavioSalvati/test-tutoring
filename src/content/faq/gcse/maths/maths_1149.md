The angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle, measuring $90^\circ$.

In a semicircle, the diameter serves as the base of a triangle, while any point on the semicircle acts as the third vertex of that triangle. According to Thales' theorem, when you construct a triangle with one side as the diameter of a circle, the angle opposite to the diameter will invariably be a right angle, which is $90^\circ$. This occurs because the diameter subtends a right angle to any point along the semicircle.

To visualize this, consider a circle with a diameter labeled as $AB$. If you select any point $C$ on the semicircle and draw lines $AC$ and $BC$, you will form triangle $ABC$. By Thales' theorem, the angle $\angle ACB$ will always equal $90^\circ$. This characteristic is a fundamental property of circles and proves to be extremely useful in solving various geometric problems.

This property is particularly advantageous in GCSE Mathematics when addressing circle theorems and problems involving angles. Remembering that the angle in a semicircle is always a right angle can streamline many questions and assist you in quickly identifying key properties of the shapes involved.
