To calculate the percentage error, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{|\text{Experimental Value} - \text{True Value}|}{\text{True Value}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

Percentage error quantifies the accuracy of an experimental value in comparison to a true or accepted value. To compute it, you'll need both the experimental value (the result obtained from your experiment) and the true value (the generally accepted correct value).

Here’s a step-by-step guide to calculating percentage error:

1. **Subtract the True Value from the Experimental Value**: This calculation yields the error, which can be either positive or negative. For instance, if your experimental value is $105$ and the true value is $100$, the error is calculated as:
   $$
   \text{Error} = 105 - 100 = 5
   $$

2. **Take the Absolute Value of the Error**: The absolute value eliminates any negative sign, as percentage error is focused on the magnitude of the error rather than its direction. In this example, the absolute error is:
   $$
   |\text{Error}| = |5| = 5
   $$

3. **Divide the Absolute Error by the True Value**: This step normalizes the error relative to the true value. Using our example, we find:
   $$
   \text{Normalized Error} = \frac{5}{100} = 0.05
   $$

4. **Multiply by 100 to Convert to a Percentage**: To express the result as a percentage, multiply the normalized error by $100$:
   $$
   \text{Percentage Error} = 0.05 \times 100 = 5\%
   $$

Consequently, the percentage error in this case is $5\%$. This calculation provides insight into the significance of the error in relation to the true value, aiding in the assessment of the accuracy of your experimental results.
