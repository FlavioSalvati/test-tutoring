You can use the tangent ratio to determine an unknown side of a right-angled triangle by rearranging the tangent formula and solving for that unknown.

The tangent ratio is a fundamental trigonometric function that connects the angles of a right-angled triangle with the lengths of its sides. Specifically, the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

To find a missing side using the tangent ratio, first identify the angle and the relevant sides of the triangle. For instance, if you know the angle $\theta$ and the length of the adjacent side, but you need to calculate the length of the opposite side, you can rearrange the formula to isolate the opposite side:

$$
\text{opposite} = \tan(\theta) \times \text{adjacent}
$$

Conversely, if you have the angle $\theta$ and the length of the opposite side, and you want to find the length of the adjacent side, you can rearrange the formula as follows:

$$
\text{adjacent} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\tan(\theta)}
$$

For example, consider a right-angled triangle where the angle $\theta$ measures $30^\circ$ and the length of the adjacent side is $5 \, \text{cm}$. To find the length of the opposite side, you would perform the following calculation:

$$
\text{opposite} = \tan(30^\circ) \times 5
$$

Using a calculator, you can determine that $\tan(30^\circ) \approx 0.577$. Therefore, the calculation becomes:

$$
\text{opposite} = 0.577 \times 5 = 2.885 \, \text{cm}
$$

This method enables you to find the missing side of a right-angled triangle using the tangent ratio, as long as you know one side and the corresponding angle.
