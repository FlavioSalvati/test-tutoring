The probability of an event that has a chance of occurring of $ \frac{1}{4} $ can be expressed as $ 0.25 $ or $ 25\% $.

To clarify this concept further, letâ€™s break it down. Probability quantifies how likely an event is to occur. It can be represented in three forms: as a fraction, a decimal, or a percentage. When we say an event has a $ 1 $ in $ 4 $ chance, we mean that among $ 4 $ possible outcomes, $ 1 $ of them corresponds to the event of interest.

In fraction form, this probability is denoted as $ \frac{1}{4} $. To convert this fraction into a decimal, you divide the numerator ($ 1 $) by the denominator ($ 4 $), yielding $ 0.25 $. To express this decimal as a percentage, you multiply it by $ 100 $, resulting in $ 25\% $. Thus, the probability of the event occurring is either $ 0.25 $ or $ 25\% $.

This concept is foundational in the fields of probability and statistics, as it aids in predicting the likelihood of various events. For instance, if you have a bag containing $ 4 $ differently colored balls and you randomly select one, the probability of choosing a specific color is $ 1 $ in $ 4 $, or $ 25\% $. Grasping these basic principles will enable you to tackle more complex probability problems in the future.
