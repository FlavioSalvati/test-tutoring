A positive correlation on a scatter diagram is characterized by points that trend upwards from left to right.

To elaborate, a scatter diagram is a specific type of graph used to illustrate the relationship between two variables. Each point on the graph corresponds to a pair of values. When we refer to a positive correlation, we mean that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. This relationship is visually represented on the scatter diagram by points that create an upward-sloping pattern.

For example, consider a scenario where you plot the number of hours studied against the marks received in an exam. If students who study more hours generally achieve higher marks, the points on the scatter diagram will start from the bottom left (indicating low hours and low marks) and extend towards the top right (indicating high hours and high marks). This upward trend signifies a positive correlation.

The strength of the correlation can vary significantly. If the points closely align to form a straight line, the correlation is considered strong. Conversely, if the points are more dispersed yet still exhibit an upward trend, the correlation is weaker. Regardless of strength, the defining characteristic of a positive correlation is that the overall direction of the points moves upwards as you progress from left to right on the graph.
