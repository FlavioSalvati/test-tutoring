The factorized form of the expression $5m + 15$ is $5(m + 3)$.

To factor an expression such as $5m + 15$, you first need to identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms involved. In this instance, both $5m$ and $15$ share a common factor of $5$. This indicates that $5$ is the largest number that can evenly divide both terms.

Begin by expressing the original expression as a product of the GCF and another term. For $5m$, you can express it as $5 \cdot m$. Similarly, for $15$, you can write it as $5 \cdot 3$. Therefore, the expression $5m + 15$ can be rewritten as:

$$
5 \cdot m + 5 \cdot 3.
$$

Next, factor out the common factor of $5$ from both terms. This means you extract $5$ from the expression, which leaves you with:

$$
5(m + 3).
$$

This is the factorized form of the original expression.

Mastering the skill of factorization is essential in algebra, as it simplifies equations and can facilitate the process of solving them. By recognizing common factors, you can decompose complex expressions into more manageable parts, allowing you to identify patterns and relationships more clearly. Remember, practice is key to improvement, so consistently work on a variety of factorization problems to build your confidence and proficiency!
