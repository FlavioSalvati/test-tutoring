The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(C)
$$

To better understand this formula, let's analyze its components. In this equation, $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of two sides of the triangle, while $C$ is the angle formed between those two sides. The sine function, denoted as $\sin$, is a trigonometric function that relates an angle to the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle. However, it can also be applied to non-right triangles to determine their area.

Consider a triangle with sides $a$ and $b$, and with the angle $C$ between them. By using the formula $ \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(C) $, you are effectively calculating the area of a parallelogram that is formed by duplicating the triangle and then halving that area. This is based on the fact that a triangle can be viewed as half of a parallelogram.

For example, letâ€™s take a triangle with side lengths $a = 5$ cm and $b = 7$ cm, and an angle $C = 30^\circ$ between them. To find the area, follow these steps:

1. Calculate $\sin(30^\circ)$, which equals $0.5$.
2. Substitute the values into the area formula:
$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 7 \times 0.5.
$$
3. Simplifying this gives:
$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 35 \times 0.5 = 8.75 \text{ square centimeters}.
$$

This method is particularly useful when the height of the triangle is unknown, but you do have the lengths of two sides and the included angle. It is a valuable tool to have in your GCSE Maths toolkit!
