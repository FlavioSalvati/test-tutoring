To solve the equation 

$$ 
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{x}{20}, 
$$ 

we will use the technique of cross-multiplication.

Cross-multiplication involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction, and then setting the two products equal to each other. In this case, we multiply $ 4 $ by $ 20 $ and $ 5 $ by $ x $. This results in the equation:

$$ 
4 \times 20 = 5 \times x. 
$$

Next, we simplify the multiplication on both sides. Calculating $ 4 \times 20 $ gives us $ 80 $, so the equation can be rewritten as:

$$ 
80 = 5x. 
$$

To isolate $ x $, we divide both sides of the equation by $ 5 $:

$$ 
x = \frac{80}{5}. 
$$

Now, we perform the division:

$$ 
\frac{80}{5} = 16. 
$$

Thus, we find that 

$$ 
x = 16. 
$$

In conclusion, by applying cross-multiplication and solving the resulting equation, we determine that $ x $ is $ 16 $. This method is particularly useful for solving equations that involve two fractions set equal to each other and is an essential skill in GCSE Mathematics.
