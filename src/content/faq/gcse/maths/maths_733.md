To round the number $67.89$ to the nearest whole number, we find that it becomes $68$.

When rounding to the nearest whole number, we focus on the digit in the tenths place, which is the first digit to the right of the decimal point. In the case of the number $67.89$, the tenths place contains the digit $8$. According to standard rounding rules, if this digit is $5$ or greater, we round the whole number part up by one. Conversely, if the digit is less than $5$, we retain the whole number part as it is.

Since the digit in the tenths place is $8$, which exceeds $5$, we round the whole number part, which is $67$, up by one. Consequently, $67$ rounds to $68$ when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Rounding is an essential skill in mathematics, as it simplifies numbers, making them easier to manipulate, particularly in mental calculations or estimations. Understanding the rules of rounding is crucial for ensuring accuracy in your calculations. Always check the digit immediately to the right of the place value you are rounding to, and apply the rounding rule appropriately.
