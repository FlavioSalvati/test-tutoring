To find the derivative of the function $ y = \frac{2}{x} $, we first rewrite it in a more convenient form for differentiation. Specifically, we can express $ \frac{2}{x} $ as $ 2x^{-1} $. This transformation is based on the fact that dividing by $ x $ is equivalent to multiplying by $ x $ raised to the power of $ -1 $.

Next, we apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if you have a function of the form $ ax^n $, where $ a $ is a constant and $ n $ is a real number, the derivative is given by $ anx^{n-1} $. In our case, we have $ a = 2 $ and $ n = -1 $.

Using the power rule, we differentiate as follows:
$$ 
\frac{d}{dx}(2x^{-1}) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot x^{-1-1} 
$$
$$ 
= -2x^{-2} 
$$

Now, we can rewrite $ -2x^{-2} $ in a more familiar form:
$$ 
-2x^{-2} = -\frac{2}{x^2} 
$$

Therefore, the derivative of the function $ y = \frac{2}{x} $ is 
$$ 
y' = -\frac{2}{x^2}. 
$$

This result indicates that for any value of $ x $, the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ is given by $ -\frac{2}{x^2} $. The negative sign signifies that as $ x $ increases, $ y $ decreases. Additionally, the rate at which $ y $ changes is inversely proportional to the square of $ x $, meaning that the impact of $ x $ on the rate of change diminishes as $ x $ becomes larger.
