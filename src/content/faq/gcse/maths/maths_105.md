To calculate the percentage decrease, follow these steps: subtract the new value from the original value, divide the result by the original value, and then multiply by 100.

Letâ€™s break this down step-by-step. Suppose you have an original value and a new value, and you want to determine the percentage decrease.

1. **Calculate the Decrease**: First, subtract the new value from the original value. This will give you the amount of decrease. For instance, if the original value is $50$ and the new value is $30$, the decrease is calculated as:
   $$
   50 - 30 = 20
   $$

2. **Divide by the Original Value**: Next, take the decrease you calculated in the previous step and divide it by the original value. Using our example, you would perform the following calculation:
   $$
   \frac{20}{50} = 0.4
   $$

3. **Convert to a Percentage**: Finally, to express this decimal as a percentage, multiply it by $100$. Thus, we have:
   $$
   0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
   $$
   Therefore, the percentage decrease from $50$ to $30$ is $40\%$.

In formulaic terms, the calculation can be represented as:
$$ 
\text{Percentage Decrease} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Value} - \text{New Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \times 100 
$$

This method is applicable to any values you have. Just remember the sequence: subtract, divide, and then multiply by $100$. This straightforward approach is particularly useful for quickly assessing how much a value has decreased in relative terms, which can be beneficial in various real-life scenarios, such as analyzing sales declines or understanding discounts.
