A surd is defined as an irrational number that cannot be simplified to eliminate a root, such as a square root or cube root.

To recognize a surd, it is essential to first understand the characteristics of irrational numbers. An irrational number cannot be expressed as a simple fraction, which means it has a decimal expansion that is non-repeating and non-terminating. Common examples of irrational numbers include the square root of $2$, denoted as $\sqrt{2}$, and the cube root of $5$, represented as $\sqrt[3]{5}$. These numbers cannot be simplified into integers or fractions.

When you encounter a number under a root symbol, the first step is to check if it can be simplified. For example, $\sqrt{4}$ simplifies to $2$, which is a rational number; thus, it is not classified as a surd. Conversely, $\sqrt{3}$ cannot be simplified further and remains an irrational number, making it a surd.

In mathematical contexts, surds are often presented in their simplest form. For instance, $\sqrt{12}$ can be simplified to $2\sqrt{3}$ since $12$ can be expressed as $4 \times 3$, and the square root of $4$ is $2$. The simplified expression $2\sqrt{3}$ still qualifies as a surd because $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

Recognizing surds is vital for various mathematical operations, including simplifying expressions, solving equations, and rationalizing denominators. By practicing these skills, you will become more adept at identifying and manipulating surds across different mathematical contexts.
