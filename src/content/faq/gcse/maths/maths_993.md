To calculate the distance between the points $(2, 3)$ and $(6, 7)$, we will utilize the distance formula given by:

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

This formula is fundamentally based on the Pythagorean theorem, which allows us to determine the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. In our scenario, the points $(2, 3)$ and $(6, 7)$ can be visualized as the endpoints of the hypotenuse.

To begin, we identify the coordinates of the two points: let $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (6, 7)$. We can now substitute these values into the distance formula:

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

Substituting the coordinates yields:

$$
d = \sqrt{(6 - 2)^2 + (7 - 3)^2}
$$

Calculating the differences, we have:

$$
d = \sqrt{(4)^2 + (4)^2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
d = \sqrt{16 + 16}
$$

Which further simplifies to:

$$
d = \sqrt{32}
$$

Finally, we can express $\sqrt{32}$ in a more simplified form:

$$
d = 4\sqrt{2}
$$

Thus, the distance between the points $(2, 3)$ and $(6, 7)$ is $4\sqrt{2}$ units. This method provides a reliable way to compute the straight-line distance between any two points on a coordinate plane.
