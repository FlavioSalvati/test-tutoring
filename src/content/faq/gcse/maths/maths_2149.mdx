To represent the inequality $ x > 3 $ on a number line, follow these steps for clarity:

1. **Draw the Number Line**: Start by sketching a horizontal line to serve as your number line.

2. **Mark the Point**: Identify and mark the point corresponding to $ 3 $ on this line.

3. **Use an Open Circle**: Since the inequality is $ x > 3 $ and not $ x \geq 3 $, place an open circle at the point $ 3 $. The open circle signifies that the number $ 3 $ itself is not included in the solution set.

4. **Shade the Appropriate Section**: Next, shade the portion of the number line that extends to the right of the open circle. This shading indicates that all numbers greater than $ 3 $ are part of the solution set. Ensure that the shading continues indefinitely to the right, reflecting the absence of an upper limit for the values that $ x $ can assume.

5. **Importance of the Open Circle**: It's essential to include the open circle, as it visually conveys that $ 3 $ is excluded from the solution. If the inequality were $ x \geq 3 $, a closed circle would be used instead to indicate that $ 3 $ is part of the solution set.

By following these steps, you can effectively and accurately illustrate the inequality $ x > 3 $ on a number line, making it clear which values of $ x $ satisfy the condition.
