To determine the equation of the line that is perpendicular to the line given by $y = 3x + 2$ and passes through the point $(1, 4)$, we will first identify the slope of the original line and then use the concept of the negative reciprocal.

The slope of the line $y = 3x + 2$ is $3$. For a line to be perpendicular to another, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of the original slope. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line is 

$$
-\frac{1}{3}.
$$

Next, we will apply the point-slope form of a line equation, which is given by 

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),
$$ 

where $m$ represents the slope, and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. In this case, we have $m = -\frac{1}{3}$ and the point $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 4)$.

Substituting these values into the point-slope formula, we have:

$$
y - 4 = -\frac{1}{3}(x - 1).
$$

We will now simplify this equation:

1. Distribute the slope on the right-hand side:

$$
y - 4 = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}.
$$

2. Add $4$ to both sides to rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form ($y = mx + c$):

$$
y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} + 4.
$$

3. To combine the constants, we convert $4$ into a fraction with a denominator of $3$:

$$
4 = \frac{12}{3}.
$$

Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{12}{3}.
$$

4. Combine the constant terms:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{13}{3}.
$$

Therefore, the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $y = 3x + 2$ and passes through the point $(1, 4)$ is 

$$
y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{13}{3}.
$$
