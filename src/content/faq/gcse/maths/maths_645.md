The complement of a set consists of all elements that are not included in that set but are part of the universal set.

In set theory, the complement of a set $A$, typically denoted as $A'$ or $A^c$, contains all elements that are not in $A$ but belong to the universal set $U$. The universal set $U$ encompasses all objects or elements relevant to the context of a particular problem.

For instance, consider the universal set $U$, which consists of all natural numbers from $1$ to $10$:

$$
U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}
$$

If we define set $A$ as 

$$
A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\},
$$

then the complement of $A$, denoted as $A'$, would be 

$$
A' = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}.
$$ 

These elements represent those in $U$ that are not included in $A$.

To determine the complement of a set, one simply needs to list all the elements of the universal set that are not present in the specified set. This concept is particularly valuable in various fields of mathematics, including probability theory, where it assists in calculating the likelihood of events not occurring. For example, if the probability of a certain event happening is known, the probability of that event not happening can be derived from its complement.

Grasping the concept of a set's complement is fundamental within set theory and is instrumental in solving problems that involve unions, intersections, and differences between sets. Additionally, it facilitates the visualization of sets through Venn diagrams, where the complement of a set is represented by the area outside the set but within the universal set.
