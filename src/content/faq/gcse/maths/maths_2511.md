To create a scale drawing of a room, follow these steps: measure the room, select a scale, and accurately draw the layout.

First, use a tape measure to determine the dimensions of the room. Record the length and width of each wall, as well as the positions and sizes of any doors, windows, and built-in furniture. It is essential to note these measurements precisely, as they will be vital for creating an accurate scale drawing.

Next, choose an appropriate scale for your drawing. A common scale for room drawings is $1:50$, which means that $1$ centimeter on the drawing represents $50$ centimeters in the actual room. This scale is advantageous because it allows you to fit the entire room onto a standard sheet of paper while still providing sufficient detail.

Now, begin the drawing process by outlining the room on graph paper or plain paper with a ruler. Convert the real measurements to your selected scale. For instance, if a wall measures $400$ cm in length and you are using a $1:50$ scale, the length of the wall on your drawing will be $8$ cm, calculated as follows:

$$
400 \, \text{cm} \div 50 = 8 \, \text{cm}.
$$

Draw each wall according to the scale, ensuring that the angles between the walls are accurate.

After completing the outline of the room, add the locations of doors, windows, and other features. Convert their actual measurements to the scale and accurately place them on your drawing. If necessary, use a protractor to ensure that angles are correct.

Finally, label your drawing with the scale used and any important measurements. This will assist anyone interpreting the drawing in understanding the dimensions and layout of the room with clarity.
