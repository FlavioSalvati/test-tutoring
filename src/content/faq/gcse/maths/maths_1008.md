The slope of the line is $-1$, and the y-intercept is $3$.

To determine the slope and y-intercept of the equation 

$$ 
y = -x + 3, 
$$ 

we need to recognize that this equation is expressed in slope-intercept form, which is 

$$ 
y = mx + c. 
$$ 

In this format, $m$ represents the slope, and $c$ represents the y-intercept.

Examining the given equation $y = -x + 3$, we can observe that the coefficient of $x$ is $-1$. Therefore, the slope $m$ is $-1$. This indicates that the line descends as it moves from left to right, meaning that for each unit increase in $x$, the value of $y$ decreases by $1$. This results in a line that slopes downward.

The constant term in the equation is $3$, which represents the y-intercept $c$. The y-intercept is the point where the line intersects the y-axis. In this instance, when $x = 0$, the value of $y$ is $3$. Thus, the line crosses the y-axis at the point $(0, 3)$.

Understanding these elements is crucial for graphing the line and analyzing its characteristics. The slope provides insight into the angle of the line, while the y-intercept offers a starting point on the graph. This knowledge simplifies the process of visualizing and working with linear equations in various mathematical contexts.
