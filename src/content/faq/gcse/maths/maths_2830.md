When a shape is enlarged by a scale factor of $0.25$, its size is reduced to one-quarter of the original dimensions.

Specifically, enlarging a shape by a scale factor of $0.25$ means that each dimension of the shape is multiplied by $0.25$. Consequently, the resulting shape will be smaller than the original. For instance, consider a square with a side length of $4 \, \text{cm}$. When you apply a scale factor of $0.25$, the new square will have a side length of $1 \, \text{cm}$, calculated as follows:

$$
4 \, \text{cm} \times 0.25 = 1 \, \text{cm}.
$$

The impact on area is even more significant. The area of a shape is proportional to the square of its dimensions. Therefore, when each dimension is reduced by a factor of $0.25$, the area is reduced by a factor of $0.25^2$, which equals $0.0625$. This means the new area will be just $6.25\%$ of the original area. For example, if the original square has an area of $16 \, \text{cm}^2$ (since $4 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} = 16 \, \text{cm}^2$), the area of the new square will be:

$$
1 \, \text{cm}^2 = 1 \, \text{cm} \times 1 \, \text{cm}.
$$

This principle applies universally to all geometric shapes, not just squares. Whether you are working with triangles, circles, or any other figure, applying a scale factor of $0.25$ will reduce all linear dimensions to one-quarter of their original lengths, and the area will be reduced to one-sixteenth of the original area. Understanding this fundamental concept in geometry is essential for grasping how shapes transform under scaling operations.
