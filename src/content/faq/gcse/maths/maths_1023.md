To derive the equation of a line that is perpendicular to $ y = x + 1 $, we start by determining the slope of the original line. The equation $ y = x + 1 $ can be expressed in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope. Here, it is clear that the slope $ m $ is equal to $1$.

For a line to be perpendicular to another, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of the original slope. The negative reciprocal of $1$ is $-1$. Thus, the slope of the perpendicular line will be $-1$.

Next, we utilize the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is given by:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

In this formula, $ m $ is the slope, and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. If a specific point is not provided, we can use a general point $(x_1, y_1)$.

For instance, if we want the perpendicular line to pass through the point $ (2, 3) $, we substitute $ m = -1 $, $ x_1 = 2 $, and $ y_1 = 3 $ into the point-slope form:

$$
y - 3 = -1(x - 2)
$$

Now, we simplify this equation:

$$
y - 3 = -x + 2
$$
$$
y = -x + 5
$$

Consequently, the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = x + 1 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 3) $ is 

$$
y = -x + 5.
$$

If no specific point is provided, the general form of the equation for the perpendicular line can be expressed as 

$$
y = -x + c,
$$ 

where $ c $ represents the y-intercept.
