To calculate the area of a circle with a diameter of $12 \, \text{cm}$, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is given by 

$$ A = \pi r^2. $$

Let's break down this formula and the steps involved in the calculation. In this equation, $A$ represents the area of the circle, $\pi$ (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $3.14159$, and $r$ is the radius of the circle. 

Since the radius is half of the diameter, for a circle with a diameter of $12 \, \text{cm}$, we can determine the radius as follows:

$$ r = \frac{12 \, \text{cm}}{2} = 6 \, \text{cm}. $$

Now, we can substitute the radius into the area formula. This gives us:

$$ A = \pi (6 \, \text{cm})^2. $$

Next, we need to calculate the square of the radius. Squaring $6 \, \text{cm}$ yields:

$$ (6 \, \text{cm})^2 = 36 \, \text{cm}^2. $$

Now, we can multiply this result by $\pi$. Thus, we have:

$$ A = \pi \times 36 \, \text{cm}^2. $$

Using the approximate value of $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we can compute the area:

$$ A \approx 3.14159 \times 36 \, \text{cm}^2. $$

Performing the multiplication gives us:

$$ 3.14159 \times 36 \approx 113.09724 \, \text{cm}^2. $$

Therefore, the area of the circle is approximately 

$$ A \approx 113.1 \, \text{cm}^2 $$ 

when rounded to one decimal place. This method allows you to accurately calculate the area of any circle when you know its diameter.
