A histogram featuring a long right tail signifies a positively skewed distribution, in which the majority of data points are concentrated on the left side of the scale.

In a positively skewed distribution, most data values are grouped towards the lower end of the range, while a smaller number of values extend toward the higher end. This characteristic results in a "tail" that stretches out to the right. For instance, consider the distribution of exam scores in a classroom. A positively skewed histogram in this context would reveal that most students received relatively low scores, with only a few students achieving very high marks.

Such distributions are frequently encountered in real-world data. A prime example is income levels within a population, which often exhibit positive skewness. In these cases, the majority of individuals earn moderate salaries, while a small number enjoy exceptionally high incomes. When observing a histogram with an extended right tail, it indicates the presence of outliers or extreme values on the higher end of the dataset.

Grasping the shape of a distribution is essential for data analysis, as it can significantly impact measures of central tendency, such as the mean and median. In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median due to the influence of higher values, which pull the mean towards the right. This understanding can yield valuable insights into the nature of the data and facilitate informed decision-making based on the analysis.
