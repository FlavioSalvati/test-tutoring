To effectively use a tree diagram for dependent events, you should multiply the probabilities along each branch while adjusting for the changing conditions that arise from prior outcomes.

A tree diagram serves as a visual representation that allows you to outline all possible outcomes of a sequence of events, particularly when those events are interdependent. Dependent events are defined as situations where the outcome of one event influences the probability of subsequent events.

Begin by sketching a branch for each possible outcome of the first event, ensuring to label the probability of each outcome along its corresponding branch. For instance, when drawing a card from a standard deck, the probability of drawing an Ace is given by $\frac{4}{52}$, while the probability of not drawing an Ace is $\frac{48}{52}$.

Next, from each of these branches, extend branches for the potential outcomes of the second event. Since the events are dependent, it is essential to modify the probabilities based on the result of the first event. For example, if you initially drew an Ace, only $51$ cards remain, and now there are only $3$ Aces left. Consequently, the probability of drawing another Ace in this scenario would be $\frac{3}{51}$.

Continue this process for any additional events, consistently adjusting the probabilities to reflect the results of prior events. To determine the probability of a specific sequence of events, multiply the probabilities along the branches corresponding to that sequence. For example, the probability of drawing two Aces consecutively would be calculated as:

$$
\frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51}
$$

By utilizing a tree diagram, you can clearly visualize how probabilities evolve with each event and accurately compute the overall probability of a sequence of dependent events.
