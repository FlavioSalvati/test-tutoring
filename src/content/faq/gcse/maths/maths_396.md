To determine the diameter of a circle given its area, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{diameter} = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{\text{area}}{\pi}}.
$$

First, let's recall that the area of a circle is expressed by the formula:

$$
A = \pi r^2,
$$

where $A$ represents the area and $r$ is the radius. To derive the radius from the area, we need to rearrange this equation. Start by dividing both sides by $\pi$:

$$
r^2 = \frac{A}{\pi}.
$$

Next, take the square root of both sides to solve for $r$:

$$
r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}.
$$

Now that we have the radius, calculating the diameter is a simple step. The diameter of a circle is defined as twice the radius, which spans the entire width of the circle while passing through its center. Therefore, we multiply the radius by $2$, resulting in the formula:

$$
\text{diameter} = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}.
$$

For example, if the area of a circle is $50$ square centimeters, you would first calculate the radius using the formula:

$$
r = \sqrt{\frac{50}{\pi}}.
$$

Using a calculator, you find that:

$$
r \approx 3.99 \text{ cm}.
$$

Next, to find the diameter, multiply the radius by $2$:

$$
\text{diameter} \approx 2 \times 3.99 \approx 7.98 \text{ cm}.
$$

This method allows you to accurately calculate the diameter from any given area by applying basic algebra and understanding the properties of circles.
