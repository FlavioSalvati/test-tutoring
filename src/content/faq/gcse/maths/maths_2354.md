The coordinates of the y-intercept in the equation $ y = -2x + 7 $ are given by the point $ (0, 7) $.

In a linear equation of the form $ y = mx + c $, the y-intercept is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis. This intersection occurs when $ x = 0 $. To determine the y-intercept, we substitute $ x = 0 $ into the equation and solve for $ y $.

For the equation $ y = -2x + 7 $, substituting $ x = 0 $ yields:
$$
y = -2(0) + 7 \\
y = 7
$$

Consequently, the y-intercept is the point where $ x = 0 $ and $ y = 7 $, which can be expressed as the coordinates $ (0, 7) $.

Understanding the y-intercept is vital, as it serves as a foundational point for graphing the line. It indicates the location where the line crosses the y-axis, facilitating accurate plotting of the graph. In this instance, the line intersects the y-axis at the point $ (0, 7) $. This implies that regardless of the value of $ x $, when $ x = 0 $, the value of $ y $ will consistently be $ 7 $.

Furthermore, the slope of the line, represented by $ m $ in the equation $ y = mx + c $, indicates the steepness of the line. In this scenario, $ m = -2 $, signifying that the line descends from left to right. By combining this information about the slope with the y-intercept, you can accurately sketch the line on a graph.
