The length of the hypotenuse is $25 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, we can apply Pythagoras' theorem. This theorem asserts that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$

Here, $ c $ represents the length of the hypotenuse, while $ a $ and $ b $ denote the lengths of the other two sides.

In our specific case, the lengths of the legs of the triangle are $7 \, \text{cm}$ and $24 \, \text{cm}$. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

$$ c^2 = 7^2 + 24^2 $$

Calculating the squares, we find:

$$ c^2 = 49 + 576 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ c^2 = 625 $$

To find $ c $, we take the square root of $625$:

$$ c = \sqrt{625} $$

Thus, we arrive at:

$$ c = 25 $$

Consequently, the length of the hypotenuse is $25 \, \text{cm}$. This method is an essential aspect of GCSE Maths and proves to be very useful for solving problems related to right-angled triangles. Always remember to confirm that your triangle is indeed right-angled before applying Pythagoras' theorem.
