The scale factor in a drawing with a ratio of 1:100 is expressed as $\frac{1}{100}$ or $0.01$.

In a 1:100 scale drawing, each unit of measurement on the drawing corresponds to 100 units of the same measurement in reality. For instance, if a drawing indicates a length of $1$ centimetre, this would represent $100$ centimetres, which is equivalent to $1$ metre in real life. This type of scale is commonly employed in architectural plans and maps to depict large structures or areas on a more manageable size of paper.

To illustrate how to utilize this scale factor, consider a drawing of a building. If a wall is represented as $2$ centimetres long on the drawing, you would calculate the actual length of the wall by multiplying this length by the scale factor of $100$. Thus, the real-life length of the wall would be $200$ centimetres, or $2$ metres. Conversely, if you have a real-life measurement and want to determine how it would appear on the drawing, you would divide the actual measurement by the scale factor. For example, a $300$-metre long road would be depicted as $3$ centimetres on the drawing, calculated as $300 \div 100 = 3$.

Using scale factors is essential for accurately representing large objects in a smaller format, facilitating easier visualization and manipulation. It is crucial to always verify the scale of a drawing before making any measurements or assumptions, as different drawings may utilize different scales.
