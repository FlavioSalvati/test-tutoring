To determine the value of $ f(2) $ for the function $ f(x) = 3x + 1 $, we will substitute $ 2 $ for $ x $ in the equation.

Let's examine this step-by-step. The function $ f(x) = 3x + 1 $ is a linear function where $ x $ represents the input variable. To find the value of the function at a specific point, we need to replace $ x $ with that value. In this instance, we are interested in finding $ f(2) $.

First, we write down the function:

$$
f(x) = 3x + 1.
$$

Next, we substitute $ 2 $ for $ x $:

$$
f(2) = 3(2) + 1.
$$

Now, we perform the multiplication:

$$
3 \times 2 = 6.
$$

Thus, the equation now becomes:

$$
f(2) = 6 + 1.
$$

Finally, we add $ 1 $ to $ 6 $:

$$
6 + 1 = 7.
$$

Therefore, we conclude that $ f(2) = 7 $.

This process of substitution and simplification is a fundamental skill in algebra. It enables you to evaluate functions at specific points, which is essential in various fields of mathematics and science. Remember, the key steps are to substitute the given value into the function and then simplify the resulting expression.
