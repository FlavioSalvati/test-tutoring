The tangent of a $60^\circ$ angle is given by $\sqrt{3}$.

In trigonometry, the tangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. For a $60^\circ$ angle, this ratio equals $\sqrt{3}$. This value arises from the properties of an equilateral triangle, where all angles measure $60^\circ$. When an equilateral triangle is divided into two right-angled triangles, the lengths of the sides adhere to a specific ratio.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, consider an equilateral triangle with each side measuring $2$ units. By drawing a height from one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, you create two right-angled triangles. Each of these right-angled triangles has angles of $30^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. In this configuration, the side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle (the height) measures $\sqrt{3}$ units, while the side adjacent to the $60^\circ$ angle (half of the base) measures $1$ unit. Consequently, the tangent of $60^\circ$, which is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, is $\sqrt{3}$:

$$
\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3}.
$$

This value plays a significant role in various mathematical applications, including solving problems involving right-angled triangles and working with trigonometric functions. Memorizing that $\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}$ can significantly expedite solving many trigonometric problems without the need for a calculator.
