To determine the midpoint of a line segment, we calculate the averages of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the endpoints.

Given the points $(2, 4)$ and $(6, 8)$, we can begin by finding the average of the x-coordinates. The x-coordinates in this case are $2$ and $6$. To compute the average, we add these two values together and then divide by $2$:

$$
\text{Average of x-coordinates} = \frac{2 + 6}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

Next, we proceed to find the average of the y-coordinates. The y-coordinates are $4$ and $8$. We follow the same procedure: add the y-coordinates and divide the sum by $2$:

$$
\text{Average of y-coordinates} = \frac{4 + 8}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
$$

Thus, the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(2, 4)$ and $(6, 8)$ is $(4, 6)$. This indicates that if you were to draw a line segment between these two points, the point $(4, 6)$ would lie exactly at the halfway mark along the line. This method is applicable for any pair of points in a coordinate plane and serves as a valuable tool in geometry for identifying the center point of a line segment.
