To effectively compare two histograms that have different class widths, it is essential to utilize frequency density rather than raw frequency.

When dealing with histograms of varying class widths, employing frequency density ensures a fair and accurate comparison. Frequency density is determined by dividing the frequency of each class by its corresponding width. This approach standardizes the data, allowing for a more precise analysis of the shapes and distributions of the histograms.

The formula for calculating frequency density is as follows:

$$
\text{Frequency Density} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Class Width}}.
$$

For instance, if a particular class has a frequency of $10$ and a width of $2$, the frequency density for that class would be calculated as:

$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5.
$$

You should perform this calculation for each class in both histograms.

After determining the frequency densities, you can plot these values on the y-axis of your histograms, while the class intervals are represented on the x-axis. This method ensures that the area of each bar corresponds to the frequency, facilitating a more straightforward comparison of the distributions, even when the class widths are not uniform.

Using frequency density allows you to analyze the overall shape, spread, and central tendency of the data represented in each histogram. This methodology aids in identifying patterns, such as which dataset exhibits greater variability or which one is more skewed, without being misled by the differences in class widths.
