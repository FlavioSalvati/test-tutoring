To calculate the area of a triangle with sides measuring $5 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $9 \, \text{cm}$, we can employ Heron's formula.

First, we need to determine the semi-perimeter of the triangle. The semi-perimeter, denoted as $s$, is defined as half the sum of the lengths of the sides. For a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, the semi-perimeter is calculated using the formula:

$$ 
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} 
$$

For our triangle with sides $5 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $9 \, \text{cm}$, we can compute the semi-perimeter as follows:

$$ 
s = \frac{5 + 7 + 9}{2} = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5 \, \text{cm} 
$$

Next, we apply Heron's formula to find the area $A$ of the triangle:

$$ 
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} 
$$

We now substitute the values of $s$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula:

$$ 
A = \sqrt{10.5 \times (10.5 - 5) \times (10.5 - 7) \times (10.5 - 9)} 
$$

This simplifies to:

$$ 
A = \sqrt{10.5 \times 5.5 \times 3.5 \times 1.5} 
$$

Next, we will calculate the product inside the square root step by step:

1. First, calculate $10.5 \times 5.5$:

$$ 
10.5 \times 5.5 = 57.75 
$$

2. Then, multiply the result by $3.5$:

$$ 
57.75 \times 3.5 = 202.125 
$$

3. Finally, multiply that result by $1.5$:

$$ 
202.125 \times 1.5 = 303.1875 
$$

Now that we have the product, we can find the area by taking the square root of $303.1875$:

$$ 
A = \sqrt{303.1875} \approx 17.42 \, \text{cm}^2 
$$

Therefore, the area of the triangle with sides $5 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $9 \, \text{cm}$ is approximately $17.42 \, \text{cm}^2$.
