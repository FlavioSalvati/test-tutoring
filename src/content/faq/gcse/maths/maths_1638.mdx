To effectively create a scatter diagram, you will need to plot data points by marking each pair of values on a graph with an x-axis and a y-axis.

Begin by drawing two perpendicular lines on your graph paper or software. Label the horizontal line as the x-axis and the vertical line as the y-axis. It is important to clearly mark these axes with appropriate scales that accommodate the range of your data. For instance, if your x-values range from $1$ to $10$, ensure that your x-axis is numbered accordingly.

Next, take each pair of data points from your dataset. Each pair consists of an x-value and a y-value. Start by locating the position on the x-axis that corresponds to the x-value of your pair. Then, find the position on the y-axis that corresponds to the y-value. The intersection of these two positions on the graph is where you will place a dot or a small cross, which represents a single data point.

Continue this process for all pairs of data points in your dataset. It is crucial to plot each point accurately to accurately reflect the relationship between the x-values and y-values. When plotted correctly, the scatter diagram will display a collection of points that may reveal a pattern or trend, such as a positive correlation, negative correlation, or no correlation at all.

Additionally, remember to label your axes with the specific variables they represent, and include units of measurement if applicable. Adding a title to your scatter diagram can further clarify what the data signifies.
