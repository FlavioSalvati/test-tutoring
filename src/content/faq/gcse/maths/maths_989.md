The gradient of the line that passes through the points $(2, 4)$ and $(5, 8)$ is given by $\frac{4}{3}$.

To determine the gradient of a line, we utilize the formula:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}.
$$

This formula calculates the rate of change of the $y$-coordinate with respect to the $x$-coordinate. In this scenario, we are working with the two points: $(2, 4)$ and $(5, 8)$.

First, we identify the coordinates of these points. For the point $(2, 4)$, the $x$-coordinate is $2$, and the $y$-coordinate is $4$. For the point $(5, 8)$, the $x$-coordinate is $5$, and the $y$-coordinate is $8$.

Next, we calculate the change in $y$ (denoted as $\Delta y$) and the change in $x$ (denoted as $\Delta x$). The change in $y$ is determined by subtracting the $y$-coordinate of the first point from the $y$-coordinate of the second point:

$$
\Delta y = 8 - 4 = 4.
$$

Similarly, the change in $x$ is calculated by subtracting the $x$-coordinate of the first point from the $x$-coordinate of the second point:

$$
\Delta x = 5 - 2 = 3.
$$

Now, we can substitute these values into the gradient formula:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{4}{3}.
$$

Thus, the gradient of the line that passes through the points $(2, 4)$ and $(5, 8)$ is $\frac{4}{3}$.

Understanding the gradient is essential, as it indicates the steepness of the line. A positive gradient signifies that the line slopes upwards, while a negative gradient indicates a downward slope. In this instance, a gradient of $\frac{4}{3}$ reflects a moderately steep upward incline.
