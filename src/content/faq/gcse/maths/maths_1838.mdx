To simplify the expression $x^2 \times x^3$, we can add the exponents, resulting in $x^{2+3} = x^5$.

When multiplying two expressions that share the same base, we can simplify the overall expression by combining the exponents. This process is based on the laws of indices (or exponents). Here, the base is $x$, while the exponents are $2$ and $3$.

Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the Base**: Both terms share the same base, which is $x$.
2. **Identify the Exponents**: The first term, $x^2$, has an exponent of $2$, and the second term, $x^3$, has an exponent of $3$.
3. **Apply the Multiplication Rule**: When multiplying powers with the same base, we add the exponents. Therefore, $x^2 \times x^3$ simplifies to $x^{2+3}$.
4. **Simplify the Exponent**: Now, we can add the exponents together: $2 + 3 = 5$.
5. **Write the Simplified Expression**: Thus, we conclude that $x^{2+3} = x^5$.

In summary, $x^2 \times x^3$ simplifies to $x^5$. This rule is extremely useful and can be applied to any similar problems involving the multiplication of powers with the same base. It is important to remember that this method only holds true when the bases are identical. If the bases differ, the exponents cannot be combined in this manner.
