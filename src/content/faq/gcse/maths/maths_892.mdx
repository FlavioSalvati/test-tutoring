To determine the $n$th term of the sequence $2, 5, 8, 11$, we can use the formula: 

$$ 
3n - 1. 
$$ 

This sequence is classified as an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a consistent difference. To find the $n$th term, we first need to establish the common difference. By subtracting the first term from the second term ($5 - 2$), we discover that the common difference is $3$. This indicates that each term is $3$ greater than the preceding term.

Next, we will express the $n$th term in terms of $n$. The general formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

$$ 
a + (n-1)d, 
$$ 

where $a$ represents the first term and $d$ denotes the common difference. In our sequence, we have $a = 2$ and $d = 3$.

Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$ 
\text{nth term} = 2 + (n-1) \times 3. 
$$ 

Now, we can simplify this expression:

$$ 
\text{nth term} = 2 + 3(n-1) 
$$ 
$$ 
= 2 + 3n - 3 
$$ 
$$ 
= 3n - 1. 
$$ 

Thus, the $n$th term of the sequence $2, 5, 8, 11$ can be expressed using the formula:

$$ 
3n - 1. 
$$ 

This formula enables you to calculate any term in the sequence by substituting the desired position number ($n$) into it. For instance, to find the 4th term, substitute $n = 4$ into the formula:

$$ 
3(4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11, 
$$ 

which confirms that the 4th term in the sequence is indeed $11$.
