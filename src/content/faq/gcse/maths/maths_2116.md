The value of $8^{2/3}$ is $4$.

To understand why $8^{2/3} = 4$, let's break it down step by step. The expression $8^{2/3}$ consists of both a power and a root. Specifically, the denominator of the fraction, $3$, indicates that we need to calculate the cube root, while the numerator, $2$, indicates that we should square the result. Therefore, we can rewrite $8^{2/3}$ as $(8^{1/3})^2$.

First, we need to determine the cube root of $8$. The cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, yields the original number. In this case, the cube root of $8$ is $2$, since:

$$ 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 $$

Thus, we conclude that $8^{1/3} = 2$.

Next, we take this result and square it. Squaring a number means multiplying it by itself, so we calculate:

$$ 2^2 = 2 \times 2 = 4 $$

Putting all of this together, we find:

$$ 8^{2/3} = (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 $$

In summary, the value of $8^{2/3}$ is $4$. This approach of decomposing the exponent into a root and a power is quite effective for solving similar problems involving fractional exponents.
