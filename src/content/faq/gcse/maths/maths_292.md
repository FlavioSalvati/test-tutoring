The slope of a line parallel to the equation $y = -4x + 3$ is $-4$.

To find the slope of a line that is parallel to a given line, you need to identify the coefficient of $x$ in the line's equation. The equation $y = -4x + 3$ is expressed in slope-intercept form, which is represented by $y = mx + c$, where $m$ denotes the slope and $c$ indicates the y-intercept. In this particular equation, the slope $m$ is $-4$.

Parallel lines share the same slope, which is why they never intersect and consistently maintain equal distance from one another. Consequently, any line that is parallel to $y = -4x + 3$ will also have a slope of $-4$. This implies that if you encounter another line with the equation $y = -4x + b$, where $b$ can be any real number, it will be parallel to the original line because the slope remains $-4$.

Grasping this concept is essential for solving problems involving parallel lines. For instance, if you are tasked with finding the equation of a line that is parallel to $y = -4x + 3$ and passes through a specific point, you would begin by using the slope $-4$. Then, you would apply the coordinates of the point to determine the y-intercept. This approach ensures that the new line retains the same slope as the original line, thereby confirming their parallelism.
