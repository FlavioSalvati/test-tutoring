To calculate the percentage change, follow these steps: subtract the old value from the new value, divide the result by the old value, and then multiply by $100$.

Let's break this down using the basic formula for percentage change:

$$
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
$$

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Identify the Values**: Begin by determining the old value and the new value. The old value represents the initial amount before any change occurs, while the new value reflects the amount after the change.

2. **Calculate the Difference**: Subtract the old value from the new value to find the difference. If the new value exceeds the old value, the difference will be positive, indicating an increase. Conversely, if the new value is less than the old value, the difference will be negative, signifying a decrease.

3. **Normalize the Difference**: Next, divide the difference by the old value. This step normalizes the change relative to the original amount, yielding a decimal that indicates the proportion of change compared to the old value.

4. **Convert to Percentage**: Finally, multiply the result by $100$ to convert the decimal into a percentage. This step expresses the change in a more comprehensible format, making it easier to interpret and compare.

### Example Calculation

Consider an example where the old value is $50$ and the new value is $75$. The calculation would proceed as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{75 - 50}{50} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{50} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
$$

This result indicates that there is a $50\%$ increase from the old value to the new value.
