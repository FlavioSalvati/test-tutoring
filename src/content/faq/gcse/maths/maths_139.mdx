To calculate the total cost of two items, each priced at £19.99, we can follow a straightforward mathematical procedure.

First, we note the cost of one item:

$$
\text{Cost of one item} = £19.99
$$

To find the total cost for two items, we multiply the cost of one item by the number of items:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = £19.99 \times 2
$$

Now, let's break this calculation down step-by-step:

1. Identify the cost of a single item: £19.99.
2. Multiply this amount by the number of items: 
   $$ 
   19.99 \times 2 
   $$
3. Perform the multiplication:
   $$ 
   19.99 \times 2 = 39.98 
   $$

Thus, the total cost for two items is:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = £39.98
$$

This method can be utilized for any quantity of items. For instance, if you wanted to find the total cost for three items, you would simply multiply £19.99 by 3, and continue this process for any number of items. Multiplication is a fundamental arithmetic operation that allows you to quickly determine the total cost when you know the price of a single item and the desired quantity.

When working with monetary values, it is crucial to maintain accuracy by paying attention to decimal places. In this example, the total cost of the two items is £39.98, which represents the sum of £19.99 for each item.
