To create a scale drawing of your garden, follow these steps: measure the garden's dimensions, select an appropriate scale, and draw the layout accurately.

First, use a tape measure to determine the dimensions of your garden. Record the length and width, along with any notable features such as flower beds, trees, or paths. Precise measurements are essential for an accurate scale drawing.

Next, choose a suitable scale for your drawing. The scale is a ratio that indicates the relationship between the measurements on your drawing and the actual dimensions. For example, a common scale is $1:100$, meaning that $1 \, \text{cm}$ on the drawing corresponds to $100 \, \text{cm}$ (or $1 \, \text{metre}$) in reality. The scale you select will depend on the size of your garden and the dimensions of the paper you are using.

Now, convert the real-life measurements to scale measurements. For instance, if your garden is $10 \, \text{metres}$ long and you are using a $1:100$ scale, the length on your drawing will be $10 \, \text{cm}$. Repeat this conversion for all the measurements you have recorded.

Using graph paper can enhance the accuracy of your drawing. Begin by outlining the garden according to the scale. Then, incorporate the features such as flower beds, trees, and paths, ensuring that each element is positioned correctly relative to your measurements and the chosen scale.

Finally, label your drawing with the scale used and identify any important features. This will facilitate easier understanding and usability for planning or presenting your garden design.
