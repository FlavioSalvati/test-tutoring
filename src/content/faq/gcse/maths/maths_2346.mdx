To graph the linear equation $ y = 6x - 7 $, follow these steps to find points:

1. **Select Values for $ x $**: Choose a range of values for $ x $. It is often convenient to use simple integers, such as $ -2, -1, 0, 1, $ and $ 2 $. 

2. **Calculate Corresponding $ y $ Values**: For each selected $ x $ value, substitute it into the equation to determine the corresponding $ y $ value.

   - For instance, when $ x = 0 $:
   $$
   y = 6(0) - 7 = -7
   $$
   This gives us the point $ (0, -7) $.

   - If we choose $ x = 1 $:
   $$
   y = 6(1) - 7 = -1
   $$
   Thus, we obtain the point $ (1, -1) $.

   - For $ x = -1 $:
   $$
   y = 6(-1) - 7 = -13
   $$
   This results in the point $ (-1, -13) $.

3. **Continue Calculating Points**: You can find additional points for a more comprehensive graph. For example:
   - For $ x = 2 $:
   $$
   y = 6(2) - 7 = 5
   $$
   Hence, the point is $ (2, 5) $.

   - For $ x = -2 $:
   $$
   y = 6(-2) - 7 = -19
   $$
   This yields the point $ (-2, -19) $.

4. **Plot the Points**: Once you have calculated several points, plot them on a coordinate grid. 

5. **Draw the Line**: Connect the plotted points with a straight line. The equation $ y = 6x - 7 $ describes a linear relationship, and the line you draw represents this equation. 

Remember, the more points you plot, the more accurate your graph will be. However, even a few points can provide a clear indication of the line's general direction and slope.
