The slope of a line that is parallel to the equation $ y = -2x + 5 $ is $ -2 $.

To find the slope of a line parallel to a given line, you should examine the coefficient of $ x $ in the equation of that line. The equation $ y = -2x + 5 $ is expressed in slope-intercept form, which is represented as $ y = mx + c $. In this format, $ m $ denotes the slope, and $ c $ indicates the y-intercept. Here, the slope $ m $ is $ -2 $.

When two lines are parallel, they possess identical slopes. Therefore, any line that is parallel to $ y = -2x + 5 $ will also have a slope of $ -2 $. While the y-intercept (the $ c $ value) can vary, the slope must remain consistent for the lines to be considered parallel.

For instance, consider the line described by the equation $ y = -2x + 3 $. This line is parallel to $ y = -2x + 5 $ because it shares the same slope of $ -2 $. Similarly, the equation $ y = -2x - 7 $ also represents a line parallel to the original line, as it too has the identical slope of $ -2 $.

Grasping the concept of slope is essential in GCSE Maths, as it enables you to analyze and compare various lines on a graph effectively. Remember, the fundamental criterion for identifying parallel lines is to verify that their slopes are the same.
