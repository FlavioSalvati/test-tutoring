To convert a length from a scale drawing to its corresponding real-world size, you need to multiply the length measured in the drawing by the scale factor.

When dealing with scale drawings, it is essential to grasp the concept of the scale factor. This factor is defined as the ratio of a length in the drawing to the equivalent length in real life. For example, a scale of $1:100$ means that $1$ unit of measurement in the drawing represents $100$ units in reality.

To determine the real-world length from a drawing, you simply multiply the length indicated in the drawing by the scale factor. For instance, if a length in the drawing measures $5 \, \text{cm}$ and the scale is $1:100$, the calculation for the real-world length would be:

$$
5 \, \text{cm} \times 100 = 500 \, \text{cm} 
$$

This is equivalent to $5$ metres.

It's also important to manage different units when performing these calculations. If the drawing is in centimetres but you need the real-world measurement in metres, remember that $1$ metre equals $100$ centimetres. For example, if the drawing length is $8 \, \text{cm}$ and the scale is $1:50$, you would first convert the drawing length to the real-world size:

$$
8 \, \text{cm} \times 50 = 400 \, \text{cm}
$$

Next, convert the centimetres to metres:

$$
400 \, \text{cm} \div 100 = 4 \, \text{metres}
$$

Understanding how to interpret scale drawings and perform these conversions is a valuable skill in various fields, including architecture, engineering, and geography. Regular practice with these conversions will enhance your comfort and proficiency in interpreting and creating scale drawings.
