To express the probability of event $ C $ in percentage form, you simply multiply the probability by $ 100 $ and append a percent sign.

Probability quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring and is typically represented as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. To convert the probability of event $ C $ into a percentage, you first need to know its probability in either fraction or decimal form. For instance, if the probability of event $ C $ is $ 0.25 $ (which is equivalent to $ \frac{1}{4} $), you multiply this value by $ 100 $ to obtain the percentage.

Thus, $ 0.25 $ multiplied by $ 100 $ equals $ 25 $. Therefore, the probability of event $ C $ can be stated as $ 25\% $. This indicates that there is a $ 25\% $ chance that event $ C $ will occur.

If the probability of event $ C $ is presented as a fraction, such as $ \frac{3}{5} $, you would first convert the fraction into a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. In this instance, $ 3 $ divided by $ 5 $ equals $ 0.6 $. Next, you multiply $ 0.6 $ by $ 100 $ to arrive at $ 60\% $. Therefore, the probability of event $ C $ in this case is $ 60\% $.

Keep in mind that converting probabilities to percentages can enhance your understanding and facilitate comparisons between the likelihoods of various events. This skill is particularly useful in numerous mathematical contexts and in everyday situations!
