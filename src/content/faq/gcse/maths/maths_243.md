Differentiation is a key mathematical tool used to determine the slope of a curve by calculating the derivative of its equation.

To elaborate, the slope of a curve at a specific point represents the gradient of the tangent line to the curve at that point. To obtain this gradient, you must differentiate the function that describes the curve. Differentiation is the process of finding the rate at which a function is changing at any given point.

For instance, consider a function given by $y = f(x)$. The derivative of this function, denoted as $\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $f'(x)$, provides the slope of the curve at any point $x$. To differentiate a function, you apply specific rules such as the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, or chain rule, depending on the function's structure.

Let's take a straightforward example: the function $y = x^2$. To find the slope of the curve at any point, we differentiate $y$ with respect to $x$. By applying the power rule, we find that the derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$. This indicates that the slope of the curve $y = x^2$ at any point $x$ is $2x$. For instance, to determine the slope at $x = 3$, you substitute $3$ into the derivative, yielding $2 \times 3 = 6$.

Overall, differentiation is essential for analyzing how a function behaves and changes, making it a crucial concept in various fields of mathematics and science.
