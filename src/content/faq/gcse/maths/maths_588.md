To create a bar chart from categorical data, you will need to organize the categories along the x-axis and their corresponding frequencies along the y-axis.

First, collect your categorical data and count the occurrences of each category. For example, if you are surveying students about their favorite fruits, the categories might include apples, bananas, and oranges. Count how many students selected each fruit.

Next, draw two axes on a sheet of graph paper or utilize graphing software. Label the horizontal axis (x-axis) with the categories (e.g., apples, bananas, oranges). The vertical axis (y-axis) should be labeled with the frequency or count of each category.

Then, for each category, draw a bar that extends up to the corresponding frequency on the y-axis. For instance, if $10$ students chose apples, the bar representing apples should rise to $10$ on the y-axis. Ensure that all bars are of uniform width and spaced evenly apart.

Finally, add a title to your bar chart to clearly indicate what it represents, such as "Favorite Fruits in Class." You may also include labels on each bar to display the exact frequency, making the chart easier to interpret.

By following these steps, you can create a clear and informative bar chart that visually represents your categorical data, enhancing your ability to analyze and understand the information effectively.
