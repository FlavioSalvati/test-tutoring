To determine the relative frequency of landing on red in a roulette game, you need to divide the number of times the ball lands on red by the total number of spins, which in this case is 50.

Relative frequency serves as an estimate of the probability of an event, derived from experimental data. In the context of a roulette wheel, there are 18 red slots among a total of 38 slots, which also include 18 black slots and 2 green slots. By spinning the wheel multiple times and recording the results, you can gather data to analyze.

For example, if you spin the roulette wheel 50 times and observe that the ball lands on a red slot 20 times, you can calculate the relative frequency of landing on red. This is done by taking the number of successful outcomes (20) and dividing it by the total number of spins (50).

The formula for calculating the relative frequency is as follows:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of Red Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Spins}} = \frac{20}{50} = 0.4 
$$

This calculation indicates that, based on your 50 spins, the relative frequency of landing on red is $0.4$, which can also be expressed as $40\%$. This value represents an experimental probability and may fluctuate with different sets of spins. As you conduct more spins, the relative frequency is expected to converge towards the theoretical probability of landing on red, which for a fair roulette wheel is approximately $\frac{18}{38}$ or about $0.474$.
