Ratios are valuable tools for comparing quantities and solving problems that involve proportions in various real-life contexts.

A ratio allows us to compare two or more quantities by illustrating the relative size of one quantity in relation to another. For instance, if you have $2$ apples and $3$ oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges can be expressed as $2:3$. This indicates that for every $2$ apples, there are $3$ oranges. Ratios find applications in numerous real-life situations, including cooking, shopping, and sports.

In cooking, recipes often utilize ratios to achieve the proper balance of ingredients. Suppose a recipe specifies a ratio of $2$ cups of flour to $1$ cup of sugar. If you wish to prepare a larger batch, you can scale the quantities while preserving the same ratio. For example, if you decide to double the recipe, you would need $4$ cups of flour and $2$ cups of sugar.

When it comes to shopping, ratios can assist you in comparing prices and identifying the best deals. Consider a scenario where a $500g$ pack of pasta costs £$1.50$, while a $1kg$ pack is priced at £$2.80$. By calculating the price per gram, you can determine which option is more economical. In this case, the $1kg$ pack offers a lower cost per gram, guiding you toward a more cost-effective choice.

In the realm of sports, ratios are employed to analyze performance metrics. For example, a football player's goal-to-game ratio can provide insight into their scoring efficiency. If a player has netted $20$ goals over $25$ games, their goal-to-game ratio is $20:25$, which simplifies to $4:5$. This indicates that, on average, the player scores $4$ goals for every $5$ games played.

Grasping the concept of ratios can simplify complex problems and empower you to make informed decisions in your everyday life.
