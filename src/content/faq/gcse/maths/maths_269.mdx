To determine the distance between the points $(2, 2)$ and $(5, 6)$, we can utilize the distance formula, which is based on Pythagorean theorem principles.

The distance formula is given by:

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points, we have $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 2)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (5, 6)$.

To find the distance, we start by calculating the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates:

$$
x_2 - x_1 = 5 - 2 = 3
$$

$$
y_2 - y_1 = 6 - 2 = 4
$$

Next, we square these differences:

$$
(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 3^2 = 9
$$

$$
(y_2 - y_1)^2 = 4^2 = 16
$$

Then, we add these squared differences together:

$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the distance:

$$
d = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Thus, the distance from the point $(2, 2)$ to the point $(5, 6)$ is $5$ units. This method allows for the accurate measurement of the straight-line distance between any two points on a coordinate plane.
