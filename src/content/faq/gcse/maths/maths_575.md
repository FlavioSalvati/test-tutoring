The interquartile range (IQR) is a statistical measure that quantifies the spread of the middle 50% of a dataset.

The IQR is an important statistic for assessing variability within a dataset. It is calculated by subtracting the first quartile (Q1) from the third quartile (Q3). Specifically, the first quartile (Q1) represents the 25th percentile, indicating that 25% of the data points fall below this value. Conversely, the third quartile (Q3) corresponds to the 75th percentile, meaning that 75% of the data points are below this threshold. By concentrating on the middle 50% of the data, the IQR offers a measure of spread that remains unaffected by extreme values or outliers.

For instance, consider a dataset of exam scores. The IQR can provide insights into how spread out the scores are within the middle range. A small IQR suggests that the middle 50% of students achieved similar scores, reflecting consistency among them. In contrast, a large IQR indicates a broader range of scores within the middle 50%, signifying greater variability.

The IQR is especially beneficial when comparing multiple datasets. For example, if you are analyzing the exam scores of two different classes, the IQR can help you identify which class demonstrates more consistent performance. A smaller IQR in one class relative to another implies that the scores are more tightly clustered around the median.

In conclusion, the IQR is a valuable tool for understanding both the spread and consistency of the central portion of a dataset. This makes it easier to analyze and compare different datasets effectively.
