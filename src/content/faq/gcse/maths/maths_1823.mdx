To divide one fraction by another, you simply multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

When performing division with fractions, the crucial step is to utilize the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the second fraction. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping its numerator (the top number) and its denominator (the bottom number). For instance, the reciprocal of the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{3}$.

Consider the example of dividing the fraction $\frac{2}{5}$ by $\frac{3}{7}$. First, we need to determine the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{7}$, which is $\frac{7}{3}$. Next, we multiply $\frac{2}{5}$ by $\frac{7}{3}$. The multiplication of fractions involves multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together:

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{2 \times 7}{5 \times 3} = \frac{14}{15}
$$

Thus, we find that:

$$
\frac{2}{5} \div \frac{3}{7} = \frac{14}{15}
$$

It is important to remember that this method is applicable to any type of fraction, including improper fractions (where the numerator is greater than the denominator) and mixed numbers (a combination of a whole number and a fraction). If you encounter a mixed number, you should first convert it into an improper fraction. For example, to divide the mixed number $1 \frac{1}{2}$ by $\frac{3}{4}$, we convert $1 \frac{1}{2}$ into the improper fraction $\frac{3}{2}$, and then proceed with the reciprocal method:

$$
\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2 \times 3} = \frac{12}{6} = 2
$$

By following these steps, you can confidently divide any fractions you encounter.
