The translation from the point $(1, 4)$ to the point $(3, 8)$ involves a horizontal shift of $2$ units to the right and a vertical shift of $4$ units upward.

To elaborate, a translation in geometry refers to the process of moving a shape or point from one location to another without altering its orientation, size, or shape. In this case, we analyze the change in the coordinates of the point. The original point is $(1, 4)$, while the new point is $(3, 8)$.

First, letâ€™s examine the horizontal movement. The x-coordinate transitions from $1$ to $3$. To determine the distance of this movement, we subtract the original x-coordinate from the new x-coordinate: 

$$
3 - 1 = 2.
$$ 

This calculation shows that the point moves $2$ units to the right.

Next, we consider the vertical movement. The y-coordinate changes from $4$ to $8$. Again, we perform a subtraction of the original y-coordinate from the new y-coordinate: 

$$
8 - 4 = 4.
$$ 

This indicates that the point moves $4$ units upward.

Thus, the translation from $(1, 4)$ to $(3, 8)$ consists of a movement of $2$ units to the right and $4$ units upward. This type of translation can also be represented as a vector, specifically $(2, 4)$, where the first component signifies the horizontal shift and the second component signifies the vertical shift. 

Understanding translations is vital in the study of coordinate geometry, as it aids in visualizing how points and shapes move across a graph.
