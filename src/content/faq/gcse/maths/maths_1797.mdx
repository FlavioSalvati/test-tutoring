To order a list of percentages, you should arrange them from the smallest to the largest value.

When you have a set of percentages, the objective is to sort them in ascending order. This means starting with the smallest percentage and progressing to the largest. For example, if you have the percentages $45\%$, $20\%$, $75\%$, and $10\%$, the first step is to identify the smallest percentage, which is $10\%$. Next, you find the next smallest percentage, which is $20\%$, followed by $45\%$, and lastly $75\%$. Thus, the ordered list would be $10\%, 20\%, 45\%, 75\%$.

To accomplish this, you can write down all the percentages and compare them one by one. Begin by examining the first two percentages to determine which one is smaller. Then, compare the smaller percentage with the next one in the list, and continue this process. This approach is known as the "comparison method" and is relatively straightforward.

Alternatively, you may find it helpful to convert the percentages into decimal form for easier comparison. For instance, $45\%$ translates to $0.45$, $20\%$ to $0.20$, $75\%$ to $0.75$, and $10\%$ to $0.10$. Once converted, it becomes clear that $0.10$ is the smallest, followed by $0.20$, $0.45$, and $0.75$. After ordering the decimal values, you can convert them back to their percentage form.

Keep in mind that ordering percentages is similar to ordering any other numbers. The key is to carefully compare each value and arrange them in the correct sequence from smallest to largest.
