To simplify the ratio $8:12$, we start by identifying the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The GCD is the largest number that can evenly divide both $8$ and $12$.

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of each number:

- The factors of $8$ are $1, 2, 4, 8$.
- The factors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$.

From this list, we can see that the common factors are $1, 2,$ and $4$. Among these, the greatest common factor is $4$. Thus, the GCD of $8$ and $12$ is $4$.

Next, we divide both numbers in the ratio by their GCD:

- Dividing $8$ by $4$ results in $2$.
- Dividing $12$ by $4$ results in $3$.

Therefore, the simplified form of the ratio $8:12$ is $2:3$.

This simplification process ensures that the ratio is expressed in its simplest form, where the two numbers share no common factors other than $1$. Simplifying ratios is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it facilitates the comparison of quantities and enhances problem-solving efficiency.
