To determine the magnitude of the vector $ (3, 4) $, we use the formula 

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
$$

The magnitude of a vector provides a measure of its length. For a vector represented by its components $ (x, y) $, the magnitude can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. This is because the vector forms a right-angled triangle with the x-axis and y-axis, where the components $ x $ and $ y $ correspond to the lengths of the triangle's legs.

To find the magnitude of the vector $ (3, 4) $, follow these steps:

1. Square the x-component: 
   $$ 
   3^2 = 9. 
   $$
2. Square the y-component: 
   $$ 
   4^2 = 16. 
   $$
3. Add these squares together: 
   $$ 
   9 + 16 = 25. 
   $$
4. Take the square root of the sum: 
   $$ 
   \sqrt{25} = 5. 
   $$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $ (3, 4) $ is $ 5 $. This method can be applied to any vector in two-dimensional space, allowing you to understand the distance from the origin $ (0, 0) $ in a Cartesian coordinate system.
