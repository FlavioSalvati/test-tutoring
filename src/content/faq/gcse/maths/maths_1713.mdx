A complex number is defined as a number that consists of both a real part and an imaginary part.

More specifically, a complex number is expressed in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ denotes the imaginary unit. The imaginary unit $i$ is characterized by the property that its square is equal to $-1$, or mathematically, $i^2 = -1$. In this representation, $a$ corresponds to the real part of the complex number, while $b$ represents the imaginary part.

For instance, in the complex number $3 + 4i$, the real part is $3$ and the imaginary part is $4$. Complex numbers are particularly valuable in various scientific and engineering disciplines because they can represent quantities that possess both magnitude and direction, such as electrical currents or wave phenomena.

When it comes to adding or subtracting complex numbers, the process is straightforward: you simply combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For example, consider the operation $(3 + 4i) + (1 + 2i)$. This can be calculated as follows:

$$
(3 + 4i) + (1 + 2i) = (3 + 1) + (4 + 2)i = 4 + 6i.
$$

Multiplying complex numbers requires the application of the distributive property along with the identity $i^2 = -1$. For example, when multiplying $(2 + 3i)(1 + 4i)$, we can expand it as follows:

$$
(2 + 3i)(1 + 4i) = 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 4i + 3i \cdot 1 + 3i \cdot 4i = 2 + 8i + 3i + 12i^2.
$$

Substituting $i^2 = -1$ into the expression, we get:

$$
2 + 8i + 3i + 12(-1) = 2 + 11i - 12 = -10 + 11i.
$$

Complex numbers can also be graphically represented on the complex plane, where the x-axis denotes the real part and the y-axis signifies the imaginary part. This graphical representation aids in visualizing operations such as addition and multiplication in a geometric context.
