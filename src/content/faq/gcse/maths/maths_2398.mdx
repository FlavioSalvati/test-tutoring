The equation of the line $ y = x - 4 $ describes a straight line with a slope of $1$ and a y-intercept of $-4$.

To elaborate, the equation $ y = x - 4 $ is expressed in the slope-intercept form, which is generally represented as 

$$ y = mx + c $$ 

In this formulation, $ m $ denotes the slope of the line, while $ c $ signifies the y-interceptâ€”the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

For the specific equation $ y = x - 4 $, the slope $ m $ is equal to $1$. This indicates that for every unit increase in $ x $, $ y $ also increases by the same amount. Consequently, the line ascends at a $45^\circ$ angle with respect to the x-axis.

The y-intercept $ c $ is $-4$, indicating that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $(0, -4)$. To determine this point, you can substitute $ x = 0 $ into the equation, yielding $ y = -4 $.

To graph the line, begin at the y-intercept $(0, -4)$. Using the slope, you can identify additional points on the line. Since the slope is $1$, you can move one unit to the right (increasing $ x $ by $1$) and one unit up (increasing $ y $ by $1$) to locate the next point, which would be $(1, -3)$. By continuing this process, you can generate a series of points that can be connected to create the line.

Grasping the implications of this equation enables you to quickly sketch the line and analyze its characteristics, such as its direction and its intersections with the axes.
