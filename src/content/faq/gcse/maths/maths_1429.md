To translate a square using the vector $(1, -1)$, you will need to move each vertex of the square $1$ unit to the right and $1$ unit down.

When translating a shape, you shift it without altering its orientation or size. In this particular case, the vector $(1, -1)$ specifies the direction and distance for the translation. The first component of the vector, $1$, indicates that each point of the square should be moved $1$ unit to the right along the x-axis. The second component, $-1$, indicates that each point should be moved $1$ unit down along the y-axis.

Consider a square defined by its vertices at points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. Let's say the coordinates of these points are as follows: $A(2, 3)$, $B(4, 3)$, $C(4, 5)$, and $D(2, 5)$. To perform the translation, you will add $1$ to the x-coordinate and subtract $1$ from the y-coordinate for each of these points. Thus, the translations will result in the following new coordinates:

- Point $A$ at $(2, 3)$ will move to $(3, 2)$.
- Point $B$ at $(4, 3)$ will move to $(5, 2)$.
- Point $C$ at $(4, 5)$ will move to $(5, 4)$.
- Point $D$ at $(2, 5)$ will move to $(3, 4)$.

This translation process preserves both the shape and size of the square while changing its position on the coordinate plane. By adhering to the vector $(1, -1)$, you can ensure that the square is translated accurately.
