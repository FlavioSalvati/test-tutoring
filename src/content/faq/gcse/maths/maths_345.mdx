An isosceles triangle possesses a single line of symmetry, which is defined as the perpendicular bisector of its base.

To locate the line of symmetry in an isosceles triangle, you should seek the line that divides the triangle into two mirror-image halves. In an isosceles triangle, two sides are of equal length, and the angles opposite these sides are also equal. This line of symmetry always extends from the vertex angle (the angle formed by the two equal sides) to the midpoint of the base (the side that is unequal to the other two sides).

To construct this line of symmetry, begin at the vertex angle and draw a straight line down to the midpoint of the base. This line is referred to as the perpendicular bisector because it is perpendicular—forming a right angle—to the base and bisects it, dividing it into two equal segments. This line of symmetry guarantees that each half of the triangle is a mirror image of the other. Consequently, if you were to fold the triangle along this line, both halves would coincide perfectly.

Understanding the line of symmetry in an isosceles triangle is essential for solving various geometric problems, such as calculating the area, determining the height, or analyzing the properties of the triangle. It is important to remember that the defining characteristics of an isosceles triangle are its two equal sides and the equal angles opposite those sides, which directly contribute to the presence of this single line of symmetry.
