To calculate the arc length of a circle, we utilize the formula:

$$ 
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r 
$$

To determine the arc length, we need two key pieces of information: the radius of the circle and the angle $\theta$ that the arc subtends at the center of the circle. In this scenario, the diameter of the circle is $10 \, \text{cm}$, which means the radius $r$ can be calculated as half of the diameter:

$$ 
r = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{cm} 
$$

The angle provided is $\theta = 60^\circ$.

Now, we can plug these values into the arc length formula:

$$ 
L = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r 
$$

Substituting the values we have:

$$ 
L = \frac{60}{360} \times 2\pi \times 5 
$$

Next, we simplify the fraction $\frac{60}{360}$:

$$ 
\frac{60}{360} = \frac{1}{6} 
$$

Now, substituting this back into our formula gives:

$$ 
L = \frac{1}{6} \times 2\pi \times 5 
$$

Multiplying the constants together, we find:

$$ 
L = \frac{1}{6} \times 10\pi 
$$

This simplifies to:

$$ 
L = \frac{10\pi}{6} 
$$

Further simplifying the fraction results in:

$$ 
L = \frac{5\pi}{3} 
$$

To obtain a numerical approximation, we can use $\pi \approx 3.14$. Therefore:

$$ 
L \approx \frac{5 \times 3.14}{3} 
$$

Calculating this gives us:

$$ 
L \approx \frac{15.7}{3} 
$$

Finally, simplifying this yields:

$$ 
L \approx 5.23 \, \text{cm} 
$$

Thus, the arc length of a circle with a diameter of $10 \, \text{cm}$ and an angle of $60^\circ$ is approximately $5.23 \, \text{cm}$.
