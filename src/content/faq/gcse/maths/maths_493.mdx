The resulting vector from adding the vectors $(3, 4)$ and $(-3, -4)$ is $(0, 0)$.

To determine the resulting vector when adding two vectors, you simply combine their corresponding components. Vectors are typically represented in the form $(x, y)$, where $x$ denotes the horizontal component and $y$ signifies the vertical component. In this case, we are working with two specific vectors: $(3, 4)$ and $(-3, -4)$.

First, let's calculate the sum of the horizontal components. The horizontal component of the first vector is $3$, while the horizontal component of the second vector is $-3$. When we add these two values together, we get:

$$
3 + (-3) = 0.
$$

Next, we will add the vertical components. The vertical component of the first vector is $4$, and the vertical component of the second vector is $-4$. Adding these vertical components yields:

$$
4 + (-4) = 0.
$$

Thus, when we combine the vectors $(3, 4)$ and $(-3, -4)$, the resulting vector is $(0, 0)$. This outcome indicates that the two vectors effectively cancel each other out, resulting in a vector that possesses neither magnitude nor direction. This concept in vector addition illustrates how vectors can interact to produce a net effect of zero.
