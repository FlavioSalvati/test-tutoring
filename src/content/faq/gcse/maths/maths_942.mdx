To determine the marginal cost, you utilize differentiation on the total cost function with respect to the quantity produced.

In the field of economics, marginal cost refers to the additional cost incurred when producing one more unit of a good or service. To calculate this, you begin with the total cost (TC) function, which quantifies the overall cost associated with producing a specific quantity of goods. This function typically encompasses both fixed costs—costs that remain constant regardless of output—and variable costs—costs that fluctuate with production levels.

Assume the total cost function is represented as $TC(q)$, where $q$ denotes the quantity of goods produced. To derive the marginal cost (MC), you need to differentiate the total cost function with respect to $q$. This differentiation process allows you to determine the rate at which the total cost changes as the quantity produced varies. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
MC = \frac{d(TC)}{dq}.
$$

For instance, if the total cost function is given by $TC(q) = 5q^2 + 3q + 10$, you would differentiate this function concerning $q$. The differentiation involves applying the power rule to each term in the function. According to the power rule, for a term of the form $aq^n$, the derivative is $n \cdot a \cdot q^{n-1}$.

Thus, differentiating $TC(q) = 5q^2 + 3q + 10$ yields:

$$
\frac{d(TC)}{dq} = 2 \cdot 5q^{2-1} + 1 \cdot 3q^{1-1} + 0 = 10q + 3.
$$

Consequently, the marginal cost function is given by:

$$
MC(q) = 10q + 3.
$$

This result signifies that for each additional unit produced, the cost increases by $10q + 3$ units of currency. Grasping this concept is crucial for businesses as it aids in making informed decisions regarding production levels and pricing strategies.
