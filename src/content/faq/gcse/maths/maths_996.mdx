The coordinates of the midpoint between the points $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$ are $(3, 5)$.

To determine the midpoint of two points, we utilize the midpoint formula, which is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

Here, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. In our case, these points are $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$.

We begin by calculating the x-coordinates of the midpoint. First, we add the x-coordinates of the two points:

$$
2 + 4 = 6
$$

Next, we divide this sum by 2 to find the x-coordinate of the midpoint:

$$
\frac{6}{2} = 3
$$

Now, let's find the y-coordinate of the midpoint. We start by adding the y-coordinates of the two points:

$$
3 + 7 = 10
$$

Then, we divide this sum by 2 to determine the y-coordinate of the midpoint:

$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5
$$

Consequently, the coordinates of the midpoint are $(3, 5)$. This point lies exactly halfway between $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$ along a straight line. Mastering the process of finding the midpoint is valuable in various areas of geometry, as it aids in analyzing and solving problems related to line segments and distances.
