To simplify the expression $\frac{4^3}{4^2}$, we can apply the property of exponents that states when dividing powers with the same base, we subtract the exponents. In this case, both the numerator and the denominator share the base $4$, where the numerator is $4^3$ and the denominator is $4^2$.

According to the exponent rule $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$, where $a$ denotes the base and $m$ and $n$ are the respective exponents, we can rewrite our expression as follows:

$$
\frac{4^3}{4^2} = 4^{3-2} = 4^1
$$

Since any number raised to the power of $1$ is equal to the number itself, we find that $4^1$ simplifies to $4$. Therefore, we conclude that 

$$
\frac{4^3}{4^2} = 4.
$$

This method of subtracting exponents is quite effective and can be utilized in any similar problems that involve the division of powers with the same base. By remembering this fundamental rule, you will be able to simplify expressions efficiently and accurately.
