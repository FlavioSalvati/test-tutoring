To determine the resulting point after translating by the vector $(4, -1)$, you simply need to add $4$ to the x-coordinate and subtract $1$ from the y-coordinate.

In more detail, a translation is a specific type of transformation that shifts each point of a shape or object a certain distance in a designated direction. When translating a point using a vector, you are effectively moving the point based on the vector's components. The vector $(4, -1)$ indicates that you should move $4$ units to the right (in the positive x-direction) and $1$ unit down (in the negative y-direction).

Suppose you have a point with coordinates $(x, y)$. To find the new coordinates after the translation, you will add the x-component of the vector to the x-coordinate of the point and the y-component of the vector to the y-coordinate of the point. This can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\text{New x-coordinate} = x + 4
$$

$$
\text{New y-coordinate} = y - 1
$$

For instance, consider the original point $(3, 5)$. To calculate the new coordinates after the translation, you would proceed as follows:

$$
\text{New x-coordinate} = 3 + 4 = 7
$$

$$
\text{New y-coordinate} = 5 - 1 = 4
$$

Thus, the point $(3, 5)$ translated by the vector $(4, -1)$ becomes $(7, 4)$.

This method is applicable to any point and any translation vector. Just remember to add the x-component of the vector to the x-coordinate of the point and the y-component of the vector to the y-coordinate of the point. This straightforward addition and subtraction will yield the new location of the point following the translation.
