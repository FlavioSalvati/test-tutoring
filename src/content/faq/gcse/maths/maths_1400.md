To calculate the diagonal of a rectangular prism, also referred to as a cuboid, you can use the following formula:

$$
d_{\text{prism}} = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
$$

In this expression, $l$ represents the length, $w$ the width, and $h$ the height of the prism. The diagonal is defined as the longest line that can be drawn from one vertex of the prism to the opposite vertex. To derive this formula, we apply the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.

### Step 1: Diagonal of the Base

First, consider the base of the rectangular prism. If you draw a diagonal across this base, you create a right-angled triangle where the two shorter sides are the length and the width. The diagonal of the base, denoted as $d_{\text{base}}$, can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
d_{\text{base}} = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
$$

### Step 2: Diagonal of the Prism

Next, imagine this diagonal $d_{\text{base}}$ as one leg of a new right-angled triangle, with the height of the prism serving as the other leg. The diagonal of the entire prism, $d_{\text{prism}}$, acts as the hypotenuse of this triangle. By applying the Pythagorean theorem once more, we can express the diagonal of the prism as:

$$
d_{\text{prism}} = \sqrt{d_{\text{base}}^2 + h^2}
$$

### Step 3: Substituting the Base Diagonal

Substituting the expression for $d_{\text{base}}$ into the equation for $d_{\text{prism}}$ yields:

$$
d_{\text{prism}} = \sqrt{(\sqrt{l^2 + w^2})^2 + h^2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
d_{\text{prism}} = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
$$

### Conclusion

This formula provides a straightforward method to compute the diagonal of any rectangular prism. Simply substitute the appropriate values for length $l$, width $w$, and height $h$ to find the diagonal length $d_{\text{prism}}$.
