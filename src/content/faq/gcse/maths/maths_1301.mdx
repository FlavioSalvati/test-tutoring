The hypotenuse of the triangle measures $41$ cm.

To determine the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known, we can apply Pythagoras' theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

In this equation, $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the other two sides.

For this particular triangle, one leg measures $9$ cm, and the other leg measures $40$ cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
9^2 + 40^2 = c^2
$$

Calculating the squares, we find:

$$
81 + 1600 = c^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
1681 = c^2
$$

To solve for $c$, we take the square root of $1681$:

$$
c = \sqrt{1681} = 41
$$

Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is $41$ cm. This method is particularly useful in various practical applications, such as construction and navigation, where right-angled triangles frequently occur. Always ensure that the triangle in question is a right triangle before applying Pythagoras' theorem!
