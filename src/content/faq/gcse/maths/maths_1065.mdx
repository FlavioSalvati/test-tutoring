To create a net for a cylinder, begin by sketching two circles and a rectangle. The width of the rectangle should match the circumference of the circles.

A cylinder's net consists of three components: two identical circles and one rectangle. The circles represent the top and bottom faces of the cylinder, while the rectangle represents the curved surface when it is unrolled. 

First, draw two circles of identical size, ensuring they are spaced apart but aligned vertically to indicate that they form the top and bottom of the cylinder.

Next, draw the rectangle. The height of this rectangle should equal the height of the cylinder. To determine the width of the rectangle, calculate the circumference of the circles using the formula:

$$
C = 2\pi r
$$

where $ r $ is the radius of the circle. Once you compute the circumference, draw the rectangle with this width, ensuring its height matches the cylinder's height.

When you assemble these shapes, you will have a net that, when cut out and folded, forms a cylinder. The two circles will serve as the top and bottom, while the rectangle will wrap around to create the curved surface. This visualization aids in understanding the three-dimensional shape and its properties, a crucial skill in GCSE Maths.
