To determine the median class from a histogram, the first step is to identify the class interval that contains the middle value of the data.

More specifically, the median class is defined as the class interval where the cumulative frequency reaches or exceeds half of the total frequency. To find this, you should first calculate the total frequency by summing the frequencies of all class intervals. Once you have the total frequency, find half of it; this value represents the median position.

Next, construct a cumulative frequency table by sequentially adding the frequencies of each class interval. Begin with the first class interval and maintain a running total of the frequencies. The class interval where the cumulative frequency first equals or surpasses the median position is identified as the median class.

For instance, consider a histogram with various class intervals and their respective frequencies, where the total frequency is $50$. Thus, the median position is $25$ (since $50$ divided by $2$ equals $25$). If the cumulative frequency reaches $25$ in the third class interval, then the third class interval is designated as the median class.

It is important to note that the median class is not necessarily the class interval with the highest frequency; rather, it is the class where the cumulative frequency equals the median position. This process aids in understanding the distribution of the data and pinpointing the central tendency within a grouped frequency distribution.
