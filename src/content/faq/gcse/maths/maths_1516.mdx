To determine the expected frequency of an event, you can multiply the probability of the event occurring by the total number of trials conducted.

When flipping a fair coin, the probability of landing on tails for any individual flip is $0.5$ (or $50\%$). To calculate the expected frequency of obtaining tails $25$ times out of $50$ flips, we apply the concept of expected value in probability. The expected value is derived from multiplying the probability of the event by the number of trials.

In this scenario, the event of interest is obtaining tails, which has a probability of $0.5$. The total number of trials corresponds to the number of flips, which is $50$. Therefore, the expected frequency of getting tails can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \text{Probability of Tails} \times \text{Number of Flips}
$$

Substituting in the values, we have:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = 0.5 \times 50
$$

Calculating this yields:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = 25
$$

This indicates that, on average, you would expect to get tails $25$ times in $50$ flips. The reason for this expectation is that the coin is fair, and over a large number of flips, the outcomes should converge, resulting in an approximately equal distribution of heads and tails. This principle is fundamental to probability theory and aids in our understanding of the likelihood of various outcomes in random experiments.
