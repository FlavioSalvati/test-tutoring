To simplify the expression $5m - 2m + 7$, we can combine like terms, resulting in $3m + 7$.

In algebra, simplifying an expression refers to the process of reducing it to its most straightforward form. In our case, we start with the expression $5m - 2m + 7$. The terms $5m$ and $-2m$ are classified as "like terms" because they both share the variable $m$. To simplify, we combine these like terms by performing the subtraction: 

$$
5m - 2m = 3m.
$$

The term $7$ is a constant, meaning it does not change and is not associated with any variable. As there are no additional constant terms to combine with it, $7$ remains unchanged.

Thus, after combining the like terms, the simplified expression is 

$$
3m + 7.
$$ 

This process of combining like terms is essential as it makes the expression easier to work with, particularly when solving equations or performing further manipulations.
