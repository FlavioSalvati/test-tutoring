In order to simplify the expression $(2^3)^2$, we apply the rule of exponents that states when a power is raised to another power, we multiply the exponents. This expression represents $2^3$ being squared. According to the laws of exponents, more specifically, the 'power of a power' rule, we multiply the exponents together. Thus, the calculation becomes $3 \times 2$, which equals 6. As a result, $(2^3)^2$ simplifies to $2^6$.

To delve deeper into the process, $2^3$ is equivalent to $2 \times 2 \times 2$, which equals 8. Raising 8 to the power of 2 leads us to compute $8 \times 8$, giving us 64. Alternatively, calculating $2^6$ would involve computing $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$, which also results in 64. Both methods yield the same answer, thereby confirming the correct simplification of $(2^3)^2$ to $2^6$.
