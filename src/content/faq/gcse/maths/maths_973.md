The gradient of the line given by the equation $ y = 3x + 2 $ is $ 3 $.

To determine the gradient of a straight line represented by the equation $ y = mx + c $, one must identify the coefficient of $ x $. In the equation $ y = 3x + 2 $, the term $ 3x $ indicates the portion responsible for defining the gradient. Here, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 3 $, which signifies that the gradient of the line is $ 3 $.

The gradient, often referred to as the slope, describes the steepness of the line. It represents the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $. More simply, for every unit increase in $ x $, $ y $ increases by $ 3 $ units. This concept of the gradient is vital for understanding the behavior of linear functions.

When graphing the line $ y = 3x + 2 $, you would begin at the y-intercept, which is $ 2 $ (the constant term $ c $). From this point, for every $ 1 $ unit you move to the right along the x-axis, you would move up $ 3 $ units. This consistent rise over run defines the gradient.

Grasping the concept of gradients is essential for analyzing and interpreting linear relationships in a variety of real-world contexts, including fields such as physics, economics, and everyday problem-solving.
