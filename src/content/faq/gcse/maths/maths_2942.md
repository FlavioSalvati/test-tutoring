The expected frequency of an event is $20$.

To clarify this concept, let's break it down. The expected frequency is calculated by multiplying the probability of the event by the total number of trials. In this scenario, the probability of the event occurring is $0.2$, and the total number of trials is $100$. Therefore, we perform the calculation:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \text{Probability} \times \text{Number of Trials} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20.
$$

This means that, on average, we can expect the event to occur $20$ times out of $100$ trials.

To illustrate this further, consider this analogy: if you were flipping a coin that lands on heads $20\%$ of the time, and you flipped it $100$ times, you would anticipate it to land on heads approximately $20$ times. This is because $20\%$ of $100$ equals $20$. The concept of expected frequency is instrumental in predicting how often an event is likely to occur within a specified number of trials, based on its probability.

In mathematical terms, the formula for expected frequency is:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \text{Probability} \times \text{Number of Trials}.
$$

Applying this formula to our example:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20.
$$

This concept is valuable in the fields of probability and statistics, as it enables us to make predictions and analyze patterns within data. While the actual number of occurrences may fluctuate, the expected frequency provides a reliable estimate based on the given probability.
