A real number is defined as any number that can be located on the number line, encompassing both rational and irrational numbers.

The set of real numbers includes a diverse array of values, such as whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. Real numbers can be classified as positive, negative, or zero. For instance, the numbers $3$, $-1.5$, $0$, and $\sqrt{2}$ are all examples of real numbers. In essence, if a number can be represented on a number line, it qualifies as a real number.

Rational numbers form a specific subset of real numbers. These are numbers that can be expressed in the form of a fraction, where both the numerator and the denominator are integers. Examples of rational numbers include $\frac{1}{2}$, $-3$, and $4$. Additionally, repeating or terminating decimals such as $0.75$ or $0.333\ldots$ are also classified as rational numbers because they can be represented as fractions.

In contrast, irrational numbers cannot be expressed as simple fractions. Their decimal expansions are non-terminating and non-repeating. Notable examples of irrational numbers include $\pi$ (pi) and $\sqrt{2}$. Despite their complexity, irrational numbers are still considered real numbers because they can be plotted on the number line.

Real numbers are fundamental in mathematics as they enable us to measure and quantify various phenomena in the world around us. They play a crucial role in mathematical concepts ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced calculus, making them an essential topic for GCSE Maths students to grasp.
