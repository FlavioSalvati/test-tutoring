To create a frequency table from raw data, follow these steps to organize and count the occurrences of each unique data value.

First, collect your raw data and identify all the distinct values present in the dataset. This can be accomplished by reviewing the data and noting each unique entry. For instance, if your dataset consists of test scores, make a list of each different score that appears.

Next, construct a table with two columns. Label the first column as "Value" and the second column as "Frequency". The "Value" column will include each unique data value you have identified, while the "Frequency" column will indicate how many times each value appears within the dataset.

Now, revisit your raw data to count the occurrences of each unique value. For each distinct value, record the corresponding count in the "Frequency" column next to the appropriate value. This process, known as tallying, allows you to keep track of the counts efficiently. You may use tally marks to assist in this counting process before finalizing the numbers.

For example, consider the following raw data: $3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5$. The resulting frequency table would appear as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Value} & \text{Frequency} \\
\hline
3 & 3 \\
4 & 3 \\
5 & 4 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

This table effectively summarizes how many times each score occurs in your dataset. Frequency tables are valuable tools that facilitate the analysis of data by providing a clear overview of patterns and trends.
