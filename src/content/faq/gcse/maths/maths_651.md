The intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ is given by the set $\{2\}$.

In set theory, the intersection of two sets is defined as the set of elements that are common to both sets. To determine the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, we must identify the elements that appear in both sets.

Set $A$ is defined as $\{1, 2\}$, while set $B$ is defined as $\{2, 3\}$. We will examine each element in set $A$ to see if it also exists in set $B$. The elements in set $A$ are $1$ and $2$. Upon checking these against set $B$, we find that $1$ is not present in set $B$, but $2$ is. Consequently, the only element that is common to both sets $A$ and $B$ is $2$.

Thus, the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A \cap B$, is $\{2\}$. This indicates that $2$ is the sole number shared by both sets. Understanding intersections is crucial in set theory, as it allows us to analyze the relationships between different groups of items effectively.
