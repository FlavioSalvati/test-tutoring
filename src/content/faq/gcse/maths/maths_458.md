To find the solutions for the equation $\tan(x) = \sqrt{3}$ within the interval from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$, we identify the angles for which the tangent of $x$ equals $\sqrt{3}$. 

The tangent function, $\tan(x)$, is positive in both the first and third quadrants. We know that:

$$
\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}
$$

Thus, one solution is:

$$
x = 60^\circ.
$$

Next, we need to determine the corresponding angle in the third quadrant where $\tan(x)$ is also equal to $\sqrt{3}$. The tangent function has a period of $180^\circ$, which means it repeats its values every $180^\circ$. Therefore, we can find the second solution by adding $180^\circ$ to our first solution:

$$
60^\circ + 180^\circ = 240^\circ.
$$

Consequently, the second solution is:

$$
x = 240^\circ.
$$

In conclusion, the angles that satisfy the equation $\tan(x) = \sqrt{3}$ in the interval from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ are:

$$
60^\circ \text{ and } 240^\circ.
$$
