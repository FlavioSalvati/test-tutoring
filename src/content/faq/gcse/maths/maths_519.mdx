The probability of drawing a king from a standard deck of cards is calculated as $\frac{4}{52}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{13}$.

To clarify this further, let’s break it down step by step. A standard deck of cards consists of a total of $52$ cards, which are organized into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains $13$ cards, and notably, each suit includes one king. Consequently, there are a total of $4$ kings in the entire deck—one from each suit.

When determining probability, it is essential to identify both the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes. In this scenario, the favorable outcomes are the $4$ kings, while the total possible outcomes correspond to the $52$ cards present in the deck. The probability is then computed by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.

Thus, the probability $P$ of drawing a king can be expressed with the formula:

$$ P(\text{King}) = \frac{\text{Number of Kings}}{\text{Total Number of Cards}} = \frac{4}{52} $$

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $4$ in this case:

$$ \frac{4}{52} = \frac{4 \div 4}{52 \div 4} = \frac{1}{13} $$

Therefore, the probability of drawing a king from a standard deck of cards is $\frac{1}{13}$. This indicates that if you were to draw a card from the deck, there is a $1$ in $13$ chance that the card drawn would be a king.
