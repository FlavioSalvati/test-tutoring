To determine the surface area of a compound solid, the process involves calculating the surface areas of its individual geometric shapes and then summing them.

A compound solid consists of two or more simple geometric shapes that are combined. To find its total surface area, you must first break it down into these simpler components. Begin by identifying all the individual shapes that constitute the compound solid. For instance, the solid might comprise a cylinder and a cone or a cube and a pyramid.

Once you have identified the shapes, proceed to calculate the surface area of each one using the appropriate formula. For example, the surface area $A$ of a cylinder is given by the formula:

$$
A = 2\pi rh + 2\pi r^2
$$

where $r$ represents the radius and $h$ denotes the height. For a cone, the surface area $A$ is calculated using:

$$
A = \pi r (r + l)
$$

where $l$ is the slant height. It's essential to include only the exposed surfaces in your calculations. If two shapes are connected, the area where they intersect should not be counted twice.

After calculating the surface areas of all the individual shapes, sum these values to obtain the total surface area of the compound solid. Be mindful to subtract any overlapping areas that are not exposed. For instance, if a cylinder is placed atop a cube, the base of the cylinder that rests on the cube should be excluded from the total surface area calculation.

By following these steps, you will be able to accurately determine the surface area of any compound solid. This method ensures that all exposed surfaces are accounted for while preventing the double-counting of any overlapping areas.
