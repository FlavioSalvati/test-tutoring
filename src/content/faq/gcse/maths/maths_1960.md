To convert a percentage into a fraction, you divide the percentage by $100$ and simplify the result when possible.

A percentage signifies a value out of $100$. For instance, $25\%$ can be interpreted as $25$ out of $100$. To express this as a fraction, write it as $\frac{25}{100}$. This fraction can often be simplified by identifying the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. In this example, both $25$ and $100$ can be divided by $25$, leading to the simplification of $\frac{25}{100}$ to $\frac{1}{4}$.

Let's consider another example: $60\%$. First, express it as $\frac{60}{100}$. To simplify this fraction, we need to find the GCD of $60$ and $100$, which is $20$. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $20$ results in $\frac{3}{5}$. Thus, $60\%$ can be represented as the fraction $\frac{3}{5}$.

For percentages that include decimal values, such as $12.5\%$, you can still follow the same method. Begin by writing $12.5\%$ as $\frac{12.5}{100}$. To eliminate the decimal, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $10$, yielding $\frac{125}{1000}$. Next, simplify this fraction by finding the GCD, which in this case is $125$. Dividing both parts by $125$ gives you $\frac{1}{8}$.

In summary, the essential steps for converting a percentage to a fraction are as follows: 

1. Write the percentage as a fraction over $100$.
2. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD.
3. If necessary, eliminate any decimals by multiplying appropriately.

This method is applicable to any percentage, making it a dependable technique for converting percentages to fractions.
