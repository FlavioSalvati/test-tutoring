To create a cumulative frequency plot, you will need to graph the cumulative frequency against the upper boundary of each class interval.

First, prepare a frequency table that lists the class intervals alongside their corresponding frequencies. The initial step involves calculating the cumulative frequency for each class interval. This is achieved by adding the frequency of the current class interval to the cumulative frequency of the preceding interval. For the very first class interval, the cumulative frequency is equal to its frequency.

Next, determine the upper boundary for each class interval. The upper boundary represents the maximum value included in that interval. For instance, if the class interval is $10-20$, the upper boundary is $20$.

Now, you can proceed to plot the points on a graph. On the x-axis, label the upper boundaries of the class intervals. On the y-axis, label the cumulative frequencies. For each class interval, locate the point where the upper boundary on the x-axis intersects with the cumulative frequency on the y-axis, and mark this point.

After all points are plotted, connect them with a smooth curve or straight lines to create the cumulative frequency graph, commonly referred to as an ogive. This graph provides a visual representation that facilitates the analysis of data distribution, making it easier to determine medians, quartiles, and percentiles.
