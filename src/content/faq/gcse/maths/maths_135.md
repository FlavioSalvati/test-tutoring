Let's clarify and enhance the content for better readability. Hereâ€™s the revised version:

The total time resulting from adding $1$ hour and $10$ minutes to $50$ minutes is $2$ hours.

To understand this calculation, we start by converting all time into minutes. We know that $1$ hour is equivalent to $60$ minutes. Therefore, we can express $1$ hour and $10$ minutes as:

$$
1 \text{ hour} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Next, we will add the additional $50$ minutes to this total:

$$
70 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Now, we need to convert these $120$ minutes back into hours and minutes. Since $1$ hour consists of $60$ minutes, we divide $120$ minutes by $60$ to determine how many hours this represents:

$$
120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours}.
$$

Thus, when we add $1$ hour and $10$ minutes to $50$ minutes, we arrive at a total of $2$ hours. 

This method of breaking down time into smaller units before performing addition or subtraction is very effective for solving similar problems. Always remember to convert to the same unit to maintain clarity and avoid confusion.
