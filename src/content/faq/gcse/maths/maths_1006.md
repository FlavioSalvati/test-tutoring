The equation of the line is given by 

$$
y = 3x - 5.
$$

To understand how this equation is derived, let's break it down further. The general form of a straight line's equation is 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $ m $ represents the slope (or gradient) of the line, and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

In our case, the slope $ m $ is specified as 3. This indicates that for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by 3 units. Additionally, the y-intercept $ c $ is provided as -5, which means the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, -5) $.

By substituting the known values of $ m $ and $ c $ into the general equation of the line, we arrive at:

$$
y = 3x + (-5),
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
y = 3x - 5.
$$

This equation implies that if you know the value of $ x $, you can determine the corresponding value of $ y $ by multiplying $ x $ by 3 and then subtracting 5. For instance, if $ x = 2 $, we can calculate:

$$
y = 3(2) - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1.
$$

Thus, the point $ (2, 1) $ lies on the line defined by the equation $ y = 3x - 5 $. This approach can be utilized to find any point on the line, making it a valuable tool for graphing and analyzing linear relationships.
