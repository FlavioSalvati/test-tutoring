The surface area of a compound solid composed of two cubes is influenced by their dimensions and the manner in which they are joined.

To calculate the surface area of such a compound solid, you must first ascertain the side lengths of the two cubes and their connection method. Let's denote the side lengths of Cube A and Cube B as $a$ and $b$, respectively.

If the cubes are separate and do not touch each other, the total surface area is simply the sum of the surface areas of both individual cubes. The surface area of a single cube can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 6 \times \text{side length}^2
$$

Thus, the combined surface area of the two cubes in this scenario would be:

$$
6a^2 + 6b^2
$$

However, if the cubes are joined together, the calculation becomes more complex. When two cubes are connected, some of their faces become hidden and are not included in the total surface area. For instance, if one face of Cube A is attached to one face of Cube B, both cubes lose one face from their overall surface area. In this case, the total surface area can be expressed as:

$$
6a^2 + 6b^2 - 2 \times (\text{area of the joined face})
$$

If the joined faces are squares, the area of the joined face will correspond to either $a^2$ or $b^2$, depending on which cube's face is being considered. 

In summary, the overall surface area of the compound solid is determined by the dimensions of the individual cubes and how they are connected. By thoroughly analyzing the configuration, you can compute the total surface area by adding the surface areas of the individual cubes and subtracting the area of any faces that are no longer exposed.
