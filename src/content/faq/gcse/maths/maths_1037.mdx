To accurately draw a 90-degree angle, you can use either a protractor or a set square. Both tools are designed to ensure precision in your drawings.

### Drawing a 90-Degree Angle Using a Protractor

Follow these steps to create a 90-degree angle with a protractor:

1. Position the midpoint of the protractor (the small hole or mark) at the vertex where you want the angle to be formed.
2. Align the baseline of the protractor with one of the lines that will make up the angle.
3. Locate the $90^\circ$ mark on the protractor, which is typically clearly labeled.
4. Make a small mark on your paper at this $90^\circ$ point.
5. Remove the protractor and use a ruler to draw a straight line from the vertex through the mark you just made. This line will form a $90^\circ$ angle with the original line.

### Drawing a 90-Degree Angle Using a Set Square

Alternatively, you can use a set square, a tool specifically designed for constructing right angles. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Place the set square on your paper so that one of its edges aligns with the line you want to use as the base for your angle.
2. Ensure that the right-angle corner of the set square is positioned at the point where you wish the vertex of the angle to be.
3. Draw along the other edge of the set square to establish the second line of the angle.
4. The two lines will then intersect to form a $90^\circ$ angle at the vertex.

Both methods are straightforward and will ensure that your $90^\circ$ angle is accurate. This precision is essential for many geometric constructions and proofs, particularly in GCSE Mathematics.
