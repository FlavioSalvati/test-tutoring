The inequality representing the statement "y is at least 6" is given as 

$$ 
y \geq 6. 
$$

In mathematics, inequalities are utilized to express the relationship between two values when they are not necessarily equal. The phrase "y is at least 6" implies that the value of $ y $ can be equal to 6 or any number larger than 6. To convey this relationship, we use the inequality symbol $ \geq $, which denotes "greater than or equal to."

When you encounter the expression 

$$ 
y \geq 6, 
$$ 

it indicates that $ y $ can take on values such as 6, 7, 8, or any number exceeding 6. This differs from the inequality 

$$ 
y > 6, 
$$ 

which stipulates that $ y $ must be strictly greater than 6 and cannot equal 6 itself. Inequalities play a crucial role in various domains of mathematics and are applicable in real-life scenarios, such as defining minimum requirements or setting constraints.

To visually represent this inequality on a number line, you would place a solid dot at 6 to signify that 6 is included in the solution set. Subsequently, you would shade the portion of the line extending to the right of 6 to indicate that all numbers greater than 6 are also included in the solution. This graphical representation effectively illustrates all possible values of $ y $ that satisfy the inequality 

$$ 
y \geq 6. 
$$
