The difference between $15.6$ and $7.4$ is $8.2$.

To ascertain the difference between two numbers, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one. In this particular instance, we subtract $7.4$ from $15.6$. When we organize this subtraction operation, it appears like this: $15.6 - 7.4$.

Firstly, it is critical to align the decimal points to ensure mathematical precision. Subsequently, subtract the digits in each column beginning from the rightmost digit. Here's the detailed process:

1. Subtract the digits in the tenths place: $6 - 4 = 2$.
2. Subtract the digits in the units place: $15 - 7 = 8$.

Hence, $15.6 - 7.4 = 8.2$.

This methodology is applicable for any pair of decimal numbers. It is always essential to align the decimal points and subtract each column of digits individually, commencing from the rightmost digit. If required, you may borrow from the adjacent column to the left, similar to subtraction involving whole numbers. This ensures that your result is both accurate and precise.
