The composition of functions is a mathematical process in which one function is applied to the output of another function.

To elaborate, when we compose two functions, denoted as $ f $ and $ g $, we create a new function by applying one function to the result of the other. This process is typically represented as $(f \circ g)(x)$, which is equivalent to $f(g(x))$. In this notation, we first evaluate the function $ g $ at the input $ x $, and subsequently apply the function $ f $ to the output $ g(x) $.

For instance, consider the functions $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $ and $ g(x) = x^2 $. The composition $(f \circ g)(x)$ can be computed as follows: 

1. First, we determine $ g(x) $, which yields $ x^2 $.
2. Next, we apply the function $ f $ to this result: 
   $$ f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = 2(x^2) + 3 = 2x^2 + 3. $$ 

Thus, we conclude that 
$$ (f \circ g)(x) = 2x^2 + 3. $$

It is crucial to note that the order of composition significantly impacts the result. In general, $(f \circ g)(x)$ is not the same as $(g \circ f)(x)$. Using the same functions from before, we can find $(g \circ f)(x)$:

1. First, we evaluate $ f(x) $, resulting in $ 2x + 3 $.
2. Next, we apply the function $ g $ to this output: 
   $$ g(f(x)) = g(2x + 3) = (2x + 3)^2. $$ 

Therefore, we find that 
$$ (g \circ f)(x) = (2x + 3)^2. $$

Understanding the composition of functions is essential in various fields of mathematics, as it aids in solving complex equations and analyzing real-world situations where multiple processes occur in succession.
