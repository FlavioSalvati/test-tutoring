To create a cumulative frequency curve, also known as an ogive, follow these steps: plot cumulative frequencies against the upper class boundaries and connect the points with a smooth curve.

### Step 1: Organize Your Data
Begin by organizing your data into a frequency table. This table should list the class intervals alongside their corresponding frequencies. To compute the cumulative frequency for each class interval, add the frequency of the current interval to the cumulative frequency of the previous interval. This process will yield a running total of frequencies up to each class interval.

### Step 2: Identify Upper Class Boundaries
Next, determine the upper class boundary for each interval. The upper class boundary represents the highest value that can belong to that particular class interval. For instance, if you have a class interval of $10-19$, the upper class boundary would be $19.5$, assuming you are working with continuous data.

### Step 3: Plotting the Cumulative Frequency
Now, you can plot the cumulative frequency against the upper class boundary for each interval on a graph. The x-axis will denote the upper class boundaries, while the y-axis will represent the cumulative frequencies. Start by plotting a point at the first upper class boundary along with its corresponding cumulative frequency. Continue this process for each subsequent upper class boundary and its cumulative frequency.

### Step 4: Connect the Points
Once you have plotted all the points, connect them using a smooth, continuous curve. This curve is your cumulative frequency curve, or ogive. It should begin at the lowest cumulative frequency and ascend to the highest, effectively illustrating the accumulation of data across the class intervals. Remember, the curve should be smooth and not jagged, as this accurately reflects the cumulative nature of the data.

By following these steps, you will successfully create a clear and informative cumulative frequency curve that represents your data effectively.
