The probability of drawing a red card followed by a black card without replacement is given by the fraction $\frac{26}{102}$, which is approximately $0.255$.

To clarify this process, letâ€™s break it down step by step. A standard deck of cards contains $52$ cards, consisting of $26$ red cards (hearts and diamonds) and $26$ black cards (clubs and spades). 

1. **Drawing the First Card**: When you draw the first card, the probability of it being red is calculated as follows:

   $$ P(\text{Red first}) = \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} \approx 0.5. $$

2. **Drawing the Second Card**: After a red card is drawn, there are now $51$ cards remaining in the deck. Of these, $25$ are red and $26$ are black. The probability of now drawing a black card is:

   $$ P(\text{Black second | Red first}) = \frac{26}{51}. $$

3. **Combined Probability**: To find the overall probability of both events occurring (drawing a red card first and then a black card), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event:

   $$ P(\text{Red first and Black second}) = P(\text{Red first}) \times P(\text{Black second | Red first}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{26}{51}\right) = \frac{26}{102}. $$

This fraction can be simplified:

$$ \frac{26}{102} = \frac{13}{51}, $$

which is approximately $0.255$ when expressed as a decimal. Therefore, there is about a $25.5\%$ chance of drawing a red card followed by a black card without replacement.
