The gradient of the function $ y = \cos(x) $ at the point $ x = 0 $ is equal to $0$.

To understand this, we must first recall that the gradient (or slope) of a function at a specific point is determined by its derivative at that point. The derivative of the function $ y = \cos(x) $ is given by 

$$
y' = -\sin(x).
$$

This derivative represents how the value of $ \cos(x) $ changes as the variable $ x $ varies.

Next, we need to evaluate this derivative at $ x = 0 $. By substituting $ x = 0 $ into the derivative $ y' = -\sin(x) $, we find:

$$
y' = -\sin(0).
$$

Since we know that $ \sin(0) = 0 $, it follows that 

$$
y' = -0 = 0.
$$

Thus, at $ x = 0 $, the gradient of the curve $ y = \cos(x) $ is indeed $0$. This indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the curve at this point is flat, meaning there is neither an incline nor a decline. 

This observation aligns with the graphical representation of $ \cos(x) $, which reaches a peak at $ x = 0 $. At this peak, the curve changes direction, and the tangent line is horizontal, further confirming that the gradient at this point is $0$.
