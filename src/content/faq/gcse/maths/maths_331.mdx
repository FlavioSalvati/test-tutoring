To interpret a drawing with a scale of 1:300, you need to multiply the measurements taken from the drawing by 300 to determine the actual dimensions in the real world.

When you encounter a 1:300 scale drawing, it indicates that each unit of measurement on the drawing corresponds to 300 units of the same measurement in reality. For instance, if a line on the drawing measures $1$ centimeter, it actually represents $300$ centimeters (or $3$ meters) in the real world. This scale is frequently utilized in architectural and engineering drawings to depict large objects or areas on a more manageable sheet of paper.

To interpret the drawing accurately, begin by measuring the length of any feature directly on the drawing using a ruler. Once you have this measurement, multiply it by $300$ to convert it to the actual size. For example, if a wall on the drawing measures $2$ centimeters, the actual length of the wall would be calculated as follows: 

$$
2 \, \text{cm} \times 300 = 600 \, \text{cm} \quad \text{or} \quad 6 \, \text{meters}.
$$

It is also essential to recognize that this scale applies uniformly in all directions. Thus, whether you are measuring the width, height, or any other dimension, you should consistently apply the same multiplication factor of $300$. This ensures that the proportions remain accurate and consistent with the real-world object or area being represented.

Always remember that the key to working effectively with scale drawings is to utilize the scale factor provided. In this case, the factor is $300$. This practice enables you to accurately interpret and convert the dimensions from the drawing to their real-world equivalents, facilitating a better understanding and visualization of the actual sizes of the objects or spaces depicted.
