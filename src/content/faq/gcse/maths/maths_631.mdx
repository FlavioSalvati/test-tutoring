A composite number is defined as a positive integer that has more than two distinct positive divisors.

In simpler terms, a composite number can be divided evenly by numbers other than just $1$ and itself. For example, the number $4$ is classified as composite because it can be evenly divided by $1$, $2$, and $4$. This contrasts with a prime number, which has exactly two distinct positive divisors: $1$ and itself. For instance, the number $5$ is a prime number since it can only be divided evenly by $1$ and $5$.

To determine if a number is composite, you can check for divisors other than $1$ and the number itself. Take the number $12$ as an example; it can be divided evenly by $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, and $12$, confirming that it is a composite number. Conversely, the number $7$ can only be divided by $1$ and $7$, making it a prime number.

Composite numbers begin with $4$, as $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and both $2$ and $3$ are classified as prime numbers. Some early examples of composite numbers include $4$, $6$, $8$, $9$, $10$, and $12$. Recognizing composite numbers is crucial in various fields of mathematics, particularly in factorization, where composite numbers are expressed as products of their prime factors. For example, the prime factorization of $12$ is given by $$2 \times 2 \times 3$$ or equivalently, $$2^2 \times 3$$.

A solid understanding of composite numbers is beneficial for solving problems related to divisibility, fractions, and algebra. Moreover, this knowledge lays the foundation for more advanced mathematical concepts such as the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM).
