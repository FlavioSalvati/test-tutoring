To draw a $45^\circ$ angle, you can either use a protractor or construct it using a compass and straightedge.

### Method 1: Using a Protractor

1. **Draw a Base Line**: Begin by drawing a straight line, which will serve as your base line.
2. **Position the Protractor**: Place the midpoint of the protractor at one end of the base line, ensuring that the base line aligns with the protractor's zero line.
3. **Locate the $45^\circ$ Mark**: Identify the $45^\circ$ mark on the protractor and make a small mark on your paper at this point.
4. **Draw the Angle**: Remove the protractor and draw a straight line from the end of the base line through the $45^\circ$ mark. This line forms a $45^\circ$ angle with the base line.

### Method 2: Using a Compass and Straightedge

1. **Draw a Base Line**: Start by drawing a straight line, which will be your base line, and mark a point on it.
2. **Create a Perpendicular Line**:
   - Position the compass point on the marked point and draw an arc that intersects the base line at two points.
   - Keeping the same compass width, place the compass point on each intersection point to draw two arcs above the base line.
   - Connect the intersection points of these arcs to the marked point on the base line. This creates a perpendicular line.
3. **Bisect the $90^\circ$ Angle**:
   - Place the compass point on the intersection of the base line and the perpendicular line.
   - Draw arcs that intersect both the base line and the perpendicular line.
   - Finally, draw a line connecting the intersection points of these arcs to the original point on the base line. This bisects the $90^\circ$ angle, resulting in two $45^\circ$ angles.

Both methods are effective for constructing a $45^\circ$ angle. The choice between them depends on the tools you have available and your comfort level with each technique.
