To calculate relative frequency, you divide the frequency of each event by the total number of observations.

Relative frequency provides insight into how often a specific event occurs in relation to the overall number of events. To perform this calculation, you will first need a frequency table, which enumerates the occurrences of each event or category.

For instance, consider a frequency table that displays the number of students who received various grades on a test. The table may appear as follows:

| Grade | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| A     | 5         |
| B     | 8         |
| C     | 12        |
| D     | 3         |
| F     | 2         |

To begin, you should calculate the total number of observations by summing all the frequencies. In this example, the total is calculated as:

$$
5 + 8 + 12 + 3 + 2 = 30.
$$

Next, to determine the relative frequency for each grade, divide the frequency of that grade by the total number of observations. For grade A, the relative frequency is computed as:

$$
\frac{5}{30} \approx 0.167 \text{ or } 16.7\%.
$$

Similarly, for grade B, the relative frequency is:

$$
\frac{8}{30} \approx 0.267 \text{ or } 26.7\%,
$$

and so forth for the remaining grades.

By converting raw frequencies into relative frequencies, you gain a clearer perspective for comparing the likelihood of different events. This approach is especially beneficial when working with large datasets or when you wish to compare information from various groups or categories.
