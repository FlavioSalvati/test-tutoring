The standard form, or scientific notation, of the number 45,000,000 is represented as $4.5 \times 10^7$.

The standard form, also referred to as scientific notation, offers a streamlined approach for writing excessively large or extremely small numbers. This technique proves to be particularly beneficial in disciplines like science and engineering, where these types of numbers are commonly encountered. The conversion of a number into standard form involves expressing it as the product of a number that falls between 1 and 10, and a power of 10.

Taking the number 45,000,000 as an example, we begin by pinpointing the significant figures, which in this case are $4.5$. Subsequently, we calculate the number of positions the decimal point must shift to revert $4.5$ back to 45,000,000. In this case, the decimal point is moved 7 places to the right. Hence, the power of 10 is $7$, and the number is represented in standard form as $4.5 \times 10^7$.

This technique greatly simplifies computations and enhances the readability and comparison of extremely large or small numbers. For instance, instead of writing out all the zeros in 45,000,000, you can succinctly represent it as $4.5 \times 10^7$. This representation is not only compact but also more convenient for mathematical operations.
