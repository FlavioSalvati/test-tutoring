The range of the function $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $ encompasses all real numbers.

To comprehend why the range of $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $ is indeed all real numbers, letâ€™s analyze it step by step. The function $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $ is a linear function, which means its graph is represented by a straight line on a coordinate plane. This equation is structured in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the slope and $ c $ represents the y-intercept. In this particular case, the slope $ m $ equals $2$, and the y-intercept $ c $ is $3$.

Linear functions, such as this one, extend infinitely in both the positive and negative directions along the y-axis. Consequently, for any chosen value of $ x $, there will always be a corresponding $ y $ value obtained by substituting $ x $ into the equation. For instance, if we take $ x = 0 $, we find that:

$$
f(0) = 2(0) + 3 = 3.
$$

Similarly, if $ x = 1 $:

$$
f(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5,
$$

and for $ x = -1 $:

$$
f(-1) = 2(-1) + 3 = 1.
$$

Since there are no constraints on the values that $ x $ can assume, and given that the function is linear, the output $ y $ can take on any real number value. Therefore, we conclude that the range of $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $ is all real numbers. In mathematical notation, we express the range as $ (-\infty, \infty) $. This indicates that for every possible value of $ x $, the function will yield a corresponding $ y $ value somewhere along the real number line.
