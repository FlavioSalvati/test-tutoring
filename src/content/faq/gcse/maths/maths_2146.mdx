To solve the simultaneous equations, we can employ either the substitution method or the elimination method. In this instance, we will utilize the elimination method to solve the equations:

$$
x + 2y = 6 \tag{1}
$$

$$
2x - y = 3 \tag{2}
$$

Our first step is to eliminate one of the variables. We can achieve this by adjusting the coefficients of $ y $ in both equations so that they are equal. To do this, we will multiply the second equation by $2$:

$$
2(2x - y) = 2(3)
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
4x - 2y = 6 \tag{3}
$$

Now we have the revised system of equations:

$$
x + 2y = 6 \tag{1}
$$

$$
4x - 2y = 6 \tag{3}
$$

Next, we will add the two equations together to eliminate $ y $:

$$
(x + 2y) + (4x - 2y) = 6 + 6
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
5x = 12
$$

Now, we can solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4
$$

With $ x $ determined, we will substitute $ x = 2.4 $ back into the first equation to find the value of $ y $:

$$
2.4 + 2y = 6
$$

Subtracting $ 2.4 $ from both sides gives:

$$
2y = 6 - 2.4
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
2y = 3.6
$$

Now, we solve for $ y $:

$$
y = \frac{3.6}{2} = 1.8
$$

Therefore, the solution to the simultaneous equations is:

$$
x = 2.4 \quad \text{and} \quad y = 1.8
$$
