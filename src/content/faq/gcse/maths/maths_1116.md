Each interior angle of a regular octagon measures $135^\circ$.

To comprehend why each interior angle in a regular octagon is $135^\circ$, we must explore some basic principles of geometry. A regular octagon is defined as a polygon with eight equal sides and eight equal angles. The formula to calculate the measure of an interior angle in a regular polygon is given by:

$$
\text{Interior Angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
$$

where $n$ represents the number of sides.

For an octagon, we substitute $n = 8$ into the formula:

$$
\text{Interior Angle} = \frac{(8-2) \times 180^\circ}{8} = \frac{6 \times 180^\circ}{8} = \frac{1080^\circ}{8} = 135^\circ
$$

Thus, each interior angle in a regular octagon measures $135^\circ$.

To further clarify, the expression $(n-2) \times 180^\circ$ calculates the total sum of all interior angles in the polygon. For an octagon, this sum is:

$$
(8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
$$

Since all angles in a regular octagon are equal, we divide this total sum by the number of angles, which is $8$. This division yields each angle measuring $135^\circ$.

This method can be utilized for any regular polygon to determine the measures of its interior angles. Understanding this concept is essential for solving various geometric problems, particularly those related to polygons.
