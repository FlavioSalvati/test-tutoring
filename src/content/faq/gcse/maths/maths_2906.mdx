To express probability as a fraction, you divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.

Probability quantifies how likely an event is to occur. When calculating probability as a fraction, you need to identify two essential components: the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes. The favorable outcomes represent the specific results you are interested in, while the total outcomes encompass all possible results that could occur in the given scenario.

For instance, consider rolling a fair six-sided die and wanting to determine the probability of rolling a $4$. There is only one favorable outcome (rolling a $4$) among six possible outcomes (rolling a $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, or $6$). Therefore, the probability of rolling a $4$ is given by:

$$
P(\text{rolling a } 4) = \frac{1}{6}
$$

To generalize, the probability $ P $ of an event can be expressed using the formula:

$$
P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

This fraction can sometimes be simplified. For example, if you draw a card from a standard deck of $52$ cards and wish to find the probability of drawing a heart, there are $13$ hearts in the deck. Thus, the probability is:

$$
P(\text{drawing a heart}) = \frac{13}{52}
$$

This fraction can be simplified to:

$$
\frac{1}{4}
$$

Understanding how to represent probability as a fraction enables you to analyze and compare the likelihood of different events in a clear and precise manner.
