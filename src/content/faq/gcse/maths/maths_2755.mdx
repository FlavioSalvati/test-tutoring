To determine the angles that satisfy the equation $\tan(x) = 1$, we use the formulas:

$$
x = 45^\circ + 180^\circ n \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\pi}{4} + \pi n,
$$

where $n$ is any integer.

To understand why these angles are valid solutions, we need to consider the fundamental properties of the tangent function. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. When $\tan(x) = 1$, it implies that the opposite and adjacent sides are equal. This scenario occurs at an angle of $45^\circ$ (or $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians) in the first quadrant.

Moreover, the tangent function exhibits periodic behavior with a period of $180^\circ$ (or $\pi$ radians). This periodicity means that the values of the tangent function repeat every $180^\circ$. Therefore, if $\tan(x) = 1$ at $45^\circ$, it will also equal $1$ at $225^\circ$ (which is $45^\circ + 180^\circ$), and this pattern continues indefinitely. This leads us to the general formula:

$$
x = 45^\circ + 180^\circ n,
$$

where $n$ can be any integer, including $0, \pm 1, \pm 2$, and so forth.

In terms of radians, the angle $45^\circ$ is equivalent to $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians. Thus, the angles that satisfy $\tan(x) = 1$ in radians are expressed as:

$$
x = \frac{\pi}{4} + \pi n,
$$

where $n$ is any integer.

Using these formulas allows us to find all angles that fulfill the equation $\tan(x) = 1$. For instance, if we set $n = 0$, we obtain $45^\circ$ or $\frac{\pi}{4}$. If we set $n = 1$, we find $225^\circ$ or $\frac{5\pi}{4}$, and this process can be repeated for other integer values of $n$. This method guarantees that we encompass all possible solutions within the infinite set of angles for which the tangent function equals $1$.
