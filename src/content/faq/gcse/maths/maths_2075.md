The factorized form of the expression $8c - 16$ is $8(c - 2)$.

To factor the expression $8c - 16$, we first need to identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms involved. The terms here are $8c$ and $-16$. The GCF of the coefficients $8$ and $16$ is $8$. This indicates that we can factor out $8$ from both terms.

When we factor $8$ out of $8c$, we are left with $c$. Similarly, when we factor $8$ out of $-16$, we obtain $-2$. Thus, we can express the original expression as:

$$
8c - 16 = 8(c - 2).
$$

Factoring is an essential skill in algebra because it simplifies expressions and can facilitate the process of solving equations. By identifying common factors, you can break down complex expressions into more manageable components. This technique is particularly advantageous when dealing with quadratic equations or simplifying algebraic fractions. Always remember to look for the highest common factor to factor expressions effectively.
