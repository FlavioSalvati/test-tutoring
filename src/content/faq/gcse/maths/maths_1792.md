To arrange decimal numbers in descending order, you should compare each digit from left to right, beginning with the whole number part.

Consider the following example with the decimal numbers $3.45$, $2.78$, and $3.56$. Start by examining the whole number portions: $3$, $2$, and $3$. Since $3$ is greater than $2$, the numbers that begin with $3$ will be positioned ahead of those that start with $2$.

Next, for the numbers that share the same whole number, compare their decimal parts. In our example, we have $3.45$ and $3.56$. Focus on the digits following the decimal point, starting with the tenths place: $4$ (from $3.45$) and $5$ (from $3.56$). Since $5$ is greater than $4$, this means that $3.56$ ranks higher than $3.45$. Therefore, at this stage, the order is $3.56$, $3.45$, and then $2.78$.

In cases where the tenths digits are identical, you should proceed to compare the hundredths place. For instance, if you were comparing $3.45$ and $3.46$, you would find that the tenths digits are the same ($4$), so you would then look at the hundredths digits: $5$ and $6$. Since $6$ is greater than $5$, it follows that $3.46$ precedes $3.45$.

It's important to remember that descending order means arranging from largest to smallest. Always start with the largest whole number, and then refine the order by examining the decimal places. This systematic approach will ensure that you accurately arrange the decimal numbers from the highest to the lowest value.
