The period of the function $ y = 2\sin(x) $ is $ 2\pi $.

In trigonometry, the period of a sine function indicates the length of the interval over which the function completes one full cycle. For the standard sine function $ \sin(x) $, this period is $ 2\pi $. This means that the function repeats its values every $ 2\pi $ units along the x-axis.

When analyzing the function $ y = 2\sin(x) $, it is important to note that the coefficient $ 2 $ in front of the sine function influences the amplitude rather than the period. The amplitude refers to the maximum value that the function attains, which, in this case, is $ 2 $. However, the period remains unchanged because the period of a sine function is determined by the coefficient of $ x $ within the sine function, rather than any coefficient that multiplies the sine function itself.

In summary, the period of $ y = 2\sin(x) $ is identical to that of $ \sin(x) $, which is $ 2\pi $. Consequently, the function $ y = 2\sin(x) $ will repeat its pattern every $ 2\pi $ units along the x-axis. Grasping this concept is essential for effectively analyzing and graphing trigonometric functions.
