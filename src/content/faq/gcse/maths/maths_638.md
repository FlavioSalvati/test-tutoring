To convert a percentage to a fraction, you divide the percentage by $100$ and simplify the fraction if possible.

A percentage indicates a ratio "per hundred." For instance, $25\%$ signifies $25$ out of $100$. To express this as a fraction, you write it as $\frac{25}{100}$. This fraction can often be simplified by identifying the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. In this case, both $25$ and $100$ can be divided by $25$, allowing us to simplify $\frac{25}{100}$ to $\frac{1}{4}$.

Letâ€™s consider another example: $60\%$. First, we write it as $\frac{60}{100}$. To simplify, we need to find the GCD of $60$ and $100$, which is $20$. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $20$ yields $\frac{3}{5}$. Thus, $60\%$ can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{3}{5}$.

For percentages that are not whole numbers, such as $12.5\%$, you can apply the same process. Begin by writing $12.5\%$ as $\frac{12.5}{100}$. To eliminate the decimal, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $10$, transforming it into $\frac{125}{1000}$. Next, simplify by finding the GCD, which in this case is $125$, resulting in $\frac{1}{8}$.

In summary, the essential steps for converting a percentage to a fraction are:
1. Write the percentage as a fraction over $100$.
2. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD.
3. If the fraction contains decimals, eliminate them by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator appropriately.

This method is effective for converting any percentage into a fraction, making it a reliable approach for this task.
