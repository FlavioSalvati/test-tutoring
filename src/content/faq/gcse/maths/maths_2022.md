You will receive £15.25 in change from £50 after spending £34.75.

To determine the change from £50 after making a purchase of £34.75, you need to subtract the amount spent from the initial total. This is a straightforward subtraction problem.

Begin by noting the total amount you have, which is £50.00, and the amount you spent, which is £34.75. Set up the subtraction as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
  50.00 \\
- 34.75 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

To simplify the subtraction, you can express £50.00 as £49.99 + £0.01. This allows you to first subtract £34.75 from £49.99, and then add the £0.01 back to the result.

Now, let's perform the subtraction of £34.75 from £49.99:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
  49.99 \\
- 34.75 \\
\hline
  15.24 \\
\end{array}
$$

Next, add the £0.01 back to the result:

$$
15.24 + 0.01 = 15.25
$$

Thus, the change you will receive is £15.25. This approach not only ensures accurate subtraction, especially when dealing with decimal numbers, but also enhances your confidence in managing money and performing calculations in everyday situations. Regular practice of these steps will improve your skills further.
