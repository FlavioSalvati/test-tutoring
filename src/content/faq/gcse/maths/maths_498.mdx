To determine the length of the vector $(-7, 24)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to calculate its magnitude.

The length of a vector, often referred to as its magnitude, can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For a vector with components $(x, y)$, the formula to find its length is given by:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

In this particular case, the components of the vector are $x = -7$ and $y = 24$.

First, we need to square each component:

$$
(-7)^2 = 49 \quad \text{and} \quad 24^2 = 576.
$$

Next, we sum these squared values together:

$$
49 + 576 = 625.
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the magnitude:

$$
\sqrt{625} = 25.
$$

Therefore, the length of the vector $(-7, 24)$ is $25$. This method can be applied to any two-dimensional vector and is a fundamental principle in vector mathematics.
