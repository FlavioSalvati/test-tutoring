The negative exponent rule states that a negative exponent signifies the reciprocal of the base raised to the corresponding positive exponent.

When you encounter a negative exponent, it indicates that you should take the reciprocal (or inverse) of the base and then raise it to the positive version of that exponent. For instance, if you have $a^{-n}$, it is equivalent to $\frac{1}{a^n}$. This rule is particularly useful for simplifying expressions and solving equations that involve powers.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Consider the expression $2^{-3}$. According to the negative exponent rule, this can be rewritten as 

$$ 
2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3}. 
$$ 

Calculating $2^3$ yields $8$, therefore 

$$ 
2^{-3} = \frac{1}{8}. 
$$ 

This rule proves invaluable when working with algebraic expressions and scientific notation. For example, if you encounter $x^{-4}$, you can express it as 

$$ 
x^{-4} = \frac{1}{x^4}. 
$$ 

This transformation simplifies the manipulation of expressions, particularly when solving equations or dealing with fractions.

Grasping the negative exponent rule is essential for GCSE Maths, as it frequently appears across various topics, including indices, algebra, and even certain geometry problems. Remember, the fundamental concept is that a negative exponent converts the base into its reciprocal and changes the exponent to positive. This straightforward yet powerful rule can significantly simplify complex problems, making them far more manageable.
