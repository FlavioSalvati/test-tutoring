A terminating decimal is characterized by a finite number of digits following the decimal point.

To determine whether a decimal is terminating, one can examine its fractional representation. A decimal is considered terminating if, when the fraction is expressed in its simplest form, the denominator contains only the prime factors $2$ and/or $5$. For example, the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$ simplifies to $0.125$. In this case, $8$ can be expressed as $2^3$, which confirms that it consists solely of the prime factor $2$. Thus, $0.125$ is a terminating decimal.

Another method to verify if a decimal is terminating is to perform the division to convert the fraction into a decimal. If the division process concludes after a finite number of steps, yielding a limited number of decimal digits, then the decimal is indeed terminating. For instance, $\frac{1}{4}$ equals $0.25$, which terminates after two decimal places.

On the other hand, if the denominator of the fraction in its simplest form includes any prime factors other than $2$ or $5$, the resulting decimal will be non-terminating and repeating. An example of this is $\frac{1}{3}$, which yields $0.333...$, a decimal that continues indefinitely.

By understanding these principles, you can quickly ascertain whether a decimal representation will terminate or repeat. This skill is valuable in various mathematical contexts.
