To determine the volume of a compound solid that consists of a rectangular base topped with a cylindrical section, you can find the total volume by summing the volumes of both components.

**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Rectangular Base**

The volume $ V $ of a rectangular prism can be calculated using the formula:

$$ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} $$

First, measure the length, width, and height of the rectangular base. Then, multiply these three dimensions together to obtain the volume of the rectangular section.

**Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Cylindrical Top**

Next, you will compute the volume $ V $ of the cylindrical section. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is given by:

$$ V = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} $$

Measure the radius of the cylinder's base, which should match the width of the rectangular base if the cylinder is perfectly positioned on top. Also, measure the height of the cylinder. To find the volume of the cylindrical part, square the radius, multiply the result by $ \pi $ (approximately $ 3.14159 $), and then multiply by the height of the cylinder.

**Step 3: Combine the Volumes**

Finally, add together the volumes of the rectangular base and the cylindrical top to obtain the total volume of the compound solid. This approach ensures that you account for both distinct shapes within the solid. 

Be sure to maintain consistent units throughout your calculations to ensure accuracy in your final result.
