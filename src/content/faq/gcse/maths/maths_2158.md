The inequality stating that "p is greater than or equal to 8" is expressed mathematically as 

$$
p \geq 8.
$$ 

In mathematics, inequalities are utilized to illustrate the relationship between two values when they are not equal. The symbol $ \geq $ denotes "greater than or equal to," indicating that the variable $ p $ can take on any value that is either greater than 8 or exactly equal to 8.

For instance, if we set $ p = 8 $, the inequality $ p \geq 8 $ is satisfied because 8 is equal to 8. Similarly, if $ p = 10 $, the inequality remains valid since 10 is greater than 8. Conversely, if $ p = 7 $, the inequality does not hold because 7 is less than 8.

When graphing this inequality on a number line, you would place a solid dot at 8 to indicate that this value is included in the solution set. You would then shade the region to the right of 8, illustrating that all numbers greater than 8 are also part of the solution set.

Grasping the concept of inequalities is essential for solving a wide range of real-world problems. This includes determining minimum requirements for tasks or establishing boundaries for acceptable values in various situations. By mastering inequalities, you can enhance your ability to analyze and interpret diverse mathematical and practical scenarios effectively.
