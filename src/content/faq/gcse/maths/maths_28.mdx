When it comes to dividing fractions, the essential step is to employ the reciprocal of the second fraction. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by interchanging its numerator and denominator. For instance, the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{3}$.

Suppose you are tasked with dividing $\frac{2}{5}$ by $\frac{3}{7}$. The initial step would be to determine the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{7}$, which is $\frac{7}{3}$. Next, you would multiply $\frac{2}{5}$ by $\frac{7}{3}$. The process of multiplying fractions involves multiplying the numerators together and doing the same with the denominators. Hence, $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{2 \times 7}{5 \times 3} = \frac{14}{15}$.

Always ensure to simplify the fractions when possible. In this instance, $\frac{14}{15}$ is already in its simplest form. However, if you encounter a fraction such as $\frac{8}{12}$, you should simplify it by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which, in this case, is 4. This results in $\frac{2}{3}$.

The method described above is applicable to all fractions, including mixed numbers. If you have a mixed number, you should first convert it to an improper fraction. For example, to divide $1 \frac{1}{2}$ by $\frac{3}{4}$, you would first convert $1 \frac{1}{2}$ to $\frac{3}{2}$. Then, you would follow the reciprocal method: $\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{12}{6} = 2$.

By adhering to these steps, you will be well-equipped to divide any fractions you come across confidently.
