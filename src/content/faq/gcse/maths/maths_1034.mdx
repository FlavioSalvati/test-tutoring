To determine the surface area of a cylinder, you need to sum the areas of its two circular bases and its curved surface (also referred to as the lateral surface).

A cylinder consists of two primary components: the circular bases and the curved surface. To compute the total surface area, you will calculate the area of each component separately and then combine them.

First, we calculate the area of the two circular bases. The formula for the area of a circle is given by:

$$
\text{Area of a circle} = \pi r^2
$$

where $ r $ represents the radius of the circle. Since a cylinder has two bases, we multiply the area of one circle by 2:

$$
\text{Area of bases} = 2 \pi r^2
$$

Next, we need to determine the area of the curved surface. To visualize this, imagine unfolding the curved surface of the cylinder into a rectangle. The height of this rectangle corresponds to the height $ h $ of the cylinder, while the width is equivalent to the circumference of the base circle, which is calculated as $ 2 \pi r $. The area of this rectangle, representing the curved surface, is:

$$
\text{Area of curved surface} = 2 \pi r h
$$

Finally, to find the total surface area of the cylinder, we add the areas of the two bases and the curved surface:

$$
\text{Total surface area} = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h
$$

For simplification, we can factor out $ 2 \pi r $ from this equation:

$$
\text{Total surface area} = 2 \pi r (r + h)
$$

Thus, the surface area of a cylinder is expressed by the formula:

$$
\text{Surface area} = 2 \pi r (r + h)
$$

where $ r $ is the radius and $ h $ is the height of the cylinder.
