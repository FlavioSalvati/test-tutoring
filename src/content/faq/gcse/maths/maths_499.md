The magnitude of the vector $(11, 60)$ is approximately $61$.

To calculate the magnitude of a vector, we apply the Pythagorean theorem. The vector $(11, 60)$ can be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the lengths of the two perpendicular sides are $11$ and $60$. The magnitude of the vector corresponds to the length of this hypotenuse.

The formula for finding the magnitude of a vector $(a, b)$ is given by:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$

In our case, we have $a = 11$ and $b = 60$. To find the magnitude, we first square both values, then sum the results, and finally take the square root of that sum.

Let's perform the calculations step by step:

1. Calculate the squares:
   - $11^2 = 121$,
   - $60^2 = 3600$.

2. Next, add these squares together:
   $$
   121 + 3600 = 3721.
   $$

3. Finally, take the square root of $3721$:
   $$
   \sqrt{3721} = 61.
   $$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(11, 60)$ is indeed $61$.

Understanding how to calculate the magnitude of a vector is crucial in various fields of mathematics and physics. It allows you to determine the length or size of the vector, which can represent quantities such as force, velocity, or displacement.
