To determine the area of a rectangle, you need to multiply its length by its width.

The area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
$$

This formula is effective because a rectangle is defined as a shape with opposite sides that are equal in length, and the area represents the total space enclosed within the shape.

For instance, consider a rectangle with a length of $5$ metres and a width of $3$ metres. To calculate the area, you simply multiply these two dimensions:

$$
5 \text{ metres} \times 3 \text{ metres} = 15 \text{ square metres}
$$

The outcome, $15$ square metres, indicates the total area contained within the rectangle.

It's crucial to ensure that both measurements are in the same units prior to performing the multiplication. If the length is given in centimetres and the width in metres, you will need to convert one of the measurements so that both are in the same unit. For example, if the length is $200$ centimetres and the width is $3$ metres, convert the length to metres:

$$
200 \text{ cm} = 2 \text{ metres}
$$

Then, you can multiply the two dimensions:

$$
2 \text{ metres} \times 3 \text{ metres} = 6 \text{ square metres}
$$

This approach is applicable to all rectangles, irrespective of their size. Whether you are calculating the area of a small picture frame or a large football pitch, the underlying principle remains consistent. By grasping and utilizing this straightforward formula, you can easily determine the area of any rectangle you encounter.
