To convert degrees to radians, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right)
$$

This conversion works because there are $180$ degrees in $\pi$ radians. For instance, if you want to convert an angle of $90$ degrees to radians, you would perform the calculation:

$$
90 \times \left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ radians}
$$

Most scientific calculators are equipped with a built-in function to facilitate the conversion from degrees to radians. You can typically find this function by looking for a button labeled "DRG" or "Mode," which allows you to switch between degrees, radians, and sometimes gradians. Once you set your calculator to radians mode, you can simply enter the degree value, and the calculator will automatically convert it to radians for you.

If you happen to be using a basic calculator that does not have this conversion function, you can still manually convert degrees to radians. To do this, multiply the degree value by $\pi$ and then divide by $180$. For example, to convert $45$ degrees to radians, you would calculate:

$$
45 \times \left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ radians}
$$

Understanding how to convert between degrees and radians is crucial in fields such as trigonometry and calculus, as many mathematical functions and equations utilize radians. By practicing these conversions, you will become more comfortable with different units of angle measurement and enhance your mathematical skills.
