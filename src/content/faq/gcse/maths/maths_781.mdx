To find the square root of $49$ using a calculator, follow these steps:

1. Locate the square root function, typically represented by the symbol $\sqrt{}$. This button is generally found on the keypad of most scientific calculators. 
2. If you are using a basic calculator, you may need to press a "shift" or "2nd" key to access the square root function, as it may be a secondary feature of another button.

Once you have identified the square root button, proceed as follows:

- Press the square root button ($\sqrt{}$).
- Enter the number for which you wish to calculate the square root. In this instance, you would input $49$.
- Finally, press the equals button ($=$) to obtain the result.

The display should show the number $7$, since the square root of $49$ is $7$.

If you are using a graphical or more advanced calculator, the procedure might differ slightly. You may need to enter the number first before pressing the square root button. If you are ever uncertain, it's advisable to consult your calculator's manual for specific instructions.

Remember, the square root of a number is defined as a value that, when multiplied by itself, yields the original number. For example, for $49$, we have:

$$
7 \times 7 = 49
$$

This confirms that $7$ is indeed the square root of $49$.
