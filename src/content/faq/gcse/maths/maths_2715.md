To determine a missing side of a right-angled triangle using Pythagoras' Theorem, you can apply the formula 

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
$$

Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry specifically applicable to right-angled triangles. It states that in such a triangle, the square of the hypotenuse's length (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this formula, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides.

To find a missing side, first determine whether you need to find the hypotenuse or one of the other sides. If your goal is to find the hypotenuse, you can rearrange the formula to solve for $c$:

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
$$

For instance, if one side measures $3$ units and the other measures $4$ units, you would calculate the hypotenuse as follows:

$$
c = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \text{ units}.
$$

If you need to find one of the other sides, rearrange the formula accordingly. For example, if the hypotenuse is $10$ units and one side is $6$ units, you would use the rearranged formula to find $a$:

$$
a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}.
$$

The calculation would then be:

$$
a = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8 \text{ units}.
$$

It is essential to verify that the triangle in question is indeed a right-angled triangle before applying Pythagoras' Theorem, as this theorem is applicable solely in such cases. Practicing with various sets of numbers will enhance your familiarity and comfort with this mathematical process.
