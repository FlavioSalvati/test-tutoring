Translating a point by the vector $(-4, 5)$ shifts it 4 units to the left and 5 units upward.

In geometric terms, translation refers to the process of moving a point or shape without altering its orientation or size. When translating a point using a vector, you add the vector's components to the coordinates of the point. For instance, if you have a point with coordinates $(x, y)$ and you translate it by the vector $(-4, 5)$, the calculations proceed as follows:

$$
\text{New x-coordinate} = x - 4
$$
$$
\text{New y-coordinate} = y + 5
$$

To illustrate, letâ€™s say your original point is $(3, 2)$. By translating it with the vector $(-4, 5)$, you would calculate:

$$
\text{New x-coordinate} = 3 - 4 = -1
$$
$$
\text{New y-coordinate} = 2 + 5 = 7
$$

Thus, the new coordinates of the point after translation would be $(-1, 7)$.

This translation can be visually represented on a coordinate grid. Start at the original point, move 4 units to the left (due to the $-4$ in the vector), and then move 5 units upward (because of the $+5$ in the vector). The position you arrive at is the location of your translated point.

Understanding translations is crucial in GCSE Maths, as it provides a foundation for grasping more complex geometric concepts and coordinate systems. Additionally, it serves as a stepping stone to learn about other transformations, such as rotations, reflections, and enlargements.
