The formula for calculating the slope of a line is given by the ratio of the change in the y-coordinates to the change in the x-coordinates, expressed as:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

To determine the slope, you need two distinct points on the line, typically represented as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The slope, commonly denoted by the letter $m$, quantifies the steepness of the line. The mathematical representation for the slope is:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

This formula computes the "rise" (the change in the y-coordinates) over the "run" (the change in the x-coordinates). In essence, it indicates how much the y-value increases or decreases for each unit change in the x-value.

For instance, consider two points on a line, $(1, 2)$ and $(4, 6)$. By assigning the values $x_1 = 1$, $y_1 = 2$, $x_2 = 4$, and $y_2 = 6$ to these coordinates, you can substitute them into the slope formula:

$$
m = \frac{6 - 2}{4 - 1} = \frac{4}{3}
$$

Therefore, the slope of the line that passes through these points is $\frac{4}{3}$.

Grasping the concept of slope is essential in GCSE Maths, as it allows you to analyze the relationship between variables in linear equations. A positive slope indicates that the line is rising, while a negative slope signifies that it is falling. A slope of zero represents a horizontal line, and an undefined slope (which occurs when the denominator is zero) corresponds to a vertical line. Understanding these concepts lays the groundwork for more advanced mathematical topics, including calculus and coordinate geometry.
