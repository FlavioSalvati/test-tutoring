To create a scale drawing of a playground, begin by measuring the actual dimensions of the playground and its various features, such as swings, slides, and benches. 

First, gather the necessary tools, such as a tape measure or a measuring wheel, to ensure you obtain accurate measurements. Carefully record the length and width of each feature, as well as the distances between them.

Next, select an appropriate scale for your drawing. A commonly used scale for playgrounds is $1:100$, where $1 \text{ cm}$ on the drawing represents $100 \text{ cm}$ (or $1 \text{ metre}$) in real life. This scale makes it easier to fit the entire playground onto a single sheet of paper.

Now, convert the actual measurements into scale measurements. For instance, if a slide measures $300 \text{ cm}$ in reality, it will be represented as $3 \text{ cm}$ on your drawing, calculated as follows:

$$
300 \text{ cm} \div 100 = 3 \text{ cm}.
$$

Carry out this conversion for all the features and distances you have measured.

To aid in accurately placing each feature, draw a grid on your paper. Each square on the grid can represent a specific number of centimeters or meters, depending on the scale you chose. Start by outlining the perimeter of the playground, and then proceed to add each feature in its correct position based on your scaled measurements.

Finally, label each feature clearly and include any necessary details, such as the names of the equipment or the type of surface (for example, grass or sand). This will enhance the clarity and comprehensibility of your scale drawing.
