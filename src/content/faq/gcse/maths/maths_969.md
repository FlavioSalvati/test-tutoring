The y-intercept of the equation $ y = 3x + 6 $ is $ 6 $.

To determine the y-intercept of a linear equation such as $ y = 3x + 6 $, it is essential to recognize what the y-intercept signifies. The y-intercept is the point where the line intersects the y-axis, which occurs when the value of $ x $ is $ 0 $.

To find the y-intercept in the equation $ y = 3x + 6 $, substitute $ x $ with $ 0 $. The equation then simplifies as follows:

$$ 
y = 3(0) + 6 
$$

This further reduces to:

$$ 
y = 6 
$$

Hence, the y-intercept is $ 6 $.

In general, for any linear equation in the form $ y = mx + c $, the y-intercept corresponds to the constant term $ c $. For our specific equation $ y = 3x + 6 $, the constant term is indeed $ 6 $. This indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, 6) $.

Understanding the y-intercept is vital for graphing linear equations and analyzing their behavior. It provides a starting point on the graph, aiding in visualizing the line's trajectory. For instance, knowing that the y-intercept is $ 6 $ informs us that the line begins at the point $ (0, 6) $ on the y-axis and will rise or fall depending on the slope, which is $ 3 $ in this scenario.
