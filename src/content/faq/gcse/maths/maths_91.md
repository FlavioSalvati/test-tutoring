Direct proportion refers to a relationship between two quantities where an increase in one quantity results in a proportional increase in the other quantity, at a constant rate.

To elaborate, when two quantities are directly proportional, their ratio remains constant as they change. For instance, if you double one quantity, the other quantity doubles as well. This relationship is mathematically represented by the equation:

$$
y = kx
$$

Here, $y$ and $x$ denote the two quantities, while $k$ represents the constant of proportionality.

Consider a practical example: if you are purchasing apples, and each apple costs 50p, then the cost behaves in a directly proportional manner to the number of apples purchased. For instance, if you buy 1 apple, the cost is 50p; if you purchase 2 apples, the total cost is £1; and if you buy 3 apples, it amounts to £1.50. In this scenario, the constant of proportionality $k$ is 50p per apple.

When graphed, relationships characterized by direct proportion are represented as straight lines that pass through the origin (0,0). This characteristic occurs because if one quantity is zero, the other must also be zero, thereby maintaining a constant ratio. For example, if you plot the number of apples on the x-axis and the total cost on the y-axis, you will observe a straight line originating from the origin.

Understanding direct proportion is essential in numerous real-life contexts, such as currency conversion, speed calculation, or recipe adjustments. This knowledge enables you to predict one quantity based on the other, simplifying various problem-solving scenarios.
