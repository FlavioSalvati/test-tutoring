The value of the mathematical expression $(2^4)^3$ is 4096.

To better comprehend why $(2^4)^3$ equates to 4096, we can deconstruct it into simpler steps. Initially, we have to determine the value of the expression within the parentheses, namely $2^4$. This denotes the multiplication of 2 by itself for four times, expressed as $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$. After performing this multiplication, the result is 16. As such, we find that $2^4 = 16$.

The subsequent step requires us to exponentiate this outcome, $16$, to the power of $3$, represented as $16^3$. This denotes the multiplication of 16 by itself thrice, expressed as $16 \times 16 \times 16$. To simplify the process, we can perform this multiplication in stages. Initially, compute $16 \times 16$, which totals to 256. Then, multiply this outcome by 16 once more, yielding $256 \times 16$.

To make the multiplication of 256 by 16 more manageable, we can break it down further:
\begin{align*}
256 \times 16 &= 256 \times (10 + 6) = (256 \times 10) + (256 \times 6), \\
256 \times 10 &= 2560, \\
256 \times 6 &= 1536, \\
2560 + 1536 &= 4096.
\end{align*}

Hence, we find that $16^3 = 4096$. Therefore, it follows that $(2^4)^3 = 4096$.

Another method to tackle this problem is by employing the exponentiation rules. According to the power of a power rule, $(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$. In this instance, we have $a = 2$, $m = 4$, and $n = 3$. Consequently, we find $(2^4)^3 = 2^{4 \times 3} = 2^{12}$. Direct computation of $2^{12}$ also yields 4096, thereby confirming our previous result.
