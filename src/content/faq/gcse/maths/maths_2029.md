Let's clarify and enhance the content for better readability and understanding.

The total cost of purchasing 4 items, each priced at £7.99, amounts to £31.96.

To calculate the total cost for multiple items, you need to multiply the price of a single item by the quantity of items. In this scenario, the price per item is £7.99, and you are buying 4 items. Therefore, you can perform the multiplication as follows:

$$
7.99 \times 4 = 31.96
$$

This calculation shows that buying 4 items at £7.99 each will result in a total expenditure of £31.96.

Let’s break this calculation down further for clarity. When you multiply £7.99 by 4, you might consider rounding the price to £8 for a simpler calculation. This gives you:

$$
8 \times 4 = 32
$$

Since £7.99 is 1 penny less than £8, you need to account for this difference by subtracting 4 pennies (or £0.04) from £32:

$$
32 - 0.04 = 31.96
$$

Thus, the total cost is indeed £31.96. This approach not only verifies the multiplication but also illustrates the subtraction needed, making it easier to tackle similar calculations in the future.
