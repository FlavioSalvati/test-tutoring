To arrange mixed numbers in order, you can convert them to either improper fractions or decimals, which allows for straightforward comparison and sorting.

Mixed numbers are composed of a whole number and a fractional part, such as $2 \frac{1}{3}$. To effectively compare and arrange these mixed numbers, you have two options: converting them to improper fractions or to decimal form.

**Converting to Improper Fractions:**
To convert a mixed number into an improper fraction, multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction and then add the numerator. For example, for the mixed number $2 \frac{1}{3}$, the conversion process is as follows:

$$
2 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2 \times 3 + 1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}
$$

**Converting to Decimals:**
Alternatively, you can convert mixed numbers to decimals. This involves dividing the numerator by the denominator and adding the result to the whole number. Using the same example, $2 \frac{1}{3}$ can be converted as follows:

$$
2 \frac{1}{3} \approx 2 + \frac{1}{3} \approx 2 + 0.333 \approx 2.333
$$

After converting all mixed numbers to a common format—either all improper fractions or all decimals—you can easily compare and sort them.

**Comparing Improper Fractions:**
When working with improper fractions, it is helpful to ensure that all fractions have a common denominator. For instance, to compare $\frac{7}{3}$ and $\frac{5}{2}$, you can convert them to have a common denominator:

$$
\frac{7}{3} = \frac{14}{6} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{5}{2} = \frac{15}{6}
$$

Now that both fractions share a common denominator, it is clear that $\frac{15}{6}$ is larger than $\frac{14}{6}$.

**Comparing Decimals:**
If you choose to work with decimals, simply compare the decimal values directly. For example, comparing $2.333$ and $2.5$ reveals that $2.5$ is greater.

Once you have compared all the numbers, you can arrange them in either ascending or descending order as needed.
