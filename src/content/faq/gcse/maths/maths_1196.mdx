To calculate the area of an equilateral triangle, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \text{side}^2
$$

An equilateral triangle is characterized by having all three sides of equal length and all three angles measuring $60$ degrees. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is derived from the standard formula for the area of a triangle, which is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

In the case of an equilateral triangle, the height can be determined using Pythagoras' theorem.

To derive the area formula, consider an equilateral triangle with each side measuring a length of $a$. If you draw a perpendicular line from one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, this line will bisect that side into two equal segments, each measuring $\frac{a}{2}$. This perpendicular line represents the height ($h$) of the triangle.

Applying Pythagoras' theorem to one of the resulting right triangles, we have:

$$
h^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = a^2
$$

Substituting in the values gives:

$$
h^2 + \frac{a^2}{4} = a^2
$$

Rearranging the equation yields:

$$
h^2 = a^2 - \frac{a^2}{4}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
h^2 = \frac{3}{4}a^2
$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

$$
h = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} a = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a
$$

Now, we can substitute this height back into the area formula for a triangle:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

Substituting the base ($a$) and the height ($\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a$), we have:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a\right)
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2
$$

Thus, the area of an equilateral triangle with a side length of $a$ is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2
$$

This formula is particularly useful as it allows you to compute the area directly from the side length without the need to separately calculate the height.
