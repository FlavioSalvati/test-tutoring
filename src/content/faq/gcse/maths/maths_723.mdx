To convert the number $8.9 \times 10^{-2}$ into standard decimal form, the result is $0.089$.

When you encounter a number in scientific notation, such as $8.9 \times 10^{-2}$, it indicates that you need to adjust the position of the decimal point. The exponent of the base $10$ specifies how many places to move the decimal point and in which direction. A negative exponent, like $-2$, indicates that you should move the decimal point to the left.

Starting with the number $8.9$, you will move the decimal point two places to the left because the exponent is $-2$. To facilitate this movement, you can add zeros as placeholders. By moving the decimal point two positions to the left from $8.9$, you arrive at $0.089$.

Therefore, $8.9 \times 10^{-2}$ is equivalent to $0.089$ in standard decimal form. Understanding this conversion process enhances your comprehension of scientific notation and illustrates how it can be utilized to represent very large or very small numbers in a more concise and manageable way.
