The symbol used to denote "greater than or equal to" is represented as "≥".

In mathematics, inequalities serve the purpose of comparing the relative sizes or values of two numbers or expressions. The symbol "≥" is essentially a combination of the "greater than" symbol ($>$) and an underline, which signifies "equal to." Consequently, when you see "≥" between two values, it indicates that the value on the left is either greater than or exactly equal to the value on the right.

For instance, consider the inequality $ x \geq 5 $. This expression means that $ x $ can take on any number that is either greater than $5$ or exactly equal to $5$. Therefore, possible values for $ x $ include $5$, $6$, $7$, and so forth. This symbol is particularly valuable in various mathematical contexts, such as solving inequalities, graphing on number lines, and working with functions.

Grasping the concept of the "greater than or equal to" symbol is crucial for tackling many types of problems in GCSE Maths. It enables you to establish boundaries and constraints in equations and inequalities, which is a fundamental skill in algebra. Whenever you encounter this symbol, always keep in mind that it encompasses the possibility of equality—this can be an essential detail for solving problems accurately.
