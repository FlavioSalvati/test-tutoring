The vector $ \mathbf{h} $ can be expressed in the form $ ai + bj $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are its components.

Vectors are mathematical entities characterized by both magnitude (length) and direction. In a two-dimensional space, a vector can be represented using its horizontal (along the x-axis) and vertical (along the y-axis) components. These components are commonly denoted by the letters $ a $ and $ b $, respectively.

When we write a vector in the form $ ai + bj $, the component $ a $ corresponds to the horizontal direction, while $ b $ corresponds to the vertical direction. The symbols $ i $ and $ j $ represent unit vectors along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. This notation provides a clear view of how much the vector extends in each direction.

For instance, if the vector $ \mathbf{h} $ has components $ 3 $ and $ 4 $, it can be represented as 

$$
\mathbf{h} = 3i + 4j.
$$

This indicates that the vector moves $ 3 $ units in the x-direction and $ 4 $ units in the y-direction.

Grasping this representation is essential for solving various vector-related problems, such as calculating the resultant vector when adding two vectors or determining a vector's magnitude and direction. By decomposing a vector into its components, we can more effectively analyze and manipulate it across different mathematical and physical scenarios.
