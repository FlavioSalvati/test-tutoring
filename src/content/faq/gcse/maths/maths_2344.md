To plot the equation $ y = -5x + 3 $ on a Cartesian plane, we will first identify and plot the y-intercept, followed by another point on the line.

Begin by locating the y-intercept, which is the point where the line intersects the y-axis. In the equation $ y = -5x + 3 $, the y-intercept is given by the constant term, which is $ 3 $. This indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, 3) $. Make sure to plot this point on the Cartesian plane.

Next, we need to select an additional value for $ x $ to determine a second point on the line. For simplicity, letâ€™s choose $ x = 1 $. We can substitute this value into our equation to find the corresponding $ y $ value:

$$
y = -5(1) + 3 = -5 + 3 = -2
$$

Thus, when $ x = 1 $, we find $ y = -2 $, which gives us the point $ (1, -2) $. Plot this point on the Cartesian plane as well.

Now, draw a straight line through the two points $ (0, 3) $ and $ (1, -2) $. This line visually represents the equation $ y = -5x + 3 $.

For further verification of your plot's accuracy, you can find another point on the line. Let's consider $ x = -1 $:

$$
y = -5(-1) + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8
$$

This calculation yields the point $ (-1, 8) $. When you plot this point, it should lie on the line you have drawn, confirming the correctness of your graph.

Keep in mind that the slope of the line is $ -5 $, which indicates that the line decreases steeply as you move from left to right. The y-intercept is $ 3 $, marking the point where the line intersects the y-axis.
