To determine the area of a compound shape consisting of a trapezium and a rectangle, you should calculate the area of each component separately and then sum them up.

First, let's decompose the compound shape into its simpler parts: a trapezium and a rectangle. The area of the trapezium can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Area of trapezium} = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h
$$

In this formula, $ a $ and $ b $ represent the lengths of the two parallel sides, while $ h $ denotes the height, which is the perpendicular distance between these sides.

Next, we can find the area of the rectangle using this formula:

$$
\text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
$$

Here, the length and width correspond to the dimensions of the rectangle.

After calculating both areas, you can obtain the total area of the compound shape by simply adding the two areas together:

$$
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of trapezium} + \text{Area of rectangle}
$$

For instance, consider a trapezium with parallel sides measuring $5 \, \text{cm}$ and $7 \, \text{cm}$, and a height of $4 \, \text{cm}$. The area of this trapezium would be computed as follows:

$$
\text{Area of trapezium} = \frac{1}{2} \times (5 + 7) \times 4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Now, if the rectangle has a length of $6 \, \text{cm}$ and a width of $3 \, \text{cm}$, its area can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Area of rectangle} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Adding these two areas together results in the total area:

$$
\text{Total area} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 + 18 \, \text{cm}^2 = 42 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

By following these steps, you can easily compute the area of any compound shape that includes a trapezium and a rectangle.
