To perform scalar multiplication on the vector $(-2, 3)$ using the scalar $-3$, we follow a straightforward process where each component of the vector is multiplied by the scalar. 

The initial vector is $(-2, 3)$, and the scalar is $-3$. The multiplication is carried out as follows:

1. **Multiply the x-component**: 
   The x-component of the vector is $-2$. We multiply this by the scalar $-3$:
   $$ 
   -2 \times -3 = 6.
   $$

2. **Multiply the y-component**: 
   The y-component of the vector is $3$. We also multiply this by the scalar $-3$:
   $$ 
   3 \times -3 = -9.
   $$

As a result of these calculations, when we multiply the vector $(-2, 3)$ by the scalar $-3$, we obtain the new vector $(6, -9)$. 

This operation is known as scalar multiplication. It modifies the magnitude of the vector and can also change its direction. In this instance, since we multiplied by a negative scalar, the direction of the vector is reversed, demonstrating how scalar multiplication can affect both the size and orientation of a vector.
