The equation of a line parallel to y = 3x + 2 has the form y = 3x + c.

To understand why, let's first recall that parallel lines have the same gradient (or slope). The gradient of a line in the form y = mx + c is given by the coefficient of x, which is m. In the equation y = 3x + 2, the gradient is 3. Therefore, any line parallel to this one must also have a gradient of 3.

The general form of a straight line equation is y = mx + c, where m is the gradient and c is the y-intercept. Since we want our new line to be parallel to y = 3x + 2, we keep the gradient the same, which is 3. The y-intercept, however, can be any value, which we denote as c.

For example, if we choose c = 5, the equation of the parallel line would be y = 3x + 5. If we choose c = -1, the equation would be y = 3x - 1. The key point is that the gradient remains 3, ensuring the lines are parallel.

In summary, to write the equation of a line parallel to y = 3x + 2, you simply use the form y = 3x + c, where c can be any real number. This keeps the gradient the same, ensuring the lines are parallel, while allowing the y-intercept to vary.
