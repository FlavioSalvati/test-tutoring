A cumulative frequency graph, often referred to as an ogive, illustrates the running total of frequencies up to each data point in a dataset. This graphical representation is an essential tool in statistics, as it effectively displays how the frequencies accumulate over a range of values, thereby simplifying the analysis of data distribution. For instance, when analyzing a list of test scores, a cumulative frequency graph can reveal how many students achieved scores up to a specific mark.

To construct a cumulative frequency graph, you begin by organizing your data into a frequency table. This table should list each data value alongside its corresponding frequency. Following this, you calculate the cumulative frequency for each data point, which is the sum of the frequencies for that value and all preceding values. Afterward, these cumulative frequencies are plotted on a graph, with the data values represented on the x-axis and the cumulative frequencies on the y-axis.

One of the primary advantages of a cumulative frequency graph is its ability to facilitate the quick determination of key statistical measures such as the median, quartiles, and percentiles of a dataset. For example, the median can be identified by locating the point at which the cumulative frequency equals half of the total frequency. Similarly, the lower and upper quartiles can be found by determining the points where the cumulative frequency reaches one-quarter and three-quarters of the total frequency, respectively.

In summary, cumulative frequency graphs serve as a powerful means of visualizing and interpreting data, making them an invaluable resource for GCSE Maths students.
