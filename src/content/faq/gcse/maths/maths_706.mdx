To simplify the expression $\frac{5^3}{5^1}$, we can apply the rule of exponents that states when dividing powers with the same base, you subtract the exponents. In this case, the base is $5$. The expression $\frac{5^3}{5^1}$ represents $5$ raised to the power of $3$ divided by $5$ raised to the power of $1$.

According to the laws of indices, specifically the division rule, we subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator. 

We start with the exponents: $3$ (from $5^3$) and $1$ (from $5^1$). Thus, we perform the subtraction:

$$
3 - 1 = 2
$$

This results in a new exponent of $2$. Therefore, the expression $\frac{5^3}{5^1}$ simplifies to $5^2$.

To illustrate this more concretely, we can expand the powers. The expression $5^3$ can be written as $5 \times 5 \times 5$, while $5^1$ is simply $5$. When we divide $5 \times 5 \times 5$ by $5$, one of the $5$s cancels out. This leaves us with:

$$
5 \times 5
$$

which is equivalent to $5^2$.

In conclusion, the simplified form of $\frac{5^3}{5^1}$ is $5^2$.
