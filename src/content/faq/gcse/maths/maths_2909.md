The probability of drawing an ace from a standard deck of cards is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, specifically $4$ out of $52$.

A standard deck of cards contains a total of $52$ cards, which are categorized into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit consists of $13$ cards, including one ace per suit. Consequently, there are a total of $4$ aces in the entire deck.

To determine the probability of drawing an ace, we analyze the number of favorable outcomes (drawing an ace) against the total number of possible outcomes (drawing any card). The favorable outcomes amount to $4$ (the number of aces), while the total outcomes are $52$ (the total cards in the deck).

The probability can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

By substituting the respective values, we find:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{4}{52}
$$

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $4$:

$$
\frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}
$$

Thus, the probability of drawing an ace from a standard deck of cards is $\frac{1}{13}$. This means that if you randomly select a card from the deck, there is a $1$ in $13$ chance that it will be an ace. Understanding this probability is essential, as it provides insight into the likelihood of certain events occurring.
