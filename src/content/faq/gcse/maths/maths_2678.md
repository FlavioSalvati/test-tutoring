To determine the volume of a compound solid composed of a cylinder and a cone, you will need to compute the volumes of each individual shape and then sum them.

Let's clarify the problem. A compound solid consists of two or more simpler geometric shapes. In our case, we are working with a cylinder and a cone. To find the total volume, we will first calculate the volume of each shape separately, and then we will add these volumes together.

The volume of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:

$$ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h $$

Here, $ r $ represents the radius of the base, and $ h $ is the height of the cylinder. Ensure that you have these measurements available. If they are not provided, you will need to measure them.

Next, the volume of a cone is given by the formula:

$$ V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h $$

In this formula, $ r $ again refers to the radius of the base, and $ h $ is the height of the cone. As with the cylinder, make sure you have these measurements.

Once you have calculated the volumes of both the cylinder and the cone, you can find the total volume of the compound solid by adding these two volumes together. Specifically, if the volume of the cylinder is denoted as $ V_{\text{cylinder}} $ and the volume of the cone is denoted as $ V_{\text{cone}} $, then the total volume $ V_{\text{total}} $ is calculated as follows:

$$ V_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} + V_{\text{cone}} $$

It is important to keep your units consistent throughout all calculations to ensure accuracy. By following these steps, you will successfully determine the volume of your compound solid!
