The key on your calculator for entering scientific notation is typically labeled as "EXP" or "EE".

To input a number in scientific notation, you generally utilize the "EXP" or "EE" key. This function allows you to express numbers in the format $ a \times 10^b $, where $ a $ represents the coefficient and $ b $ signifies the exponent. For instance, to enter the number $ 3.2 \times 10^5 $, you would first type $ 3.2 $, then press the "EXP" or "EE" key, and finally enter $ 5 $.

While "EXP" and "EE" are the most commonly used labels, different calculators may have slight variations in their terminology. In some cases, you may need to press a "2nd" or "Shift" key to access the scientific notation function. If you're uncertain, it's always a good idea to consult your calculator's manual for guidance.

Using scientific notation is especially beneficial when dealing with very large or very small numbers, which frequently occur in scientific and engineering applications. This notation not only simplifies calculations but also enhances the readability and clarity of these numbers. For GCSE Maths, mastering the use of this function on your calculator can save you valuable time and help you minimize errors in your calculations.
