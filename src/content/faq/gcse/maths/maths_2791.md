To determine the length of a side in a triangle using the sine rule, we utilize the following formula:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}
$$

The sine rule is an essential concept in trigonometry that facilitates solving problems involving non-right-angled triangles. It establishes a relationship between the lengths of the triangle's sides and the sines of its angles. In this formula, $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent the lengths of the sides opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.

To calculate a specific side, you need to know the length of one side along with the measures of two angles. For instance, to find side $a$ when you know side $b$ and angles $A$ and $B$, you can rearrange the formula as follows:

$$
a = \frac{b \cdot \sin(A)}{\sin(B)}
$$

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to apply this method:

1. **Identify Known Values**: Determine the length of one side and the measures of the two angles.
2. **Write Down the Sine Rule Formula**: Use the sine rule as stated above.
3. **Substitute Known Values**: Insert the known values into the formula.
4. **Rearrange the Formula**: Solve for the unknown side.
5. **Perform Calculations**: Use a calculator to compute the sine of the angles and carry out the necessary multiplication and division.

For example, suppose side $b$ measures $7 \, \text{cm}$, angle $A$ is $30^\circ$, and angle $B$ is $45^\circ$. You can find side $a$ using the following calculation:

$$
a = \frac{7 \cdot \sin(30^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ)}
$$

Calculating further:

$$
a = \frac{7 \cdot 0.5}{0.7071} \approx 4.95 \, \text{cm}
$$

This method allows you to accurately determine the unknown side, provided that you have the necessary measurements for the angles and one side.
