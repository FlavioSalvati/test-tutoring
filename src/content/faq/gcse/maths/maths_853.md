To expand the expression $(x + 3)(x - 2)$, we will utilize the distributive property, commonly referred to as the FOIL method, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, and Last. This approach allows us to systematically multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket.

We begin by multiplying the first terms of each bracket:

$$
x \times x = x^2.
$$

Next, we proceed to multiply the outer terms:

$$
x \times -2 = -2x.
$$

Following that, we multiply the inner terms:

$$
3 \times x = 3x.
$$

Finally, we multiply the last terms from each bracket:

$$
3 \times -2 = -6.
$$

Now, we can combine all of these results:

$$
x^2 - 2x + 3x - 6.
$$

To simplify this expression, we combine the like terms $-2x$ and $3x$:

$$
-2x + 3x = x.
$$

Thus, the expanded form of $(x + 3)(x - 2)$ is:

$$
x^2 + x - 6.
$$
