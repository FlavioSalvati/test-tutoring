The upper bound of $0.456$ rounded to two decimal places is $0.465$.

When we refer to the upper bound in the context of rounding to a specified number of decimal places, we are identifying the maximum value that will still round down to the designated figure. In this scenario, we are rounding $0.456$ to two decimal places, which results in $0.46$.

To determine the upper bound, we need to identify the smallest number that would round up to the next possible value. For two decimal places, this involves finding the smallest number that rounds up to $0.47$. The smallest number that achieves this is $0.465$. Numbers ranging from $0.460$ to just under $0.465$ will round to $0.46$, but once we reach $0.465$, it rounds up to $0.47$.

Consequently, the upper bound of $0.456$ when rounded to two decimal places is $0.465$. This indicates that any value from $0.4555$ up to, but not including, $0.465$ will round to $0.46$ when rounded to two decimal places. Understanding this concept is crucial for ensuring precision and grasping the limitations of rounding in mathematical calculations.
