The angle subtended by a diameter in a circle is always $90$ degrees at the circumference.

In a circle, a diameter is defined as a straight line that passes through the center and touches two points on the circumference. By drawing a triangle using the diameter as one side and any point on the circumference as the third vertex, you form a right-angled triangle. The angle opposite the diameter—the angle at the circumference—is always a right angle, measuring $90$ degrees. This property arises from the inherent geometry of the circle and is referred to as the "angle in a semicircle" theorem.

To grasp why this holds true, consider the center of the circle, the endpoints of the diameter, and the point on the circumference that together form a triangle. The diameter divides the circle into two equal semicircles. Any triangle formed in this manner will have the diameter as its hypotenuse. According to the theorem, the angle subtended by the diameter at the circumference is always a right angle. This conclusion stems from the fact that the angle at the center of the circle—formed by two radii—is twice the angle at the circumference. Since the angle at the center corresponding to the diameter is $180$ degrees (a straight line), it follows that the angle at the circumference must be half of that, resulting in $90$ degrees.

This property is invaluable for solving various geometric problems and proofs involving circles. It provides a reliable method for identifying right angles and aids in the construction and analysis of different geometric shapes and their properties.
