To express the vector $ \mathbf{c} $ as a linear combination of the vectors $ \mathbf{a} $ and $ \mathbf{b} $, you need to find scalars $ x $ and $ y $ such that the equation 

$$
\mathbf{c} = x\mathbf{a} + y\mathbf{b}
$$ 

holds true.

A linear combination refers to the process of representing one vector as the sum of multiples of other vectors. In this context, you aim to express the vector $ \mathbf{c} $ using the vectors $ \mathbf{a} $ and $ \mathbf{b} $. This entails determining two specific numbers, $ x $ and $ y $, which, when multiplied by $ \mathbf{a} $ and $ \mathbf{b} $ respectively and then summed, will yield $ \mathbf{c} $.

To achieve this, you can set up the equation

$$
\mathbf{c} = x\mathbf{a} + y\mathbf{b}.
$$ 

If the vectors $ \mathbf{a} $, $ \mathbf{b} $, and $ \mathbf{c} $ are represented in component form, for example:

$$
\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2), \quad \mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2), \quad \mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2),
$$ 

you can derive two simultaneous equations based on their components:

$$
c_1 = x a_1 + y b_1 
$$ 

$$
c_2 = x a_2 + y b_2.
$$ 

To find the values of $ x $ and $ y $, you will solve these simultaneous equations. These values represent the scalars that, when multiplied by the vectors $ \mathbf{a} $ and $ \mathbf{b} $, will produce the vector $ \mathbf{c} $. This procedure may involve algebraic manipulation or even matrix methods, but the fundamental concept is to align the components of $ \mathbf{c} $ with the corresponding linear combination of the components of $ \mathbf{a} $ and $ \mathbf{b} $.
