To perform an enlargement with a scale factor of $3$ about the origin, you need to multiply each coordinate of the shape by $3$.

When you enlarge a shape with a scale factor of $3$ centered at the origin, you effectively increase the size of the shape to three times its original dimensions while preserving its proportions. The origin, represented by the point $(0,0)$, serves as the center of enlargement. To achieve this, you will take each vertex (corner) of the shape and multiply both its x-coordinate and y-coordinate by $3$.

For instance, consider a point $A$ with coordinates $(2, 1)$. To find the new coordinates of point $A$ after enlargement, you would calculate:

$$
(2 \times 3, 1 \times 3) = (6, 3).
$$

This process is repeated for every point in the shape.

Letâ€™s say you have a triangle with vertices at $(1, 2)$, $(3, 4)$, and $(5, 6)$. To enlarge this triangle by a scale factor of $3$, you would multiply each coordinate by $3$. The new vertices would be calculated as follows:

- For the vertex $(1, 2)$:
$$
(1 \times 3, 2 \times 3) = (3, 6).
$$
- For the vertex $(3, 4)$:
$$
(3 \times 3, 4 \times 3) = (9, 12).
$$
- For the vertex $(5, 6)$:
$$
(5 \times 3, 6 \times 3) = (15, 18).
$$

The new vertices of the enlarged triangle are thus $(3, 6)$, $(9, 12)$, and $(15, 18)$.

This method guarantees that the shape remains similar to the original. This means that all angles remain unchanged and the lengths of the sides are proportional to those of the original shape. The only distinction is that the new shape is three times larger in every direction from the origin. 

This technique is particularly useful in various applications, such as creating scale models or resizing images while maintaining their proportions.
