To add $2$ hours and $45$ minutes to $1$ hour, the result is $3$ hours and $45$ minutes.

When performing time addition, it is beneficial to separate the calculations for hours and minutes. Begin by adding the hours together. In this scenario, you have $1$ hour and $2$ hours. Adding these gives:

$$
1 + 2 = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

Next, proceed to add the minutes. You have $45$ minutes to incorporate. Since there are no additional minutes in the initial $1$ hour, you simply add the $45$ minutes to the total, resulting in:

$$
3 \text{ hours} + 45 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours and } 45 \text{ minutes}
$$

If, however, the minutes had totaled $60$ or more, you would need to convert some of those minutes into hours. For instance, consider the addition of $1$ hour and $30$ minutes with $2$ hours and $45$ minutes. You would first add the hours:

$$
1 + 2 = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

Then, add the minutes:

$$
30 + 45 = 75 \text{ minutes}
$$

Since $75$ minutes exceeds $60$, you would convert $60$ of those minutes into $1$ hour, yielding:

$$
75 - 60 = 15 \text{ minutes}
$$

This results in a total of:

$$
3 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ hours and } 15 \text{ minutes}
$$

In the simpler case presented initially, there is no need to convert any minutes into hours because $45$ minutes is less than $60$. Therefore, the final result remains:

$$
3 \text{ hours and } 45 \text{ minutes}
$$
