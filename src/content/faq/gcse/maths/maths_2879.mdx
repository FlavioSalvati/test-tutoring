The vector from the point $(0, 0)$ to the point $(7, 24)$ is represented as $(7, 24)$.

To elaborate, a vector is a mathematical quantity that possesses both direction and magnitude. When we refer to the vector connecting two points, we describe the movement required to go from the starting point to the ending point. In this instance, the starting point is $(0, 0)$ and the ending point is $(7, 24)$.

To determine the vector, we calculate the difference between the coordinates of the ending point and the coordinates of the starting point. For the x-coordinate, we subtract $0$ from $7$, resulting in $7$. For the y-coordinate, we subtract $0$ from $24$, yielding $24$. Consequently, the vector is expressed as $(7, 24)$.

This vector indicates that to travel from the point $(0, 0)$ to the point $(7, 24)$, one must move $7$ units in the x-direction (to the right) and $24$ units in the y-direction (upward). Vectors are typically notated in the format $(x, y)$, which effectively illustrates the horizontal and vertical components of the movement. This concept is fundamental in GCSE Mathematics, particularly in the context of coordinate geometry and vector analysis.
