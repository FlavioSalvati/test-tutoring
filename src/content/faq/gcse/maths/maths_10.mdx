A negative number is defined as any number that is less than zero, typically indicated by a minus sign ($-$). 

Negative numbers are vital for representing values that fall below zero. Common examples include temperatures that drop below freezing, financial debts, and elevations that are below sea level. They are an essential part of the number line, which includes positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero itself. On this number line, negative numbers are located to the left of zero.

In mathematical operations, negative numbers follow specific rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, when you add a negative number to a positive number, you are essentially subtracting the absolute value of the negative number from the positive number. Furthermore, multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive outcome, as the two negative signs cancel each other out.

Negative numbers also play a crucial role in solving equations and inequalities. Consider the equation 

$$ 
x + 3 = 1 
$$ 

To isolate $x$, you would subtract $3$ from both sides, leading to 

$$ 
x = -2 
$$ 

Understanding operations involving negative numbers is fundamental for progressing in mathematics, especially in areas such as algebra and calculus.

In everyday life, negative numbers appear in various situations. For instance, if you have £10 and then spend £15, you incur a debt of £5, which can be represented as $-£5$. Similarly, temperatures below zero degrees Celsius, such as $-5^\circ C$, are classified as negative.

By mastering the concept of negative numbers, you will significantly enhance your ability to tackle a wide array of mathematical challenges and real-world scenarios.
