The graph of the function $ y = x^2 + x - 6 $ represents a parabola that opens upwards.

To elaborate, this equation defines a quadratic function, which is generally expressed in the form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, where $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants. For our specific function, we have $ a = 1 $, $ b = 1 $, and $ c = -6 $. Since the coefficient $ a $ is positive, the parabola opens upwards, resulting in a U-shaped curve.

To better understand the shape and position of the parabola, we can determine its vertex and roots. The vertex of a quadratic function $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $ is calculated using the formula:

$$
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
$$

Substituting our values $ a = 1 $ and $ b = 1 $ into the formula, we find:

$$
x = -\frac{1}{2 \times 1} = -\frac{1}{2}
$$

Next, we need to find the y-coordinate of the vertex. We do this by substituting $ x = -\frac{1}{2} $ back into the original equation:

$$
y = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) - 6 
= \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} - 6 
= -\frac{25}{4}
$$

Thus, the vertex of the parabola is located at the point $ \left(-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{25}{4}\right) $.

Next, let's find the roots (or x-intercepts) of the parabola by solving the equation $ x^2 + x - 6 = 0 $. We can factor this equation as follows:

$$
(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0
$$

From this factorization, we can identify the roots as $ x = -3 $ and $ x = 2 $. These x-values indicate where the parabola intersects the x-axis.

By plotting the vertex and the roots, and considering the characteristic U-shape of the parabola, you can sketch the graph of the function $ y = x^2 + x - 6 $ accurately.
