To construct a frequency polygon from a histogram, you should plot the midpoints of each bar and connect them with straight lines.

A frequency polygon is an effective method for visualizing the distribution of data and can be derived directly from a histogram. The first step is to identify the midpoints at the top of each bar in the histogram. The midpoint for a given class interval is calculated by averaging its upper and lower boundaries. For instance, if a bar corresponds to the interval $10-20$, the midpoint can be determined as follows:

$$
\text{Midpoint} = \frac{10 + 20}{2} = 15.
$$

Next, plot these midpoints on a graph where the x-axis represents the class intervals and the y-axis represents the frequencies. Each midpoint should be marked at a height that corresponds to the frequency of its respective class interval.

After plotting all the midpoints, connect them with straight lines. Begin with the first midpoint and draw a line to the next, continuing this process until all midpoints are linked. To complete the frequency polygon, you can extend the lines down to the x-axis at both the beginning and the end of the dataset, ensuring that the polygon starts and ends at a frequency of zero.

This method provides a clear visual representation of the data distribution, facilitating the analysis of trends and patterns more effectively than a histogram alone.
