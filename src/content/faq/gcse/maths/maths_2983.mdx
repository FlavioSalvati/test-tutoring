The conditional probability $ P(B|A) $ is calculated as $ 0.5 $.

To determine $ P(B|A) $, which represents the probability of event $ B $ occurring given that event $ A $ has already occurred, we employ the formula for conditional probability:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}
$$

In this scenario, we are provided with the values $ P(A) = 0.7 $ and $ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.35 $.

By substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{0.35}{0.7}
$$

Calculating this gives us $ P(B|A) = 0.5 $. Therefore, the probability of event $ B $ occurring, given that event $ A $ has taken place, is $ 0.5 $ or $ 50\% $.

Understanding conditional probability is crucial as it allows us to analyze situations where the occurrence of one event influences the likelihood of another event. In this example, the knowledge that event $ A $ has occurred alters the probability of event $ B $ occurring. This concept is widely applicable across various disciplines, including statistics, science, and everyday decision-making.
