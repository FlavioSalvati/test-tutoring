The formula for the circumference of a semicircle is given by 

$$ 
\pi r + 2r 
$$ 

where $ r $ represents the radius of the semicircle.

To better understand this formula, letâ€™s break it down further. A semicircle is essentially half of a full circle. The circumference of a complete circle can be expressed as 

$$ 
2\pi r 
$$ 

Since a semicircle is half of a full circle, one might initially think that its circumference would simply be half of $ 2\pi r $, which results in $ \pi r $. However, this calculation only accounts for the curved portion of the semicircle.

In addition to the curved segment, a semicircle has a straight edge known as the diameter. The diameter of a circle is twice the radius, which can be represented as 

$$ 
2r 
$$ 

To compute the total circumference of a semicircle, you must combine the length of the curved part ($ \pi r $) with the length of the straight edge ($ 2r $).

Thus, the complete formula for the circumference of a semicircle is 

$$ 
\pi r + 2r 
$$ 

This expression allows you to determine the total distance around the semicircle, encompassing both the curved and straight components.
