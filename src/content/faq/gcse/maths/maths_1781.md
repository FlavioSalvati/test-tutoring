The value of $(2^3)^2$ is $64$.

To understand why $(2^3)^2$ equals $64$, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses. The expression $2^3$ means $2$ raised to the power of $3$, which is equivalent to multiplying $2$ by itself three times: 

$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8.
$$

Next, we take the result of $2^3$, which is $8$, and raise it to the power of $2$. This can be expressed as $8^2$. Raising a number to the power of $2$ means multiplying the number by itself:

$$
8 \times 8 = 64.
$$

Another way to comprehend this is through the laws of exponents. According to the power of a power rule, we have:

$$
(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}.
$$

In our case, $a$ is $2$, $m$ is $3$, and $n$ is $2$. Therefore, we can rewrite $(2^3)^2$ as:

$$
2^{3 \times 2} = 2^6.
$$

The expression $2^6$ means multiplying $2$ by itself six times:

$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 64.
$$

Thus, whether you analyze it step by step or apply the laws of exponents, we can confirm that the value of $(2^3)^2$ is indeed $64$.
