Yes, the expression $ f(x) = x^3 $ represents a function because each input $ x $ corresponds to exactly one output.

To ascertain whether $ f(x) = x^3 $ qualifies as a function, we must verify that every input value $ x $ from its domain (which includes all real numbers) maps to a single output value $ f(x) $. In simpler terms, for every value of $ x $ substituted into the equation $ x^3 $, you should obtain exactly one result.

Let’s delve into the definition: a function is a specific type of relation in which each input is associated with one and only one output. For the case of $ f(x) = x^3 $, if you select any real number for $ x $, cubing that number (multiplying it by itself twice) yields a unique result. For instance, if you take $ x = 2 $, then

$$ f(2) = 2^3 = 8. $$

Similarly, if $ x = -3 $, then

$$ f(-3) = (-3)^3 = -27. $$

No matter which number you choose for $ x $, you will always receive one specific value as the output.

Furthermore, you can utilize the vertical line test to verify that $ f(x) = x^3 $ is indeed a function. When you graph the equation $ f(x) = x^3 $, you will observe a continuous curve. If you were to draw a vertical line anywhere on this graph, it would intersect the curve at precisely one point. This indicates that for every value of $ x $, there exists only one corresponding $ y $ value, thereby confirming that $ f(x) = x^3 $ is a valid function.

In summary, $ f(x) = x^3 $ satisfies the definition of a function, as each input $ x $ yields a unique output $ f(x) $.
