To determine the equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by the equation $y = 2x + 1$ and passes through the point $(0, 2)$, we find that the desired equation is $y = 2x + 2$.

To derive the equation of a parallel line, we must first identify the slope (gradient) of the original line. In the equation $y = 2x + 1$, the slope is represented by the coefficient of $x$, which is $2$. Since parallel lines have identical slopes, our new line will also have a slope of $2$.

Next, we utilize the point $(0, 2)$, which is known to lie on the new line. The general form of the equation for a straight line is given by 

$$y = mx + c,$$

where $m$ represents the slope and $c$ denotes the y-intercept. Given that we have already established the slope $m = 2$, we can substitute this value into the equation, yielding 

$$y = 2x + c.$$

To find the y-intercept $c$, we can substitute the coordinates of the point $(0, 2)$ into the equation. By setting $x = 0$ and $y = 2$, we have:

$$2 = 2(0) + c,$$

which simplifies to 

$$2 = c.$$

Thus, we find that the y-intercept $c$ is $2$. By substituting this value back into our line equation, we arrive at the final equation of the line:

$$y = 2x + 2.$$

This equation represents a line that is parallel to $y = 2x + 1$ and passes through the point $(0, 2)$.
