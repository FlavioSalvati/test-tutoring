To determine the area of a triangle with side lengths of $5 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $9 \, \text{cm}$, we will employ Heron's formula.

### Step 1: Calculate the Semi-Perimeter

First, we must find the semi-perimeter of the triangle, denoted as $s$. The semi-perimeter is defined as half the sum of the lengths of the sides of the triangle. For a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, the semi-perimeter can be calculated using the formula:

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

For our specific triangle with sides measuring $5 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $9 \, \text{cm}$, we compute the semi-perimeter as follows:

$$
s = \frac{5 + 7 + 9}{2} = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5 \, \text{cm}
$$

### Step 2: Apply Heron's Formula

Next, we utilize Heron's formula to find the area $A$ of the triangle, which is represented by the equation:

$$
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

We substitute the values of $s$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula:

$$
A = \sqrt{10.5 \times (10.5 - 5) \times (10.5 - 7) \times (10.5 - 9)}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
A = \sqrt{10.5 \times 5.5 \times 3.5 \times 1.5}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate the Product Inside the Square Root

Next, we will compute the product under the square root step-by-step:

1. First, calculate $10.5 \times 5.5$:

$$
10.5 \times 5.5 = 57.75
$$

2. Next, multiply the result by $3.5$:

$$
57.75 \times 3.5 = 202.125
$$

3. Finally, multiply this result by $1.5$:

$$
202.125 \times 1.5 = 303.1875
$$

### Step 4: Find the Area

Now that we have calculated the product, we can find the area by taking the square root:

$$
A = \sqrt{303.1875} \approx 17.42 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

### Conclusion

Thus, the area of the triangle with side lengths of $5 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $9 \, \text{cm}$ is approximately $17.42 \, \text{cm}^2$.
