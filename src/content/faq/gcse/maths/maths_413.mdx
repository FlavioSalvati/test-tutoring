To determine the volume of a sphere with a radius of $4.5$ cm, you can use the formula:

$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 $$

In this formula, $V$ represents the volume of the sphere, $\pi$ (pi) is approximately $3.14159$, and $r$ is the radius. In this case, the radius $r$ is given as $4.5$ cm.

Let's break down the calculations step by step:

1. **Calculate the cube of the radius**: 
   To find $r^3$ when $r = 4.5$, you compute:

   $$ 4.5^3 = 4.5 \times 4.5 \times 4.5 $$

   Performing this multiplication yields:

   $$ 4.5 \times 4.5 = 20.25 $$

   Then,

   $$ 20.25 \times 4.5 = 91.125 $$

   Thus, we have:

   $$ r^3 = 91.125 $$

2. **Multiply by $\pi$**: 
   Next, we need to multiply the result from the previous step by $\pi$:

   $$ 91.125 \times \pi \approx 91.125 \times 3.14159 \approx 286.168 $$

3. **Multiply by $\frac{4}{3}$**: 
   Finally, we multiply this result by $\frac{4}{3}$ to find the volume:

   $$ V = \frac{4}{3} \times 286.168 $$

   Performing this calculation gives:

   $$ V \approx 381.557 $$

Therefore, the volume of the sphere is approximately $381.557$ cubic centimeters (cmÂ³). This method ensures an accurate calculation by sequentially cubing the radius, multiplying by $\pi$, and then scaling the result by $\frac{4}{3}$.
