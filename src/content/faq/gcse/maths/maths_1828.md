The product of $2.5$ and $3.6$ equals $9$.

To calculate the product of two numbers, you multiply them together. In this instance, we will multiply $2.5$ by $3.6$. One approach to perform this multiplication is to convert the decimal numbers into fractions. Specifically, $2.5$ can be expressed as $\frac{5}{2}$ and $3.6$ can be represented as $\frac{18}{5}$. When we multiply these fractions, we have:

$$
\frac{5}{2} \times \frac{18}{5}.
$$

Here, the $5$s cancel each other out, resulting in:

$$
\frac{18}{2},
$$

which simplifies to $9$.

Alternatively, we can use long multiplication with decimals. First, ignore the decimal points and multiply $25$ by $36$, which yields $900$. Next, we need to account for the total number of decimal places in the original numbers. The number $2.5$ has one decimal place, and $3.6$ also has one decimal place, resulting in a total of two decimal places. Therefore, we place the decimal point two places from the right in $900$, which gives us $9.00$, or simply $9$.

Mastering the multiplication of decimals is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it enables you to tackle a wide range of problems involving measurements, finances, and more. By practicing these methods, you will gain confidence in performing decimal multiplication, both in your exams and in everyday situations.
