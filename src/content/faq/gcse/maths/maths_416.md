The volume of a compound solid consisting of a cube and a pyramid is determined by summing the volumes of the individual shapes.

To calculate the volume of the compound solid, you should first compute the volume of the cube and then the volume of the pyramid, before adding these two results together.

Let's start with the cube. The volume of a cube can be calculated using the formula:

$$
V = a^3
$$

where $ a $ represents the length of one side of the cube. For instance, if each side of the cube measures $ 4 \, \text{cm} $, the volume will be:

$$
V = 4^3 = 64 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

Next, we move on to the pyramid. The volume of a pyramid is calculated using the formula:

$$
V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
$$

If the base of the pyramid is a square with side length $ b $ and the height of the pyramid is $ h $, then the base area can be expressed as $ b^2 $. For example, if the side length of the base is $ 4 \, \text{cm} $ and the height is $ 6 \, \text{cm} $, the volume of the pyramid would be calculated as follows:

$$
V = \frac{1}{3} \times 4^2 \times 6 = \frac{1}{3} \times 16 \times 6 = 32 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

Finally, to obtain the total volume of the compound solid, you simply add the volumes of the cube and the pyramid together. In our examples, the total volume is:

$$
V_{\text{total}} = 64 + 32 = 96 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

This method can be universally applied to any combination of a cube and a pyramid by substituting the corresponding measurements into the formulas.
