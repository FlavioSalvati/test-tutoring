To calculate the mean of grouped data, follow these steps: multiply the midpoints of each class by their corresponding frequencies, sum these products, and finally divide by the total frequency.

When working with grouped data, the data set is organized into classes or intervals. Each class has an associated frequency, indicating the number of data points that fall within that class. To find the mean, you first need to calculate the midpoint of each class. The midpoint is determined by taking the average of the lower and upper boundaries of the class. For example, for a class interval of $10-20$, the midpoint is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Midpoint} = \frac{10 + 20}{2} = 15.
$$

Next, multiply each class midpoint by the frequency of that class to produce a set of products. For instance, if the frequency of the class $10-20$ is $5$, the calculation would be:

$$
\text{Product} = 15 \, (\text{midpoint}) \times 5 \, (\text{frequency}) = 75.
$$

Once you have computed all the products, sum them up to obtain the total of all the midpoints multiplied by their respective frequencies.

Next, calculate the total frequency, which is the sum of the frequencies of all the classes. To find the mean, divide the sum of the products by the total frequency. For example, if the total of all the products is $300$ and the total frequency is $20$, the mean is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{300}{20} = 15.
$$

This method provides an estimate of the mean for the grouped data, which is particularly useful when handling large datasets where individual data points are not available.
