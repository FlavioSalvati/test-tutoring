To determine the vector from point $ A(2, 3) $ to point $ B(6, 8) $, you need to subtract the coordinates of point $ A $ from those of point $ B $.

More specifically, a vector indicates both the direction and the distance between two points. To compute the vector from point $ A $ to point $ B $, you subtract the coordinates of point $ A $ from the coordinates of point $ B $. This involves subtracting the x-coordinate of $ A $ from the x-coordinate of $ B $, and the y-coordinate of $ A $ from the y-coordinate of $ B $.

For points $ A(2, 3) $ and $ B(6, 8) $, the x-coordinates are $ 2 $ and $ 6 $, respectively, while the y-coordinates are $ 3 $ and $ 8 $, respectively. First, calculate the difference in the x-coordinates:

$$
6 - 2 = 4.
$$

Next, calculate the difference in the y-coordinates:

$$
8 - 3 = 5.
$$

Therefore, the vector from point $ A $ to point $ B $ can be expressed as $ (4, 5) $. This indicates that to travel from point $ A $ to point $ B $, one must move $ 4 $ units to the right (along the x-axis) and $ 5 $ units up (along the y-axis). We can represent this vector as 

$$
\vec{AB} = (4, 5).
