The solutions to the equation $ y = x^2 - 6x + 9 $ are represented graphically by the x-coordinates where the graph intersects the x-axis.

To determine these solutions graphically, we must plot the quadratic equation $ y = x^2 - 6x + 9 $ and locate the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. The x-axis corresponds to the line where $ y = 0 $. Thus, the solutions to the equation are the x-values for which $ y = 0 $.

First, let's rewrite the quadratic equation in a more familiar form. Notice that $ x^2 - 6x + 9 $ can be factored as $ (x - 3)^2 $. Consequently, our equation can be expressed as:

$$
y = (x - 3)^2.
$$

When we set $ y = 0 $, we obtain:

$$
(x - 3)^2 = 0.
$$

Solving this equation, we find that $ x = 3 $.

From a graphical perspective, this indicates that the parabola $ y = (x - 3)^2 $ touches the x-axis at the point $ (3, 0) $. Since the parabola merely touches the x-axis at this single point without crossing it, there exists only one solution to the equation $ y = x^2 - 6x + 9 $, which is $ x = 3 $.

In summary, the graph of $ y = x^2 - 6x + 9 $ is a parabola that touches the x-axis at $ x = 3 $. This implies that the quadratic equation has a repeated root, and the solution is $ x = 3 $.
