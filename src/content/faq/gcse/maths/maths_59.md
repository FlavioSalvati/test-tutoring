The value of $(2^5) / (2^2)$ is $8$.

To comprehend this, let's dissect the problem using the laws of exponents. When dividing two numbers with identical bases, you subtract the exponent of the divisor from the exponent of the dividend. In this instance, both the numerator and the denominator have a common base of $2$. Hence, you subtract the exponent of the denominator ($2$) from the exponent of the numerator ($5$):

$$2^5 / 2^2 = 2^{(5-2)} = 2^3.$$

Next, you need to compute $2^3$. This requires multiplying $2$ by itself thrice:

$$2 * 2 * 2 = 8.$$

Consequently, the value of $(2^5) / (2^2)$ is indeed $8$.

This technique of subtracting exponents during division is a fundamental law in mathematics and is highly beneficial for simplifying expressions involving powers. Remember, this rule only applies when the bases are identical. If the bases were different, you would need to implement a different strategy. Mastery and application of these rules will aid in solving a diverse set of problems more efficiently.
