To substitute $2$ for the variable $q$ in the expression $7q + 3$, follow these steps to simplify the expression.

When substituting a value into an algebraic expression, you replace the variable with the specified number. In this case, the expression is $7q + 3$, and we will substitute $q$ with $2$. Begin by rewriting the expression with $2$ in place of $q$:

$$
7(2) + 3
$$

Next, carry out the multiplication: $7$ times $2$ equals $14$. Therefore, the expression now simplifies to:

$$
14 + 3
$$

Finally, perform the addition: $14$ plus $3$ equals $17$. Thus, when you substitute $2$ for $q$ in the expression $7q + 3$, the simplified result is $17$.

This substitution process is valuable in various areas of mathematics, such as solving equations and evaluating functions. By substituting specific values into expressions, you can determine their outputs for those values, which aids in understanding the behavior of the expression.
