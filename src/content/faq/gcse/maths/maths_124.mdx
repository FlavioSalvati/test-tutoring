The end time is $11:30 \, \text{AM}$.

To determine the end time when you know the start time and the duration, you simply add the duration to the start time. In this scenario, the start time is $9:30 \, \text{AM}$, and the duration is $2$ hours.

Let's break this down into clear steps. We begin with the initial time of $9:30 \, \text{AM}$. Adding $1$ hour to $9:30 \, \text{AM}$ results in $10:30 \, \text{AM}$. Next, adding another hour to $10:30 \, \text{AM}$ brings us to $11:30 \, \text{AM}$. Thus, $2$ hours after $9:30 \, \text{AM}$ is indeed $11:30 \, \text{AM}$.

When adding time, it is crucial to track hours and minutes separately. In this case, since the minutes component of the start time is $30$, and the duration is given in whole hours, the minutes remain unchanged. You only need to add the hours from the duration to the hours of the start time.

This method is applicable for any start time and duration. If the duration included minutes, you would add those minutes to the minutes of the start time. Should the total minutes exceed $60$, you would convert the excess into hours. For instance, if the duration were $2$ hours and $45$ minutes, you would first add $45$ minutes to $9:30 \, \text{AM}$, resulting in $10:15 \, \text{AM}$, and then add the $2$ hours to reach $12:15 \, \text{PM}$.
