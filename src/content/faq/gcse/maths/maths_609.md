The cumulative frequency for the interval $10-20$, given a frequency of $5$, is determined by the frequencies of the preceding intervals.

Cumulative frequency represents a running total of frequencies across the intervals in a frequency distribution. To calculate the cumulative frequency for the interval $10-20$, you need to add the frequency of this interval to the cumulative frequency of the interval immediately before it. For instance, if the cumulative frequency for the interval $0-10$ is $7$, then the cumulative frequency for the interval $10-20$ would be:

$$
7 \, (\text{previous cumulative frequency}) + 5 \, (\text{current interval frequency}) = 12.
$$

In cases where there are no prior intervals—meaning that $10-20$ is the first interval—the cumulative frequency is simply equal to the frequency of that interval, which is $5$. However, in most scenarios, you will encounter multiple intervals. In such cases, you need to sum all the frequencies from the beginning of the distribution up to the interval in question to obtain the cumulative frequency.

Understanding cumulative frequency is essential for analyzing data distributions and is particularly useful for constructing cumulative frequency graphs. These graphs illustrate the number of observations that fall below a specified value within a dataset, aiding in the identification of key statistical measures such as medians and quartiles.
