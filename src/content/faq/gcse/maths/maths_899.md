The formula for the $n$th term of the sequence $1, 2, 4, 8$ is given by the expression $2^{(n-1)}$.

To understand how we arrive at this formula, let’s first examine the sequence: $1, 2, 4, 8$. It is evident that each term is double the previous one. This consistent pattern indicates that the sequence is geometric, where each term is derived by multiplying the preceding term by a constant factor—in this case, $2$.

In a geometric sequence, the $n$th term can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a \times r^{(n-1)}
$$

where $a$ represents the first term and $r$ denotes the common ratio. For our specific sequence:
- The first term $a$ is $1$.
- The common ratio $r$ is $2$.

By substituting these values into the formula, we obtain:

$$
\text{nth term} = 1 \times 2^{(n-1)} = 2^{(n-1)}
$$

Now, let’s verify this formula by calculating a few terms:
- For $n = 1$: $2^{(1-1)} = 2^0 = 1$
- For $n = 2$: $2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2$
- For $n = 3$: $2^{(3-1)} = 2^2 = 4$
- For $n = 4$: $2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8$

As demonstrated, the formula $2^{(n-1)}$ accurately generates the terms of the sequence. This approach to determining the $n$th term is particularly beneficial for sequences that either expand or contract by a constant factor, making it an essential method in GCSE Maths.
