To determine the value of the expression $ 7x - 3 $ when $ x = 4 $, we begin by substituting the value of $ x $ into the expression. This means that every instance of $ x $ in $ 7x - 3 $ will be replaced with $ 4 $. Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

$$
7(4) - 3.
$$

Next, we perform the multiplication first, in accordance with the order of operations, which can be remembered by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). Multiplying $ 7 $ by $ 4 $ yields $ 28 $. Therefore, we can simplify the expression to:

$$
28 - 3.
$$

Now, we proceed with the subtraction. Subtracting $ 3 $ from $ 28 $ results in $ 25 $. Thus, we conclude that the value of the expression $ 7x - 3 $ when $ x = 4 $ is:

$$
25.
$$

This process of substitution and simplification is a fundamental skill in algebra. It enables us to evaluate expressions for specific values of variables, a common task in various mathematical contexts. Always remember to adhere to the order of operations to ensure accurate results.
