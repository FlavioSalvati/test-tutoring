To calculate the expected frequency of drawing an ace from a standard deck of cards over 52 trials, we can multiply the probability of drawing an ace by the total number of trials.

In a standard deck consisting of 52 cards, there are 4 aces. Therefore, the probability of drawing an ace in a single trial can be expressed as the ratio of aces to the total number of cards:

$$
P(\text{Ace}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}.
$$

To determine the expected frequency of drawing an ace during 52 trials, we multiply the probability by the number of trials:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = P(\text{Ace}) \times \text{Number of Trials} = \frac{1}{13} \times 52.
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \frac{52}{13} = 4.
$$

Thus, if you draw a card 52 times, you can expect to draw an ace approximately 4 times. This expected frequency serves as an indication of the average outcome when conducting a large number of trials, suggesting that over 52 card draws, you will likely draw an ace around 4 times.
