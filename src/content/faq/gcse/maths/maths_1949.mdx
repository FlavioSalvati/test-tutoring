To convert $120\%$ to a decimal, you can express it as $1.2$.

The process of converting a percentage to a decimal involves dividing the percentage value by $100$. The term "percent" literally means "per hundred," so $120\%$ can be understood as $120$ out of $100$. When you divide $120$ by $100$, the result is $1.2$.

An alternative method for this conversion is to move the decimal point two places to the left. For instance, starting with $120.0\%$, shifting the decimal two places left results in $1.2$. This technique is applicable to any percentage. For example, $50\%$ converts to $0.5$, while $250\%$ becomes $2.5$.

Understanding how to convert percentages to decimals is valuable in various fields of mathematics, including probability, statistics, and financial calculations. This knowledge simplifies operations like multiplication and division. For example, to find $120\%$ of a given number, you would multiply that number by $1.2$.

As a practical example, if you want to calculate $120\%$ of $50$, you would perform the calculation $50 \times 1.2 = 60$. Mastering this skill is particularly useful in everyday scenarios, such as determining discounts, interest rates, and solving other percentage-related problems.
