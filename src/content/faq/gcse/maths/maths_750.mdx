The lower bound for the number $0.789$ when rounded to three decimal places is $0.7885$.

When rounding a number to three decimal places, we focus on the thousandths place, which is the third digit to the right of the decimal point. In the case of $0.789$, the thousandths place is represented by the digit $9$. To find the lower bound, we need to determine the smallest number that would still round up to $0.789$ when rounded to three decimal places.

To calculate this lower bound, we subtract half of the smallest place value we are rounding to. Since we are rounding to the thousandths place, the smallest place value is $0.001$. Half of $0.001$ is $0.0005$. Therefore, we subtract $0.0005$ from $0.789$ to obtain the lower bound:

$$
0.789 - 0.0005 = 0.7885.
$$

This indicates that any number in the range from $0.7885$ up to, but not including, $0.7895$ will round to $0.789$ when rounded to three decimal places. Thus, the lower bound is $0.7885$, which is the smallest number that, when rounded to three decimal places, results in $0.789$.
