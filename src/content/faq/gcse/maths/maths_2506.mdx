A net of a cuboid is a two-dimensional representation that can be folded to create the three-dimensional shape of a cuboid.

When observing a net of a cuboid, you are essentially viewing all six faces of the cuboid arranged flat. Each face of a cuboid is a rectangle, and the net illustrates how these rectangles are connected and organized in such a manner that, when folded along the edges, they form the cuboid.

To interpret a net of a cuboid, begin by identifying the six rectangles, which represent the faces of the cuboid. Pay attention to their relative positioning. Typically, you will notice three pairs of rectangles, with each pair corresponding to opposite faces of the cuboid. For instance, if the cuboid has dimensions of length $l$, width $w$, and height $h$, you will find pairs of rectangles with dimensions $l \times w$, $w \times h$, and $h \times l$.

Next, examine how these rectangles are connected. The edges of the rectangles in the net correspond to the edges of the cuboid. When you fold the net along these edges, the rectangles should come together seamlessly to form the cuboid, without any gaps or overlaps. Visualizing this folding process can enhance your understanding of how the two-dimensional net transforms into the three-dimensional shape.

Understanding nets is particularly beneficial for solving problems related to surface area and volume. By analyzing the net, you can easily calculate the surface area by summing the areas of all the rectangles. This skill is especially useful in GCSE Maths, where you may be required to work with various three-dimensional shapes and their corresponding nets.
