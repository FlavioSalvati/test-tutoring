The factorized form of the expression $10y - 20$ is $10(y - 2)$.

To factor the expression $10y - 20$, we begin by identifying the greatest common factor (GCF) of its terms. In this case, both $10y$ and $20$ share a common factor of $10$. By factoring out this GCF, we can express the original expression in a simpler, more manageable form.

First, we need to determine the GCF of the coefficients of the terms involved. The coefficients here are $10$ and $20$. The GCF of $10$ and $20$ is $10$. Next, we factor out the $10$ from each term in the expression. This step involves dividing each term by $10$ and placing the $10$ outside a set of parentheses.

Calculating this, we find that $10y$ divided by $10$ equals $y$, and $-20$ divided by $10$ equals $-2$. Consequently, the expression inside the parentheses becomes $(y - 2)$. Therefore, we can rewrite the original expression as:

$$
10(y - 2).
$$

This factorization process is crucial for simplifying expressions, and it often proves beneficial when solving equations or simplifying algebraic fractions. Always remember to start by identifying the greatest common factor when factorizing expressions.
