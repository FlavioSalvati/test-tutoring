The midpoint of the line segment defined by the endpoints $(2, 4)$ and $(6, 8)$ is $(4, 6)$.

To determine the midpoint of a line segment, we utilize the midpoint formula:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

This formula calculates the average of the $x$-coordinates and the $y$-coordinates of the endpoints. In our case, the endpoints are $(2, 4)$ and $(6, 8)$.

First, we will calculate the average of the $x$-coordinates. The $x$-coordinates are $2$ and $6$. Summing these gives us:

$$
2 + 6 = 8
$$

Next, we divide this total by $2$ to find the average:

$$
\frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

Now, we will compute the average of the $y$-coordinates. The $y$-coordinates are $4$ and $8$. Adding these together yields:

$$
4 + 8 = 12
$$

We then divide this sum by $2$ to obtain the average:

$$
\frac{12}{2} = 6
$$

Thus, the midpoint of the segment with endpoints $(2, 4)$ and $(6, 8)$ is $(4, 6)$. This point represents the exact halfway mark between the two endpoints, both horizontally and vertically. Understanding how to calculate the midpoint is a valuable skill in geometry, as it aids in solving various problems related to line segments and coordinate systems.
