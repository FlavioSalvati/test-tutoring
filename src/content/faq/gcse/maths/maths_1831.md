The expression $2^3$ evaluates to $8$.

To grasp why $2^3$ equals $8$, letâ€™s break it down step by step. The notation $2^3$ is pronounced as "2 to the power of 3" or "2 cubed." This indicates that we multiply the number $2$ by itself a total of three times. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2.
$$

First, we compute $2 \times 2$, which results in $4$. Next, we take that result and multiply it by $2$ once more:

$$
4 \times 2 = 8.
$$

Thus, we conclude that $2^3 = 8$.

Exponents, or powers, are a method of expressing repeated multiplication of the same number. The number that is multiplied is referred to as the "base," while the number of times it is multiplied is known as the "exponent." In this instance, $2$ is the base, and $3$ is the exponent.

Understanding exponents is essential in GCSE Maths, as they appear across various topics, including algebra, geometry, and scientific notation. Exponents facilitate the simplification of expressions and the efficient solving of equations. For instance, knowing that $2^3 = 8$ allows you to quickly tackle problems involving powers of $2$ without needing to perform the multiplication each time.

Therefore, whenever you encounter an exponent, remember that it serves as a shorthand notation for saying "multiply this number by itself this many times." This approach significantly streamlines calculations, particularly as the numbers and exponents increase in size.
