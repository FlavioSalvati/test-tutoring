The gradient of the line given by the equation 

$$ 
y = -2x + 7 
$$ 

is $ -2 $.

In the equation of a straight line, which is conventionally expressed in the form 

$$ 
y = mx + c, 
$$ 

the gradient (or slope) is denoted by the coefficient $ m $. This coefficient indicates both the steepness and the direction of the line. In our case, for the equation $ y = -2x + 7 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ -2 $. Thus, the gradient of the line is $ -2 $.

The gradient quantifies how much the $ y $-value changes in response to a unit change in the $ x $-value. A negative gradient, such as $ -2 $, signifies that the line slopes downward as one moves from left to right. Specifically, for every increase of $ 1 $ unit in $ x $, the $ y $-value decreases by $ 2 $ units. This downward trend is why the line descends along the $ x $-axis.

Understanding the gradient is essential, as it allows you to assess both the direction and steepness of the line. If the gradient were positive, the line would slope upwards, indicating that $ y $ increases as $ x $ increases. Conversely, if the gradient were zero, the line would be horizontal, signifying that there is no change in $ y $ when $ x $ changes. In summary, a gradient of $ -2 $ indicates that the line is relatively steep and descends as you move from left to right on the graph.
