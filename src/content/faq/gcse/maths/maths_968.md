The slope of the linear equation $ y = 7x - 1 $ is 7.

To find the slope of the equation $ y = 7x - 1 $, we need to examine the coefficient of $ x $. In the standard form of a linear equation, represented as $ y = mx + c $, the variable $ m $ denotes the slope, while $ c $ represents the y-intercept. In our equation, it is already presented in this form, where $ m = 7 $ and $ c = -1 $. Thus, the slope is simply the value of $ m $, which is 7.

The slope of a line provides insight into its steepness and direction. A positive slope, such as 7, indicates that the line rises as it moves from left to right. Specifically, for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by 7 units. This steepness is quite pronounced, demonstrating a rapid increase in $ y $ relative to $ x $.

Understanding the slope is essential for graphing the line and analyzing its behavior. For example, if you were to plot the equation $ y = 7x - 1 $ on a graph, you would begin at the y-intercept, which is -1 (the point where the line intersects the y-axis). From this point, you would move up 7 units for each 1 unit you move to the right, effectively following the slope. This method aids in visualizing and predicting the trajectory of the line on the coordinate plane.
