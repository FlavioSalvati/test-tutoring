To calculate the expression $2^3 \times 2^4$, we can simplify the process by adding the exponents. According to the laws of indices, specifically the property that states $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$, we can rewrite our expression as follows:

$$
2^3 \times 2^4 = 2^{3+4} = 2^7
$$

Next, we need to compute $2^7$. This expression represents $2$ multiplied by itself $7$ times:

$$
2^7 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
$$

To find the value of $2^7$, we can perform the multiplication step-by-step:

$$
2 \times 2 = 4
$$
$$
4 \times 2 = 8
$$
$$
8 \times 2 = 16
$$
$$
16 \times 2 = 32
$$
$$
32 \times 2 = 64
$$
$$
64 \times 2 = 128
$$

Thus, we find that $2^7 = 128$. Consequently, we conclude that:

$$
2^3 \times 2^4 = 128
$$

This method can be applied to any numbers with the same base, allowing for the simplification of multiplication involving exponents.
