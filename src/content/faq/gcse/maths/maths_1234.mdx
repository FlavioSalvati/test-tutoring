To determine the surface area of a cone, we need to combine two components: the base area and the lateral surface area.

The surface area of a cone is made up of two distinct parts. The base of the cone has a circular shape, and its area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, which is given by:

$$
\text{Base Area} = \pi r^2
$$

For this example, the radius $ r $ is given as $3 \, \text{cm}$. Therefore, we can compute the base area as follows:

$$
\text{Base Area} = \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Next, we proceed to calculate the lateral surface area of the cone. The formula for the lateral surface area is:

$$
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi r l
$$

where $ l $ represents the slant height. In this case, the slant height $ l $ is given as $7 \, \text{cm}$. Substituting the values, we find the lateral surface area:

$$
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi \times 3 \times 7 = 21\pi \, \text{cm}^2
$$

To find the total surface area of the cone, we add the base area and the lateral surface area together:

$$
\text{Total Surface Area} = 9\pi + 21\pi = 30\pi \, \text{cm}^2
$$

If you would like a numerical approximation, you can use the value of $ \pi $ as approximately $3.14$:

$$
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 30 \times 3.14 = 94.2 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Thus, the surface area of the cone is approximately $94.2 \, \text{cm}^2$.
