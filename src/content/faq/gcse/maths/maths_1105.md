To calculate the area of a similar shape, you need to multiply the area of the original shape by the square of the scale factor.

When working with similar shapes, it is essential to note that their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional. This means that if you have the scale factor between two similar shapes, you can use it to determine the area of one shape based on the area of the other.

First, identify the scale factor between the two shapes. The scale factor is the ratio of any pair of corresponding lengths in the similar shapes. For instance, if one side of a smaller shape measures $3 \, \text{cm}$ and the corresponding side of a larger shape measures $6 \, \text{cm}$, then the scale factor can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Scale Factor} = \frac{6 \, \text{cm}}{3 \, \text{cm}} = 2.
$$

Next, to find the area of the similar shape, you will need to square the scale factor. In our example, with a scale factor of $2$, squaring it results in:

$$
2^2 = 4.
$$

This indicates that the area of the larger shape is $4$ times that of the smaller shape.

Finally, to find the area of the larger shape, multiply the area of the original shape by the squared scale factor. If the area of the smaller shape is $10 \, \text{cm}^2$, then the area of the larger shape can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Area of Larger Shape} = 10 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 4 = 40 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

It is important to remember that this method works in both directions. If you know the area of the larger shape and wish to find the area of the smaller shape, you would divide by the squared scale factor instead. Understanding how areas scale with similar shapes is a fundamental concept in geometry.
