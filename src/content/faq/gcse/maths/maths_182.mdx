The expression $\frac{5^3}{5^2}$ simplifies to $5$.

To grasp why this is true, let's analyze the problem using the rules of indices (or exponents). When dividing two numbers that share the same base, the exponent of the denominator is subtracted from the exponent of the numerator. In this case, both the numerator and the denominator have the base $5$. Specifically, the numerator $5^3$ indicates $5$ raised to the power of $3$, while the denominator $5^2$ indicates $5$ raised to the power of $2$.

Applying the rule of indices for division, we can express this as:

$$
\frac{5^3}{5^2} = 5^{3-2} = 5^1.
$$

Since any number raised to the power of $1$ equals the number itself, we find that $5^1$ is simply $5$.

To visualize this further, consider what $5^3$ and $5^2$ represent. The expression $5^3$ can be expanded to $5 \times 5 \times 5$, while $5^2$ expands to $5 \times 5$. When you divide $5 \times 5 \times 5$ by $5 \times 5$, you can cancel out two $5$s from both the numerator and the denominator, leaving you with just one $5$. This confirms that:

$$
\frac{5^3}{5^2} = 5.
$$

Understanding these rules is essential for simplifying various problems involving indices and streamlining calculations. With continued practice, you'll find that working with exponents will become second nature!
