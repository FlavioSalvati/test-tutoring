To sketch the graph of the function $ y = 3^x $, follow these steps: plot key points, draw a smooth curve, and observe the asymptotic behavior of the graph.

First, recognize that $ y = 3^x $ is an exponential function with a base of 3. This indicates that as $ x $ increases, the value of $ y $ will rise rapidly, while as $ x $ decreases, $ y $ approaches zero.

Begin by plotting some essential points on the graph. For instance:

- When $ x = -2 $, then $ y = 3^{-2} = \frac{1}{9} $.
- When $ x = -1 $, then $ y = 3^{-1} = \frac{1}{3} $.
- When $ x = 0 $, then $ y = 3^0 = 1 $.
- When $ x = 1 $, then $ y = 3^1 = 3 $.
- When $ x = 2 $, then $ y = 3^2 = 9 $.

These calculated points will guide you in accurately shaping the curve.

Next, connect these points with a smooth curve. The curve should start just above the x-axis on the left side (as $ x $ approaches negative infinity, $ y $ approaches 0 but never actually reaches it). The curve will pass through the points you plotted and rise steeply on the right side.

Itâ€™s important to note that the graph has a horizontal asymptote at $ y = 0 $. This indicates that as $ x $ becomes more negative, the graph gets closer and closer to the x-axis without ever touching it.

Finally, be sure to label your axes and the key points you have plotted. This will enhance the clarity of your graph, making it easier to interpret and understand.
