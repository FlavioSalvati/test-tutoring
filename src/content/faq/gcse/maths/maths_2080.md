To expand the expression $(x + 4)(x + 3)$, we can apply the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method. The FOIL acronym stands for First, Outer, Inner, and Last, which represents the pairs of terms we multiply from each binomial. 

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **First**, multiply the first terms in each binomial: 
   $$ 
   x \times x = x^2 
   $$

2. **Outer**, multiply the outer terms: 
   $$ 
   x \times 3 = 3x 
   $$

3. **Inner**, multiply the inner terms: 
   $$ 
   4 \times x = 4x 
   $$

4. **Last**, multiply the last terms: 
   $$ 
   4 \times 3 = 12 
   $$

Next, we combine all these products together: 
$$ 
x^2 + 3x + 4x + 12 
$$

Now, we combine the like terms, specifically the $3x$ and $4x$: 
$$ 
x^2 + 7x + 12 
$$

Thus, the expanded form of $(x + 4)(x + 3)$ is 
$$ 
x^2 + 7x + 12 
$$ 

This method ensures that every term in the first binomial is multiplied by every term in the second binomial, resulting in a quadratic expression.
