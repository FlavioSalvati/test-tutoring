To convert a flow rate from gallons per hour to litres per minute, you can use a straightforward multiplication by $0.06309$.

To better understand this conversion, letâ€™s break it down into two clear steps: first, we will convert gallons to litres, and then we will convert hours to minutes.

1. **Converting Gallons to Litres**: 
   One US gallon is approximately $3.78541$ litres. Therefore, if you have a flow rate expressed in gallons per hour, you can convert it to litres per hour by multiplying the number of gallons by $3.78541$. For instance, if you have a flow rate of $10$ gallons per hour, the conversion to litres per hour would be calculated as follows:

   $$ 
   10 \, \text{gallons/hour} \times 3.78541 \, \text{litres/gallon} = 37.8541 \, \text{litres/hour} 
   $$

2. **Converting Hours to Minutes**: 
   Next, we convert the time unit from hours to minutes. Since there are $60$ minutes in an hour, to convert from litres per hour to litres per minute, you divide by $60$. Continuing with our previous example:

   $$ 
   \frac{37.8541 \, \text{litres/hour}}{60} \approx 0.6309 \, \text{litres/minute} 
   $$

By combining these two steps into a single formula, we can derive a more efficient method: multiply the flow rate in gallons per hour by $3.78541$ and then divide by $60$. This process can be simplified to a single multiplication by $0.06309$. Thus, if you have a flow rate of $10$ gallons per hour, you would calculate:

$$ 
10 \, \text{gallons/hour} \times 0.06309 \approx 0.6309 \, \text{litres/minute} 
$$

This approach allows you to easily convert any flow rate from gallons per hour to litres per minute using a simple multiplication factor.
