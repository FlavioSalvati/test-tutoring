A cube root of a number is defined as a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, yields the original number.

In mathematical terms, if $ x $ represents the cube root of $ y $, then the relationship can be expressed as:

$$
x^3 = y
$$

For example, the cube root of $ 27 $ is $ 3 $, since:

$$
3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27
$$

Likewise, the cube root of $ -8 $ is $ -2 $, because:

$$
-2 \times -2 \times -2 = -8
$$

The cube root of a number is denoted by the symbol $ \sqrt[3]{y} $.

Unlike square roots, cube roots can be both positive and negative. This is due to the fact that multiplying three negative numbers results in a negative product. Consequently, every real number has exactly one real cube root. For instance, the cube root of $ 64 $ is $ 4 $, and the cube root of $ -64 $ is $ -4 $.

To determine the cube root of a number, you can use a calculator or estimate it by recognizing perfect cubes. Perfect cubes are specific integers such as $ 1, 8, 27, 64, 125 $, etc., which are derived from cubing whole numbers. For non-perfect cubes, more advanced methods or tools may be necessary to find an accurate approximation.

Understanding cube roots is crucial for solving equations that involve cubic terms and has various applications in science and engineering. It aids in simplifying mathematical expressions and resolving real-world problems related to volume and scaling.
