To determine the composite function $ (f \circ g)(x) $, we need to substitute $ g(x) $ into $ f(x) $. This results in the expression $ (f \circ g)(x) = 2x + 3 $.

Let’s clarify the concept of composite functions. A composite function is formed when one function is applied to the output of another function. In this case, we have two specific functions: 

- $ f(x) = x + 3 $ 
- $ g(x) = 2x $

The notation $ (f \circ g)(x) $ indicates that we first evaluate $ g(x) $ and then apply $ f(x) $ to that result.

To compute $ (f \circ g)(x) $, we begin by substituting $ g(x) $ into $ f(x) $. Since $ g(x) = 2x $, we replace the $ x $ in $ f(x) $ with $ 2x $. This leads us to the following expression:

$$
f(g(x)) = f(2x)
$$

Next, we substitute $ 2x $ into the definition of $ f(x) $, which is given by $ x + 3 $. Thus, wherever $ x $ appears in $ f(x) $, we replace it with $ 2x $:

$$
f(2x) = 2x + 3
$$

Consequently, the composite function $ (f \circ g)(x) $ can be expressed as:

$$
(f \circ g)(x) = 2x + 3
$$

In summary, this means that by first applying $ g(x) $ to an input $ x $ (which doubles it to yield $ 2x $), and subsequently applying $ f(x) $ to that result, we effectively add $ 3 $ to obtain the final output. Understanding this substitution process is crucial for grasping how composite functions operate.
