The exact value of $\cos 45^\circ$ is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

To understand why $\cos 45^\circ$ equals $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we can examine a special type of right-angled triangle known as an isosceles right-angled triangle. In this triangle, the two non-right angles are both $45^\circ$. If we consider an isosceles right triangle where both legs (the sides opposite the $45^\circ$ angles) have equal lengths of $1$ unit each, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to determine the length of the hypotenuse.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, for our triangle, we have:

$$
\text{hypotenuse}^2 = 1^2 + 1^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\text{hypotenuse}^2 = 1 + 1 = 2
$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

$$
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{2}
$$

Next, the cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. For the $45^\circ$ angle in our triangle, the length of the adjacent side is $1$ unit, and the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ units. Thus, we can express the cosine as follows:

$$
\cos 45^\circ = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

To rationalize the denominator (i.e., to make the denominator a rational number), we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{2}$:

$$
\cos 45^\circ = \frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
$$

Consequently, the exact value of $\cos 45^\circ$ is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
