To convert £25 to pence, you multiply $25$ by $100$, which gives you a total of $2500$ pence.

In the United Kingdom, the currency is the pound sterling (£), which is subdivided into $100$ smaller units known as pence (p). This means that $1$ pound (£1) is equivalent to $100$ pence (100p). To convert an amount in pounds to pence, you simply multiply the number of pounds by $100$.

For instance, if you have £25 and want to determine how many pence this equates to, you can perform the following calculation: 

$$
25 \text{ pounds} \times 100 \text{ pence per pound} = 2500 \text{ pence}.
$$

This conversion method is applicable to any amount in pounds. For example, if you have £3.50, you would convert it to pence by multiplying $3.50$ by $100$, resulting in $350$ pence. The crucial step in this process is to multiply the number of pounds by $100$ to obtain the equivalent amount in pence.

Understanding this conversion is valuable in various real-life situations, such as when managing prices, budgeting, or using vending machines that may only accept coins. It is a straightforward yet essential skill in everyday mathematics.
