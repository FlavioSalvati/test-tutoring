Letâ€™s enhance the clarity and readability of the content while ensuring proper formatting for mathematical expressions.

In the equation 

$$ \frac{s}{2} + 1 = 5, $$ 

the variable $s$ is the unknown we need to determine.

To solve for $s$, we must isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's go through the steps methodically. The initial equation is:

$$ \frac{s}{2} + 1 = 5. $$

First, we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We can achieve this by subtracting $1$ from both sides:

$$ \frac{s}{2} + 1 - 1 = 5 - 1. $$

This simplifies to:

$$ \frac{s}{2} = 4. $$

Next, to isolate $s$, we need to remove the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by $2$:

$$ 2 \times \frac{s}{2} = 4 \times 2. $$

This simplifies to:

$$ s = 8. $$

Thus, we conclude that in this equation, $s$ is the variable that, when divided by $2$ and then increased by $1$, equals $5$. Through this process, we find that $s$ is equal to $8$. Mastering the technique of isolating variables and applying inverse operations is a fundamental skill in algebra, enabling us to solve for unknowns in a variety of mathematical contexts.
