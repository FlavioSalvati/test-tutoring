To find the cube root of a number using a calculator, you typically have two options: the "∛" button or the exponentiation key, where you can input the exponent as $\frac{1}{3}$.

If your calculator features the "∛" button, you can directly use it to compute the cube root. For instance, to find the cube root of $27$, simply press the "∛" button after entering $27$. If your calculator lacks this specific button, you can utilize the exponentiation function instead. In this case, to calculate the cube root of $27$, you would enter $27^{\frac{1}{3}}$. This approach works because raising a number to the power of $\frac{1}{3}$ is mathematically equivalent to taking its cube root.

On some scientific calculators, accessing the exponentiation function may require a combination of key presses. For example, you might need to press the shift or second function key, followed by the exponentiation key (often labeled as "$^{}$" or "$y^x$"), and then input $\frac{1}{3}$. If you're uncertain about the process, it's always a good idea to consult your calculator's manual, as the method can vary between different models.

Understanding how to find the cube root is a valuable skill in various mathematical contexts, including solving equations and analyzing geometric shapes. For example, if you know the volume of a cube, you can determine the length of one side by calculating the cube root of the volume. Mastering this concept is essential not only for academic success but also for practical applications in fields such as science and engineering.
