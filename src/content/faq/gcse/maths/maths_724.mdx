To subtract $ 5 \times 10^5 $ from $ 2 \times 10^6 $, we arrive at the result of $ 1.5 \times 10^6 $.

To clarify this subtraction process, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to express both numbers with the same power of ten. The number $ 2 \times 10^6 $ is already in the desired form, but $ 5 \times 10^5 $ can be rewritten as $ 0.5 \times 10^6 $. This adjustment simplifies our subtraction, as both numbers now share the same exponent.

Next, we focus on subtracting the coefficients (the numerical parts in front of the powers of ten). We take $ 2 $ from $ 2 \times 10^6 $ and subtract $ 0.5 $ from $ 0.5 \times 10^6 $. This calculation yields:

$$
2 - 0.5 = 1.5
$$

Since both terms are still multiplied by $ 10^6 $, we maintain the power of ten. Consequently, the final result of the subtraction is:

$$
1.5 \times 10^6
$$

This method of aligning the powers of ten before subtracting the coefficients is a standard procedure in scientific notation, simplifying the handling of large numbers.
