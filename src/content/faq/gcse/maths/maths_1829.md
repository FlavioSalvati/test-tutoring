To simplify the expression $7^{-2}$, we can rewrite it using the property of negative exponents:

$$
7^{-2} = \frac{1}{7^2}
$$

Calculating $7^2$ gives us $49$, thus:

$$
7^{-2} = \frac{1}{49}
$$

When you encounter a negative exponent, it indicates that you should take the reciprocal of the base and then apply the positive exponent. In this case, the base is $7$ and the exponent is $-2$. The negative sign in the exponent instructs us to take the reciprocal of $7$, resulting in:

$$
\frac{1}{7}
$$

Next, we apply the positive exponent to this reciprocal. Specifically, $\left(\frac{1}{7}\right)^2$ means we multiply $\frac{1}{7}$ by itself:

$$
\left(\frac{1}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{7} \times \frac{1}{7} = \frac{1}{49}
$$

Therefore, we conclude that:

$$
7^{-2} = \frac{1}{49}
$$

This method is applicable to any negative exponent: simply take the reciprocal of the base and raise it to the positive version of the exponent. Remembering this technique is invaluable for simplifying expressions involving negative exponents.
