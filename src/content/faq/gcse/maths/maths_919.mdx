To graph the function $ y = 2^x $, you will first need to create a table of values, plot the corresponding points, and then connect them with a smooth curve.

Begin by selecting a range of $ x $ values that includes negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. A suitable choice could be $ x = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 $. For each of these $ x $ values, compute the corresponding $ y $ values using the equation $ y = 2^x $.

Here is a quick reference table for the values:

- When $ x = -3 $, $ y = 2^{-3} = \frac{1}{8} $.
- When $ x = -2 $, $ y = 2^{-2} = \frac{1}{4} $.
- When $ x = -1 $, $ y = 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} $.
- When $ x = 0 $, $ y = 2^0 = 1 $.
- When $ x = 1 $, $ y = 2^1 = 2 $.
- When $ x = 2 $, $ y = 2^2 = 4 $.
- When $ x = 3 $, $ y = 2^3 = 8 $.

Next, plot these points on a graph with the $ x $-axis and $ y $-axis. Carefully mark each point: specifically, plot the coordinates $ (-3, 0.125) $, $ (-2, 0.25) $, $ (-1, 0.5) $, $ (0, 1) $, $ (1, 2) $, $ (2, 4) $, and $ (3, 8) $.

Once all points are plotted, connect them with a smooth curve. The curve should approach the $ x $-axis as $ x $ takes negative values, pass through the point $ (0, 1) $, and rise steeply as $ x $ increases. This curve visually represents the exponential growth behavior of the function $ y = 2^x $.
