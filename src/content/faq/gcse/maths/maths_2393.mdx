The equation of a line that is parallel to $ y = 4x - 1 $ can be expressed as $ y = 4x + c $.

To understand the reasoning behind this, let's examine the equation of the given line, $ y = 4x - 1 $. This equation is in the slope-intercept form, which is represented as $ y = mx + b $, where $ m $ denotes the slope and $ b $ represents the y-intercept. For the line in question, the slope $ m $ is equal to $ 4 $.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same slope. Therefore, any line that is parallel to $ y = 4x - 1 $ must also have a slope of $ 4 $. The general equation for any line with a slope of $ 4 $ can be written as $ y = 4x + c $, where $ c $ is a constant that can take any real value. This constant $ c $ signifies the y-intercept of the new line, which can vary, while the slope remains constant.

For instance, if we set $ c = 2 $, the equation of the parallel line would be $ y = 4x + 2 $. Conversely, if $ c = -3 $, the equation would then be $ y = 4x - 3 $. The essential point is that the slope $ 4 $ remains unchanged, thereby ensuring that the lines are parallel.

In summary, the equation of any line parallel to $ y = 4x - 1 $ will always take the form $ y = 4x + c $, where $ c $ is any constant. This consistent slope guarantees that the lines do not intersect and remain parallel to each other.
