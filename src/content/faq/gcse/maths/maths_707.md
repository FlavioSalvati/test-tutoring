To calculate $ 3^{-2} $, you need to find the reciprocal of $ 3^2 $, which equals $ \frac{1}{9} $.

When dealing with a negative exponent, it signifies that you should take the reciprocal of the base raised to the corresponding positive exponent. Therefore, $ 3^{-2} $ indicates that you need to compute the reciprocal of $ 3^2 $.

First, let's compute $ 3^2 $. This involves multiplying $ 3 $ by itself:

$$
3 \times 3 = 9
$$

Next, we need to take the reciprocal of $ 9 $. The reciprocal of a number is defined as $ 1 $ divided by that number. Consequently, the reciprocal of $ 9 $ is:

$$
\frac{1}{9}
$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$
3^{-2} = \frac{1}{9}
$$

This approach can be applied to any base with a negative exponent. For instance, if you were to evaluate $ 5^{-3} $, you would first calculate $ 5^3 $, which equals $ 125 $, and then take the reciprocal, yielding:

$$
\frac{1}{125}
$$

Grasping this concept is essential for effectively working with indices and exponents in mathematics.
