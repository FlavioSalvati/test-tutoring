The gradient of the function $ y = \ln(x) $ at the point where $ x = 1 $ is equal to $1$.

To determine the gradient of $ y = \ln(x) $ at a specific point, we need to compute the derivative of the function with respect to $ x $. The derivative of $ \ln(x) $ is given by 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}.
$$

This derivative represents the gradient of the curve at any point $ x $.

Next, we substitute $ x = 1 $ into the derivative:

$$
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
$$

This indicates that the gradient of the curve $ y = \ln(x) $ at the point where $ x = 1 $ is indeed $1$.

In simpler terms, the gradient of a curve at a particular point reflects its slope or steepness at that point. For the natural logarithm function $ y = \ln(x) $, the slope at $ x = 1 $ is exactly $1$. This means that if you were to draw a tangent line to the curve at $ x = 1 $, the line would rise by $1$ unit for every $1$ unit it moves to the right. 

Understanding the concept of the gradient is fundamental in calculus as it helps us analyze how functions behave at specific points.
