To find the magnitude and direction of the vector $(4, 4)$, we will utilize Pythagoras' theorem and some basic principles of trigonometry.

**Step 1: Calculate the Magnitude of the Vector**

The magnitude of a vector $(x, y)$ is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

For the vector $(4, 4)$, we substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 4$ into the formula:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{16 + 16} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(4, 4)$ is $4\sqrt{2}$.

**Step 2: Determine the Direction of the Vector**

The direction of a vector is typically expressed as the angle $\theta$ that it forms with the positive x-axis. We can find this angle using the tangent function, which relates the angle to the ratio of the y-component to the x-component of the vector:

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}
$$

For the vector $(4, 4)$, this relationship is:

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{4}{4} = 1
$$

To find $\theta$, we take the inverse tangent (or arctan) of $1$:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}(1)
$$

In degrees, $\tan^{-1}(1)$ equals $45^\circ$. Therefore, the direction of the vector $(4, 4)$ is $45^\circ$ from the positive x-axis.

**Summary**

In conclusion, the magnitude of the vector $(4, 4)$ is $4\sqrt{2}$, and its direction is $45^\circ$ relative to the positive x-axis.
