To calculate the surface area of a similar sphere, you can use the square of the ratio of their radii multiplied by the surface area of the original sphere.

When working with similar spheres, their surface areas are directly proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii. If you know the surface area of one sphere and the ratio of the radii of the two spheres, you can easily determine the surface area of the other sphere.

Consider two spheres, Sphere A and Sphere B. Let the radius of Sphere A be denoted as $r_A$, and the radius of Sphere B as $r_B$. If the surface area of Sphere A is $SA_A$, you can find the surface area of Sphere B, denoted as $SA_B$, by following these steps:

1. Calculate the ratio of the radii: $$\frac{r_B}{r_A}$$.
2. Square this ratio: $$\left(\frac{r_B}{r_A}\right)^2$$.
3. Multiply the squared ratio by the surface area of Sphere A: $$SA_B = \left(\frac{r_B}{r_A}\right)^2 \times SA_A$$.

For example, if Sphere A has a radius of $3 \, \text{cm}$ and a surface area of $113.1 \, \text{cm}^2$, while Sphere B has a radius of $6 \, \text{cm}$, you would first find the ratio of the radii: 

$$\frac{6}{3} = 2.$$

Next, squaring this ratio yields:

$$2^2 = 4.$$

Thus, the surface area of Sphere B can be calculated as:

$$SA_B = 4 \times 113.1 \, \text{cm}^2 = 452.4 \, \text{cm}^2.$$

This method takes advantage of the geometric principle that the surface area of spheres scales with the square of their radii, making it a straightforward process to find the surface area of similar spheres.
