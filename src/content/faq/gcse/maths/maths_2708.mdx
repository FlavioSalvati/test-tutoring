The length of the other leg is $12$ cm.

To determine the length of the unknown leg in a right-angled triangle, we can apply Pythagoras' Theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The formula is expressed as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Here, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the other two legs of the triangle.

In this particular problem, we know the hypotenuse $c = 13$ cm and one leg $a = 5$ cm. Our goal is to find the length of the other leg $b$. By substituting the known values into the formula, we have:

$$
5^2 + b^2 = 13^2
$$

Simplifying this equation yields:

$$
25 + b^2 = 169
$$

Next, we subtract $25$ from both sides to isolate $b^2$:

$$
b^2 = 144
$$

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for $b$:

$$
b = \sqrt{144} = 12
$$

Thus, the length of the other leg is $12$ cm. This example demonstrates a straightforward application of Pythagoras' Theorem, which is a fundamental concept in GCSE Mathematics. Mastering the manipulation and solving of equations using this theorem is essential for tackling various problems involving right-angled triangles.
