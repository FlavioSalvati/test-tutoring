The length of a leg in a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse measuring $17 \, \text{cm}$ is dependent on the length of the other leg.

In a right-angled triangle, the relationship between the sides is dictated by Pythagoras' Theorem. This theorem asserts that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

In this equation, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the other two legs.

Given that the hypotenuse $c$ is $17 \, \text{cm}$, we can apply this theorem to determine the length of one leg if we know the length of the other leg. For instance, if one leg, $a$, is $8 \, \text{cm}$, we can find the length of the other leg, $b$, by rearranging the formula to solve for $b$:

$$
b^2 = c^2 - a^2
$$

Substituting the known values into the equation, we have:

$$
b^2 = 17^2 - 8^2 = 289 - 64 = 225
$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

$$
b = \sqrt{225} = 15 \, \text{cm}
$$

If the lengths of neither leg are known, it is not possible to determine the exact length of a leg based solely on the hypotenuse. However, if you have the length of one leg, you can always use Pythagoras' Theorem to calculate the length of the other leg. This theorem is a fundamental concept in GCSE Mathematics and serves as a valuable tool for solving problems involving right-angled triangles.
