The reflection of the point $(3, 4)$ across the line $y = -x$ is given by the point $(-4, -3)$.

To find the reflection of a point over the line $y = -x$, follow these steps: First, swap the coordinates of the point, and then change the signs of both coordinates. This process is necessary because the line $y = -x$ is a diagonal line that extends from the top left to the bottom right of the coordinate plane. Reflecting a point over this line effectively flips it across this diagonal.

Let's illustrate this method step-by-step. Starting with the original point $(3, 4)$, we first swap the coordinates, which results in the new point $(4, 3)$. Next, we change the signs of both coordinates: changing the sign of $4$ gives us $-4$, and changing the sign of $3$ gives us $-3$. As a result, the reflected point is $(-4, -3)$.

This technique is effective because the line $y = -x$ serves as a mirror, and reflecting a point over this line involves both swapping the coordinates and inverting their signs. This method is a valuable tool in coordinate geometry and can be applied to reflect any point over the line $y = -x$. Remember, the essential steps are to swap the coordinates and then change their signs.
