Qualitative data refers to non-numerical information that describes various qualities or characteristics of a subject.

This type of data captures the essence of the phenomenon being studied without focusing primarily on numerical values. Qualitative data is typically collected through methods such as interviews, observations, and open-ended surveys. For instance, if you were investigating people's opinions on a new school uniform, you might ask them to describe their feelings about it. Their responses—such as "comfortable," "stylish," or "uncomfortable"—serve as examples of qualitative data.

In contrast to quantitative data, which involves numbers and measurements, qualitative data emphasizes understanding the 'why' and 'how' of a given topic. It provides context and depth to the information gathered. For example, if a survey reveals that $70\%$ of students dislike the new uniform, qualitative data can offer insights into the reasons behind their feelings, illuminating aspects that numerical data alone cannot convey.

In the context of GCSE Maths, grasping the concept of qualitative data is essential, as it complements quantitative data. While numerical data can inform us about how many or how much, qualitative data can elucidate the reasons behind those numbers. This dual approach enables a more comprehensive analysis and interpretation of data. For instance, when conducting a project or research, integrating both qualitative and quantitative data can yield a richer understanding of the topic under investigation.
