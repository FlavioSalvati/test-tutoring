To determine the $n$th term of the sequence $4, 10, 18, 28$, we can use the formula $$n^2 + 3n$$.

To derive the $n$th term of a sequence, we first need to identify the underlying pattern or rule that generates the terms. For the sequence given, we analyze the differences between consecutive terms:

- The first differences are: 
  - $10 - 4 = 6$
  - $18 - 10 = 8$
  - $28 - 18 = 10$

These first differences ($6, 8, 10$) are not constant, so we calculate the second differences:

- The second differences are:
  - $8 - 6 = 2$
  - $10 - 8 = 2$

Since the second differences are constant, we can conclude that this is a quadratic sequence.

A quadratic sequence can be represented in the general form $$an^2 + bn + c$$. To find the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$, we will use the first few terms of the sequence.

We establish a system of equations based on the terms of the sequence:

1. For $n = 1$: 
   $$a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 4$$ 
   which simplifies to $$a + b + c = 4$$
   
2. For $n = 2$: 
   $$a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 10$$ 
   simplifying to $$4a + 2b + c = 10$$
   
3. For $n = 3$: 
   $$a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 18$$ 
   simplifying to $$9a + 3b + c = 18$$

This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $$a + b + c = 4$$
2. $$4a + 2b + c = 10$$
3. $$9a + 3b + c = 18$$

Next, we will solve these equations. 

First, we subtract the first equation from the second:

$$ (4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 10 - 4 $$
This simplifies to:
$$ 3a + b = 6 \quad \text{(Equation 4)} $$

Next, we subtract the second equation from the third:

$$ (9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 18 - 10 $$
This simplifies to:
$$ 5a + b = 8 \quad \text{(Equation 5)} $$

Now, we can eliminate $b$ by subtracting Equation 4 from Equation 5:

$$ (5a + b) - (3a + b) = 8 - 6 $$
This simplifies to:
$$ 2a = 2 \implies a = 1 $$

Next, we substitute $a = 1$ back into Equation 4 to find $b$:

$$ 3(1) + b = 6 $$
This simplifies to:
$$ 3 + b = 6 \implies b = 3 $$

Finally, we substitute both $a = 1$ and $b = 3$ back into the first equation to find $c$:

$$ 1 + 3 + c = 4 $$
This simplifies to:
$$ 4 + c = 4 \implies c = 0 $$

Thus, the formula for the $n$th term of the sequence is given by:

$$ n^2 + 3n $$
