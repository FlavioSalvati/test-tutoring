A skewed histogram reveals that the data is not symmetrically distributed around its mean.

When a histogram exhibits skewness, it indicates that the data values are unevenly distributed relative to the central value. There are two primary types of skewness: positive (or right) skew and negative (or left) skew. In a positively skewed histogram, the tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or thicker than that on the left. This suggests the presence of a few unusually high values, which pull the mean to the right. In contrast, a negatively skewed histogram features a longer or thicker tail on the left side, indicating that a few unusually low values are pulling the mean to the left.

Understanding skewness is crucial as it influences measures of central tendency, such as the mean, median, and mode. In a positively skewed distribution, the relationship typically follows: 

$$ \text{mean} > \text{median} > \text{mode}. $$

Conversely, in a negatively skewed distribution, the relationship is usually:

$$ \text{mean} < \text{median} < \text{mode}. $$

This information can provide insight into the overall shape and spread of your data, and it can guide your decision-making regarding the statistical methods most suitable for further analysis.

For instance, when working with a positively skewed dataset, it may be more appropriate to use the median as the measure of central tendency since it is less influenced by extreme values compared to the mean. Recognizing skewness can also aid in identifying potential outliers or anomalies within your data, prompting further investigation where necessary.
