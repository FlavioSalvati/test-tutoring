The equation of the line is given by 

$$
y = -3x + 6.
$$

To gain a clearer understanding of how we derive this equation, let's break it down step by step. The standard form of a straight line is 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $ m $ denotes the slope (or gradient) of the line and $ c $ indicates the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

In our case, we have a slope of $ -3 $ and a y-intercept of $ 6 $. The slope provides insight into the steepness of the line and its direction. Specifically, a slope of $ -3 $ indicates that for every 1 unit you move to the right along the x-axis, the line descends by 3 units. The y-intercept of $ 6 $ tells us that the line crosses the y-axis at the coordinate point $ (0, 6) $.

By substituting the provided values into the general equation $ y = mx + c $, we replace $ m $ with $ -3 $ and $ c $ with $ 6 $. This results in the specific equation for this line:

$$
y = -3x + 6.
$$

This equation encapsulates all the essential information about the line. For any given value of $ x $, you can determine the corresponding $ y $ value by substituting $ x $ into the equation. For instance, if $ x = 2 $, we can calculate $ y $ as follows:

$$
y = -3(2) + 6 = -6 + 6 = 0.
$$

Thus, the point $ (2, 0) $ lies on the line. This method of expressing a straight line mathematically is both straightforward and powerful.
