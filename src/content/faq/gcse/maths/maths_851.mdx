To factor the expression $18x + 9$, the first step is to identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms involved. In this case, the two terms are $18x$ and $9$. The GCF is the largest number that divides both terms without leaving a remainder. For this expression, the GCF is $9$, as it is the largest number that can evenly divide both $18$ and $9$.

Once the GCF is determined, the next step is to divide each term by this common factor. For the term $18x$, dividing by $9$ yields:

$$
18x \div 9 = 2x
$$

For the term $9$, dividing by $9$ results in:

$$
9 \div 9 = 1
$$

Now, we can express the original expression as a product of the GCF and the simplified terms. Thus, we can rewrite $18x + 9$ as:

$$
9(2x + 1)
$$

This process illustrates that we have successfully factorized the expression by extracting the common factor of $9$, leaving us with $9$ multiplied by the binomial $(2x + 1)$.

Factorization is a valuable skill in algebra, as it simplifies equations and often makes solving them more straightforward. Always begin by identifying the GCF, and then rewrite the expression as a product of this factor and the resulting simplified terms.
