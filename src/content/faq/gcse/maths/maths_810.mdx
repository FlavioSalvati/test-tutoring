To graph an exponential growth function, begin by plotting points for a variety of $x$-values and then connect these points with a smooth curve.

An exponential growth function is expressed in the form:

$$ y = a \cdot b^x $$

where $a$ represents the initial value and $b$ is the growth factor, with the condition that $b > 1$. To effectively visualize the function, select a range of $x$-values that includes both positive and negative values, allowing for a comprehensive spread of points. For each chosen $x$-value, compute the corresponding $y$-value using the function.

For instance, consider the function:

$$ y = 2 \cdot 3^x $$

You might select $x$-values such as $-2$, $-1$, $0$, $1$, and $2$. Calculate the corresponding $y$-values as follows:

- For $x = -2$:

$$ y = 2 \cdot 3^{-2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9} $$

- For $x = -1$:

$$ y = 2 \cdot 3^{-1} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} $$

- For $x = 0$:

$$ y = 2 \cdot 3^0 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 $$

- For $x = 1$:

$$ y = 2 \cdot 3^1 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 $$

- For $x = 2$:

$$ y = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 $$

Next, plot these calculated points on a graph, utilizing the $x$-axis and $y$-axis. Once all points are plotted, draw a smooth curve that connects them. The curve should start near the $x$-axis for negative $x$-values and rise steeply as $x$ becomes positive, illustrating the rapid increase characteristic of exponential growth.

It's important to note that the graph will never actually intersect the $x$-axis; it will approach it infinitely closely but will always remain above it. This behavior is due to the nature of exponential functions, which never reach zero.
