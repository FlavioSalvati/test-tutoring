The position vector of the point $(3, 4)$ is expressed as 

\mathbf{r} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.


To elaborate, a position vector is a representation of a point's location within a coordinate system. For a point defined by coordinates $(x, y)$, the corresponding position vector $\mathbf{r}$ is represented as a column vector, where $x$ occupies the top entry and $y$ occupies the bottom entry. This vector originates from the point $(0, 0)$, or the origin, and extends towards the specified coordinates.

For the point $(3, 4)$, the $x$-coordinate is $3$ and the $y$-coordinate is $4$. Consequently, the position vector $\mathbf{r}$ is 


\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.


This indicates that if you start at the origin and move $3$ units to the right (along the x-axis) and then $4$ units upward (along the y-axis), you will arrive at the point $(3, 4)$.

Position vectors are valuable in various fields of mathematics and physics because they offer a clear and concise method for describing the locations of points in space. They are especially useful for performing operations such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication, which are frequently encountered in vector algebra.
