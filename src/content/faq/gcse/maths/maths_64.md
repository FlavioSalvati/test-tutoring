The number $0.00076$ in standard form is denoted as $7.6 \times 10^{-4}$.

Standard form, also referred to as scientific notation, is a method used to articulate extremely large or incredibly small numbers in a more succinct and manageable manner. The process to convert a number into standard form entails representing it as a multiplication of a number between 1 and 10, and a power of 10.

Taking the number $0.00076$ as an example, the first step is to identify the significant figures, which in this case are $7.6$. Afterward, you count how many positions the decimal point needs to be shifted to the right to transform $0.00076$ to $7.6$. In this instance, the decimal point shifts 4 positions to the right. Given that the original number is less than 1, the exponent will be negative.

Thus, the number $0.00076$ can be denoted as $7.6 \times 10^{-4}$. The negative exponent signifies that the decimal point has been shifted to the right, effectively converting a small number into its standard form. This method simplifies computations and facilitates easier comparison and analysis of extremely large or very small numbers.
