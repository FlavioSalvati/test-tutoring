To solve the inequality $ 3x + 4 < 12 $, we will first isolate the variable $ x $ by performing operations on both sides of the inequality.

We start by subtracting $ 4 $ from both sides:

$$
3x + 4 - 4 < 12 - 4
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
3x < 8
$$

Next, we need to isolate $ x $ by dividing both sides of the inequality by $ 3 $:

$$
\frac{3x}{3} < \frac{8}{3}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x < \frac{8}{3}
$$

Thus, the solution to the inequality is $ x < \frac{8}{3} $. This indicates that any value of $ x $ that is less than $ \frac{8}{3} $ will satisfy the inequality. In decimal form, $ \frac{8}{3} $ is approximately $ 2.67 $, which means $ x $ must be less than $ 2.67 $.

It's important to remember that when solving inequalities, if you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, you must reverse the direction of the inequality sign. However, in this case, we divided by a positive number, so the inequality sign remains unchanged.
