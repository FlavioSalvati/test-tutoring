To convert the scientific notation $3.6 \times 10^{-2}$ into a standard decimal number, we find that it equals $0.036$.

Letâ€™s break down the expression $3.6 \times 10^{-2}$. The term $10^{-2}$ indicates a power of ten with a negative exponent. Specifically, this means we are dealing with a fraction, where $10^{-2}$ can be expressed as $\frac{1}{10^2}$. Thus, $10^{-2} = \frac{1}{100}$, which is equivalent to $0.01$.

By multiplying $3.6$ by $0.01$, we effectively move the decimal point in $3.6$ two places to the left. This operation is equivalent to dividing $3.6$ by $100$. Consequently, $3.6$ becomes $0.036$.

This method of expressing numbers is known as scientific notation, which is particularly advantageous for representing very large or very small values. In this example, scientific notation simplifies the multiplication process and provides clarity regarding the scale of the number.

When you encounter a number formatted as $a \times 10^b$, remember that $a$ represents the significant figure, while $10^b$ indicates how many decimal places to shift. If the exponent $b$ is negative, you move the decimal point to the left; if $b$ is positive, you shift it to the right.
