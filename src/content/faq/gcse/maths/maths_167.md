To determine the value of the expression $3k - 4$ when $k = 5$, we need to substitute the value of $k$ into the expression. This involves replacing every instance of $k$ with $5$. Thus, the expression $3k - 4$ transforms into $3(5) - 4$.

Next, we follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). According to this rule, we perform the multiplication first. Calculating $3 \times 5$ yields $15$. Consequently, our expression simplifies to $15 - 4$.

Now, we proceed with the subtraction. When we subtract $4$ from $15$, we obtain $11$. Therefore, the value of the expression $3k - 4$ when $k = 5$ is $11$.

This process of substituting a specific value into an algebraic expression and simplifying it step-by-step is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths. It enhances our understanding of how variables function and how to manipulate algebraic expressions effectively. Always remember to adhere to the order of operations to ensure accurate results.
