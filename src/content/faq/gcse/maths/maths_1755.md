The power of a product rule states that when multiplying two numbers with the same base, you add their exponents.

In more detail, the power of a product rule is a fundamental principle in algebra that simplifies expressions involving exponents. If you have two numbers, $a$ and $b$, both raised to the power of $n$, the rule can be expressed as:

$$
(a \cdot b)^n = a^n \cdot b^n
$$

This means you can distribute the exponent $n$ to both $a$ and $b$ individually.

For instance, consider the expression $(2 \cdot 3)^4$. Using the power of a product rule, you can simplify it as follows:

$$
(2 \cdot 3)^4 = 2^4 \cdot 3^4
$$

Now, calculating further, we find that $2^4 = 16$ and $3^4 = 81$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

$$
16 \cdot 81 = 1296
$$

This rule is particularly useful when working with algebraic expressions, as it helps to break down complex problems into more manageable components.

Understanding the power of a product rule is essential for solving a variety of mathematical problems, especially in GCSE Maths, where expressions with exponents frequently appear. Mastering this rule enables you to manipulate and simplify expressions with greater ease, making it a valuable tool in your mathematical toolkit.
