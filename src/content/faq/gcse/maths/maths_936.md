To determine the velocity function, you need to differentiate the position function with respect to time.

Specifically, if you have a position function $ s(t) $ that describes the location of an object at time $ t $, the velocity can be obtained by taking the derivative of this function with respect to time. The resulting velocity function, denoted as $ v(t) $, is defined as the first derivative of the position function. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
v(t) = \frac{ds(t)}{dt}.
$$

For instance, consider the position function given by 

$$
s(t) = 5t^2 + 3t + 2.
$$

To find the velocity function, differentiate each term with respect to $ t $. The derivative of $ 5t^2 $ is $ 10t $, the derivative of $ 3t $ is $ 3 $, and since the derivative of the constant $ 2 $ is $ 0 $, we conclude that the velocity function $ v(t) $ is:

$$
v(t) = 10t + 3.
$$

Differentiation is essential for understanding how position varies over time, which is the essence of velocity. This principle holds true even for more complex position functions that involve trigonometric or exponential terms. For example, if the position function is 

$$
s(t) = \sin(t),
$$ 

the corresponding velocity function $ v(t) $ would be:

$$
v(t) = \cos(t),
$$ 

since the derivative of $ \sin(t) $ is $ \cos(t) $.

Mastering the process of differentiating a position function to derive the velocity is a crucial skill in both physics and mathematics. This knowledge enables you to analyze motion and make predictions about future positions and velocities.
