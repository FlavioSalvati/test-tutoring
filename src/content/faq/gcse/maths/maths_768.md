The unit rate is defined as 60 kilometers per hour.

To calculate the unit rate, you need to determine how many kilometers are traveled in one hour. This is accomplished by dividing the total distance by the total time. In this scenario, you have traveled a distance of 300 kilometers over a duration of 5 hours. Thus, you perform the calculation:

$$
\text{Unit Rate} = \frac{300 \text{ km}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ km/h}
$$

This means the unit rate is 60 kilometers per hour.

Understanding unit rates is essential because it enables you to compare different situations effortlessly. For instance, knowing that a car travels at a unit rate of 60 kilometers per hour allows you to quickly estimate how far it will go in any given period. If you want to find out how long it will take to cover a specific distance, you can also use the unit rate to make that calculation.

In practical terms, being aware of the unit rate aids in planning journeys, estimating travel times, and budgeting for fuel expenses. It is a fundamental concept in mathematics that applies to various real-world contexts, from driving to comprehending speeds in different scenarios. Therefore, mastering the calculation and application of unit rates will be highly beneficial in both your academic pursuits and everyday life.
