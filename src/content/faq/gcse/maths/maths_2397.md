The slope of the line is $7$, and the y-intercept is $4$.

To determine the slope and y-intercept of the equation $ y = 7x + 4 $, we recognize that it is in slope-intercept form, given by the equation $ y = mx + c $. In this expression, $ m $ denotes the slope (or gradient) of the line, while $ c $ represents the y-intercept, which indicates the point where the line intersects the y-axis.

In the equation $ y = 7x + 4 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $7$. This signifies that the slope of the line is $7$. The slope indicates how steep the line is; specifically, for every unit increase of $1$ in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by $7$ units.

The constant term in the equation is $4$. This value represents the y-intercept, which is the value of $ y $ when $ x $ is $0$. Consequently, when plotted on a graph, the line will intersect the y-axis at the point $(0, 4)$.

Understanding the slope and y-intercept is crucial for sketching the graph of the equation and analyzing how changes in $ x $ influence $ y $. For instance, if you increase $ x $ by $2$ units, $ y $ would increase by $ 2 \times 7 = 14 $ units due to the slope. Additionally, knowing the y-intercept enables you to accurately begin your graph at the correct point on the y-axis.
