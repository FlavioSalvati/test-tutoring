To determine the measure of corresponding angles created by a transversal, it is essential to identify the angles that occupy matching positions.

When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, it generates several pairs of corresponding angles. These angles are situated on the same side of the transversal and occupy corresponding positions with respect to the parallel lines. For instance, if we label the angles formed by the transversal and the parallel lines as $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ on the upper line and $5$, $6$, $7$, and $8$ on the lower line, we can observe the following correspondences: angle $1$ corresponds to angle $5$, angle $2$ corresponds to angle $6$, angle $3$ corresponds to angle $7$, and angle $4$ corresponds to angle $8$.

To find the measure of corresponding angles, we can utilize the property that corresponding angles are equal when the lines are parallel. Therefore, if the measure of one angle is known, the measure of its corresponding angle can be directly inferred. For example, if angle $1$ measures $50^\circ$, then angle $5$ will also measure $50^\circ$.

In cases where the lines are not parallel, corresponding angles are not necessarily equal, and additional information would be required to determine their measures. However, in GCSE Maths, problems typically involve parallel lines when addressing transversals, allowing you to confidently apply the principle of equality for corresponding angles to solve various problems. 

An effective strategy for identifying corresponding angles is to look for the "F" shape that is formed by the transversal and the parallel lines, which can make it easier to spot these angles.
