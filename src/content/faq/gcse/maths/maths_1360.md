To solve the equation $2\sin(x) = 1$, we start by dividing both sides by $2$ to isolate $\sin(x)$:

$$
\sin(x) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Next, we need to determine the angles $x$ where $\sin(x)$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. From our knowledge of the unit circle and trigonometric values, we know that:

$$
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

This can also be expressed in degrees as:

$$
\sin\left(30^\circ\right) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Since the sine function is periodic and positive in both the first and second quadrants, we should also consider the angle in the second quadrant that yields the same sine value:

$$
\sin\left(150^\circ\right) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

In radian measure, this corresponds to:

$$
\sin\left(\pi - \frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Therefore, the general solutions for $x$ in radians can be expressed as:

$$
x = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi
$$

$$
x = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2k\pi
$$

where $k$ is any integer, representing the periodic nature of the sine function.

In degrees, the solutions can be written as:

$$
x = 30^\circ + 360^\circ k
$$

$$
x = 150^\circ + 360^\circ k
$$

Again, $k$ represents any integer.

These solutions comprehensively account for all possible angles $x$ where the sine of $x$ equals $\frac{1}{2}$.
