The sequence $5, 10, 15, 20$ exhibits a clear pattern where each term increases by $5$. 

This sequence is classified as an arithmetic sequence, characterized by a constant difference between consecutive terms. In this instance, the common difference is $5$. To determine the next term in the sequence, you simply add $5$ to the previous term. For example, starting with $5$, you add $5$ to obtain $10$, then add another $5$ to arrive at $15$, and so forth.

Arithmetic sequences are a foundational concept in GCSE Maths, providing insight into how numbers can progress in a systematic way. The general formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is expressed as:

$$
a_n = a + (n - 1)d
$$

where $a$ represents the first term, $d$ denotes the common difference, and $n$ indicates the term number. For this specific sequence, we have $a = 5$ and $d = 5$. Thus, the $n$th term can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a_n = 5 + (n - 1) \times 5
$$

Comprehending this pattern is beneficial not only for solving mathematical problems related to sequences but also in practical situations involving regular intervals or increments. Examples include saving money, organizing schedules, or conducting specific scientific measurements. By recognizing and working with arithmetic sequences, you can enhance your understanding of how numbers and patterns interrelate in mathematics.
