To estimate the difference between $89$ and $47$, we can round each number to the nearest ten and then subtract the smaller rounded value from the larger one.

Rounding numbers to the nearest ten simplifies the calculation significantly. For the number $89$, rounding to the nearest ten results in $90$. For $47$, rounding to the nearest ten gives us $50$. Now, we can perform the subtraction: 

$$
90 - 50 = 40.
$$

Thus, the estimated difference between $89$ and $47$ is approximately $40$.

This method is effective because rounding makes the numbers easier to work with, particularly in mental arithmetic. By rounding $89$ up to $90$ and $47$ up to $50$, we transform the problem into a simpler one while still obtaining a reasonable approximation of the actual difference. This technique is especially useful in exams or scenarios where a quick, rough estimate is required.

It's important to note that the actual difference between $89$ and $47$ is $42$, but our estimate of $40$ is sufficiently close for many practical applications. Estimation serves as a quick way to verify the reasonableness of answers and can be a valuable tool in problem-solving.
