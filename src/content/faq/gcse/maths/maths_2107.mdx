To calculate $4^{-2}$, we begin by finding the reciprocal of $4^2$. This value can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{1}{16}.
$$

When dealing with a negative exponent, it indicates that we should take the reciprocal of the base raised to the corresponding positive exponent. Specifically, for $4^{-2}$, we need to determine the reciprocal of $4^2$.

First, we calculate $4^2$. This involves multiplying $4$ by itself:

$$
4 \times 4 = 16.
$$

Next, we determine the reciprocal of $16$. The reciprocal of a number is defined as $1$ divided by that number:

$$
\frac{1}{16}.
$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$
4^{-2} = \frac{1}{16}.
$$

This approach is applicable to any negative exponent. For instance, if we consider $5^{-3}$, we would first compute $5^3$, which equals $125$, and then take its reciprocal:

$$
\frac{1}{125}.
$$

Understanding this principle is essential for manipulating indices and exponents in mathematics.
