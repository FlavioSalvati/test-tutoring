To determine the expected frequency of rolling a 6 on a die over the course of 120 rolls, we can use a simple calculation: multiply the total number of rolls, which is 120, by the probability of rolling a 6, which is $\frac{1}{6}$.

When rolling a fair six-sided die, each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) has an equal chance of landing face up. The probability of rolling a 6 is $\frac{1}{6}$, as there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 6) among six possible outcomes.

To compute the expected frequency, we use the formula:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \text{Number of Trials} \times \text{Probability of Desired Outcome}
$$

Substituting the appropriate values into the equation gives us:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = 120 \times \frac{1}{6}
$$

This can also be expressed as:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = 120 \div 6
$$

Calculating this yields:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = 20
$$

Therefore, you can expect to roll a 6 approximately 20 times in 120 rolls of a fair die. It is important to note that this value represents an average; in practice, the actual number of times a 6 is rolled may vary slightly due to the inherent randomness of each roll. Nevertheless, over a large number of trials, the actual frequency should align closely with this expected value.
