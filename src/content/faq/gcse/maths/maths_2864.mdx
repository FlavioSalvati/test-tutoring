The magnitude of the vector $(5, 12)$ is $13$.

To determine the magnitude of a vector, we apply the Pythagorean theorem. A vector in two dimensions is represented as $(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ denote its components along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The magnitude of the vector corresponds to the length of the line segment extending from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the point $(x, y)$.

For the vector $(5, 12)$, we can visualize it as forming a right-angled triangle with the x-axis and y-axis. Here, the x-component is $5$, and the y-component is $12$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the magnitude (or length) of the vector serves as the hypotenuse of this right triangle.

The formula to calculate the magnitude is given by:

$$ \text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $$

Now, substituting the values for $x$ and $y$:

$$ \text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} $$

Calculating further, we find:

$$ \text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{25 + 144} $$

$$ \text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{169} $$

$$ \text{Magnitude} = 13 $$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(5, 12)$ is $13$. This indicates that if you were to plot this vector on a graph, the distance from the origin to the point $(5, 12)$ would be $13$ units. Understanding vector magnitude is essential in various fields such as physics and engineering, where it is vital for analyzing forces, velocities, and other vector quantities.
