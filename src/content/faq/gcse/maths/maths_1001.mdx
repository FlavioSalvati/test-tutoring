The equation of the line is given by 

$$ 
y = -x + 5. 
$$ 

To derive the equation of a line, we utilize the slope-intercept form, which is expressed as 

$$ 
y = mx + c, 
$$ 

where $ m $ represents the slope and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. In this instance, the slope is specified as $ m = -1 $ and we have a point on the line, $(2, 3)$. We can substitute these values into the equation to determine $ c $.

Let's start by substituting the slope and the coordinates of the point into the slope-intercept form:

$$ 
3 = -1 \cdot 2 + c. 
$$ 

Next, we simplify this equation:

$$ 
3 = -2 + c. 
$$ 

To solve for $ c $, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

$$ 
3 + 2 = c, 
$$ 

which simplifies to 

$$ 
c = 5. 
$$ 

Now that we have established the slope $ m = -1 $ and the y-intercept $ c = 5 $, we can formulate the complete equation of the line:

$$ 
y = -x + 5. 
$$ 

This equation indicates that for any given value of $ x $, the corresponding $ y $ value can be calculated by multiplying $ x $ by $-1$ and then adding $ 5 $. For instance, if $ x = 0 $, then 

$$ 
y = -0 + 5 = 5. 
$$ 

Similarly, if $ x = 1 $, then 

$$ 
y = -1 + 5 = 4. 
$$ 

This linear relationship holds true for all values of $ x $ and describes a straight line with a negative slope, signifying that the line descends as one moves from left to right.
