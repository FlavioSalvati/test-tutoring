To create a cumulative frequency graph, the first step is to develop a cumulative frequency table based on your data.

Begin by gathering your dataset, which is typically presented in the form of a frequency table. This table should outline the various categories or intervals of your data, along with their associated frequencies. The next step involves adding a new column to this table specifically for cumulative frequency.

Cumulative frequency refers to the running total of frequencies as you progress through the intervals. To compute cumulative frequency, you start with the first frequency and continuously add each subsequent frequency to the total of all previous frequencies. For instance, if your frequencies are $3$, $5$, $2$, and $4$, the cumulative frequencies would be calculated as follows: the first cumulative frequency is $3$, the second is $3 + 5 = 8$, the third is $8 + 2 = 10$, and the fourth is $10 + 4 = 14$. Thus, the cumulative frequencies are $3$, $8$, $10$, and $14$.

After constructing your cumulative frequency table, you can then plot these cumulative frequencies on a graph. In this graph, the x-axis will represent the upper boundary of each interval, while the y-axis will denote the cumulative frequency. You should plot each point corresponding to the cumulative frequencies and connect them with either a smooth curve or straight lines to create the cumulative frequency graph.

This graph is a valuable tool for visualizing how frequencies accumulate across the intervals. It can be particularly useful for analyzing the distribution of your data, allowing you to determine key statistical measures such as the median, quartiles, and percentiles.
