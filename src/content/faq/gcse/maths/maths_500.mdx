To find the magnitude of the vector $(14, -48)$, we will employ the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the magnitude can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{14^2 + (-48)^2}
$$

Let's delve deeper into the concept of vector magnitude. The magnitude of a vector represents its length in a two-dimensional space. For a vector expressed in terms of its components $(x, y)$, the magnitude is determined using the Pythagorean theorem. This is because the vector forms a right-angled triangle with the x-axis and y-axis, where the magnitude serves as the hypotenuse.

For the vector $(14, -48)$, we identify the x-component as $14$ and the y-component as $-48$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the magnitude (or length) of the vector can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

By substituting the values of the components, we have:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{14^2 + (-48)^2}
$$

Now, we will compute the squares of the components:

$$
14^2 = 196 
$$

$$
(-48)^2 = 2304 
$$

Next, we will sum these squared values:

$$
196 + 2304 = 2500 
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the magnitude:

$$
\sqrt{2500} = 50 
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(14, -48)$ is $50$. This method is applicable to any vector, making it a valuable tool in various fields of mathematics and physics.
