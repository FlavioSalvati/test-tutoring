Set operations are fundamental techniques in set theory that involve combining, comparing, and manipulating sets through various operations, specifically union, intersection, difference, and complement.

In set theory, a **set** is defined as a collection of distinct objects treated as a single entity. The primary operations performed on sets include:

1. **Union ($\cup$)**: The union of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A \cup B$, is the set containing all elements that are either in $A$, in $B$, or in both. For instance, if $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then the union is given by:

   $$ A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} $$

2. **Intersection ($\cap$)**: The intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$, written as $A \cap B$, is the set containing all elements that are present in both $A$ and $B$. Using the same sets as above, the intersection is:

   $$ A \cap B = \{3\} $$

3. **Difference ($-$)**: The difference between two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A - B$, is the set containing all elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$. For example, in our previous sets, we find:

   $$ A - B = \{1, 2\} $$
   $$ B - A = \{4, 5\} $$

4. **Complement ($A'$)**: The complement of a set $A$, denoted as $A'$, includes all elements not in $A$, relative to a specified universal set $U$. For instance, if $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then the complement is:

   $$ A' = \{4, 5\} $$

Grasping these operations is crucial for solving various problems related to sets, such as identifying common elements, determining unique elements, and finding elements that lie outside a specified set.
