Fuel efficiency is determined by dividing the distance traveled by the amount of fuel consumed.

To accurately calculate fuel efficiency, you need two essential pieces of information: the distance your vehicle has traveled and the amount of fuel it has used. The distance is typically measured in miles or kilometers, while the fuel is generally measured in liters or gallons.

For instance, if you drove $300$ miles and consumed $10$ gallons of fuel, you would calculate the fuel efficiency by dividing the distance by the fuel used. The calculation would be as follows:

$$
\text{Fuel Efficiency (mpg)} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ gallons}} = 30 \text{ miles per gallon (mpg)}
$$

This result indicates that your vehicle can travel $30$ miles for every gallon of fuel it consumes.

In metric units, if you drove $500$ kilometers and used $50$ liters of fuel, the calculation for fuel efficiency would be:

$$
\text{Fuel Efficiency (km/l)} = \frac{500 \text{ kilometers}}{50 \text{ liters}} = 10 \text{ kilometers per liter (km/l)}
$$

This means your vehicle can travel $10$ kilometers for every liter of fuel consumed.

Fuel efficiency can also be expressed in terms of fuel consumption, which is the inverse of fuel efficiency. For example, in the UK, fuel consumption is often measured in liters per $100$ kilometers (L/100 km). To convert from km/l to L/100 km, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Fuel Consumption (L/100 km)} = \frac{100}{\text{km/l}}
$$

So, if your vehicle has a fuel efficiency of $10$ km/l, the fuel consumption would be calculated as:

$$
\text{Fuel Consumption (L/100 km)} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \text{ L/100 km}
$$

Understanding how to calculate fuel efficiency enables you to better manage your fuel costs and minimize your environmental impact.
