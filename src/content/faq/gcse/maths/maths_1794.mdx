To order negative numbers, arrange them from the smallest (most negative) to the largest (least negative). 

When working with negative numbers, it is essential to remember that the further a number is from zero on the number line, the smaller it is. For instance, $-10$ is smaller than $-2$ because $-10$ is positioned further to the left on the number line. To visualize this concept, picture a number line with zero at its center. All numbers to the left of zero are negative, and as you move further left, the values decrease.

Consider the negative numbers $-3$, $-7$, $-1$, and $-5$. To order them from smallest to largest, begin with the number that is furthest from zero, which is $-7$. The order would then follow with $-5$, $-3$, and finally $-1$, since $-1$ is closest to zero and thus the largest among these negative values.

A helpful analogy is to think of negative numbers as representing debt. For example, if you owe £7, you are in a worse financial situation than if you owe £1. Therefore, $-7$ is less than $-1$. This comparison can aid in understanding why $-7$ is considered smaller than $-1$.

In summary, when ordering negative numbers, always remember that the number with the greater absolute value (the value without the negative sign) is actually the smaller number. This understanding will assist you in correctly arranging negative numbers from smallest to largest.
