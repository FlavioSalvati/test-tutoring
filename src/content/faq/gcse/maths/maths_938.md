To identify critical points of a function, you need to differentiate the function and set the derivative equal to zero, subsequently solving for $ x $.

Critical points of a function occur where its derivative is either zero or undefined. These points are significant because they can indicate local maxima, minima, or points of inflection. To locate these critical points, you first differentiate the function. Differentiation is the process of calculating the derivative, which expresses the rate of change of the function.

After computing the derivative, you should set it to zero. This step is essential because critical points correspond to locations where the slope of the tangent line to the curve is zero, signifying that the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at that particular point. By solving the equation where the derivative equals zero, you can find the $ x $-values of the critical points.

For instance, consider the function 

$$ 
f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4. 
$$ 

First, you calculate the derivative:

$$ 
f'(x) = 2x - 4. 
$$ 

Next, you set the derivative equal to zero:

$$ 
2x - 4 = 0. 
$$ 

Solving this equation yields 

$$ 
x = 2, 
$$ 

indicating that $ x = 2 $ is a critical point.

Additionally, it is important to check for points where the derivative is undefined, as these can also qualify as critical points. However, for most polynomial functions, the derivative is defined everywhere.

To ascertain whether the identified critical points correspond to maxima, minima, or points of inflection, you can employ the second derivative test or analyze the behavior of the first derivative around these points.
