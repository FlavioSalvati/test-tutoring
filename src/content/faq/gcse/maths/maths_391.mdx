The area of a parallelogram with a base measuring $6 \, \text{cm}$ and a height of $5 \, \text{cm}$ is $30 \, \text{cm}^2$.

To calculate the area of a parallelogram, we employ the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}.
$$

In this specific case, the base is given as $6 \, \text{cm}$ and the height as $5 \, \text{cm}$. Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$
\text{Area} = 6 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 30 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

In the context of a parallelogram, the base refers to one of its sides, while the height is defined as the perpendicular distance from this base to the opposite side. It is crucial to understand that the height does not represent the length of the slanted side; rather, it is the vertical distance between the two bases of the parallelogram.

This area formula is valid because a parallelogram can be visualized as a slanted rectangle. If you were to remove a triangle from one side of the parallelogram and reposition it on the other side, you would effectively create a rectangle with the same base and height. Consequently, the area of the parallelogram is equivalent to the area of this rectangle.

Grasping this concept is vital for solving problems related to parallelograms, as it allows for straightforward multiplication to determine the area, rather than resorting to more complex calculations. This principle is not only fundamental in geometry but also plays a significant role in various problems encountered in GCSE Mathematics.
