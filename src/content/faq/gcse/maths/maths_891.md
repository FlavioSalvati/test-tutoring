To solve the inequality $2x + 1 > 5$, we will follow a systematic approach: first, we will subtract $1$ from both sides, and then we will divide by $2$.

Letâ€™s break down the solution step by step, starting with the inequality:

$$
2x + 1 > 5
$$

Our objective is to isolate the variable $x$ on one side of the inequality.

**Step 1:** Subtract $1$ from both sides to eliminate the constant on the left side:

$$
2x + 1 - 1 > 5 - 1
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
2x > 4
$$

**Step 2:** Next, we need to isolate $x$ by dividing both sides of the inequality by $2$:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} > \frac{4}{2}
$$

This further simplifies to:

$$
x > 2
$$

Thus, the solution to the inequality $2x + 1 > 5$ is $x > 2$. This means that any value of $x$ that is greater than $2$ will satisfy the inequality. For instance, if we take $x = 3$, we have:

$$
2(3) + 1 = 7,
$$

which is indeed greater than $5$. Similarly, for $x = 4$:

$$
2(4) + 1 = 9,
$$

which is also greater than $5$.

It is essential to remember that when solving inequalities, the direction of the inequality sign remains unchanged unless we multiply or divide by a negative number, which would reverse the inequality sign. In this case, since we only divided by a positive number, the inequality sign remains the same.
