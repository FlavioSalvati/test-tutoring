The perimeter of the compound shape is $28 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the perimeter of a compound shape, you must sum the lengths of all its sides. In this particular instance, the shape features sides measuring $4 \, \text{cm}$, $6 \, \text{cm}$, $8 \, \text{cm}$, and $10 \, \text{cm}$. The perimeter represents the total distance around the shape, which requires adding these lengths together.

Letâ€™s perform the calculation step-by-step:

$$ 4 \, \text{cm} + 6 \, \text{cm} + 8 \, \text{cm} + 10 \, \text{cm} = 28 \, \text{cm} $$

Consequently, the perimeter of the compound shape is $28 \, \text{cm}$. This method can be applied to any compound shape, provided you know the lengths of all its sides. Simply add them together to obtain the total perimeter. Understanding this principle is fundamental in geometry and is vital for tackling more complex problems related to shapes and their properties.
