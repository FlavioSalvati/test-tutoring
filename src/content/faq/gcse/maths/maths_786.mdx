To convert fractions to decimals using a calculator, you simply divide the numerator by the denominator.

A fraction is composed of a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number). To transform this fraction into a decimal, you perform a division operation. For example, with the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, you would divide $3$ by $4$.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this using a calculator:

1. **Turn on your calculator**: Ensure that your calculator is set to standard mode, avoiding any specialized settings such as fraction or scientific modes.
2. **Enter the numerator**: Input the top number of the fraction. For our example, with the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, you would enter `3`.
3. **Press the division key**: This key is typically represented by the symbol '÷' or a forward slash '/'.
4. **Enter the denominator**: Input the bottom number of the fraction. Continuing with our example, you would enter `4`.
5. **Press the equals key**: This key is usually denoted by the '=' symbol. The calculator will then display the decimal equivalent of the fraction.

For the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, the calculator will show $0.75$. This indicates that $\frac{3}{4}$ is equivalent to $0.75$ in decimal form. This method is applicable to any fraction, whether simple like $\frac{1}{2}$ or more complex like $\frac{7}{8}$.

Using a calculator to convert fractions to decimals is a quick and efficient approach, particularly when working with more complicated fractions or when accuracy is critical.
