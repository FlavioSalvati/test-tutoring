Hereâ€™s an enhanced version of your content for clarity and readability:

When we divide the vector $(10, -5)$ by the scalar $5$, the result is the vector $(2, -1)$.

Dividing a vector by a scalar involves dividing each component of the vector by that scalar. In this example, the vector is $(10, -5)$ and the scalar is $5$. To compute the new vector, we perform the division on each component of the original vector.

First, we examine the x-component of the vector, which is $10$. Dividing $10$ by $5$ gives us $2$. Next, we look at the y-component of the vector, which is $-5$. Dividing $-5$ by $5$ results in $-1$. Therefore, the new vector after division is $(2, -1)$.

This process is analogous to dividing numbers, but we apply the operation to each component of the vector individually. This method provides a straightforward way to scale down a vector, reducing its magnitude while maintaining its direction. Such operations are valuable in various fields of mathematics and physics, particularly when normalizing a vector or adjusting its magnitude.
