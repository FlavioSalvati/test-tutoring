To arrange a set of numbers in ascending order, begin by comparing each number and sequentially organizing them from the least to the greatest.

Start the process by identifying the smallest number in the set. Write this number down first. Then, search for the next smallest number in the remaining set and write it down. Continue this method until all numbers are listed in ascending order.

For example, consider the numbers $4$, $1$, $7$, and $3$. You would begin by identifying $1$ as the smallest. Next, compare the remaining numbers ($4$, $7$, and $3$) to find that $3$ is the next smallest. After that, compare $4$ and $7$, noting that $4$ comes next, followed by $7$. Thus, the ordered list is $1$, $3$, $4$, $7$.

When dealing with negative numbers, remember that they are always less than positive numbers. For instance, $-5$ is less than $-1$, and both of these are less than any positive number. When you have a mixture of negative and positive numbers, start with the most negative number and proceed to the most positive.

For decimal numbers, first compare the whole number parts. If these are identical, then compare the decimal parts. For instance, $2.3$ is less than $2.5$ because $3$ is less than $5$.

By adhering to these steps, you can systematically arrange any collection of numbers from smallest to largest.
