To determine the x-coordinate corresponding to a given y-coordinate, you can substitute the y-value into the equation and solve for x.

When you have a point on a graph and know its y-coordinate, you can find the corresponding x-coordinate using the equation of the line or curve on which the point lies. For instance, consider the equation of the line given by 

$$ 
y = 2x + 3. 
$$ 

If you know that the y-coordinate is $7$, you would substitute $7$ for $y$ in the equation, resulting in 

$$ 
7 = 2x + 3. 
$$ 

Next, solve this equation for $x$. Start by isolating the $x$ term on one side of the equation. Subtract $3$ from both sides to obtain 

$$ 
4 = 2x. 
$$ 

Then, divide both sides by $2$ to solve for $x$, yielding 

$$ 
x = 2. 
$$ 

Thus, the x-coordinate that corresponds to the y-coordinate of $7$ is $2$.

This method is applicable to various types of equations, including linear, quadratic, and others. For example, with a quadratic equation such as 

$$ 
y = x^2 + 2x + 1, 
$$ 

if you know the y-coordinate, you can substitute it into the equation and solve for $x$. This may involve techniques like factoring or using the quadratic formula. For instance, if you have 

$$ 
y = 5, 
$$ 

you would set up the equation 

$$ 
5 = x^2 + 2x + 1 
$$ 

and then solve for $x$.

It's important to note that some equations may yield more than one x-coordinate for a given y-coordinate, particularly in the case of parabolas or circles. Therefore, always check for all possible solutions.
