To create a scatter plot with two variables, you will represent each pair of values as a point on a graph.

First, identify the two variables you wish to compare. For instance, let's consider the height and weight of a group of students. You will assign one variable to the x-axis (horizontal) and the other to the y-axis (vertical). While the choice of which variable to place on which axis is flexible, it is common practice to position the independent variable (the one you suspect may influence the other) on the x-axis.

Next, draw the axes on graph paper or utilize graphing software. Clearly label each axis with the name of the variable it represents, and include the appropriate units of measurement. For example, if you are plotting height, you might label the x-axis as "Height (cm)" and the y-axis as "Weight (kg)".

Now, for each pair of values, locate the corresponding position on the graph. For example, if one student has a height of $150 \, \text{cm}$ and a weight of $50 \, \text{kg}$, find $150$ on the x-axis and $50$ on the y-axis. Place a dot at the intersection of these two values on the graph. Repeat this process for all pairs of values in your dataset.

After plotting all the points, you can begin to observe any patterns or relationships between the two variables. If the points tend to rise together, this indicates a positive correlation. Conversely, if one variable increases while the other decreases, it suggests a negative correlation. If the points appear to be scattered randomly, it may indicate no correlation exists.

Remember, a scatter plot is an effective tool for visually analyzing the relationship between two variables and can provide valuable insights into how they may be interconnected.
