The length of the diagonal in a three-dimensional shape can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem extended to three dimensions.

To find the diagonal length of a 3D object, such as a cuboid, we start by considering a cuboid with side lengths denoted as $a$, $b$, and $c$. The diagonal we are interested in extends from one corner of the cuboid to the diagonally opposite corner, traversing through the interior of the shape.

First, we can analyze the diagonal on the base of the cuboid. For a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$, the diagonal $d_1$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in two dimensions:

$$
d_1 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

Next, this diagonal $d_1$ serves as the base of a right-angled triangle, where the third dimension $c$ acts as the height. To find the overall 3D diagonal $d$, we apply the Pythagorean theorem once more, this time considering all three dimensions:

$$
d = \sqrt{d_1^2 + c^2}
$$

By substituting the expression for $d_1$ into the equation, we derive:

$$
d = \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2) + c^2}
$$

This simplifies further to:

$$
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
$$

Thus, the length of the diagonal in a three-dimensional shape, such as a cuboid, is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of its side lengths. This method can be universally applied to any rectangular prism or cuboid to calculate the length of its internal diagonal.
