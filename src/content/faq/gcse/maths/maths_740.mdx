To estimate the difference between $234$ and $89$, we can round each number and then subtract the smaller number from the larger one.

Rounding numbers to the nearest ten or hundred can significantly simplify calculations. For the number $234$, rounding to the nearest ten results in $230$, while rounding to the nearest hundred gives us $200$. For $89$, rounding to the nearest ten yields $90$, and rounding to the nearest hundred results in $100$.

To achieve a more precise estimate, letâ€™s round to the nearest ten. Thus, we have $234$ rounding to $230$ and $89$ rounding to $90$. We can now perform the subtraction:
$$
230 - 90 = 140.
$$

Alternatively, if we choose to round to the nearest hundred, $234$ becomes $200$ and $89$ rounds to $100$. Subtracting these gives us:
$$
200 - 100 = 100.
$$

The first method, which rounds to the nearest ten, provides a more accurate estimate of the difference. Therefore, the estimated difference between $234$ and $89$ is approximately $140$. This technique not only simplifies mental arithmetic but also offers a quick and reasonable approximation of the actual difference.
