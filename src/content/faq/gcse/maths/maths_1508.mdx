The complementary probability of not rolling a 6 on a standard six-sided die is given by $\frac{5}{6}$.

When rolling a standard die, each of its six faces has an equal probability of landing face up. Therefore, there are six possible outcomes: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$. The probability of rolling any specific number, such as a $6$, is $\frac{1}{6}$.

Understanding the concept of complementary probability allows us to assess the likelihood of the opposite event occurring. In this scenario, the complementary event to rolling a $6$ is not rolling a $6$. Since there are six faces on the die and only one of them shows a $6$, the remaining five faces ($1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$) represent the outcomes in which a $6$ is not rolled.

To calculate the complementary probability, we can subtract the probability of the event from $1$. Given that the probability of rolling a $6$ is $\frac{1}{6}$, we find the complementary probability of not rolling a $6$ as follows:

$$
1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
$$

Thus, there is a $\frac{5}{6}$ probability of not rolling a $6$ on a single roll of the die. Understanding complementary probabilities is valuable because it enables you to quickly determine the likelihood of an event not occurring, which can be just as essential as knowing the probability of the event itself.
