To estimate the gradient of the function $ y = e^x $ at the point $ x = 1 $, we need to evaluate the derivative $ \frac{dy}{dx} $ at that specific value of $ x $.

To elaborate, the gradient of a function at a particular point is determined by the value of its derivative at that point. For the function $ y = e^x $, the derivative is given by 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = e^x.
$$

This expression indicates that the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ is equal to $ e^x $ for any value of $ x $.

To find the gradient at $ x = 1 $, we substitute $ x = 1 $ into the derivative. Thus, we have 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} \text{ at } x = 1 \text{ is } e^1.
$$ 

The value of Euler's number $ e $ is approximately $ 2.718 $. Therefore, we can conclude that 

$$
e^1 \approx 2.718.
$$

Consequently, the gradient of the curve $ y = e^x $ at the point where $ x = 1 $ is approximately $ 2.718 $. This indicates that at $ x = 1 $, the function $ y = e^x $ increases at a rate of about $ 2.718 $ units of $ y $ for every one unit increase in $ x $.
