To express a number increased by $x$, you can represent this mathematically as the sum of the number and $x$, written as: 

$$ \text{number} + x $$

When we refer to increasing a number by $x$, we are essentially performing an addition of $x$ to that number. For instance, if we start with the number $5$ and wish to increase it by $3$, we write:

$$ 5 + 3 $$

This operation indicates that we are adding $3$ to $5$, resulting in a total of $8$.

In the context of algebra, this concept is commonly applied to variables. For example, if we denote a variable as $n$ and intend to increase it by $x$, we express this as:

$$ n + x $$

This expression signifies that regardless of the value of $n$, we are adding $x$ to it. To illustrate further, if $n$ is $7$ and $x$ is $2$, then:

$$ n + x = 7 + 2 $$

This yields a result of $9$.

This fundamental idea plays a crucial role in algebra, aiding in the formation of equations and the resolution of various problems. For example, if we know that a number increased by $4$ equals $10$, we can formulate this as:

$$ n + 4 = 10 $$

To determine the original number, we solve for $n$ by subtracting $4$ from both sides of the equation, resulting in:

$$ n = 6 $$

Grasping how to express a number increased by $x$ is essential for tackling a wide range of mathematical problems, especially those involving equations and algebraic expressions. This understanding empowers you to manipulate and work with both numbers and variables effectively.
