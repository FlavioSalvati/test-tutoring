The slope of a line parallel to the equation $y = -x + 6$ is $-1$.

In mathematics, the slope of a line quantifies its steepness and direction. For a line expressed in the standard form $y = mx + c$, the coefficient $m$ denotes the slope. In the equation $y = -x + 6$, the slope $m$ is clearly $-1$.

When two lines are parallel, they possess identical slopes. Thus, any line that is parallel to $y = -x + 6$ will also exhibit a slope of $-1$. While the y-intercept (represented by $c$) may vary, the slope must remain constant for the lines to be considered parallel.

Grasping the concept of slope is essential for GCSE Maths, as it aids in analyzing the relationships between variables in linear equations. The slope indicates how much the variable $y$ changes in response to a one-unit change in the variable $x$. A negative slope, such as $-1$, signifies that as $x$ increases, $y$ decreases at a consistent rate.

Therefore, if you encounter any line described by the equation $y = -x + b$, where $b$ is any real number, you can confidently assert that it is parallel to $y = -x + 6$, as they both share the same slope of $-1$.
