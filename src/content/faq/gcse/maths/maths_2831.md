The image of a point after translating it by the vector $(4, -2)$ can be computed by adding $4$ to the x-coordinate and subtracting $2$ from the y-coordinate.

To elaborate, translation in geometry refers to the process of moving every point of a shape or object a specific distance in a designated direction. When we translate a point using a vector, we effectively shift its position on the coordinate plane. The vector $(4, -2)$ indicates the movement: $4$ units to the right (in the positive x-direction) and $2$ units downward (in the negative y-direction).

For instance, if we take a point with coordinates $(x, y)$, translating it by the vector $(4, -2)$ means we add $4$ to the x-coordinate and subtract $2$ from the y-coordinate. This can be expressed mathematically as:
$$ (x, y) \rightarrow (x + 4, y - 2) $$

Let's consider a specific example. Suppose the original point is $(3, 5)$. To find the new coordinates after translation, we perform the following calculations:
$$ x' = 3 + 4 = 7 $$
$$ y' = 5 - 2 = 3 $$

Thus, the new coordinates of the point after translation would be $(7, 3)$.

This method can be applied to any point on the coordinate plane. Just remember to adjust the x-coordinate by the first component of the vector and the y-coordinate by the second component. This straightforward process enables you to easily determine the new position of any point following translation.
