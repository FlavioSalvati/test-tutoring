The unit rate is defined as $40$ miles per hour.

To calculate the unit rate, we need to determine how many miles are traveled in one hour. This is accomplished by dividing the total number of miles by the total number of hours. In this scenario, we have a distance of $120$ miles covered over a duration of $3$ hours. Therefore, we perform the division as follows:

$$
\frac{120 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 40 \text{ miles per hour}.
$$

This indicates that for every hour of travel, a distance of $40$ miles is covered.

Understanding unit rates is crucial because they enable us to compare different quantities on a standardized basis. In this example, knowing the speed in miles per hour provides insight into the rate of travel. For instance, if you travel for $1$ hour at this rate, you will cover $40$ miles. If you were to travel for $2$ hours, you would cover $80$ miles, and this pattern continues.

Unit rates are frequently encountered in everyday life, particularly when calculating speed, fuel efficiency, or even pricing in supermarkets. For example, if you know the cost per kilogram of apples, you can easily determine the price for a different weight of apples. Similarly, understanding speed in miles per hour allows you to estimate travel times for various distances.

In summary, the unit rate of $40$ miles per hour provides a consistent measure of speed, facilitating better planning and comprehension of travel times.
