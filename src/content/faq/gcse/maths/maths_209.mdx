The next term in the sequence $1, 3, 6, 10$ is $15$.

This sequence is known as the triangular numbers sequence. Each term in this sequence can be visualized as a triangle formed by dots. For example, the first term is $1$, which consists of a single dot. The second term is $3$, which can be arranged to form a triangle with two dots in the bottom row and one dot on top. The third term is $6$, represented by a triangle with three dots at the bottom, two in the middle, and one on top, and so forth.

To determine the next term in the sequence, you simply add the next natural number to the last term. Starting with the first term, which is $1$, we find the second term by adding $2$: 

$$
1 + 2 = 3.
$$ 

For the third term, we add $3$ to the previous term ($3$):

$$
3 + 3 = 6.
$$ 

For the fourth term, we add $4$ to the previous term ($6$):

$$
6 + 4 = 10.
$$ 

Therefore, to find the fifth term, we add $5$ to the previous term ($10$):

$$
10 + 5 = 15.
$$ 

In general, the $n$th term of the triangular number sequence can be calculated using the formula:

$$
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
$$ 

For instance, to find the fifth term, we substitute $n$ with $5$:

$$
T_5 = \frac{5(5+1)}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15.
$$ 

This calculation confirms that the next term in the sequence is indeed $15$.
