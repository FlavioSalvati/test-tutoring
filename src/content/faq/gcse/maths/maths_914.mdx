The range of the function $ y = x^2 - 2 $ is given by $ y \geq -2 $.

To comprehend this, let's analyze the function $ y = x^2 - 2 $. This is a quadratic function, and its graph takes the shape of a parabola. The standard form of a quadratic function is $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $. Here, we have $ a = 1 $, $ b = 0 $, and $ c = -2 $.

The term $ x^2 $ indicates that the parabola opens upwards, as the coefficient of $ x^2 $ (which is $ 1 $) is positive. The vertex of this parabola represents the lowest point on the graph. For the function $ y = x^2 - 2 $, the vertex is located at $ x = 0 $. By substituting $ x = 0 $ into the function, we find $ y = 0^2 - 2 = -2 $. Hence, the vertex is at the point $ (0, -2) $.

Since the parabola opens upwards, all $ y $-values produced by the function will be greater than or equal to the $ y $-value at the vertex. This indicates that the minimum value of $ y $ is $ -2 $, and as $ x $ moves away from $ 0 $ in either direction, $ y $ can increase indefinitely.

Consequently, the range of the function $ y = x^2 - 2 $ encompasses all real numbers $ y $ such that $ y \geq -2 $. The function does not yield any $ y $-values below $ -2 $, but it can produce any value that is greater than or equal to $ -2 $.
