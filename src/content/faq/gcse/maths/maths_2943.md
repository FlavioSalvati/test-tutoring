The relative frequency is $0.2$, or $20\%$.

Relative frequency quantifies the occurrence of an event in relation to the total number of trials conducted. To calculate relative frequency, you divide the number of times the event occurs by the total number of trials. In this example, the event occurs $20$ times out of $100$ trials. Thus, the calculation for relative frequency is as follows:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of times the event occurs}}{\text{Total number of trials}} = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2
$$

Relative frequency can also be represented as a percentage. To convert a decimal into a percentage, simply multiply it by $100$. Therefore, $0.2$ translates to $20\%$. This indicates that the event occurs $20\%$ of the time within the trials conducted.

Understanding relative frequency is crucial as it allows for the analysis of the likelihood of an event based on empirical data. For instance, if you are rolling a die and wish to determine the frequency of rolling a $4$, you can apply relative frequency to estimate this probability. If you rolled the die $100$ times and obtained a $4$ on $20$ of those rolls, the relative frequency would again be $0.2$, or $20\%$, indicating that rolling a $4$ is relatively frequent in your trials.

Relative frequency is especially beneficial in experimental settings and real-world situations where calculating theoretical probabilities may be challenging. It offers a pragmatic approach to understanding and predicting outcomes based on actual observed data.
