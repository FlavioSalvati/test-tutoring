The cosine rule for determining the length of a side in a triangle is expressed as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C).
$$

This formula is a valuable tool in trigonometry, applicable not only to right-angled triangles but to any triangle. It provides a relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the cosine of one of its angles. Specifically, in a triangle where the sides are denoted as $a$, $b$, and $c$, and the angle opposite side $c$ is $C$, the cosine rule can be used to calculate the length of side $c$ when the lengths of sides $a$ and $b$ and the measure of angle $C$ are known.

To effectively apply the cosine rule, follow these steps:

1. Identify the two sides and the included angle you are working with. Ensure you have the lengths of both sides and the measure of the angle between them.
2. Substitute the known values into the formula: 
   $$
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C).
   $$
3. Calculate the value of $c^2$ by performing the operations on the right-hand side of the equation.
4. Finally, take the square root of the result to determine the length of side $c$.

**Example:**

Consider a triangle with sides $a = 5 \, \text{cm}$, $b = 7 \, \text{cm}$, and the included angle $C = 60^\circ$. You would substitute these values into the formula as follows:

$$
c^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot \cos(60^\circ).
$$

Now, simplifying this expression step-by-step:

1. Calculate each term:
   - $5^2 = 25$,
   - $7^2 = 49$,
   - $\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5$.
2. Substitute these values back into the equation:
   $$
   c^2 = 25 + 49 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 0.5.
   $$
3. This simplifies to:
   $$
   c^2 = 25 + 49 - 35.
   $$
4. Adding and subtracting gives:
   $$
   c^2 = 39.
   $$

To find the length of side $c$, take the square root:

$$
c = \sqrt{39} \approx 6.24 \, \text{cm}.
$$

Thus, the length of side $c$ is approximately $6.24 \, \text{cm}$.
