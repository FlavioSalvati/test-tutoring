To plot the point $(7, -1)$ on a Cartesian plane, you need to locate the coordinates $7$ on the x-axis and $-1$ on the y-axis.

First, it's essential to understand that a Cartesian plane comprises two perpendicular axes: the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis. The point $(7, -1)$ is represented in the format $(x, y)$, where $7$ corresponds to the x-coordinate and $-1$ corresponds to the y-coordinate.

To begin, locate the x-coordinate. Move $7$ units to the right from the origin $(0, 0)$ along the x-axis. The origin is the point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect. Once you reach $x = 7$, you can then determine the y-coordinate.

Next, starting from the point $(7, 0)$ on the x-axis, move vertically downward since the y-coordinate is $-1$. Moving downward signifies a negative value on the y-axis. Count $1$ unit down from the x-axis to arrive at $y = -1$.

The intersection of these two movements marks the location of the point $(7, -1)$ on the Cartesian plane. You can then highlight this point with a dot and label it as $(7, -1)$ for clarity. This step-by-step approach ensures that you accurately plot the point based on its coordinates.
