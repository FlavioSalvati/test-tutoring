Pythagoras' Theorem asserts that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

This theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry and is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras. It specifically applies to right-angled triangles, which are defined as triangles that contain one angle measuring $90$ degrees. The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, and it is the longest side of the triangle. The remaining two sides are referred to as the "legs" of the triangle.

The theorem can be mathematically expressed using the formula:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

In this equation, $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides. For instance, if one leg of a right-angled triangle measures $3$ units and the other leg measures $4$ units, Pythagoras' Theorem can be employed to calculate the length of the hypotenuse. According to the theorem, we have:

$$
3^2 + 4^2 = c^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$

Thus, we find that:

$$
c = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Pythagoras' Theorem is immensely valuable in a variety of real-world applications, including construction, navigation, and computer graphics. It aids in determining distances and ensuring that structures are built accurately. A solid understanding of Pythagoras' Theorem is crucial for solving many problems in GCSE Maths and lays the groundwork for more advanced topics in both trigonometry and geometry.
