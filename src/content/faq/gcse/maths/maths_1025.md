The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $720$ degrees.

To comprehend why this is true, we must explore some fundamental concepts in geometry. A hexagon is defined as a six-sided polygon. The formula to calculate the sum of the interior angles of any polygon is given by:

$$
(n - 2) \times 180 \text{ degrees}
$$

where $n$ represents the number of sides. For a hexagon, we have $n = 6$. Substituting this value into the formula yields:

$$
(6 - 2) \times 180 = 4 \times 180 = 720 \text{ degrees}.
$$

This formula is effective because any polygon can be subdivided into triangles. The sum of the angles in each triangle is always $180$ degrees. In the case of a hexagon, you can draw lines from one vertex to all non-adjacent vertices, which divides the hexagon into four triangles. Since each triangle's angles sum to $180$ degrees, and there are four triangles, the total sum of the interior angles can be calculated as:

$$
4 \times 180 = 720 \text{ degrees}.
$$

Grasping this concept is essential for solving a variety of geometry problems, such as determining unknown angles in polygons or analyzing regular polygons where all sides and angles are equal. For a regular hexagon, each interior angle can be found by dividing the total sum of the angles by the number of angles (or sides):

$$
\frac{720}{6} = 120 \text{ degrees}.
$$

This understanding also serves as a foundation for more advanced topics, including tessellations and the study of symmetry in geometric shapes.
