To determine the probability of a single event, you can calculate it by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.

Probability quantifies how likely an event is to occur. To compute it, you need two key pieces of information: the number of favorable outcomes (the outcomes you are interested in) and the total number of possible outcomes (all outcomes that could potentially occur). The formula to calculate probability is given by:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

For instance, consider rolling a fair six-sided die. If you want to find the probability of rolling a 4, there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 4) and six possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Thus, the probability can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Probability of rolling a 4} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

This fraction can also be converted to a decimal, which is approximately $0.167$, or to a percentage, which is $16.7\%$.

In another example, consider drawing a card from a standard deck of 52 cards. If you want to calculate the probability of drawing an Ace, there are 4 Aces in the deck and a total of 52 possible cards. Therefore, the probability is:

$$
\text{Probability of drawing an Ace} = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}
$$

This probability can also be expressed as approximately $0.077$ or $7.7\%$.

It is important to remember that probabilities always fall within the range from $0$ to $1$. A probability of $0$ indicates that the event cannot occur, while a probability of $1$ signifies that the event is certain to happen.
