The value of $6^{-2}$ is given by $\frac{1}{36}$.

To clarify how we arrive at this result, let's break it down step by step. A negative exponent indicates that we should take the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive version of that exponent. Therefore, $6^{-2}$ implies we need to find the reciprocal of $6^2$.

First, let's calculate $6^2$. This calculation is straightforward: 

$$
6^2 = 6 \times 6 = 36.
$$

Since the exponent is negative, we take the reciprocal of $36$. The reciprocal of a number $n$ is defined as $\frac{1}{n}$. Thus, the reciprocal of $36$ is 

$$
\frac{1}{36}.
$$

Therefore, we can express $6^{-2}$ as:

$$
6^{-2} = \frac{1}{6^2} = \frac{1}{36}.
$$

This principle is part of the rules of indices (or exponents), which are fundamental concepts in mathematics. Understanding these rules allows for the simplification of expressions and more effective solving of equations. Remember that negative exponents indicate division, while positive exponents signify multiplication. Keeping this in mind can significantly ease the process of working with powers.
