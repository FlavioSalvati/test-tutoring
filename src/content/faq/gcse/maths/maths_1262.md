To determine the area of a compound shape composed of rectangles, the initial step is to decompose it into its individual rectangular components and then calculate the sum of their areas.

When faced with a compound shape consisting of multiple rectangles, start by identifying and delineating each rectangle within the overall shape. This process may involve drawing lines to visually separate the compound shape into simpler, non-overlapping rectangles.

Once you have identified each rectangle, measure the length and width of each one. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying its length by its width. For instance, if one of the rectangles has a length of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and a width of $3 \, \text{cm}$, its area would be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 5 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 15 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

After computing the area of each individual rectangle, sum all these areas to obtain the total area of the compound shape. For example, if you have three rectangles with areas of $15 \, \text{cm}^2$, $20 \, \text{cm}^2$, and $10 \, \text{cm}^2$, the total area of the compound shape would be:

$$
\text{Total Area} = 15 \, \text{cm}^2 + 20 \, \text{cm}^2 + 10 \, \text{cm}^2 = 45 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

It is important to ensure that all measurements are in consistent units before proceeding with any calculations. This method is effective because the area is additive; thus, the total area of a shape is simply the sum of the areas of its non-overlapping parts. By breaking down complex shapes into simpler rectangles, you can easily manage and calculate the total area.
