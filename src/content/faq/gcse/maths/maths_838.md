In the expression $2p + 7$, the letter $p$ represents a variable or an unknown number.

In mathematics, a variable is a symbol that signifies a number that can change or vary. In this particular expression, $p$ serves as the variable. The coefficient, which is the number $2$ in front of $p$, indicates that this number multiplies the variable. The number $7$ is classified as a constant, meaning it remains unchanged regardless of the value of $p$.

When you encounter an expression like $2p + 7$, it implies that you can substitute different values for $p$ to observe how the expression transforms. For instance, if $p = 3$, the expression becomes:

$$
2(3) + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13.
$$

Similarly, if $p = 5$, the expression changes to:

$$
2(5) + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17.
$$

Understanding variables is essential in algebra, as they enable you to create general expressions and equations that can be solved for various values. This fundamental concept will aid you in tackling more complex problems as you advance in your mathematics studies. Therefore, whenever you see a letter like $p$ in an expression, remember that it acts as a placeholder for a number that can vary.
