To determine the midrange of a data set, follow these steps: first, identify the smallest and largest values, then add these values together, and finally, divide the sum by two.

The midrange serves as a measure of central tendency, providing insight into the central value of a data set. To compute the midrange, you need to pinpoint the minimum (smallest) and maximum (largest) values within your data set. Once you have these two values, you add them together. The sum is then divided by two, yielding the midrange.

For instance, consider the following data set: $3, 7, 8, 5, 12$. The smallest value is $3$, and the largest value is $12$. By adding these two values, you obtain $3 + 12 = 15$. Dividing this sum by $2$ gives you $15 / 2 = 7.5$, which represents the midrange of this data set.

The midrange is advantageous because it is straightforward to calculate and provides a quick approximation of the central point of the data. However, it is important to note that the midrange can be significantly influenced by extreme values, known as outliers. These outliers may skew the midrange, making it less representative of the overall data set. Consequently, while the midrange is a useful metric, it is often considered alongside other measures of central tendency, such as the mean or median, to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the data.
