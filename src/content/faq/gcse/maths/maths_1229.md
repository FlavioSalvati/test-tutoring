The formula for calculating the area of a sector is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
$$

A sector is a segment of a circle that resembles a "slice of pie." To determine the area of a sector, you need two key pieces of information: the radius of the circle, denoted as $r$, and the angle of the sector, denoted as $\theta$, which is measured in degrees. The formula works by determining the fraction of the circle that the sector occupies and then multiplying that fraction by the total area of the circle.

Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step guide to finding the area of a sector:

1. **Identify the radius ($r$)**: This represents the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference.
2. **Determine the angle ($\theta$)**: This is the angle created at the center of the circle by the two radii that define the boundaries of the sector.
3. **Calculate the area of the entire circle**: Use the formula $$\text{Area}_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2$$ to find the total area of the circle.
4. **Compute the fraction of the circle represented by the sector**: This fraction is given by $$\frac{\theta}{360}$$, since a complete circle measures $360$ degrees.
5. **Multiply the total area of the circle by this fraction**: This product will yield the area of the sector.

For instance, consider a circle with a radius of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and a sector with an angle of $90$ degrees. To find the area of this sector, you would calculate it as follows:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{sector}} = \frac{90}{360} \times \pi \times 5^2
$$

Simplifying this expression, we have:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{sector}} = \frac{1}{4} \times \pi \times 25 = \frac{25\pi}{4}
$$

This results in an area of approximately $19.63 \, \text{cm}^2$.
