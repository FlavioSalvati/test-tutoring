The process of converting a fraction to a percentage involves multiplying the fraction by 100 and appending the percentage symbol (%). 

In essence, a fraction is a representation of a portion of a whole. To express this fractional part as a percentage, you must determine its equivalent value out of 100. This can be accomplished by multiplying the fraction by 100. For instance, to convert the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ to a percentage, you would multiply $\frac{3}{4}$ by 100.

Here's the detailed procedure:
1. Start with the fraction you wish to convert. As an example, we'll use $\frac{3}{4}$.
2. Multiply the numerator (the top number) by 100. Thus, $3 \times 100 = 300$.
3. Divide the resulting product by the denominator (the bottom number). So, $300 \div 4 = 75$.
4. Finally, append the percentage symbol (%) to the result. Hence, $\frac{3}{4}$ expressed as a percentage is $75\%$.

This technique is applicable to any fraction. For example, with a fraction like $\frac{1}{5}$, you would multiply 1 by 100 to get 100, and then divide by 5 to obtain 20. Consequently, $\frac{1}{5}$ as a percentage is $20\%$.

It's worth noting that multiplying by 100 effectively shifts the decimal point two places to the right, thereby converting the fraction into a percentage. This is a useful tip to remember when dealing with fractions and percentages in your GCSE Maths examinations.
