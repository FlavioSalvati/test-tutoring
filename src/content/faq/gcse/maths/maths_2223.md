The vertex of the parabola defined by the equation $ y = x^2 + 6x + 9 $ is located at the point $(-3, 0)$.

To determine the vertex of a parabola represented by the general quadratic equation $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, we can utilize the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex, which is given by:

$$
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
$$

In this specific case, we have $ a = 1 $, $ b = 6 $, and $ c = 9 $. Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$
x = -\frac{6}{2 \cdot 1} = -3
$$

With the x-coordinate of the vertex calculated, we can now find the corresponding y-coordinate by substituting $ x = -3 $ back into the original equation. We compute:

$$
y = (-3)^2 + 6(-3) + 9
$$

This expression simplifies as follows:

$$
y = 9 - 18 + 9 = 0
$$

Thus, the y-coordinate of the vertex is $ 0 $.

Consequently, the vertex of the parabola $ y = x^2 + 6x + 9 $ is at the point $(-3, 0)$. This point represents the minimum of the parabola because the coefficient of $ x^2 $ is positive, indicating that the parabola opens upwards. Understanding the vertex is essential, as it provides the turning point of the parabola, which is valuable for both graphing and solving quadratic equations.
