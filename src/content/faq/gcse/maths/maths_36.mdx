The least number in the set is $0.5$.

In order to ascertain the smallest number within a set, it is necessary to compare each number with the others. For this particular set, we're dealing with the numbers $0.5$, $1.2$, $0.75$, and $1.1$. We'll compare these step by step.

Firstly, let's compare $0.5$ and $1.2$. Since $0.5$ is less than $1.2$, it is clear that $0.5$ is the smaller number. Next, let's compare $0.5$ with $0.75$. Again, $0.5$ is less than $0.75$ which means $0.5$ maintains its position as the smallest number. Lastly, we compare $0.5$ with $1.1$. As $0.5$ is less than $1.1$, it remains as the smallest number in the set.

When comparing decimal numbers, the initial step is to compare the digits to the left of the decimal point. If they are equal, the next step is to compare the digits to the right of the decimal point, one at a time. In this particular scenario, $0.5$ has a zero to the left of the decimal point, while the other numbers in the set have either a one or a higher value to the right of the decimal point.

Therefore, through careful comparison of each number in the set, it becomes evident that $0.5$ is indeed the smallest number.
