To construct a triangle using a compass, follow these steps to draw three intersecting arcs from given points, which will serve as the triangle's vertices.

First, gather the necessary tools: a ruler, a compass, and a pencil. Begin by drawing a base line segment, which will represent one side of your triangle. Label the endpoints of this line segment as points $A$ and $B$. Next, determine the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.

Place the point of the compass on point $A$ and adjust it to the length of one of the other sides. Draw an arc above the line segment $AB$. Without changing the compass width, move the compass point to point $B$ and draw a second arc that intersects the first arc. Label the intersection point as $C$.

At this stage, you should have three points: $A$, $B$, and $C$. Use the ruler to draw line segments $AC$ and $BC$. The line segments $AC$, $BC$, and $AB$ together form your triangle.

This method ensures that the sides of the triangle are of the specified lengths and that the vertices are accurately placed. This fundamental technique in geometry not only helps you construct triangles but also deepens your understanding of their properties and the application of geometric tools.
