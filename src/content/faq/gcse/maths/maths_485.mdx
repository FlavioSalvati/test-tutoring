The image of the point $(4, 5)$ after being translated by the vector $(-1, 3)$ is $(3, 8)$.

To elaborate, translation is a specific type of transformation that shifts each point of a shape or object a certain distance in a specified direction. When translating a point, you add the components of the translation vector to the coordinates of the original point.

For the point $(4, 5)$, we have the translation vector $(-1, 3)$. This vector indicates that we should move the point $1$ unit to the left (due to the $-1$) and $3$ units upward (because of the $3$).

To determine the new coordinates of the point, we simply add the x-component of the translation vector to the x-coordinate of the original point and the y-component of the vector to the y-coordinate of the original point. Therefore, for the x-coordinate, we calculate:

$$
4 + (-1) = 3,
$$

and for the y-coordinate, we have:

$$
5 + 3 = 8.
$$

Thus, after applying the translation vector $(-1, 3)$ to the point $(4, 5)$, the new coordinates are $(3, 8)$. This indicates that the point has shifted $1$ unit to the left and $3$ units upward, resulting in its new position at $(3, 8)$.
