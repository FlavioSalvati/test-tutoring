Hereâ€™s an enhanced version of your content for clarity and readability, with proper formatting for mathematical expressions:

When you express the product of $5$ and a variable $x$, you write it as $5x$.

In algebra, it is customary to represent the multiplication of a number by a variable by placing them next to each other without any intervening symbol. This shorthand notation streamlines mathematical expressions, making them clearer and easier to read. Instead of writing $5 * x$, you simply write $5x$, which is universally understood to mean "5 times $x$."

This notation is an essential part of the conventions used in algebra to simplify expressions and equations. For example, if $x$ represents a specific number, then $5x$ indicates that you take that number and multiply it by $5$. If $x$ were equal to $2$, then $5x$ would be computed as $5 * 2$, resulting in $10$.

Using this notation becomes increasingly helpful as you work with more complex expressions and equations. For instance, consider the equation $3x + 5x$. You can combine the like terms to simplify it to $8x$, which is far more straightforward than writing it as $3 * x + 5 * x$ and then combining the terms.

It's important to remember that the variable $x$ can represent any number, and the expression $5x$ will vary depending on the value assigned to $x$. This flexibility is one of the powerful features of algebra, enabling you to solve a wide range of problems through the manipulation of these expressions.
