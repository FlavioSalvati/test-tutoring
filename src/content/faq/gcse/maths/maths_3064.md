To determine the equation of the line of best fit, we employ the least squares method to compute both the slope and the y-intercept.

The line of best fit, commonly referred to as the regression line, is a straight line that best represents the data plotted on a scatter plot. To derive this line, we utilize the least squares method, which aims to minimize the sum of the squares of the vertical distances (residuals) between the data points and the line.

**Step 1: Calculate the Means**

Begin by calculating the mean of the x-values, denoted as $\bar{x}$, and the mean of the y-values, denoted as $\bar{y}$. These values represent the average of your data points.

**Step 2: Compute the Slope**

Next, find the slope ($m$) of the line using the following formula:

$$
m = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}
$$

In this formula, $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent the individual data points, and the summation $\sum$ is taken over all data points.

**Step 3: Calculate the Y-Intercept**

Once the slope is determined, compute the y-intercept ($c$) with the following equation:

$$
c = \bar{y} - m\bar{x}
$$

**Step 4: Write the Equation of the Line**

With both the slope and the y-intercept calculated, you can express the equation of the line of best fit in the standard form:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

This equation allows you to predict the corresponding $y$-value for any given $x$-value based on the trend indicated by your data. It is important to note that while the line of best fit serves as a model to summarize the relationship between the variables, it may not pass through all data points. Instead, it offers the best overall approximation of the data's trend.
