To plot the equation $ y = x - 2 $, follow these steps: create a table of values, plot the corresponding points, and then draw the line.

**Step 1: Create a Table of Values**

Begin by constructing a table that includes values for $ x $ and their corresponding $ y $ values. Select a few values for $ x $ (for example, $ -2, 0, 2, 4 $) and substitute each into the equation $ y = x - 2 $ to determine the corresponding $ y $ values. 

Here are some calculations:
- For $ x = -2 $:
  $$ y = -2 - 2 = -4 $$
- For $ x = 0 $:
  $$ y = 0 - 2 = -2 $$
- For $ x = 2 $:
  $$ y = 2 - 2 = 0 $$
- For $ x = 4 $:
  $$ y = 4 - 2 = 2 $$

Thus, the points you will use are:
- $ (-2, -4) $
- $ (0, -2) $
- $ (2, 0) $
- $ (4, 2) $

**Step 2: Plot the Points**

Next, plot these points on a graph. You can use graph paper or a digital graphing tool for this task. On the coordinate plane, accurately mark the points calculated from your table:
- Plot the point $ (-2, -4) $
- Plot the point $ (0, -2) $
- Plot the point $ (2, 0) $
- Plot the point $ (4, 2) $

**Step 3: Draw the Line**

Finally, connect the plotted points with a straight line. Since the equation $ y = x - 2 $ is linear, the points should align perfectly on a straight line. Use a ruler to ensure that the line is straight and extends in both directions beyond the plotted points.

By following these steps, you can effectively plot the graph of $ y = x - 2 $. This approach not only helps you visualize the relationship between $ x $ and $ y $ but also enhances your understanding of how variations in $ x $ influence the value of $ y $.
