To calculate the probability of both events A and B occurring, denoted as $P(A \text{ and } B)$, you can use the formula:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)
$$

In this context, $P(A|B)$ represents the conditional probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred. 

Here, you are given that:

- $P(A|B) = 0.3$
- $P(B) = 0.4$

To find $P(A \text{ and } B)$, simply multiply these two probabilities:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.3 \times 0.4 = 0.12
$$

This result indicates that there is a 12% chance, or probability of $0.12$, that both events A and B will occur simultaneously. 

This approach is particularly useful in probability problems where the goal is to determine the likelihood of two events happening together, especially when you have conditional information about one event based on the occurrence of the other. The foundational concept behind this calculation stems from the definition of conditional probability, which states that:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}
$$

By rearranging this equation, you arrive back at the original formula:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)
$$ 

This relationship highlights the interconnectedness of probabilities in scenarios involving multiple events.
