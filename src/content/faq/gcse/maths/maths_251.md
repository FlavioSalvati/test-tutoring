To determine the inverse of the function $ f(x) = 4x + 5 $, we find that its inverse is given by $ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 5}{4} $.

Finding the inverse of a function involves swapping the roles of the variables $ x $ and $ y $, and then solving for $ y $. We start by rewriting the original function. First, we replace $ f(x) $ with $ y $ for clarity:

$$ y = 4x + 5 $$

Next, we swap $ x $ and $ y $ to set up the equation for the inverse:

$$ x = 4y + 5 $$

Now, our goal is to solve this equation for $ y $. We begin by isolating $ y $ on one side. First, we subtract $ 5 $ from both sides:

$$ x - 5 = 4y $$

Next, we divide both sides by $ 4 $ to solve for $ y $:

$$ y = \frac{x - 5}{4} $$

Thus, the inverse function can be expressed as:

$$ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 5}{4} $$

This means that for any value of $ x $ in the original function $ f(x) $, you can utilize the inverse function $ f^{-1}(x) $ to retrieve the corresponding input value. For instance, if we have $ f(x) = 13 $, we can find $ x $ using the inverse function:

$$ x = f^{-1}(13) = \frac{13 - 5}{4} = 2 $$

Understanding how to find the inverse of a function is valuable in various fields of mathematics, as it deepens our comprehension of the relationship between functions and their inverses.
