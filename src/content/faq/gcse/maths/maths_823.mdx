The expression $\sqrt{8}$ can be rewritten in surd form as $2\sqrt{2}$.

To convert $\sqrt{8}$ into surd form, we simplify it by identifying its prime factors. We start by recognizing that $8$ can be expressed as a product of its prime factors: 

$$8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^3.$$

Thus, the square root of $8$ can be rewritten as the square root of $2^3$.

When simplifying square roots, we search for pairs of prime factors, since the square root of a pair of identical factors simplifies to just one of those factors. In this case, we have three factors of $2$. We can extract one pair of $2$s from under the square root, which leaves one $2$ inside. This process can be mathematically expressed as follows:

$$\sqrt{8} = \sqrt{(2 \times 2 \times 2)} = \sqrt{(4 \times 2)} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}.$$

Therefore, $\sqrt{8}$ simplifies to $2\sqrt{2}$. This is the simplest surd form, as $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be simplified further; it is already in its most basic form. Mastering the simplification of surds is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it facilitates solving equations and working effectively with irrational numbers.
