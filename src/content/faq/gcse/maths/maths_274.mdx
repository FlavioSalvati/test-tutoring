The formula for determining the midpoint of a line segment is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right).
$$

To calculate the midpoint, you will need the coordinates of the two endpoints of the segment. Let's denote these endpoints as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The midpoint is simply the average of the $x$-coordinates and the average of the $y$-coordinates of these endpoints. Specifically, you add the $x$-coordinates together and divide by $2$, and you do the same for the $y$-coordinates.

For instance, consider a line segment with endpoints located at $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$. To find the midpoint, you would perform the following calculations:

$$
x_{\text{mid}} = \frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3
$$

$$
y_{\text{mid}} = \frac{3 + 7}{2} = 5
$$

Thus, the midpoint of the line segment is $(3, 5)$.

This formula is particularly useful in various geometric contexts, such as finding the center of a line segment or dividing a line segment into equal parts. It is also a fundamental concept in coordinate geometry, which is commonly encountered in GCSE Mathematics. Remember, the midpoint is always equidistant from both endpoints, making it an ideal center point for the line segment.
