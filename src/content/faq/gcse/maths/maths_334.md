To determine the actual area from a 1:100 scale drawing, you need to multiply the area depicted in the drawing by $10,000$.

When working with scale drawings, it's crucial to remember that the scale factor applies to both lengths and areas. A scale of $1:100$ indicates that $1$ unit on the drawing corresponds to $100$ units in real life. However, when calculating areas, the scale factor must be squared because area is a two-dimensional measurement, calculated as length times width.

For instance, consider a rectangle in a $1:100$ scale drawing with dimensions $2 \, \text{cm}$ by $3 \, \text{cm}$. First, you calculate the area on the drawing:

$$
\text{Area on drawing} = 2 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 6 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

To find the actual area, you must multiply this drawing area by the square of the scale factor. Since the scale factor is $100$, you square it to obtain $10,000$. Consequently, the real area is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Real area} = 6 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 10,000 = 60,000 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

If you wish to convert this into more commonly used units, you can change square centimeters to square meters. Since there are $10,000 \, \text{cm}^2$ in $1 \, \text{m}^2$, the conversion gives:

$$
60,000 \, \text{cm}^2 = 6 \, \text{m}^2.
$$

Thus, the actual area of the rectangle is $6 \, \text{m}^2$.

In summary, the critical step in this process is squaring the scale factor ($100^2 = 10,000$) and then multiplying it by the area depicted in the drawing. This method ensures an accurate conversion of the scaled area into the real-world area.
