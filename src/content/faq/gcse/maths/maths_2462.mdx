The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the equation $ y = x - 2 $ is $ -1 $.

To clarify why this is the case, let's first examine the gradient of the given line. The equation $ y = x - 2 $ is expressed in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the gradient (or slope) of the line. In this instance, the gradient $ m $ is $ 1 $.

A fundamental property of perpendicular lines is that the product of their gradients is always $ -1 $. This means that if one line has a gradient of $ m $, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to it can be calculated using the formula:

$$
-\frac{1}{m}
$$

For the line defined by $ y = x - 2 $, we have established that the gradient $ m $ is $ 1 $. To determine the gradient of the line perpendicular to it, we substitute $ m = 1 $ into the formula:

$$
-\frac{1}{1} = -1
$$

Thus, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to $ y = x - 2 $ is indeed $ -1 $. This implies that if you were to draw a line with a gradient of $ -1 $, it would intersect the line $ y = x - 2 $ at a right angle, forming a perfect $ 90^\circ $ angle.
