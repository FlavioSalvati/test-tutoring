The surface area of a sphere with a radius of $6 \, \text{cm}$ is given by the expression $144\pi$ square centimeters.

To calculate the surface area of a sphere, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 4\pi r^2
$$

where $ r $ represents the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius $ r $ is $6 \, \text{cm}$. Substituting the radius into the formula, we have:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 4\pi (6)^2
$$

First, we need to calculate the square of the radius:

$$
6^2 = 36
$$

Next, we multiply this result by $4$:

$$
4 \times 36 = 144
$$

Finally, we append the $\pi$ to our result:

$$
144\pi
$$

Thus, the surface area of the sphere is $ 144\pi $ square centimeters. If you require a numerical approximation, you can use the value of $ \pi $ (approximately $3.14159$):

$$
144\pi \approx 144 \times 3.14159 \approx 452.39
$$

Therefore, the approximate surface area is $452.39$ square centimeters. However, unless specified otherwise, it is generally preferable to present your answer in terms of $ \pi $ for precision, especially in examination settings.
