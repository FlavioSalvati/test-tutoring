The conditional probability $ P(A|B) $ is given as $ 0.5 $.

To determine the conditional probability $ P(A|B) $, we utilize the formula:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}
$$

This formula calculates the probability of event $ A $ occurring given that event $ B $ has already taken place. In this scenario, we know that $ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.15 $ and $ P(B) = 0.3 $.

Now, let's substitute these values into the formula:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.15}{0.3}
$$

When we perform the division of $ 0.15 $ by $ 0.3 $, we find that the result is $ 0.5 $. Consequently, we conclude that:

$$
P(A|B) = 0.5
$$

This implies that if event $ B $ has occurred, there is a $ 50\% $ probability that event $ A $ will also occur.

Understanding conditional probability is crucial as it allows us to analyze situations where events are interdependent. For instance, if we know it is raining (event $ B $), we may be particularly interested in the probability that we will need an umbrella (event $ A $). By applying the given probabilities along with the formula, we can make more informed decisions based on the likelihood of related events.
