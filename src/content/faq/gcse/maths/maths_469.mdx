To determine the area of a triangle, you can use the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} 
$$

For example, consider a triangle with a base of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and a height of $7 \, \text{cm}$. Substituting these values into the formula gives us:

$$ 
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \, \text{cm} \times 7 \, \text{cm} 
$$

First, we will calculate the product of the base and the height:

$$ 
5 \, \text{cm} \times 7 \, \text{cm} = 35 \, \text{cm}^2 
$$

Next, we multiply this result by $\frac{1}{2}$:

$$ 
\frac{1}{2} \times 35 \, \text{cm}^2 = 17.5 \, \text{cm}^2 
$$

Thus, the area of the triangle is $17.5 \, \text{cm}^2$. 

This formula is effective because a triangle can be thought of as half of a rectangle. If you visualize a rectangle with the same base and height, its area would be calculated as $\text{base} \times \text{height}$. Since a triangle occupies half of that area, we divide by $2$. This method is universally applicable to any triangle, provided you know its base and height.
