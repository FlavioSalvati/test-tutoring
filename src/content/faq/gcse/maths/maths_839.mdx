To determine the value of the expression $4r - 8$ when $r = 3$, we will substitute the value of $r$ into the expression. This involves replacing every instance of $r$ with $3$. Thus, the expression $4r - 8$ transforms into $4(3) - 8$.

Following the order of operations, often referred to as BIDMAS or BODMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction), we first perform the multiplication. Calculating $4 \times 3$ yields $12$, which simplifies our expression to:

$$
12 - 8
$$

Next, we carry out the subtraction. Subtracting $8$ from $12$ results in $4$. Therefore, the value of the expression $4r - 8$ when $r = 3$ is:

$$
4
$$

This practice of substituting a specific value into an algebraic expression and simplifying it step-by-step is a crucial skill in GCSE Maths. It enhances your understanding of how variables function and how to manipulate algebraic expressions effectively. Always remember to adhere to the order of operations to ensure accurate results.
