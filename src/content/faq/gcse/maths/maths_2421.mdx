The slope of the line that passes through the points $(1, 5)$ and $(2, 8)$ is $3$.

To determine the slope of a line between two points, we utilize the slope formula:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points, we have: $x_1 = 1$, $y_1 = 5$, $x_2 = 2$, and $y_2 = 8$.

Next, we will substitute these values into the slope formula:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{8 - 5}{2 - 1}
$$

First, we calculate the difference in the y-coordinates:

$$
8 - 5 = 3
$$

Then, we compute the difference in the x-coordinates:

$$
2 - 1 = 1
$$

Now, we divide the difference in the y-coordinates by the difference in the x-coordinates:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{3}{1} = 3
$$

Thus, the slope of the line passing through the points $(1, 5)$ and $(2, 8)$ is $3$. This indicates that for every unit increase in the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate increases by $3$ units. 

Understanding the slope is essential for analyzing the steepness and direction of a line. In this case, a positive slope of $3$ signifies that the line rises as it progresses from left to right.
