The formula for calculating the perimeter of a square is given by 

$$
P = 4s
$$ 

where $ s $ represents the length of one side of the square.

To elaborate, the perimeter of a square is the total distance around its outer edge. Because all four sides of a square are of equal length, you can determine the perimeter by summing the lengths of all four sides. This is the rationale behind the formula $ P = 4s $, where $ P $ denotes the perimeter and $ s $ indicates the length of one side.

For instance, if each side of the square measures $ 5 $ centimeters, you would compute the perimeter by multiplying $ 5 $ by $ 4 $, resulting in $ 20 $ centimeters. Consequently, the total distance around the square is $ 20 $ centimeters.

Grasping this formula is particularly beneficial in practical scenarios, such as when you need to measure the boundary of a square garden or a square piece of fabric. This straightforward calculation can save you considerable time and effort. Remember, the essential point is that all four sides of a square are always equal in length, which simplifies the process of determining the perimeter.
