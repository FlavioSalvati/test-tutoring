To construct a triangle given three side lengths, you can use a ruler and compass to draw each side accurately.

Begin by labeling the three sides as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Start with the longest side, which we will denote as $a$, and draw it using a ruler. This side will serve as the base of your triangle. Mark the endpoints of this line segment as points $A$ and $B$.

Next, set your compass to the length of side $b$. Place the compass point on point $A$ and draw an arc above the line segment $AB$. This arc represents all possible points that are $b$ units away from point $A$.

Now, adjust your compass to the length of side $c$. Position the compass point on point $B$ and draw another arc that intersects the first arc. The intersection of these two arcs will give you point $C$, which is the third vertex of the triangle.

Finally, use a ruler to draw line segments $AC$ and $BC$ to complete the triangle. Make sure that the lengths of these segments correspond to the specified lengths $b$ and $c$.

By following these steps, you can accurately construct a triangle with the given side lengths. This method guarantees that the triangle adheres to the principles of Euclidean geometry, specifically the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.
