To round the number 789 to the nearest hundred, we first identify the tens digit. In this case, the number is 789, and the tens digit is 8. 

When rounding to the nearest hundred, we follow these rules: if the tens digit is $5$ or greater, we round up; if it is less than $5$, we round down. Since the tens digit in $789$ is $8$, which exceeds $5$, we round up.

This process involves increasing the hundreds digit by $1$ and converting both the tens and units digits to $0$. Consequently, $789$ rounds to $800$ when rounded to the nearest hundred.

Rounding is a valuable skill in mathematics, particularly useful for simplifying calculations or quickly estimating values. It makes numbers easier to handle, especially in mental arithmetic or when analyzing large datasets. Remember, the critical step in rounding is to always check the digit immediately to the right of the place value you are rounding to.
