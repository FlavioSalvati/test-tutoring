The area of a similar rectangle with a scale factor of $3$ is $9$ times the area of the original rectangle.

When working with similar shapes, the scale factor significantly influences the dimensions of the shape. For rectangles, if the scale factor is $3$, then each side of the new rectangle is $3$ times longer than the corresponding side of the original rectangle. However, since area is a two-dimensional measurement, the impact of the scale factor on the area is squared.

To illustrate this concept, let's consider a rectangle with an original length $ l $ and width $ w $. The area of this rectangle is given by 

$$ 
A = l \times w. 
$$ 

When we apply a scale factor of $3$, the new length becomes $ 3l $ and the new width becomes $ 3w $. Consequently, the area of the new rectangle can be expressed as 

$$ 
A' = (3l) \times (3w) = 9lw. 
$$ 

This calculation demonstrates that the area of the new rectangle is $9$ times the area of the original rectangle. This principle holds true for any scale factor $ k $; the area of the similar shape will be $ k^2 $ times the area of the original shape. Therefore, if you are aware of the scale factor, you can easily determine how the area changes by simply squaring the scale factor.
