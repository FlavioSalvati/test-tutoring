To convert the decimal $0.6$ into a percentage, you simply multiply it by $100$, resulting in $60\%$.

When transitioning from a decimal to a percentage, the process involves multiplying the decimal value by $100$. This is rooted in the definition of "percent," which translates to "per hundred." Essentially, you are determining how many parts out of $100$ the decimal represents. For example, when you multiply $0.6$ by $100$, you arrive at $60$. Thus, $0.6$ expressed as a percentage is $60\%$.

To elaborate further, consider $0.6$ as equivalent to $6$ tenths. By multiplying $6$ tenths by $10$, you obtain $60$ hundredths, which can also be expressed as $60$ out of $100$, or $60\%$. Another way to visualize this conversion is by shifting the decimal point two places to the right, effectively multiplying by $100$. Hence, $0.6$ transforms into $60.0$, which simplifies to $60\%$.

This conversion method applies to any decimal number. For instance, when you take $0.25$ and multiply it by $100$, you get $25\%$. Similarly, for $1.75$, multiplying by $100$ yields $175\%$. 

Converting decimals to percentages is a valuable skill across various mathematical fields, including statistics, probability, and everyday calculations such as discounts and interest rates.
