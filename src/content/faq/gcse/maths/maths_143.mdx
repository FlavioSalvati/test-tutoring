The price per item is £5.

To determine the price per item, you need to divide the total cost by the number of items. In this example, the total cost is £25, and the number of items is $5$. Therefore, you perform the division:

$$
\frac{£25}{5} = £5.
$$

This calculation indicates that each item costs £5.

This scenario illustrates a division problem where you are distributing a total amount evenly among a specified number of parts. It is a fundamental concept in mathematics that aids in understanding how to decompose larger quantities into smaller, manageable units.

In practical situations, such calculations are extremely beneficial. For example, when shopping for multiple items, being able to calculate the price per item allows you to compare prices effectively and make more informed purchasing decisions.

To recap, the essential steps are to identify the total amount and the number of items, then divide the total amount by the number of items. Practicing these steps will help you become more proficient with similar problems in the future.
