The equation of the line is given by 

$$ 
y = 2x - 3. 
$$

To clarify this, let's break it down step by step. The general form of a straight line is 

$$ 
y = mx + c, 
$$ 

where $ m $ denotes the slope (or gradient) of the line, and $ c $ signifies the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

In this particular case, the slope is $ 2 $ and the y-intercept is $ -3 $. By substituting these values into the equation, we replace $ m $ with $ 2 $ and $ c $ with $ -3 $, resulting in the equation 

$$ 
y = 2x - 3. 
$$

A slope of $ 2 $ indicates that for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ rises by $ 2 $ units. Conversely, a y-intercept of $ -3 $ means that when $ x = 0 $, $ y $ is $ -3 $. Thus, the point $ (0, -3) $ is where the line crosses the y-axis.

To visualize this, you can plot the y-intercept at the coordinates $ (0, -3) $ on a graph. From this point, you can use the slope to determine another point on the line. Given that the slope is $ 2 $, you can move $ 1 $ unit to the right (increasing $ x $ by $ 1 $) and $ 2 $ units up (increasing $ y $ by $ 2 $) to find the next point, which will be $ (1, -1) $. 

Connecting these two points, $ (0, -3) $ and $ (1, -1) $, will yield the straight line represented by the equation 

$$ 
y = 2x - 3. 
$$
