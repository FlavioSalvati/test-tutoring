The mean of the data set consisting of the values $20$, $25$, $30$, $35$, and $40$ is $30$.

To calculate the mean of a data set, follow these steps: first, sum all the values, and then divide that total by the number of values in the set. For our data set, the values are $20$, $25$, $30$, $35$, and $40$. 

Let's begin by adding these numbers together:

$$
20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 = 150
$$

Next, we need to determine how many values there are in the data set. In this instance, there are $5$ values. Now, we can find the mean by dividing the total sum by the number of values:

$$
\frac{150}{5} = 30
$$

Thus, the mean of this data set is $30$. The mean serves as a measure of central tendency, providing insight into the average value of the data set. It is particularly useful for summarizing a collection of numbers with a single value that effectively represents the center of the data.
