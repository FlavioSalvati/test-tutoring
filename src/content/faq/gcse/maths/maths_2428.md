To write the equation of a line that is parallel to $ y = 4x + 2 $, you need to use the same slope, which is $ 4 $.

In more detail, the standard form of the equation of a line is given by 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $ m $ represents the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. For two lines to be parallel, they must have identical slopes. The line $ y = 4x + 2 $ has a slope of $ 4 $.

To derive the equation of a line that is parallel to this one, you will maintain the slope at $ 4 $. Consequently, the general form for any line parallel to $ y = 4x + 2 $ can be expressed as 

$$
y = 4x + c,
$$ 

where $ c $ is any constant. This constant $ c $ represents the y-intercept of the new line, which can differ from that of the original line.

For instance, if you wish to find a line that is parallel to $ y = 4x + 2 $ and passes through the point $ (1, 3) $, you will substitute $ x = 1 $ and $ y = 3 $ into the equation $ y = 4x + c $ to solve for $ c $:

$$ 
3 = 4(1) + c 
$$
$$ 
3 = 4 + c 
$$
$$ 
c = 3 - 4 
$$
$$ 
c = -1 
$$

Thus, the equation of the line that is parallel to $ y = 4x + 2 $ and passes through the point $ (1, 3) $ is 

$$ 
y = 4x - 1. 
$$
