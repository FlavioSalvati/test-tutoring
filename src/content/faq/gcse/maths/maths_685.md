To arrange a set of decimals and fractions, the first step is to convert all numbers into a consistent format, either as decimals or as fractions. This uniformity simplifies comparison and ordering.

When faced with mixed decimals and fractions, choose whether to convert all the numbers to decimals or to fractions based on whichever method you find easier.

To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator (the top number) by the denominator (the bottom number). For instance, to convert the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ to a decimal, you perform the calculation $3 \div 4$, which equals $0.75$. Once all fractions are converted to decimals, you can easily compare and arrange them in either ascending or descending order.

Alternatively, you can convert decimals into fractions. To do this, express the decimal as a fraction with a denominator that corresponds to the number of decimal places, such as $10$, $100$, or $1000$. For example, the decimal $0.75$ can be expressed as $\frac{75}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{3}{4}$. After converting all decimals to fractions, find a common denominator to facilitate comparison and ordering.

Consider the example with the numbers $0.5$, $\frac{1}{3}$, and $0.75$. You could convert $\frac{1}{3}$ to its decimal equivalent, approximately $0.333$. Now the set consists of $0.5$, $0.333$, and $0.75$. Arranging these in ascending order yields $0.333$, $0.5$, and $0.75$. 

If you prefer to work with fractions, convert $0.5$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ and $0.75$ to $\frac{3}{4}$. By finding a common denominator of $12$, you transform these fractions into $\frac{6}{12}$, $\frac{4}{12}$, and $\frac{9}{12}$ respectively. This allows you to arrange them as $\frac{4}{12}$, $\frac{6}{12}$, and $\frac{9}{12}$, which corresponds to the order of $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, and $\frac{3}{4}$.
