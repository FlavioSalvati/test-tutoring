The formula for calculating the area of a sector in a circle is given by:

$$
\text{Sector Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
$$

To better understand this formula, let's break it down. A sector of a circle can be visualized as a "slice of pie." It is defined by a central angle $\theta$ (measured in degrees) and the radius $r$ of the circle. The total area of a circle is determined using the formula $\pi r^2$. However, since a sector only represents a portion of the circle, we need to calculate what fraction of the entire area is occupied by the sector.

The fraction of the circle represented by the sector is determined by the central angle $\theta$. Since a complete circle encompasses $360$ degrees, the fraction of the circle that the sector occupies is $\frac{\theta}{360}$. To find the area of the sector, we multiply the total area of the circle by this fraction.

For instance, consider a circle with a radius of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and a sector that has a central angle of $90$ degrees. By substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
\text{Sector Area} = \frac{90}{360} \times \pi \times 5^2
$$

Simplifying this expression, we find:

$$
\text{Sector Area} = \frac{1}{4} \times \pi \times 25 = \frac{25\pi}{4} \approx 19.63 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

This formula is highly useful in a variety of contexts, such as calculating the area of a pizza slice or a segment of a circular garden. Always ensure that you use consistent units for the radius and convert the angle to degrees if it is provided in a different unit.
