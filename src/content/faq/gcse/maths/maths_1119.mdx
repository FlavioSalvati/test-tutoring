The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always equal to $360^\circ$.

To elaborate, an exterior angle is formed by extending one side of a polygon at each vertex. When you calculate the total of all the exterior angles of a polygon—whether it has $3$ sides or $30$ sides—the sum will consistently be $360^\circ$. This consistency arises because each exterior angle represents the amount of turning you do as you navigate around the polygon, ultimately returning you to your starting point.

To grasp why this is true, let's consider a straightforward example: a triangle. When you extend one side of a triangle, the resulting exterior angle is supplementary to the interior angle at that vertex. Since the sum of the interior angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$, we can express each exterior angle as $180^\circ$ minus the corresponding interior angle. If we sum the three exterior angles of the triangle, we find that they total $360^\circ$.

This principle applies universally to all polygons, irrespective of the number of sides. Whether you are dealing with a quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, or any other polygon, the sum of the exterior angles will always remain $360^\circ$. This fundamental property is invaluable for various geometric calculations and proofs. Therefore, no matter how intricate the shape, you can depend on this rule to assist you in analyzing and solving problems related to polygons.
