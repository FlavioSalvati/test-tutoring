The vector difference between two vectors, denoted as $ \mathbf{m} $ and $ \mathbf{n} $, is expressed as $ \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{n} $.

To elaborate, vectors are mathematical entities characterized by both magnitude and direction. When we refer to the vector difference, we are essentially performing a subtraction of one vector from another. Specifically, for two vectors $ \mathbf{m} $ and $ \mathbf{n} $, the vector difference $ \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{n} $ yields a new vector that points from the tip of vector $ \mathbf{n} $ to the tip of vector $ \mathbf{m} $.

To perform vector subtraction, we subtract the corresponding components of the vectors. For instance, if we have $ \mathbf{m} = (m_1, m_2) $ and $ \mathbf{n} = (n_1, n_2) $ in a two-dimensional space, the vector difference $ \mathbf{m} - \mathbf{n} $ can be computed as follows:

$$ 
\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{n} = (m_1 - n_1, m_2 - n_2) 
$$

This formula indicates that you subtract the first component of vector $ \mathbf{n} $ from the first component of vector $ \mathbf{m} $, and similarly, the second component of vector $ \mathbf{n} $ from the second component of vector $ \mathbf{m} $. The resulting vector represents the relative position of $ \mathbf{m} $ in relation to $ \mathbf{n} $.

Grasping the concept of vector subtraction is crucial across various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer graphics, where it is often necessary to determine the difference between two points or directions.
