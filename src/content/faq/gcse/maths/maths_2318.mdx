The inverse of the function $ f(x) = x^2 + 1 $ is given by $ f^{-1}(x) = \pm\sqrt{x-1} $. However, it is important to note that this expression does not represent a function.

To grasp this concept, letâ€™s first revisit the idea of an inverse function. The inverse effectively "reverses" the mapping of the original function. For the function $ f(x) = x^2 + 1 $, we start by swapping $ x $ and $ y $ in the equation $ y = x^2 + 1 $. This gives us the equation $ x = y^2 + 1 $. Rearranging this, we find $ x - 1 = y^2 $, which leads to $ y = \pm\sqrt{x-1} $.

However, there is a significant issue here. For a function to possess an inverse that is also a function, each input $ x $ must correspond to exactly one output $ y $. The original function $ f(x) = x^2 + 1 $ is not one-to-one because both positive and negative values of $ x $ can yield the same $ y $-value. For instance, $ f(2) = 5 $ and $ f(-2) = 5 $. Consequently, the inverse $ f^{-1}(x) = \pm\sqrt{x-1} $ cannot be classified as a function since it provides two possible outputs for each input.

In GCSE Maths, it is crucial to recognize that not every function has an inverse that is also a function. The function $ f(x) = x^2 + 1 $ fails the "horizontal line test." This test determines whether any horizontal line intersects the graph of the function more than once. If a horizontal line does indeed cross the graph multiple times, the function does not have an inverse that is also a function. In this case, the expression $ \pm\sqrt{x-1} $ represents a relation rather than a function, as it does not satisfy the vertical line test.
