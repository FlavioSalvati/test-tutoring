To find y in 2y + 4 = 10, subtract 4 from 10, then divide by 2.

To solve the equation 2y + 4 = 10, you need to isolate the variable y. Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. You do this by subtracting 4 from both sides. This gives you:

2y + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4

Simplifying both sides, you get:

2y = 6

Now, you need to isolate y by getting rid of the coefficient 2. You do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

2y / 2 = 6 / 2

This simplifies to:

y = 3

So, y equals 3. This method of solving linear equations involves basic arithmetic operations: subtraction and division. By following these steps, you can solve similar equations and find the value of the unknown variable. Remember, the goal is to get y by itself on one side of the equation.
