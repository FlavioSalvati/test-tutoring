Skewness is a statistical measure that quantifies the asymmetry of a data distribution in relation to its mean.

When we discuss skewness, we are examining the extent to which a dataset leans towards one side. A symmetrical distribution indicates that the data is evenly distributed on both sides of the mean. In contrast, an asymmetrical distribution may be skewed either to the left or to the right.

A distribution is classified as **positively skewed** (or right-skewed) if the tail on the right side is longer or thicker than the left tail. This suggests that most data points cluster on the left side, with a few larger values extending towards the right. For instance, when analyzing the distribution of incomes within a country, it is common to observe that the majority of individuals earn below the average income, while a small number earn significantly more, resulting in a right-skewed distribution.

On the other hand, a distribution is termed **negatively skewed** (or left-skewed) if the tail on the left side is longer or thicker than the right tail. This indicates that most data points are concentrated on the right side, with fewer smaller values extending towards the left. A typical example can be seen in the age of retirement, where most individuals retire around a certain age, but a few retire much earlier, leading to a left-skewed distribution.

Understanding skewness is vital for accurate data analysis, as it provides insights into the direction and degree of asymmetry within the data. This knowledge can be crucial when making predictions and informed decisions based on the dataset.
