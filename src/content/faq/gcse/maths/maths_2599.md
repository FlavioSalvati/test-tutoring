The angle subtended by an arc in the same segment is always equal.

This property is a fundamental concept in circle theorems. Specifically, when you have a circle with an arc, any angle formed by drawing lines from the endpoints of the arc to a point on the circumference will be the same, provided that the point lies within the same segment of the circle. In simpler terms, if you select any two points on the circumference that are on the same side of the arc, the angles they create with the arc will be identical.

To visualize this concept, consider a circle with an arc labeled $AB$. If you draw two lines from points $A$ and $B$ to another point $C$ on the circumference, the angle $ACB$ is said to be subtended by the arc $AB$. Now, if you choose another point $D$ on the same side of the arc $AB$ and draw lines $AD$ and $BD$, the angle $ADB$ will equal angle $ACB$. This equality occurs because both angles are subtended by the same arc $AB$ and are located within the same segment of the circle.

This property is particularly useful for solving problems involving circles, as it enables the identification of equal angles and assists in proving other geometric properties. For instance, it can be employed to demonstrate that certain quadrilaterals are cyclic, meaning all their vertices lie on a single circle. Additionally, grasping this property can aid in tackling more complex problems related to tangents, chords, and various other concepts associated with circles.
