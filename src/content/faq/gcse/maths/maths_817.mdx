The exponential decay formula is given by 

$$ 
N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt} 
$$

Exponential decay refers to the process of decreasing an amount by a consistent percentage over time. In this formula, $N(t)$ denotes the quantity at time $t$, $N_0$ represents the initial quantity, $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to $2.71828$), $k$ is the decay constant, and $t$ is the elapsed time.

To clarify each component further:

- **Initial Quantity** ($N_0$): This is the starting amount before any decay occurs.
- **Decay Constant** ($k$): This value indicates the rate at which the quantity decreases. A larger value of $k$ results in a faster decay.
- **Exponential Term** ($e^{-kt}$): This expression illustrates how the quantity decreases exponentially over time. As time $t$ increases, the term $e^{-kt}$ becomes smaller, leading to a decrease in $N(t)$.

For instance, consider a radioactive substance with an initial amount of $100$ grams and a decay constant of $0.1$ per year. To determine how much of the substance remains after $5$ years, you can substitute the values into the formula: 

$$ 
N(5) = 100 e^{-0.1 \times 5} 
$$

Calculating this yields approximately $60.65$ grams remaining after $5$ years.

Understanding the principles of exponential decay is valuable in various real-world applications, including the calculation of the remaining concentration of a drug in the bloodstream, the depreciation of assets, and the cooling of hot objects.
