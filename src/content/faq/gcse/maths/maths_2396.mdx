The equation of the line that has a slope of $2$ and passes through the point $(0, -3)$ can be expressed as:

$$
y = 2x - 3.
$$

To understand how we arrive at this equation, letâ€™s break it down step by step. The general form of a linear equation is 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $m$ represents the slope (or gradient) of the line, and $c$ denotes the y-intercept, which is the point where the line intersects the y-axis.

In this scenario, we have the slope given as $m = 2$ and a specific point on the line, which is $(0, -3)$. Notably, since the x-coordinate is $0$, this point represents the y-intercept. Thus, we can identify that $c = -3$.

Now, substituting the values of $m$ and $c$ into the general equation of the line gives us:

$$
y = 2x + (-3),
$$ 

which simplifies to:

$$
y = 2x - 3.
$$

This equation indicates that for every unit increase in $x$, the value of $y$ increases by $2$ units. Furthermore, when $x = 0$, the value of $y$ is $-3$, which aligns perfectly with the given point $(0, -3)$.

In conclusion, the equation 

$$
y = 2x - 3 
$$ 

accurately describes the line with the specified slope and point of intersection.
