To create a line graph from a data set, follow these steps: label the axes, plot the data points, and connect them with lines.

First, collect your data set, which should consist of pairs of values. These pairs typically illustrate the relationship between two variables, such as time and temperature. Label the horizontal axis (the x-axis) with the independent variable and the vertical axis (the y-axis) with the dependent variable. For instance, if you are plotting temperature against time, then time should be placed on the x-axis, while temperature should be on the y-axis.

Next, establish the scale for each axis. The scale should be selected so that all data points fit comfortably within the graph. For example, if your time data ranges from $0$ to $10$ hours, you might label the x-axis from $0$ to $10$ in increments of $1$ hour. Similarly, if your temperature data spans from $20^\circ C$ to $100^\circ C$, you could label the y-axis from $20$ to $100$ in increments of $10^\circ C$.

Now, plot each pair of values on the graph. For each pair, locate the corresponding position on the x-axis and y-axis, and mark a point where these two values intersect. For example, if one of your data pairs is $(2 \text{ hours}, 50^\circ C)$, find $2$ on the x-axis and $50$ on the y-axis, then place a point at their intersection.

After all points have been plotted, connect them with straight lines in the order of the data points. This will create the line graph, which visually represents the trend or relationship between the two variables. Lastly, ensure that your graph has a descriptive title, such as "Temperature Over Time", to clarify what the graph represents.
