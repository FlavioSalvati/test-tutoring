To calculate the conditional probability of event $ A $ given event $ B $, we use the formula:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.
$$

Conditional probability quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring, assuming that another event has already taken place. In this context, we aim to determine the probability of event $ A $ occurring under the condition that event $ B $ has occurred. The formula $ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} $ provides a systematic approach to finding this probability.

Here’s a breakdown of the components: 

- $ P(A|B) $ denotes the conditional probability of $ A $ given $ B $.
- $ P(A \cap B) $ represents the probability that both events $ A $ and $ B $ occur simultaneously.
- $ P(B) $ is the probability that event $ B $ occurs.

By dividing the probability of both events $ A $ and $ B $ occurring together by the probability of event $ B $, we effectively isolate the probability of $ A $ occurring under the condition that $ B $ has already happened.

For instance, consider a standard deck of 52 playing cards, where we wish to find the probability of drawing an Ace (event $ A $) given that the drawn card is red (event $ B $). In the deck, there are 26 red cards, out of which 2 are Aces (the Ace of Hearts and the Ace of Diamonds). Thus, we have:

- $ P(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{52} $
- $ P(B) = \frac{26}{52} $

Applying the formula, we find:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{2}{52}}{\frac{26}{52}} = \frac{2}{26} = \frac{1}{13}.
$$

Therefore, the probability of drawing an Ace, given that you have drawn a red card, is $ \frac{1}{13} $.
