The expression $1.5 \times 10^3$ in standard numerical form is $1500$.

To grasp why $1.5 \times 10^3$ equals $1500$, we can break it down into simpler components. The notation $10^3$ denotes $10$ raised to the power of $3$, which is a way to express the repeated multiplication of the number $10$. Specifically, $10^3$ can be calculated as follows:

$$
10^3 = 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000.
$$

When you multiply $1.5$ by $1000$, you are effectively shifting the decimal point three places to the right. Thus, $1.5$ becomes $1500$. This shift occurs because multiplying by $10$ moves the decimal point one place to the right, and multiplying by $1000$ (which is equivalent to $10^3$) shifts it three places.

Scientific notation, such as $1.5 \times 10^3$, allows us to express large numbers in a more compact form. This notation is particularly beneficial in fields like science and engineering, where one frequently encounters very large or very small quantities. For students preparing for the GCSE Mathematics exam, mastering the conversion between scientific notation and standard numerical form is an essential skill. It enhances your ability to handle and interpret various types of data effectively.

Therefore, whenever you encounter a number in the format $a \times 10^b$, remember that you are multiplying $a$ by $10$ raised to the power of $b$. This understanding will make it easier for you to convert such expressions back into standard numerical form.
