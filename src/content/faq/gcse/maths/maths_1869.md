To round the number $45.678$ to two decimal places, the result is $45.68$.

When rounding a number to two decimal places, you need to examine the third decimal place. This digit will guide your decision on whether to round up or down. In this instance, the number is $45.678$, and the third decimal place is $8$. According to standard rounding rules, if the digit in the third decimal place is $5$ or greater, you round the second decimal place up by one. Conversely, if it is $4$ or lower, you retain the value of the second decimal place.

Here, since the third decimal place is $8$, which is greater than $5$, you round the second decimal place (currently $7$) up by one. This changes the $7$ to an $8$. Thus, $45.678$ rounded to two decimal places is $45.68$.

Rounding is a valuable skill in both mathematics and everyday situations, as it simplifies numbers and makes them easier to work with. It is essential to follow the correct procedures to ensure accuracy. Always remember to check the digit immediately following the place to which you are rounding, as this will determine whether you round up or down.
