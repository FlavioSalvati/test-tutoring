The median is a measure that represents the middle value of a data set when the values are ordered from smallest to largest.

To determine the median, start by arranging your data in numerical order. If the number of data points is odd, the median is simply the middle number. For instance, consider the data set $3, 5, 7, 9, 11$. Here, the median is $7$ because it is the third number in this five-number set. Conversely, if the number of data points is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers. For example, in the data set $2, 4, 6, 8$, the median can be found by taking the average of $4$ and $6$: 

$$
\text{Median} = \frac{4 + 6}{2} = 5.
$$

The median is a valuable measure of central tendency, particularly because it is not influenced by outliersâ€”extremely high or low values. This characteristic often makes the median a more accurate representation of the typical value in a data set compared to the mean, which can be distorted by such outliers. For instance, in the data set $1, 2, 3, 4, 100$, the median is $3$, which more accurately reflects the central tendency than the mean, which is $22$.

Understanding the median enhances your ability to analyze data distributions. It provides insight into the center of the data, making it especially useful when comparing different data sets. For example, if you are assessing the test scores of two classes, the median score can help you discern which class performed better on average.
