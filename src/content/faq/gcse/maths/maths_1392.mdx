The formula for calculating the area of a triangle using the cosine function is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin(C)
$$

To clarify this formula, let's break it down step by step. In any triangle, you can determine the area if you know the lengths of two sides and the measure of the included angle (the angle formed between those two sides). In this context, $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the two sides, while $C$ denotes the measure of the included angle. The sine function, denoted as $\sin$, relates the angle to the area of the triangle.

Consider a triangle with sides $a$ and $b$, with the angle $C$ between them. The height of the triangle corresponding to the base $a$ can be calculated using trigonometric principles. Specifically, the height $h$ can be expressed as $b \sin(C)$. This relationship arises because, in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side (height) to the length of the hypotenuse (side $b$).

The standard formula for the area of a triangle is:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

By substituting the height $h$ with $b \sin(C)$, we can rewrite the area formula as:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \sin(C)
$$

This formula is particularly advantageous for calculating the area of non-right-angled triangles, where traditional methods involving base and height may not be easily applicable. It empowers you to find the area using only the lengths of two sides and the included angle, making it an invaluable tool in geometry.
