The formula for calculating the population growth rate is given by:

$$ 
\text{Growth Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Births} - \text{Deaths}}{\text{Total Population}} \right) \times 100 
$$

The population growth rate serves as an indicator of how the number of individuals in a population changes over time, whether it increases or decreases. To perform this calculation, you need to gather the number of births and deaths that occurred during a specific time period, as well as the total population at the beginning of that period.

To begin, subtract the number of deaths from the number of births to determine the net increase in population. This result reflects the natural change in the population. Next, divide this net increase by the total population at the start of the period. This division yields a decimal value that represents the growth rate.

To convert the growth rate into a percentage, multiply the decimal by $100$. This percentage provides insight into how much the population has grown or shrunk in relation to its initial size. For instance, if a town has a population of $1,000$, experiences $50$ births, and has $20$ deaths in a year, the growth rate can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
\left( \frac{50 - 20}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 3\% 
$$

Understanding this formula is essential for analyzing population trends, which is vital for effective planning of resources, services, and infrastructure. Additionally, it facilitates the comparison of growth rates across different regions or countries.
