To determine the total price inclusive of an 18% Value Added Tax (VAT) on £85, you can simply multiply £85 by $1.18$.

When you need to apply VAT to a price, a straightforward multiplication method can be used. VAT represents a percentage of the original price, and in this instance, it is $18\%$. To compute the total price that includes VAT, you first convert the percentage into a decimal form.

The decimal equivalent of $18\%$ is $0.18$. To incorporate this into the original price, you add $1$ to the decimal. Therefore, we have:

$$
1 + 0.18 = 1.18
$$

This factor, $1.18$, now represents the original price along with the added VAT.

Next, you will multiply the original price by this factor. For an original price of £85, the calculation is as follows:

$$
£85 \times 1.18 = £100.30
$$

Thus, the total price including $18\%$ VAT amounts to £100.30. This method is applicable for any percentage of VAT; simply convert the percentage into a decimal, add $1$, and multiply by the original price. By using this approach, you can quickly and accurately calculate the total price that includes VAT.
