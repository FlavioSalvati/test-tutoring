To solve the proportion $\frac{3}{4} = \frac{x}{8}$, we will use cross-multiplication followed by division to determine the value of $x$.

First, we apply cross-multiplication. This involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction. Specifically, we multiply $3$ by $8$ and $4$ by $x$. This results in the equation:

$$
3 \cdot 8 = 4 \cdot x.
$$

Simplifying this, we obtain:

$$
24 = 4x.
$$

Next, we need to isolate $x$ to solve for its value. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $4$:

$$
x = \frac{24}{4}.
$$

Calculating this gives us:

$$
x = 6.
$$

In summary, by using cross-multiplication followed by division, we find that $x$ equals $6$. This method is effective for solving any proportion and is a reliable technique for determining an unknown variable in a fraction.
