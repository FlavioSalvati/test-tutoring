To express $95\%$ as a decimal, you can simply write it as $0.95$.

To convert a percentage to a decimal, follow these steps: divide the percentage by $100$. This is because "percent" translates to "per hundred." Thus, $95\%$ equates to $95$ per $100$. When you perform the division $95 \div 100$, the result is $0.95$.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the conversion process:

1. Start with the percentage: $95\%$.
2. Remove the percentage sign: $95$.
3. Divide by $100$: 
   $$ 
   95 \div 100 = 0.95 
   $$

Alternatively, you can think of this conversion as moving the decimal point two places to the left. For instance, if you consider $95.0$ (since $95\%$ can be viewed as $95.0\%$), shifting the decimal point two positions left yields $0.95$.

Understanding how to convert percentages to decimals is a valuable skill across various fields of mathematics, including probability, statistics, and finance. For example, if you have a $95\%$ chance of an event occurring, you can express this probability as $0.95$ in decimal form. Additionally, if you need to calculate $95\%$ of a certain number, you can simply multiply that number by $0.95$.

In summary, converting percentages to decimals is a practical skill that simplifies many calculations and enhances your mathematical intuition.
