To determine the length of a side in a non-right-angled triangle using the cosine rule, you can apply the formula:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)
$$

The cosine rule is particularly advantageous when you know two sides of a triangle and the angle included between them, or when you have all three sides and need to compute an angle. In this formula, $ a $ and $ b $ represent the lengths of the two known sides, $ C $ is the included angle, and $ c $ is the side opposite the angle $ C $ that you wish to find.

For example, consider a triangle with sides $ a = 5 $ cm, $ b = 7 $ cm, and the included angle $ C = 60^\circ $. You can substitute these values into the cosine rule formula. Start by calculating $ \cos(60^\circ) $, which equals $ 0.5 $. The equation now becomes:

$$
c^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 0.5
$$

Next, simplify this expression:

$$
c^2 = 25 + 49 - 35
$$

This results in:

$$
c^2 = 39
$$

Finally, to find the length of side $ c $, take the square root of $ 39 $:

$$
c \approx 6.24 \text{ cm}
$$

It's important to note that the cosine rule can also be rearranged to determine an angle if all three sides of the triangle are known. This versatility makes the cosine rule an essential tool for solving various problems involving non-right-angled triangles.
