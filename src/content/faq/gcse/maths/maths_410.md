The formula for the volume of a cone is given by 

$$ 
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h 
$$ 

To understand this formula more clearly, let's break it down. The volume $V$ of a cone is determined by two essential measurements: the radius $r$ of its circular base and the height $h$ of the cone. The radius is defined as the distance from the center of the base to its edge, while the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the tip, or apex, of the cone.

This volume formula can be further elucidated by comparing it to the volume of a cylinder. A cylinder that shares the same base and height as the cone would have a volume calculated as 

$$ 
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h 
$$ 

Notably, the volume of the cone is exactly one-third of that of the cylinder, which is why we multiply by the factor of $\frac{1}{3}$ in the formula for the cone's volume.

The symbol $\pi$ (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $3.14159$. It represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and is essential in various calculations involving circular shapes.

To apply the formula for the volume of a cone, follow these steps: first, square the radius (which means multiplying the radius by itself), then multiply that result by $\pi$, followed by multiplying by the height. Finally, divide the entire product by $3$. 

For instance, consider a cone with a radius of $3$ cm and a height of $6$ cm. The volume can be calculated as follows:

$$ 
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3^2)(6) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9)(6) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (54) = 18 \pi 
$$ 

Thus, the volume of the cone is $18 \pi$ cubic centimeters. When you multiply by the approximate value of $\pi$, this results in approximately $56.55$ $\text{cm}^{3}$.
