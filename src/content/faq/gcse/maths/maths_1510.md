The relative frequency of drawing a red card 25 times out of a total of 50 draws is $0.5$ or $50\%$.

Relative frequency refers to the proportion of times an event occurs compared to the total number of trials or observations. In this scenario, you have drawn a red card $25$ times out of $50$ total draws. To compute the relative frequency, you divide the number of successful outcomes (in this case, drawing a red card) by the total number of trials (the total draws).

The calculation is as follows:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of Red Cards Drawn}}{\text{Total Number of Draws}} = \frac{25}{50} = 0.5
$$

This indicates that the relative frequency of drawing a red card is $0.5$. To express this value as a percentage, simply multiply by $100$:

$$
0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
$$

Thus, the relative frequency of drawing a red card $25$ times out of $50$ is $50\%$. This implies that, based on your experimental trials, you can expect to draw a red card half the time. 

Relative frequency is particularly useful as it provides insight into the likelihood of an event occurring based on empirical data, rather than relying solely on theoretical probability.
