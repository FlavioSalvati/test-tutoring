To calculate 5% of 150, you simply multiply 150 by 0.05, which results in $7.5$.

To clarify this process, let's first define what a percentage is. A percentage represents a number as a fraction of 100. Therefore, $5\%$ signifies 5 out of every 100. When you aim to find $5\%$ of a number, you're essentially determining 5 parts from the total of 100 parts of that number.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Convert the percentage to a decimal**: To convert $5\%$ to a decimal, divide $5$ by $100$. This yields $0.05$.

2. **Multiply by the number**: Next, take this decimal value ($0.05$) and multiply it by the number you wish to find the percentage of, which in this instance is $150$.

$$
150 \times 0.05 = 7.5
$$

Thus, $5\%$ of $150$ is $7.5$.

Alternatively, you can approach the problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable steps. First, calculate $1\%$ of $150$ by dividing $150$ by $100$, which gives you $1.5$. Then, multiply that result by $5$ to find $5\%$:

$$
1.5 \times 5 = 7.5
$$

Both methods yield the same result. Mastering these steps will enhance your ability to solve a variety of percentage problems with confidence.
