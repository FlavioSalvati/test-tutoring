To multiply three fractions, the process involves multiplying the numerators together and then multiplying the denominators together.

When you multiply fractions, you begin by multiplying the numerators (the top numbers) of each fraction, which results in the numerator of the final product. Next, you multiply the denominators (the bottom numbers) of each fraction, yielding the denominator of the product.

For example, consider the fractions $\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{4}{5}$, and $\frac{3}{7}$. First, you would multiply the numerators: 

$$
2 \times 4 \times 3 = 24.
$$ 

Then, multiply the denominators:

$$
3 \times 5 \times 7 = 105.
$$ 

Thus, the product of these three fractions is 

$$
\frac{24}{105}.
$$ 

It can be beneficial to simplify the fractions before multiplying, when possible. Simplification involves canceling out any common factors present in the numerators and denominators. For instance, if we have the fractions $\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{3}{4}$, and $\frac{4}{5}$, we can simplify before performing the multiplication. 

Notice that the $3$ in the numerator of the second fraction cancels with the $3$ in the denominator of the first fraction. Similarly, the $4$ in the numerator of the third fraction cancels with the $4$ in the denominator of the second fraction. After canceling, we are left with:

$$
\frac{2}{1}, \quad \frac{1}{1}, \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{5}.
$$ 

This simplification streamlines the multiplication process.

In summary, the essential steps are to multiply the numerators together and then multiply the denominators together. Simplifying either before or after the multiplication can facilitate easier calculations and lead to a simpler final answer.
