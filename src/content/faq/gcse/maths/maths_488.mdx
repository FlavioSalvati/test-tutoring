To rotate a shape $270^\circ$ counterclockwise about the origin, you need to swap the coordinates of each point and then change the sign of the new x-coordinate.

When you perform a $270^\circ$ counterclockwise rotation about the origin, you transform each point of the shape individually. For a given point $(x, y)$, the steps are as follows: first, swap the x and y coordinates, and then negate the new x-coordinate. Consequently, the point $(x, y)$ becomes $(y, -x)$.

For instance, consider the point $(3, 4)$. To rotate it $270^\circ$ counterclockwise, you first swap the coordinates to arrive at $(4, 3)$. Next, you change the sign of the new x-coordinate, resulting in the transformed point $(4, -3)$.

This transformation can be applied to any point on the shape. If you have multiple points, simply apply the same procedure to each one. For example, if you have a triangle with vertices at $(1, 2)$, $(3, 4)$, and $(5, 6)$, after rotating these points $270^\circ$ counterclockwise, the new vertices will be $(2, -1)$, $(4, -3)$, and $(6, -5)$, respectively.

It’s important to note that rotating a shape $270^\circ$ counterclockwise is equivalent to rotating it $90^\circ$ clockwise. This relationship can sometimes make it easier to visualize the transformation. Practicing with various points and shapes will enhance your understanding and comfort with these types of rotations.
