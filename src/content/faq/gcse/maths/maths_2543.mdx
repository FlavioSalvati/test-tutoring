The ratio of areas in similar shapes can be expressed as the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

When two shapes are similar, they share equal corresponding angles and proportional corresponding side lengths. This implies that if one shape is a scaled version—either enlarged or reduced—of another, the ratio of any two corresponding side lengths remains consistent. We can denote this ratio of side lengths as $k$.

To determine the ratio of the areas of these similar shapes, we must consider how area scales with side length. When the side lengths of one shape are multiplied by $k$ to derive the side lengths of the second shape, the area of the second shape increases by a factor of $k^2$. This occurs because area is a two-dimensional measurement, and both dimensions (length and width) are scaled by $k$.

For instance, if the ratio of the side lengths of two similar shapes is $3:2$, then the corresponding ratio of their areas will be calculated as $3^2 : 2^2$, which simplifies to $9:4$. This indicates that the area of the larger shape is $\frac{9}{4}$ times that of the smaller shape.

Grasping this concept is essential for tackling problems related to similar shapes, as it enables you to swiftly assess how changes in dimensions influence the overall area. Remember, the fundamental principle is that the area ratio is the square of the side length ratio.
