To determine the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

Consider the points $(0, 0)$ and $(5, 12)$. We can visualize these points on a coordinate grid: the point $(0, 0)$ represents the origin, while the point $(5, 12)$ is located 5 units to the right and 12 units up from the origin. Together, these points form a right-angled triangle with the x-axis and y-axis.

In this triangle, the horizontal leg (along the x-axis) measures $5$ units, and the vertical leg (along the y-axis) measures $12$ units. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse (which represents the distance between the two points) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

We can calculate the distance $d$ as follows:
$$ d = \sqrt{(5^2 + 12^2)} $$

First, we compute the squares of the lengths of the legs:
$$ 5^2 = 25 $$
$$ 12^2 = 144 $$

Next, we add these squares together:
$$ 25 + 144 = 169 $$

Finally, we find the square root of the sum to determine the length of the hypotenuse:
$$ d = \sqrt{169} = 13 $$

Thus, the distance between the points $(0, 0)$ and $(5, 12)$ is $13$ units. This method can be applied to find the distance between any two points on a coordinate plane by substituting their respective coordinates into the Pythagorean theorem.
