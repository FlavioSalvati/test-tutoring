To multiply $2.1 \times 10^3$ by $3 \times 10^2$, we will first handle the coefficients and then the exponents.

When working with numbers in scientific notation, we can break the calculation into two distinct parts: the coefficients (the numerical factors) and the powers of ten. In this case, the coefficients are $2.1$ and $3$, while the powers of ten are $10^3$ and $10^2$.

**Step 1: Multiply the Coefficients**

First, we multiply the coefficients:
$$
2.1 \times 3 = 6.3.
$$

**Step 2: Add the Exponents**

Next, we add the exponents of the powers of ten:
$$
10^3 \times 10^2 = 10^{3 + 2} = 10^5.
$$

**Final Result: Combine the Results**

Now, we combine the results from both steps:
$$
6.3 \times 10^5.
$$

Therefore, $2.1 \times 10^3$ multiplied by $3 \times 10^2$ results in $6.3 \times 10^5$. 

This method is effective due to the properties of exponents and the distributive property of multiplication over addition. By separating the coefficients from the powers of ten, we simplify the calculations and enhance accuracy.
