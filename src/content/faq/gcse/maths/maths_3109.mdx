To calculate cumulative frequency from a histogram, you need to sequentially add the frequencies of each class interval.

A histogram is a specific type of bar chart that illustrates the frequency of data within defined intervals, known as class intervals or bins. To determine the cumulative frequency, follow a step-by-step approach to sum the frequencies of these class intervals.

Begin with the first class interval on the histogram. The frequency of this interval becomes your initial cumulative frequency. For the subsequent class intervals, add the frequency of each to the cumulative frequency of the previous interval. This process continues for each interval, effectively accumulating the frequency from all prior intervals.

For instance, consider a histogram with class intervals that have the following frequencies: $5$, $7$, $3$, and $10$. The calculation of cumulative frequency would proceed as follows:

- The first interval has a frequency of $5$, so the cumulative frequency is $5$.
- The second interval has a frequency of $7$. Adding this to the previous cumulative frequency ($5$) gives a new cumulative frequency of $12$.
- The third interval has a frequency of $3$. Adding this to the prior cumulative frequency ($12$) results in a cumulative frequency of $15$.
- The fourth interval has a frequency of $10$. Adding this to the previous cumulative frequency ($15$) yields a final cumulative frequency of $25$.

After completing this process, you will have a cumulative frequency for each class interval, which aids in understanding the distribution of data across the intervals.
