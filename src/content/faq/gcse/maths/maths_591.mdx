To create a box plot, you need to determine five key summary statistics from your data set: the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and maximum.

Begin by organizing your data in ascending order. This simplifies the process of identifying the essential values required for the box plot. The minimum and maximum values are defined as the smallest and largest numbers in your data set, respectively.

Next, calculate the median, which represents the middle value of your ordered data. If the number of data points is odd, the median is the value at the center position. Conversely, if there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two central values.

Following this, determine the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3). The lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of your data set, excluding the overall median if the total number of data points is odd. Similarly, the upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of your data set.

Once you have identified these five critical values—minimum, $Q_1$, median, $Q_3$, and maximum—you can construct your box plot. Start by drawing a number line that encompasses the range of your data. Above this line, create a box that extends from $Q_1$ to $Q_3$. Inside the box, draw a line indicating the median.

Finally, add "whiskers" to the plot: extend one whisker from the minimum value to $Q_1$ and the other from $Q_3$ to the maximum value.

This graphical representation provides a clear visual summary of the distribution and central tendency of your data, allowing you to quickly assess the spread and identify any potential outliers.
