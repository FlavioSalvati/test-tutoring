The range of a data set represents the difference between its highest and lowest values. 

It serves as a straightforward measure of how spread out the values are within the data set. To compute the range, you simply subtract the smallest value from the largest value. For instance, consider a data set of exam scores: $55$, $67$, $72$, $88$, and $91$. The range in this case would be calculated as:

$$
\text{Range} = 91 - 55 = 36.
$$

This indicates that the scores span a range of $36$ marks.

Understanding the range provides a quick insight into the variability of your data. A larger range suggests that the data points are more dispersed, which may reflect greater variability or diversity within the data. Conversely, a smaller range implies that the data points are more closely clustered together, indicating less variability.

However, it's important to note the limitations of the range. It only takes into account the two extreme values— the maximum and minimum— and overlooks all the other data points. This characteristic makes the range susceptible to the influence of outliers, which are values that are significantly higher or lower than the rest. For example, if one student scored $100$ on the exam while the others scored between $55$ and $72$, the range would be:

$$
\text{Range} = 100 - 55 = 45,
$$

which could give a misleading impression of the overall spread of the scores.

In conclusion, while the range is a useful initial metric for gauging the spread of data, it is often beneficial to complement it with additional measures, such as the interquartile range or standard deviation, for a more thorough analysis.
