The equation representing the sum of the variable $ x $ and the constant 5 is given by:

$$ x + 5 $$

In mathematics, an equation is a statement that indicates the equality of two expressions. When we refer to the sum of $ x $ and 5, we are simply adding the variable $ x $ to the fixed number 5. This relationship can be expressed as:

$$ x + 5 $$

In this equation, $ x $ represents an unknown value that can vary, while 5 remains a constant.

To clarify this concept further, let's analyze it in more detail. The variable $ x $ can assume any numerical value. For instance, if $ x $ is equal to 3, then the sum of $ x $ and 5 would be:

$$ 3 + 5 = 8 $$

Conversely, if $ x $ were -2, the sum would be:

$$ -2 + 5 = 3 $$

Thus, the equation $ x + 5 $ serves as a general expression applicable to any value of $ x $.

In GCSE Mathematics, mastering the formation and manipulation of equations is essential. Equations such as $ x + 5 $ form a foundational aspect of algebra, as they enable you to solve problems where the value of an unknown variable must be determined. For example, if you have the equation:

$$ x + 5 = 10 $$

you can isolate $ x $ by subtracting 5 from both sides, resulting in:

$$ x = 10 - 5 $$

which simplifies to:

$$ x = 5 $$

Equations act as valuable tools for modeling real-world situations and systematically solving problems. By practicing with simple equations like $ x + 5 $, you develop the essential skills necessary to tackle more complex mathematical challenges.
