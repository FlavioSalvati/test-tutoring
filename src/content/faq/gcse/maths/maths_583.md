To calculate the variance of a data set, you need to determine the average of the squared differences from the mean.

**Step 1: Calculate the Mean**

First, find the mean (average) of your data set. To do this, sum all the numbers in the data set and then divide by the total number of data points. For example, consider the data set consisting of the numbers $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and $10$. The sum of these numbers is:

$$
2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
$$

Next, divide this sum by the number of data points, which is $5$ in this case:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
$$

**Step 2: Calculate the Differences from the Mean**

Next, subtract the mean from each data point to find the difference for each one. Using the calculated mean of $6$, the differences are computed as follows:

- For $2$: $2 - 6 = -4$
- For $4$: $4 - 6 = -2$
- For $6$: $6 - 6 = 0$
- For $8$: $8 - 6 = 2$
- For $10$: $10 - 6 = 4$

Thus, the differences are $-4$, $-2$, $0$, $2$, and $4$.

**Step 3: Square the Differences**

Next, square each of these differences to eliminate any negative signs and to give more weight to larger differences. The squared differences are as follows:

- For $-4$: $(-4)^2 = 16$
- For $-2$: $(-2)^2 = 4$
- For $0$: $0^2 = 0$
- For $2$: $2^2 = 4$
- For $4$: $4^2 = 16$

Thus, the squared differences are $16$, $4$, $0$, $4$, and $16$.

**Step 4: Calculate the Variance**

Finally, find the average of these squared differences. First, sum the squared differences:

$$
16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 40
$$

Next, divide this sum by the number of data points, which remains $5$:

$$
\text{Variance} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
$$

In summary, the variance of the data set $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and $10$ is $8$. This value indicates the degree to which the numbers in your data set are spread out around the mean.
