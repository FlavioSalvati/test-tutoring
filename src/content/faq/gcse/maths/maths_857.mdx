The value of the expression $(3^2)^3$ is equal to 729.

To understand why $(3^2)^3$ results in 729, let's break it down step by step. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is $3^2$. This means raising 3 to the power of 2, or performing the multiplication:

$$3^2 = 3 \times 3 = 9$$

Next, we take this result and raise it to the power of 3. Thus, we need to calculate $9^3$, which involves multiplying 9 by itself three times:

$$9^3 = 9 \times 9 \times 9$$

Now, let's perform this calculation step by step. First, we multiply 9 by 9:

$$9 \times 9 = 81$$

Next, we take the result, 81, and multiply it by 9 again:

$$81 \times 9 = 729$$

Therefore, we conclude that $(3^2)^3 = 729$.

In mathematical terms, when you encounter an expression like $(a^m)^n$, you can simplify it by multiplying the exponents: $a^{m \times n}$. In this scenario, we have $a = 3$, $m = 2$, and $n = 3$. Consequently, we can simplify $(3^2)^3$ to $3^{2 \times 3}$, which equals $3^6$. Calculating $3^6$ directly yields:

$$3^6 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 729$$

Thus, whether we break it down step by step or apply the exponent rule, we find that the value of $(3^2)^3$ is indeed 729.
