To determine the relative frequency of obtaining heads in $100$ coin flips, you need to divide the number of heads observed by the total number of flips, which is $100$.

Relative frequency is a statistical concept that illustrates how often an event occurs in relation to the total number of trials conducted. In this scenario, you will flip a coin $100$ times and aim to find out how frequently it lands on heads. First, you should perform the $100$ flips and tally the number of times you get heads. For example, let's assume you observe heads $55$ times out of the $100$ flips.

To calculate the relative frequency, you take the number of heads observed ($55$) and divide it by the total number of flips ($100$). Therefore, the relative frequency of getting heads can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{55}{100} = 0.55.
$$

This means that heads appeared $55\%$ of the time during your $100$ flips.

Relative frequency is particularly useful because it provides insight into the likelihood of an event occurring based on experimental data. For a fair coin, you would theoretically expect heads to appear $50\%$ of the time, or a relative frequency of $0.50$. However, in practice, the observed relative frequency may vary slightly due to random fluctuations. By conducting more trials, the relative frequency is likely to converge towards the theoretical probability.
