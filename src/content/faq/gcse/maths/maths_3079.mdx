A frequency table displays individual data counts, while a cumulative frequency table presents a running total of these frequencies.

In a frequency table, each unique data value or range of values is listed alongside the number of times it occurs. For instance, if you surveyed students about their favorite fruit, the frequency table might indicate how many students selected apples, bananas, oranges, and so forth. This table provides a quick visual representation of the data distribution.

Conversely, a cumulative frequency table builds upon the frequency table by adding a running total of the frequencies. To create this table, you start with the initial frequency and progressively add each subsequent frequency to the total. For example, if $5$ students chose apples, $7$ chose bananas, and $3$ chose oranges, the cumulative frequencies would be as follows: for apples, it would be $5$; for bananas, it would be $5 + 7 = 12$; and for oranges, it would be $12 + 3 = 15$. This cumulative approach allows you to observe how the data accumulates over different intervals, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns.

Cumulative frequency tables are particularly valuable when determining medians, quartiles, or percentiles, as they illustrate how data aggregates across various ranges. For instance, if you wish to find out how many students preferred a fruit that is less popular than bananas, you can quickly ascertain that $5$ students chose apples by referring to the cumulative frequency for that fruit. This feature makes cumulative frequency tables a powerful tool for in-depth data analysis.
