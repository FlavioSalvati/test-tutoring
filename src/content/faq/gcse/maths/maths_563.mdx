Data can be categorized into two main types: discrete and continuous. 

**Discrete data** consists of distinct and separate values that are countable. This type of data typically involves whole numbers. For instance, the number of students in a classroom is considered discrete because each student can be counted individually, and it is impossible to have a fraction of a student. Other examples of discrete data include:

- The number of cars in a parking lot
- The number of books on a shelf
- The number of goals scored in a football match

Discrete data is often visually represented using bar charts or pie charts.

In contrast, **continuous data** can assume any value within a specified range and is generally measured rather than counted. For example, the height of students in a classroom is a continuous variable because it can take any value within a range, such as $150.5 \, \text{cm}$ or $160.2 \, \text{cm}$. Other examples of continuous data include:

- Temperature
- Time
- Weight

Continuous data is typically represented using histograms or line graphs.

To determine whether data is discrete or continuous, consider whether the data can be counted in whole numbers (indicating it is discrete) or if it can take any value within a range (indicating it is continuous). This distinction is crucial for selecting the appropriate methods for data analysis and visualization.
