To determine the value of $ x $ in the equation 

$$ \frac{x}{3} + 2 = 5, $$ 

we will solve the equation step by step, aiming to isolate $ x $ on one side.

### Step 1: Eliminate the Constant Term

First, we need to remove the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $ 2 $ from both sides:

$$ \frac{x}{3} + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2. $$

This simplifies to:

$$ \frac{x}{3} = 3. $$

### Step 2: Clear the Fraction

Next, we will eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by $ 3 $:

$$ 3 \times \frac{x}{3} = 3 \times 3. $$

This simplifies to:

$$ x = 9. $$

### Conclusion

Thus, the value of $ x $ is $ 9 $. 

This method of solving equations by isolating the variable and using inverse operations is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths. It is essential to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain balance and ensure that the equality remains valid.
