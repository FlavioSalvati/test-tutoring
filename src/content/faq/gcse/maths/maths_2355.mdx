The gradient of the line that passes through the points $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$ is $2$.

To determine the gradient of a line, we utilize the formula:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}
$$

This formula allows us to measure how much the $y$-coordinate changes for a given change in the $x$-coordinate between two points along the line.

For the points $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$, we identify the coordinates as follows: $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (3, 6)$. We begin by calculating the change in $y$, which is given by:

$$
y_2 - y_1 = 6 - 2 = 4
$$

Next, we calculate the change in $x$:

$$
x_2 - x_1 = 3 - 1 = 2
$$

Now, we can substitute these values into the gradient formula:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

Thus, the gradient of the line is $2$.

This indicates that for every unit increase in the $x$-coordinate, the $y$-coordinate increases by $2$ units. The gradient provides insight into the steepness of the line; a gradient of $2$ signifies a relatively steep incline. Understanding how to calculate and interpret the gradient is essential in GCSE Maths, as it aids in graphing linear equations and analyzing the relationship between variables.
