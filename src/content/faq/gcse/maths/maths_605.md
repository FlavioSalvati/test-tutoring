To create a scatter plot, you need to plot each pair of data points on a graph that features both an x-axis and a y-axis.

**Step 1: Gather Your Data Set**  
Begin by collecting your data, which should consist of pairs of values commonly represented as $(x, y)$. Here, $x$ denotes the value on the horizontal axis (x-axis), and $y$ represents the value on the vertical axis (y-axis). For instance, if your data pertains to the number of hours studied and the corresponding test scores, the 'hours studied' will correspond to your $x$-values, while the 'test scores' will be your $y$-values.

**Step 2: Draw the Axes**  
Next, use graph paper or graphing software to draw your axes. Label the x-axis with the variable that represents your $x$-values and the y-axis with the variable corresponding to your $y$-values. Ensure that both axes include a scale that adequately covers the range of your data points.

**Step 3: Plot the Data Points**  
Now, plot each pair of data points on the graph. For each pair $(x, y)$, identify the position on the x-axis that corresponds to the $x$-value and the position on the y-axis that corresponds to the $y$-value. Place a dot at the intersection of these two positions on the graph.

**Step 4: Analyze the Scatter Plot**  
After plotting all the points, you can analyze the scatter plot for insights. Look for patterns or trends within the data. For example, if the points generally rise from left to right, this indicates a positive correlation between the variables. Conversely, if the points trend downward from left to right, this suggests a negative correlation. If the points appear randomly distributed, it may indicate no correlation.

Scatter plots are valuable tools for visualizing the relationship between two variables, as they can help identify trends, clusters, and outliers in your data.
