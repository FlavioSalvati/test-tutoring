To simplify the expression $\frac{x^3}{x^{-2}}$, you can apply the rule of exponents that allows you to subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator.

When dealing with a fraction that has the same base in both the numerator and the denominator, the laws of exponents state that:

$$
\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}
$$

In this particular case, the base is $x$. The exponent in the numerator is $3$, while the exponent in the denominator is $-2$. Therefore, you will subtract $-2$ from $3$:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x^{-2}} = x^{3 - (-2)}
$$

Remember that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart. Thus, we have:

$$
3 - (-2) = 3 + 2 = 5
$$

Consequently, we find that:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x^{-2}} = x^5
$$

Thus, the simplified form of $\frac{x^3}{x^{-2}}$ is $x^5$. This approach is applicable to any similar problems involving the division of powers with the same base. Just remember to subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator.
