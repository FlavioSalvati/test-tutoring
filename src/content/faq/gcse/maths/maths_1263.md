To calculate the area of a compound shape that consists of a rectangle and a semicircle, you need to combine the areas of both individual shapes.

First, let's clarify what a compound shape is. A compound shape is formed by two or more simple geometric shapes. In our case, these shapes are a rectangle and a semicircle. To find the total area, we will compute the area of each shape separately and then sum them.

**Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle.**

The area of a rectangle can be determined using the formula:

$$
\text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
$$

Ensure you have the measurements for both the length and the width of the rectangle. Multiply these two values together to obtain the area of the rectangle.

**Step 2: Calculate the area of the semicircle.**

The area of a full circle is given by the formula:

$$
\text{Area of circle} = \pi \times r^2
$$

where $ r $ is the radius of the circle. Since we are working with a semicircle, we must take half of the area of a full circle:

$$
\text{Area of semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi \times r^2
$$

Make sure you determine the radius of the semicircle, which is half of the diameter. Substitute this radius into the formula to calculate the area of the semicircle.

**Step 3: Combine the areas to find the total area of the compound shape.**

Finally, to find the total area of the compound shape, add the area of the rectangle to the area of the semicircle:

$$
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of rectangle} + \text{Area of semicircle}
$$

By following these steps, you can accurately determine the area of a compound shape that includes a rectangle and a semicircle.
