The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by the equation $ y = 4x - 1 $ is $ -\frac{1}{4} $.

To grasp this concept, let's first examine the gradient of the original line. The equation $ y = 4x - 1 $ is expressed in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the gradient. In this case, the gradient $ m $ is equal to $ 4 $.

A fundamental principle in coordinate geometry states that if two lines are perpendicular, the product of their gradients must equal $ -1 $. Thus, if the gradient of one line is $ m $, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to it can be calculated as $ -\frac{1}{m} $.

Given that the gradient of the line in question is $ 4 $, we can determine the gradient of the perpendicular line by taking the negative reciprocal of $ 4 $. The reciprocal of $ 4 $ is $ \frac{1}{4} $, and therefore, the negative reciprocal is $ -\frac{1}{4} $.

Consequently, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to $ y = 4x - 1 $ is $ -\frac{1}{4} $. This indicates that for every $ 4 $ units the perpendicular line moves horizontally, it descends by $ 1 $ unit vertically. Understanding this relationship is crucial for solving various problems related to perpendicular lines in coordinate geometry.
