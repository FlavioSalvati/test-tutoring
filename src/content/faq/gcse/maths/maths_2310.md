The domain of the function $ f(x) = x^2 - 1 $ encompasses all real numbers.

To determine the domain of a function, we must identify all possible values of $ x $ that can be input into the function without leading to any mathematical complications. For the function $ f(x) = x^2 - 1 $, we should examine whether there are any values of $ x $ that would render the function undefined.

In this case, $ f(x) = x^2 - 1 $ is a polynomial function. Polynomial functions are defined for all real numbers, since squaring any real number and subsequently subtracting 1 does not introduce any issues. Unlike certain other types of functions, there are no restrictions such as division by zero or taking the square root of a negative number, which can limit their domains.

Consequently, since there are no values of $ x $ that would result in $ f(x) $ being undefined, we conclude that the domain of $ f(x) = x^2 - 1 $ is all real numbers. In mathematical notation, this is expressed as 

$$
(-\infty, \infty)
$$ 

indicating that $ x $ can take any value from negative infinity to positive infinity.
