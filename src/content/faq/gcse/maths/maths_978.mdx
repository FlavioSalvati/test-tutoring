The slope of the equation $ y = 7x + 1 $ is $ 7 $.

To determine the slope of a linear equation in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, one must identify the coefficient of $ x $. In the equation $ y = 7x + 1 $, this coefficient, denoted by $ m $, is $ 7 $. The slope represents the steepness of the line and its direction: a positive slope indicates that the line rises as it moves from left to right, while a negative slope signifies a decline.

In this scenario, the slope is $ 7 $, which means that for every $ 1 $ unit you move to the right along the $ x $-axis, the value of $ y $ increases by $ 7 $ units. This steep positive slope suggests a rapid increase in $ y $ as $ x $ increases. Comprehending the slope is essential for accurately graphing the line and analyzing how variations in $ x $ influence $ y $.
