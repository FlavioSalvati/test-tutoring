The midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 4)$ is $(1, 2)$.

To determine the midpoint of a line segment, we utilize the midpoint formula, which is given by:

$$
\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the endpoints of the segment. For our example, the endpoints are $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 4)$.

First, we will calculate the x-coordinate of the midpoint. We add the x-coordinates of the endpoints:

$$
0 + 2 = 2
$$

Next, we divide this sum by $2$:

$$
\frac{2}{2} = 1
$$

Thus, the x-coordinate of the midpoint is $1$.

Now, we proceed to find the y-coordinate of the midpoint. We add the y-coordinates of the endpoints:

$$
0 + 4 = 4
$$

We then divide this sum by $2$:

$$
\frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

Consequently, the y-coordinate of the midpoint is $2$.

Therefore, the coordinates of the midpoint are $(1, 2)$. This indicates that the point $(1, 2)$ is precisely halfway between $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 4)$ along the line segment. This method can be applied to any pair of points to calculate the midpoint, making it an invaluable tool in geometry.
