Here is the enhanced content with improved clarity and readability:

The expression $ 6k - 2k - 4 $ can be simplified to $ 4k - 4 $.

To simplify the expression $ 6k - 2k - 4 $, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are those that share the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, $ 6k $ and $ -2k $ are like terms because both include the variable $ k $.

First, we combine the coefficients of the like terms. The coefficient of $ 6k $ is $ 6 $, and the coefficient of $ -2k $ is $ -2 $. When we subtract $ 2k $ from $ 6k $, we perform the operation:

$$
6 - 2 = 4
$$

Thus, $ 6k - 2k $ simplifies to $ 4k $.

The constant term, $ -4 $, does not contain a variable, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the simplified expression is:

$$
4k - 4
$$

This process of combining like terms is a fundamental skill in algebra, as it helps to make expressions more manageable and easier to understand.
