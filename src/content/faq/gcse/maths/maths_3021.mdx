When two data sets exhibit the same range, it indicates that the difference between their highest and lowest values is identical.

The range of a data set serves as a measure of the dispersion of its values. To calculate the range, you subtract the smallest value from the largest value within the data set. For example, consider a data set with values that span from $2$ to $10$. The range can be determined as follows:

$$
\text{Range} = 10 - 2 = 8.
$$

Similarly, if another data set has values that extend from $5$ to $13$, its range is also:

$$
\text{Range} = 13 - 5 = 8.
$$

However, having the same range does not imply that the data sets are identical or even similar in other aspects. They may differ significantly in terms of their means (averages), medians (middle values), or modes (most frequently occurring values). For instance, one data set could be closely clustered around its mean, while another might be more dispersed, yet both can still share the same range.

In conclusion, the range is merely one characteristic used to describe a data set. It provides insight into the spread of the data but does not convey information about its shape or central tendency. Thus, while two data sets with the same range share a particular feature, they can still have substantial differences in other respects.
