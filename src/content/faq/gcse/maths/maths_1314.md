The length of the hypotenuse is $5 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, we apply Pythagoras' Theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

In this equation, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides.

In our example, the lengths of the legs are $3 \, \text{cm}$ and $4 \, \text{cm}$. By substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
3^2 + 4^2 = c^2
$$

Calculating the squares, we find:

$$
9 + 16 = c^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
25 = c^2
$$

To solve for $c$, we take the square root of both sides:

$$
c = \sqrt{25}
$$

This results in:

$$
c = 5
$$

Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is $5 \, \text{cm}$. Understanding and applying Pythagoras' Theorem is essential in GCSE Mathematics, as it provides a reliable method for solving problems related to right-angled triangles. It is important to remember that Pythagoras' Theorem is applicable only to right-angled triangles, so always verify that a right angle is present before using this theorem.
