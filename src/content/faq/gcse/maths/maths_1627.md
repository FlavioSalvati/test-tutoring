To determine the upper quartile in a box plot, focus on the right edge of the box.

A box plot, also referred to as a box-and-whisker plot, serves as a graphical representation of a data set, illustrating its distribution. In this plot, the box itself represents the interquartile range (IQR), which encompasses the middle 50% of the data. The left edge of the box indicates the lower quartile, denoted as $Q_1$, while the line within the box signifies the median, or $Q_2$. The right edge of the box marks the upper quartile, referred to as $Q_3$.

The upper quartile, $Q_3$, is the value below which 75% of the data falls. To identify $Q_3$, simply observe the right edge of the box in the plot. This value effectively divides the highest 25% of the data from the remainder. The whiskers extending from the box illustrate the range of the data, excluding outliers, which are typically represented as individual points.

Understanding how to interpret a box plot is essential for analyzing data distributions, as it provides a clear visual summary of the data's spread and central tendency. By identifying the upper quartile, you can gain valuable insights into the upper range of the data set and its relationship with the median and lower quartile.
