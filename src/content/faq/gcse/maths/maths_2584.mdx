To determine the measure of the interior angles in a regular heptagon, we can use the formula 

$$
\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
$$ 

where $ n $ represents the number of sides of the polygon.

A heptagon is defined as a seven-sided polygon. In the case of a regular heptagon, all sides and angles are congruent. To find the measure of each interior angle, we first need to calculate the sum of all the interior angles of the heptagon. The formula for the sum of the interior angles of any polygon is 

$$
(n-2) \times 180^\circ 
$$ 

where $ n $ is the number of sides. For a heptagon, we have $ n = 7 $.

By substituting $ 7 $ into the formula, we can compute the sum of the interior angles:

$$
(7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
$$ 

This indicates that the total sum of all the interior angles in a heptagon is $ 900^\circ $.

Since a regular heptagon has equal interior angles, we can find the measure of each angle by dividing the total sum by the number of angles (which is the same as the number of sides, $ 7 $):

$$
\frac{900^\circ}{7} \approx 128.57^\circ
$$ 

Consequently, each interior angle in a regular heptagon measures approximately $ 128.57^\circ $. This approach can be applied to any regular polygon by substituting the correct number of sides into the formulas provided.
