The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism is given by the expression:

$$
V = l \times w \times h
$$

where $ V $ represents the volume, $ l $ denotes the length, $ w $ stands for the width, and $ h $ indicates the height.

A rectangular prism, commonly referred to as a cuboid, is a three-dimensional geometric figure characterized by six rectangular faces. To determine the volume of a rectangular prism, you multiply its three dimensions: length, width, and height. 

Consider a box as an example. The length represents how long the box is, the width indicates how wide it is, and the height reflects how tall it is. By multiplying these three measurements together, you essentially calculate the total number of unit cubes that can fit within the box. For instance, if the length is $5 \, \text{cm}$, the width is $3 \, \text{cm}$, and the height is $4 \, \text{cm}$, the volume can be computed as:

$$
V = 5 \times 3 \times 4 = 60 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

This formula is highly practical in everyday scenarios, such as determining the capacity of a storage container or assessing how much liquid a tank can accommodate. It is important to remember that the units of volume will be expressed in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters ($\text{cm}^3$), cubic meters ($\text{m}^3$), or cubic inches ($\text{in}^3$), depending on the units used for each dimension.

Grasping this formula is a fundamental aspect of geometry and serves as a foundation for understanding more complex mathematical concepts. Therefore, the next time you encounter a box, you can effortlessly calculate its volume using this straightforward yet powerful formula!
