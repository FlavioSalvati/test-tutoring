To find the perimeter of a compound shape, you need to sum the lengths of all its outer sides.

A compound shape, also referred to as a composite shape, consists of two or more simple geometric figures. To calculate its perimeter, you must first identify and measure the lengths of all the outer edges. Begin by decomposing the compound shape into its simpler components, which could include rectangles, triangles, or circles. Carefully trace the outline of the entire shape, ensuring that you account for every segment that forms the outer boundary.

For instance, consider a compound shape made up of a rectangle and a semicircle attached to one of its sides. To find its perimeter, you would first measure the perimeter of the rectangle. This is done by adding the lengths of all four sides. Next, you need to measure the curved edge of the semicircle, which represents half the circumference of a full circle. The formula for the perimeter of the semicircle is given by:

$$
\text{Semicircle perimeter} = \frac{\pi d}{2}
$$

where $d$ is the diameter of the semicircle. Additionally, remember to include the straight edge of the semicircle that lies along the rectangle.

Once you have gathered all the individual measurements, simply add them together to obtain the total perimeter. Be cautious not to include any internal edges that do not contribute to the outer boundary. It is advisable to double-check your measurements and calculations to ensure accuracy. This systematic approach can be applied to any compound shape, regardless of its complexity, by breaking it down into simpler parts and summing the lengths of its outer sides.
