The base of an exponential function plays a critical role in determining the rate of growth or decay of the function's value.

In an exponential function expressed in the form $$ f(x) = a \cdot b^x $$, the base $ b $ is a key element. If $ b > 1 $, the function exhibits exponential growth, meaning that the value of $ f(x) $ increases rapidly as $ x $ rises. For instance, if $ b = 2 $, the function's value doubles for every unit increase in $ x $. This phenomenon is frequently observed in real-world situations such as population growth and compound interest.

On the other hand, if $ 0 < b < 1 $, the function indicates exponential decay, where the value of $ f(x) $ diminishes as $ x $ increases. For example, if $ b = 0.5 $, the function's value halves with each unit increase in $ x $. This type of function is commonly encountered in scenarios such as radioactive decay or the depreciation of assets.

The base also influences the steepness of the curve. A larger base leads to a steeper growth curve, while a smaller base (still greater than $ 1 $) results in a gentler slope. In the case of decay functions, a base that is closer to $ 1 $ corresponds to a slower rate of decay, whereas a base that approaches $ 0 $ results in a more rapid decline.

Grasping the significance of the base is essential for analyzing and predicting the behavior of exponential functions across various contexts, making it a fundamental concept in GCSE Mathematics.
