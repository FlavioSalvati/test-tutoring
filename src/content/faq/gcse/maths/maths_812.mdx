The half-life in exponential decay refers to the time required for a quantity to diminish to half of its initial value.

To elaborate, the concept of half-life is essential for comprehending how substances decay over time. Consider a specific amount of a radioactive substance. The half-life is the interval needed for half of that substance to decay or transform into another form. For instance, if you begin with $100$ grams of a substance that has a half-life of $5$ years, after $5$ years, only $50$ grams would remain. After an additional $5$ years (for a total of $10$ years), only $25$ grams would be left, and this pattern continues.

Mathematically, exponential decay can be represented by the formula 

$$ 
N(t) = N_0 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/T} 
$$ 

where $N(t)$ is the amount remaining after time $t$, $N_0$ is the initial quantity, and $T$ is the half-life. This formula illustrates how the quantity decreases by half for every $T$ time units.

Understanding half-life is significant not only in physics and chemistry but also in various practical applications. For example, in medicine, the half-life of a drug influences how often a patient needs to take their medication. In archaeology, the half-life of carbon-14 is utilized in radiocarbon dating to estimate the age of ancient artifacts.

By grasping the concept of half-life, you can gain insights into the processes of decay and growth in both natural and scientific contexts, making it a fundamental topic in GCSE Maths and Science.
