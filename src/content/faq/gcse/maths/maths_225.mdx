The zeros of the function $ y = x^3 - 3x $ are located at $ x = -\sqrt{3} $, $ x = 0 $, and $ x = \sqrt{3} $.

To find the zeros of the function graphically, we look for the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. These intersection points correspond to the values of $ x $ for which $ y $ equals zero. Thus, we need to solve the equation:

$$ x^3 - 3x = 0 $$

We can start by factoring the equation:

$$ x^3 - 3x = x(x^2 - 3) = 0 $$

This factorization gives us two components to consider: $ x = 0 $ and $ x^2 - 3 = 0 $. To solve the second equation, we take the square root of both sides:

$$ x^2 = 3 $$
$$ x = \pm\sqrt{3} $$

Therefore, the complete set of solutions is $ x = -\sqrt{3} $, $ x = 0 $, and $ x = \sqrt{3} $. These points indicate where the graph of $ y = x^3 - 3x $ intersects the x-axis.

When you plot the graph of $ y = x^3 - 3x $, you will observe that it intersects the x-axis at these three points. The graph exhibits the characteristic shape of a cubic function, featuring a local maximum and a local minimum. It crosses the x-axis at $ x = -\sqrt{3} $, $ x = 0 $, and $ x = \sqrt{3} $. This visual representation serves to confirm the zeros we derived through algebraic methods.
