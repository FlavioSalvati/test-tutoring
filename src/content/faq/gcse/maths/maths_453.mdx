To sketch the graph of the function $ y = \sin(x) $, begin by plotting key points and then connect them with a smooth, continuous curve.

First, itâ€™s important to understand that the sine function is periodic, which means it repeats its pattern every $ 2\pi $ radians (or 360 degrees). The fundamental shape of the sine wave starts at the origin $(0,0)$, rises to a maximum value of $ 1 $ at $ \frac{\pi}{2} $ radians (90 degrees), returns to $ 0 $ at $ \pi $ radians (180 degrees), drops to a minimum value of $ -1 $ at $ \frac{3\pi}{2} $ radians (270 degrees), and finally returns to $ 0 $ at $ 2\pi $ radians (360 degrees).

To begin sketching the graph, draw the $ x $-axis and $ y $-axis. On the $ x $-axis, mark the following key points: $ 0 $, $ \frac{\pi}{2} $, $ \pi $, $ \frac{3\pi}{2} $, and $ 2\pi $. On the $ y $-axis, indicate the maximum value $ 1 $ and the minimum value $ -1 $, which correspond to the peak and trough of the sine function, respectively.

Next, plot the key points corresponding to one complete cycle of the sine wave: 
- $(0,0)$
- $\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, 1\right)$
- $(\pi, 0)$
- $\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, -1\right)$
- $(2\pi, 0)$

With these points plotted, draw a smooth, continuous curve that connects them. The curve should start at the origin, rise to the peak at $ \frac{\pi}{2} $, fall back to zero at $ \pi $, descend to the trough at $ \frac{3\pi}{2} $, and return to zero at $ 2\pi $.

Keep in mind that the sine wave extends infinitely in both directions. Therefore, you can continue to replicate this pattern to the left and right as needed. The resulting wave should be smooth and continuous, exhibiting no sharp corners or breaks.
