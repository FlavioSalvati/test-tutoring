The relative frequency of selecting a blue ball, which occurred 40 times out of 200 trials, is $0.2$, or $20\%$.

Relative frequency quantifies how often a specific event occurs compared to the total number of trials or observations. In this scenario, you picked a blue ball $40$ times from a total of $200$ picks. To compute the relative frequency, you divide the number of successful outcomes (the instances of picking a blue ball) by the total number of trials (the overall picks).

The calculation is as follows:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Trials}} = \frac{40}{200}
$$

When you divide $40$ by $200$, the result is $0.2$. To express this as a percentage, multiply by $100$, resulting in $20\%$. Thus, the relative frequency of picking a blue ball is $0.2$ or $20\%$.

Relative frequency is particularly valuable as it offers insight into the likelihood of an event occurring based on empirical data. This approach is especially useful in practical scenarios where theoretical probabilities may be difficult to ascertain. For instance, in the context of experiments or surveys, relative frequency enables a clearer understanding of results and helps interpret findings in a meaningful way.
