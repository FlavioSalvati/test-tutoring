The standard form of the number $123,000$ is represented as 

$$ 
1.23 \times 10^5. 
$$ 

Standard form, often referred to as scientific notation, provides a concise method for expressing very large or very small numbers. This format is especially beneficial in fields such as science and engineering, where such numbers are commonly encountered. In standard form, a number is expressed as the product of a coefficient (a number between $1$ and $10$) and a power of $10$.

To convert $123,000$ into standard form, we begin by identifying the significant figures within the number. In this case, the significant figures are $1$, $2$, and $3$. We then insert a decimal point after the first significant figure, resulting in $1.23$. 

Next, we determine how many places the decimal point has moved from its original position at the end of the number to its new position after the first significant figure. For the number $123,000$, the decimal point shifts $5$ places to the left.

This movement is represented using a power of $10$. Since the decimal point moved $5$ places to the left, we multiply $1.23$ by 

$$ 
10^5. 
$$ 

Thus, the standard form of $123,000$ is 

$$ 
1.23 \times 10^5. 
$$ 

Understanding standard form is crucial for simplifying calculations and enhancing the readability and comparability of large numbers. Additionally, it facilitates more efficient operations such as multiplication and division, as one can handle the powers of $10$ separately from the significant figures.
