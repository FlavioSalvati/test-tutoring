A cone possesses an infinite number of lines of symmetry, all of which extend from its apex to the center of its circular base.

To clarify this concept, envision a cone standing upright on its circular base. The apex is the pointed top of the cone, while the base is the flat, circular surface at the bottom. Any line drawn from the apex, through the center of the base, and extending to the opposite side of the base constitutes a line of symmetry. This is because if the cone were folded along such a line, the two resulting halves would align perfectly.

The reason for the infinite number of lines of symmetry stems from the circular nature of the base. You can draw these lines at any angle around the circle, and each line will still bisect the cone into two identical halves. This characteristic contrasts with shapes like squares or rectangles, which have a finite number of lines of symmetry.

To further visualize this, consider slicing the cone with a plane that intersects both the apex and the center of the base. Each slice will produce two mirror-image halves, illustrating the line of symmetry. This property is distinctive to cones and other shapes that exhibit rotational symmetry around a central axis.
