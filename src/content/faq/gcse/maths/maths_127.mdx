To effectively plan a 3-hour study session, consider breaking it into focused segments interspersed with short breaks, while also varying your activities for better engagement.

Begin by dividing the 3 hours into manageable intervals. A widely used method is the Pomodoro Technique, which entails studying for $25$ minutes followed by a $5$-minute break. This approach allows you to fit in a total of six $25$-minute study sessions, each accompanied by a $5$-minute break, and you can also schedule a longer break at the end. This technique helps to enhance concentration and mitigates the risk of burnout.

Next, identify the specific topics you need to cover. For instance, in GCSE Maths, you may want to focus on various areas such as algebra, geometry, and statistics. Create a list of particular tasks or problems to address in each $25$-minute session. For example, you might spend the first session reviewing algebraic equations, the second practicing geometry problems, and continue this pattern with subsequent topics.

During each study segment, commit to staying focused on the task at hand. Minimize distractions by putting away your phone and avoiding social media to maximize your productivity. Utilize your breaks to relax and rechargeâ€”consider stretching, grabbing a snack, or taking a brief walk.

Lastly, keep your study sessions engaging by varying your activities. Alternate between reading notes, solving problems, and watching instructional videos. This diversity not only reinforces your understanding but also keeps you motivated. By the conclusion of your 3-hour study session, you'll have covered a broad range of topics while maintaining a high level of focus and engagement throughout.
