To calculate the area of a triangle, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

This formula offers a simple and effective way to determine the area of a triangle.

For instance, consider a triangle with a base measuring $5 \, \text{cm}$ and a height of $7 \, \text{cm}$. By substituting these values into the formula, we can compute the area as follows:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \, \text{cm} \times 7 \, \text{cm}
$$

First, we multiply the base by the height:

$$
5 \, \text{cm} \times 7 \, \text{cm} = 35 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Next, we take this result and multiply it by $\frac{1}{2}$:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 35 \, \text{cm}^2 = 17.5 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Therefore, the area of the triangle is $17.5 \, \text{cm}^2$.

This formula is particularly effective because a triangle can be visualized as half of a rectangle. If you imagine a rectangle with the same base and height, its area would be calculated by simply multiplying the base by the height. Since a triangle occupies half of that rectangle's area, we divide by $2$. This reliable method can be applied to any triangle, as long as the base and height are known.
