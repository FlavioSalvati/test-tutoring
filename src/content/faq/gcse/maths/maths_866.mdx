The expression $2^{-3}$ evaluates to $\frac{1}{8}$.

To comprehend why $2^{-3}$ equals $\frac{1}{8}$, we must delve into the concept of negative exponents. A negative exponent signifies that the base number should be taken as its reciprocal and then raised to the corresponding positive exponent. Specifically, $2^{-3}$ indicates that we take the reciprocal of $2$, which is $\frac{1}{2}$, and raise it to the power of $3$.

This can be mathematically represented as:
$$ 
2^{-3} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 
$$

Next, we compute $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3$. This involves multiplying $\frac{1}{2}$ by itself three times:
$$ 
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) 
$$

When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
$$ 
\frac{1 \times 1 \times 1}{2 \times 2 \times 2} = \frac{1}{8} 
$$

Thus, we conclude that $2^{-3} = \frac{1}{8}$.

Grasping the concept of negative exponents is essential, as it aids in simplifying expressions and solving equations in mathematics. Remember, a negative exponent effectively inverts the base to its reciprocal and then applies the positive exponent. This principle is widely applicable across various fields of mathematics, including algebra and calculus, and serves as a foundational concept for advancing to more complex topics.
