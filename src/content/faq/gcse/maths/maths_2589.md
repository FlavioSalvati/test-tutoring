To determine the measures of angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal, it is essential to understand the relationships between different types of angles, such as corresponding angles, alternate angles, and co-interior angles.

When a transversal crosses two parallel lines, it creates several angle pairs. **Corresponding angles** are located in the same position at each intersection and are always equal. For instance, if one corresponding angle measures $50^\circ$, the other corresponding angle will also measure $50^\circ$.

**Alternate angles** are situated on opposite sides of the transversal and lie between the parallel lines. These angles are equal as well. For example, if one alternate angle is $70^\circ$, the angle that is opposite to it across the transversal will also measure $70^\circ$.

**Co-interior angles**, also referred to as consecutive or allied angles, are located on the same side of the transversal and between the parallel lines. The sum of these angles is always $180^\circ$. Therefore, if one co-interior angle measures $110^\circ$, the other angle must be $70^\circ$ because $110^\circ + 70^\circ = 180^\circ$.

By recognizing these relationships, you can easily calculate unknown angles. For example, if you know the measure of one angle, you can deduce the measures of all other related angles using these established rules. This approach not only simplifies the calculation process but also ensures accuracy in your results.
