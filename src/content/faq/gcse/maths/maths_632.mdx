An irrational number is defined as a number that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction of two integers. 

Irrational numbers have decimal expansions that continue infinitely without repeating. This characteristic means that they cannot be represented as a ratio of two whole numbers, such as $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{3}{4}$. A well-known example of an irrational number is $\pi$ (pi), which begins as $3.14159$ but extends infinitely without any repeating pattern. Another notable irrational number is the square root of $2$, denoted as $\sqrt{2}$, which is approximately $1.4142135$ and also exhibits a non-repeating, infinite decimal expansion.

The term "irrational" can be understood by considering the word "ratio." Rational numbers, by definition, can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, such as $\frac{7}{3}$ or $\frac{-5}{8}$. In contrast, irrational numbers cannot be represented in this way, making them the "opposite" of rational numbers.

When attempting to express an irrational number in decimal form, you will observe that it neither terminates nor forms a repeating sequence. This is in stark contrast to rational numbers, which either have terminating decimals (like $0.75$) or repeating decimals (like $0.666\ldots$). Due to their non-repeating and non-terminating nature, irrational numbers can pose challenges in mathematical calculations and proofs.

In summary, irrational numbers are distinctive because they cannot be neatly expressed as fractions, and their decimal representations are infinite and non-repeating. This unique nature makes them an intriguing and significant aspect of mathematics, particularly in fields such as geometry, algebra, and calculus.
