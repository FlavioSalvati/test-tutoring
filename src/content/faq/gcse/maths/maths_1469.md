To calculate the magnitude of the vector $(0, -13)$, we will use the formula:

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

The magnitude of a vector represents its length in a geometric sense. For a vector defined by its coordinates $(x, y)$, the magnitude can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem. The formula for calculating the magnitude is:

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

In this instance, the vector we are examining is $(0, -13)$.

First, we identify the components of the vector: here, we have $x = 0$ and $y = -13$. Next, we proceed to square both components:

- For the $x$ component: 
$$
0^2 = 0
$$
- For the $y$ component: 
$$
(-13)^2 = 169
$$

After squaring the components, we add the results together:

$$
0 + 169 = 169
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the magnitude of the vector:

$$
\sqrt{169} = 13
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(0, -13)$ is $13$. This method is applicable to any vector in two-dimensional space and aids in understanding the distance from the origin to the point represented by the vector.
