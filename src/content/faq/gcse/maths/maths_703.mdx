The expression $ 10^2 \times 10^3 $ simplifies to $ 10^5 $.

When multiplying powers that share the same base, the exponents are added together. In this case, our base is $ 10 $. Therefore, we combine the exponents $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ as follows: 

$$
2 + 3 = 5.
$$ 

This means that $ 10^2 \times 10^3 $ can be rewritten as $ 10^5 $.

To elaborate further, $ 10^2 $ represents $ 10 $ multiplied by itself, resulting in $ 100 $. Similarly, $ 10^3 $ denotes $ 10 $ multiplied by itself three times, yielding $ 1000 $. When we multiply $ 100 $ by $ 1000 $, we obtain $ 100,000 $. This value is equivalent to $ 10^5 $, since multiplying $ 10 $ by itself five times also results in $ 100,000 $.

Grasping this principle greatly simplifies working with powers. Instead of calculating each power separately before multiplying, you can simply add the exponents when the bases are identical. This foundational rule of exponents (or indices) is invaluable for streamlining various mathematical problems.
