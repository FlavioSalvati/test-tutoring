The button for calculating square roots on most scientific calculators is typically labeled as "√" or "sqrt".

On scientific calculators, the square root function is denoted by the symbol "√". This function allows you to determine the square root of a number, which is a value that, when multiplied by itself, yields the original number. For example, the square root of $16$ is $4$, since $4 \times 4 = 16$.

To utilize the square root function, you generally press the "√" button followed by the number for which you wish to find the square root. For instance, to calculate the square root of $25$, you would press "√" and then "25". Some calculators may require you to enter the number first before pressing the "√" button, so it’s advisable to consult your calculator’s manual if you're unsure of the correct procedure.

In addition to the "√" button, some calculators may use "sqrt" to represent the square root function, which is particularly common in software-based or graphing calculators. Regardless of the label used, the function remains consistent.

Understanding how to effectively use the square root button is crucial for solving a variety of mathematical problems, especially those involving quadratic equations and geometric calculations. By practicing with your calculator, you will become more proficient and confident in utilizing this function.
