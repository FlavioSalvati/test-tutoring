The expression $10^2 \times 10^3$ simplifies to $10^5$.

To understand this simplification, we need to examine the rules of exponents. When multiplying two numbers with the same base, you simply add their exponents. In our case, both numbers share the base of $10$. Therefore, we can combine the exponents by performing the addition: $2 + 3 = 5$. As a result, we have:

$$
10^2 \times 10^3 = 10^{2+3} = 10^5.
$$

Let’s delve deeper into this. The term $10^2$ represents $10$ multiplied by itself, which is calculated as follows:

$$
10^2 = 10 \times 10 = 100.
$$

On the other hand, $10^3$ denotes $10$ multiplied by itself three times:

$$
10^3 = 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000.
$$

When we multiply these two results together, we arrive at:

$$
100 \times 1000 = 100,000.
$$

However, leveraging the exponent rule streamlines this process significantly. Instead of manually multiplying $100$ and $1000$, we can simply add the exponents:

$$
10^2 \times 10^3 = 10^{2+3} = 10^5.
$$

This method is not only quicker but also more efficient.

To further clarify, $10^5$ signifies $10$ multiplied by itself five times:

$$
10^5 = 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 100,000.
$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$
10^2 \times 10^3 = 100,000.
$$

The principle of adding exponents is a key rule in mathematics that significantly simplifies calculations involving powers.
