To determine the length of the diagonal in a 3D triangular prism, we use the formula:

$$
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + h^2}
$$

In the context of a 3D triangular prism, the diagonal represents the longest line segment that can be drawn from one vertex to the opposite vertex, traversing through the interior of the prism. To calculate this diagonal, you need to know three dimensions: the length of the base of the triangular face ($a$), the height of the triangular face ($b$), and the height of the prism itself ($h$).

Imagine positioning the triangular prism such that it rests on one of its rectangular faces. The diagonal we are focusing on extends from one vertex of the triangular base to the corresponding opposite vertex on the other triangular base. This diagonal forms a right triangle with the base ($a$) and the height ($b$) of the triangular face.

First, consider the right triangle formed by the base ($a$) and the height ($b$) of the triangular face. The length of the hypotenuse of this triangle, which we will denote as $d_1$, can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
d_1 = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

Next, the hypotenuse $d_1$ and the height of the prism ($h$) together form another right triangle. The diagonal of the prism is the hypotenuse of this second triangle. Applying the Pythagorean theorem a second time, we arrive at the final expression for the diagonal:

$$
d = \sqrt{d_1^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + h^2}
$$

Thus, by knowing the dimensions of the triangular base and the height of the prism, you can easily calculate the diagonal using the formula provided.
