The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to $ y = x + 2 $ is $-1$.

To understand this, letâ€™s first examine the gradient of the line $ y = x + 2 $. This equation is written in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the gradient (or slope) of the line. In this case, $ m = 1 $ since the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 1 $.

A fundamental principle in coordinate geometry states that if two lines are perpendicular, the product of their gradients is always $-1$. This means that if one line has a gradient of $ m $, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to it can be calculated using the formula:

$$
m_{\text{perpendicular}} = -\frac{1}{m}
$$

In our specific example, the gradient $ m $ of the line $ y = x + 2 $ is $ 1 $. To find the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to it, we substitute $ m = 1 $ into the formula:

$$
m_{\text{perpendicular}} = -\frac{1}{1} = -1
$$

Thus, the gradient of any line that is perpendicular to $ y = x + 2 $ is indeed $-1$. This indicates that any line crossing $ y = x + 2 $ at a right angle will have a slope of $-1$. Understanding this concept is crucial in geometry, as it helps us analyze the relationships between various lines on a graph.
