A square possesses four lines of symmetry: two along its diagonals and two along its midlines.

To identify the lines of symmetry in a square, it's essential to recognize that these symmetry lines divide the shape into two identical halves. For a square, there are two primary methods to locate these lines. 

First, draw lines from one vertex to the opposite vertex. These lines represent the diagonals of the square, and each serves as a line of symmetry because they bisect the square into two congruent triangles.

Next, consider the midlines. These lines traverse the center of the square, running parallel to its sides. To create these midlines, locate the midpoint of each side of the square. Then, draw a line connecting the midpoints of opposite sides. This results in one vertical line and one horizontal line, each intersecting at the center of the square. These midlines also function as lines of symmetry, as they divide the square into two equal rectangles.

By understanding these four lines of symmetry, one can appreciate the high degree of symmetry inherent in a square. This property is significant in various mathematical contexts and real-world applications, such as design and architecture, where symmetry often plays a vital role.
