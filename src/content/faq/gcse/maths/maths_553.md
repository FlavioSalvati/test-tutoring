The conditional probability of event $A$ given that $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.2$ and $P(B) = 0.5$ is calculated to be $0.4$.

To determine the conditional probability of event $A$ given event $B$, we utilize the formula:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}.
$$

This formula indicates the likelihood of event $A$ occurring, assuming that event $B$ has already taken place.

In this scenario, we know that $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.2$ and $P(B) = 0.5$. By substituting these values into the formula, we obtain:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.2}{0.5} = 0.4.
$$

This result signifies that if event $B$ occurs, the probability that event $A$ will also occur is $0.4$, or $40\%$.

Understanding conditional probability is crucial because it allows us to analyze situations where events are interdependent. For instance, if you know it is raining (event $B$), you might be more inclined to carry an umbrella (event $A$). By applying the given probabilities, we can make more informed predictions about such scenarios.
