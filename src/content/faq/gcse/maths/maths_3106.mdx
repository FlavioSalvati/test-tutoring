To determine the range of data represented in a histogram, you simply subtract the smallest value from the largest value.

A histogram is a specific type of bar chart that illustrates the frequency distribution of a dataset. Each bar, or "bin," corresponds to a range of values, and the height of the bar indicates the number of data points that fall within that range. To calculate the range of the dataset, you need to identify the smallest and largest values shown on the histogram's horizontal axis (x-axis).

Start by examining the leftmost bar of the histogram to pinpoint the smallest value. This bar represents the lowest range of data values. The starting point of this bar is the smallest value in your dataset. Next, focus on the rightmost bar to find the largest value. This bar represents the highest range of data values, and its endpoint indicates the largest value in your dataset.

Once you have determined both the smallest and largest values, you can calculate the range by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. For instance, if the smallest value is $10$ and the largest value is $50$, the range would be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Range} = 50 - 10 = 40
$$

The range provides valuable insight into the spread of the data, illustrating the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset.
