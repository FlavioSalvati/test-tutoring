The range of the function $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $ encompasses all real numbers except for zero.

To understand the range of $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $, we need to examine the possible values that $ f(x) $ can assume as $ x $ varies over all real numbers, excluding zero. The function is undefined at $ x = 0 $ because division by zero is not permissible. However, for any other real number $ x $, the function yields a valid real output.

When $ x $ is a positive number, the expression $ \frac{1}{x} $ is also positive and can take on any positive real value. As $ x $ increases, $ \frac{1}{x} $ decreases and approaches zero, although it never actually reaches it. Conversely, as $ x $ decreases (while remaining positive), $ \frac{1}{x} $ increases without bound.

For negative values of $ x $, the output $ \frac{1}{x} $ is negative, allowing it to take any negative real value. As $ x $ becomes more negative (i.e., its absolute value increases), $ \frac{1}{x} $ approaches zero from the negative side but never actually attains it. Similarly, as $ x $ approaches zero from the negative side, $ \frac{1}{x} $ grows increasingly large in the negative direction.

In conclusion, the function $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $ can attain any real number value except for zero. Thus, the range of the function is all real numbers excluding zero.
