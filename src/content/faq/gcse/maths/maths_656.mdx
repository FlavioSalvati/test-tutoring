To compute the expression $(4^2)^3$, we can approach it in two distinct ways. First, we will evaluate the expression step by step, and then we will use the laws of exponents for a more efficient calculation.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Calculate $4^2$:**
   Squaring a number involves multiplying it by itself. Thus,
   $$4^2 = 4 \times 4 = 16.$$

2. **Raise the Result to the Power of 3:**
   Next, we take the result from the first step, which is $16$, and raise it to the power of $3$. Raising a number to the power of $3$ means multiplying it by itself three times:
   $$16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16.$$

   To simplify this calculation, we can break it down further:

   - First, compute $16 \times 16$:
   $$
   16 \times 16 = 256.
   $$

   - Next, multiply the result by $16$ again:
   $$
   256 \times 16 = 4096.
   $$

Thus, we find that 
$$(4^2)^3 = 4096.$$

### Alternative Method Using the Laws of Exponents

Alternatively, we can apply the power of a power rule, which states that $(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$. Applying this rule to our expression:
$$(4^2)^3 = 4^{2 \times 3} = 4^6.$$

Now, we can compute $4^6$ directly:
$$4^6 = 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4.$$

To make the computation easier, we can break it down as follows:

- Calculate $4 \times 4$:
$$
4 \times 4 = 16.
$$

- Multiply the result by $4$:
$$
16 \times 4 = 64.
$$

- Multiply the next result by $4$:
$$
64 \times 4 = 256.
$$

- Again, multiply by $4$:
$$
256 \times 4 = 1024.
$$

- Finally, multiply by $4$ one last time:
$$
1024 \times 4 = 4096.
$$

Regardless of the method used, we arrive at the same conclusion:
$$(4^2)^3 = 4096.$$
