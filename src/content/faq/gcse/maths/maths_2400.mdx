The equation of the line is given by 

$$
y = -2x + 10.
$$

To derive the equation of a line, we utilize the slope-intercept form, which is represented as 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $ m $ denotes the slope and $ c $ represents the y-intercept. In this case, we have a slope of $ m = -2 $ and a specific point on the line, $(4, 2)$. By substituting these values into the equation, we can solve for $ c $.

First, we substitute the slope and the coordinates of the point into the equation:

$$
2 = -2(4) + c.
$$

Next, we solve for $ c $:

$$
2 = -8 + c,
$$

which simplifies to 

$$
c = 2 + 8.
$$

Thus, we find 

$$
c = 10.
$$

Now that we have determined the y-intercept $ c = 10 $, we can express the complete equation of the line:

$$
y = -2x + 10.
$$

This equation indicates that for any value of $ x $, the corresponding $ y $ value can be calculated by multiplying $ x $ by $-2$ and then adding $ 10 $. For instance, if $ x = 0 $, then 

$$
y = 10,
$$ 

and if $ x = 1 $, then 

$$
y = 8.
$$ 

This linear relationship is consistent with a slope of $-2$, meaning that for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ decreases by $ 2 $ units.
