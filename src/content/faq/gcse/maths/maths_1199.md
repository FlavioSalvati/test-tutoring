The formula to calculate the perimeter of an irregular polygon is simply the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

To determine the perimeter of an irregular polygon, you must measure the length of each side individually. Unlike regular polygons, which have equal sides and angles, irregular polygons feature sides of varying lengths and angles of different measures. Consequently, a straightforward multiplication formula, as applicable to regular polygons, cannot be used here.

Begin by identifying and labeling each side of the polygon. Utilize a ruler or any suitable measuring instrument to accurately determine the length of each side. Once you have recorded all the measurements, you can add them together. For instance, if an irregular polygon has sides measuring $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, $5 \, \text{cm}$, and $6 \, \text{cm}$, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 3 \, \text{cm} + 4 \, \text{cm} + 5 \, \text{cm} + 6 \, \text{cm} = 18 \, \text{cm}.
$$

This method is applicable to any irregular polygon, regardless of the number of sides. Just ensure that you measure each side accurately and sum all the lengths together. This straightforward approach guarantees that you account for the distinct dimensions of each side, which is crucial for accurately determining the perimeter of irregular shapes.
