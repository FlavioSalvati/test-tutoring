The limits of accuracy for the number $9.876$ when rounded to three decimal places are $9.8755$ and $9.8765$.

Rounding a number to three decimal places means that it is accurate to the nearest thousandth. In this instance, we are rounding the number $9.876$ to three decimal places. To determine the limits of accuracy, we must identify the smallest and largest values that would round to $9.876$.

The smallest value that would round up to $9.876$ is $9.8755$. This is because any number less than $9.8755$ would round down to $9.875$ when rounded to three decimal places. Conversely, the largest value that would round down to $9.876$ is $9.8765$. Any number equal to or greater than $9.8765$ would round up to $9.877$.

Therefore, the limits of accuracy for $9.876$ rounded to three decimal places range from $9.8755$ to just under $9.8765$. This range guarantees that any number within these limits, when rounded to three decimal places, will yield $9.876$. Understanding these limits is essential in various fields, such as measurements and calculations, where precision is of utmost importance.
