The square root of $49$ is $7$.

To grasp why this is the case, let's explore the concept of square roots. A square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, results in the original number. In formal mathematical terms, if $x$ is the square root of $y$, then it follows that $x \times x = y$. For the number $49$, the value that meets this criterion is $7$, since $7 \times 7 = 49$.

The symbol $ \sqrt{} $ denotes the square root. Therefore, we can express this as $ \sqrt{49} = 7 $. It is essential to recognize that every positive number has two square roots: one positive and one negative. This is due to the fact that both $7 \times 7 = 49$ and $-7 \times -7 = 49$. However, in most contexts, when we refer to "the square root," we are typically indicating the positive square root, also known as the principal square root.

Understanding square roots is fundamental in various areas of mathematics, including solving quadratic equations and analyzing geometric shapes. For instance, if you know that the area of a square is $49$ square units, you can determine the length of one side by taking the square root of $49$, which is $7$ units.

In conclusion, the square root of $49$ is $7$, and this concept plays a vital role in many mathematical applications.
