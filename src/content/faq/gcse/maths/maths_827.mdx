To rationalize the denominator of the expression $ \frac{7}{\sqrt{5}} $, you can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $ \sqrt{5} $.

When dealing with a fraction like $ \frac{7}{\sqrt{5}} $, the denominator contains a surd (a square root that cannot be simplified to a whole number). To rationalize the denominator, the goal is to eliminate the surd. This is achieved by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the surd in the denominator, which in this case is $ \sqrt{5} $.

Here is a step-by-step guide to the process:

1. Identify the surd in the denominator, which is $ \sqrt{5} $.
2. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $ \sqrt{5} $:
$$
\frac{7}{\sqrt{5}} \times \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}}.
$$
3. When you multiply the denominators, you have:
$$
\sqrt{5} \times \sqrt{5} = 5,
$$
since $ \sqrt{5} \times \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{25} = 5 $.
4. Now, multiply the numerators:
$$
7 \times \sqrt{5} = 7\sqrt{5}.
$$

Thus, the fraction now transforms into:
$$
\frac{7\sqrt{5}}{5}.
$$

At this point, the denominator has been rationalized, meaning it no longer contains a surd. The final simplified result is:
$$
\frac{7\sqrt{5}}{5}.
$$

This rationalization process is beneficial because it simplifies further calculations and is a common practice in mathematics to present answers in a more standard form.
