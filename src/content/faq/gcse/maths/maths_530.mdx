Relative frequency is defined as the proportion of times an event occurs in relation to the total number of trials or observations. In this instance, the relative frequency is $0.2$, which is equivalent to $20\%$.

To compute the relative frequency, you divide the number of occurrences of the event by the total number of trials. In this example, the event occurs $8$ times out of $40$ trials. The calculation for relative frequency can be expressed as follows:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of occurrences of the event}}{\text{Total number of trials}} = \frac{8}{40} 
$$

When you perform the division $8$ by $40$, the result is $0.2$. This value can also be converted to a percentage by multiplying by $100$, resulting in $20\%$. Therefore, the relative frequency of the event occurring is $0.2$ or $20\%$.

Understanding relative frequency is crucial as it allows for the analysis of the likelihood of an event based on experimental or observed data. For instance, if you were rolling a die and wanted to determine how often you rolled a $3$, you could calculate the relative frequency of that outcome. If you rolled the die $40$ times and obtained a $3$ on $8$ occasions, the relative frequency would again be $0.2$. This indicates that rolling a $3$ is relatively frequent within your trials.

Relative frequency is especially valuable in scenarios where calculating theoretical probability is challenging or when comparing experimental results with theoretical expectations. It offers a practical approach to understanding and interpreting data in real-world contexts.
