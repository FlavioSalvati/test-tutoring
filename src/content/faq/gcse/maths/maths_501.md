The magnitude of the vector $(24, 7)$ is $25$.

To determine the magnitude of a vector, we utilize the Pythagorean theorem. The vector $(24, 7)$ represents the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of a right-angled triangle. The magnitude of the vector corresponds to the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle.

The formula to calculate the magnitude of a vector $(a, b)$ is given by:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

In this instance, we have $a = 24$ and $b = 7$. Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{24^2 + 7^2}
$$
$$
= \sqrt{576 + 49}
$$
$$
= \sqrt{625}
$$
$$
= 25
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(24, 7)$ is $25$. This indicates that if you were to graph this vector, the straight-line distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the point $(24, 7)$ would measure $25$ units. Understanding how to calculate the magnitude of a vector is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, particularly when solving problems related to geometry and physics.
