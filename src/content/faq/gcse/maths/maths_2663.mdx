To determine the area of a sector with a radius of $6 \, \text{cm}$ and an angle of $60^\circ$, we can apply the formula for the area of a sector:

$$
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
$$

where $\theta$ represents the angle in degrees and $r$ is the radius of the sector. In this example, the radius $r$ is $6 \, \text{cm}$ and the angle $\theta$ is $60^\circ$.

We begin by substituting the known values into the formula:

$$
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{60}{360} \times \pi \times 6^2
$$

Next, we simplify the fraction $\frac{60}{360}$:

$$
\frac{60}{360} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

Now, we can calculate the area:

$$
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{1}{6} \times \pi \times 36
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{36\pi}{6}
$$

Thus, we find:

$$
\text{Area of sector} = 6\pi \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Consequently, the area of the sector is $6\pi \, \text{cm}^2$. If you prefer a numerical approximation, you can use $\pi \approx 3.14$, which yields:

$$
6\pi \approx 6 \times 3.14 = 18.84 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

However, in most GCSE Maths contexts, it is generally acceptable and often preferred to leave the answer expressed in terms of $\pi$.
