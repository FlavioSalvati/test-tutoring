To determine the fourth power of $2$, you compute $2^4$, which results in $16$.

Raising a number to a power involves multiplying that number by itself a specified number of times. The exponent indicates how many times the base number is used in the multiplication. For instance, $2^4$ signifies that you multiply $2$ by itself four times, expressed as:

$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2.
$$

Letâ€™s break down this calculation step by step:

1. Start with the base number $2$.
2. Multiply $2$ by itself: 
   $$
   2 \times 2 = 4.
   $$
3. Take the result ($4$) and multiply it by $2$ again: 
   $$
   4 \times 2 = 8.
   $$
4. Finally, take the result ($8$) and multiply it by $2$ once more: 
   $$
   8 \times 2 = 16.
   $$

Thus, we conclude that $2^4 = 16$. This method of repeated multiplication is what we refer to when we talk about raising a number to a power. It is a fundamental principle in mathematics that has applications across various fields, from algebra to physics. Mastering the concept of exponents will empower you to tackle more complex problems and deepen your understanding of numerical relationships.
