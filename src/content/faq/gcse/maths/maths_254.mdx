To determine the y-coordinate of a point when the x-coordinate is known, you can substitute the x-value into the equation of the line.

For instance, consider the linear equation given by 

$$ y = 2x + 3. $$ 

To find the y-coordinate for an x-coordinate of $4$, you would substitute $4$ for $x$ in the equation:

$$ y = 2(4) + 3. $$ 

This simplifies to 

$$ y = 8 + 3, $$ 

resulting in 

$$ y = 11. $$ 

Thus, the corresponding y-coordinate is $11$.

In cases where the equation is more complex, such as a quadratic equation given by 

$$ y = x^2 - 4x + 6, $$ 

the substitution process remains the same. For example, if the x-coordinate is $2$, you would substitute $2$ into the equation:

$$ y = (2)^2 - 4(2) + 6. $$ 

This simplifies to 

$$ y = 4 - 8 + 6, $$ 

which results in 

$$ y = 2. $$ 

Therefore, the corresponding y-coordinate is $2$.

If you are working with a table of values or a graph instead of a direct equation, the approach differs slightly. When using a table, locate the row where the x-coordinate matches the specified value, and then read the corresponding y-coordinate. If you have a graph, find the given x-coordinate on the x-axis, then move vertically until you intersect the line or curve, allowing you to read the y-coordinate directly from the y-axis.

Mastering the techniques of substitution and simplification is essential in this process. Regular practice with various equations, as well as utilizing graphs and tables, will enhance your confidence in determining y-coordinates from provided x-coordinates.
