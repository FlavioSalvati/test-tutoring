To determine the equation of a line that is parallel to the given line $ y = -3x + 2 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 3) $, we start by recognizing that parallel lines share the same slope. 

The slope (gradient) of the line $ y = -3x + 2 $ is $ -3 $, which is the coefficient of $ x $ in the equation.

Next, we will use the point $ (2, 3) $ to formulate the equation of the new line. We can apply the point-slope form of a linear equation, expressed as:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

In this equation, $ m $ represents the slope, while $ (x_1, y_1) $ is a specific point on the line.

Substituting the slope $ m = -3 $ and the point $ (2, 3) $ into the point-slope form, we have:

$$
y - 3 = -3(x - 2)
$$

Next, we will simplify this equation. Expanding the right side gives:

$$
y - 3 = -3x + 6
$$

To isolate $ y $, we add $ 3 $ to both sides:

$$
y = -3x + 9
$$

Thus, the equation of the line that is parallel to $ y = -3x + 2 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 3) $ is 

$$
y = -3x + 9.
$$

This newly derived line maintains the same slope as the original line, confirming that they are indeed parallel, and it also satisfies the condition of passing through the specified point.
