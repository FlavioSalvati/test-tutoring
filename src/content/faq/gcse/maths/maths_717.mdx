The number $0.005$ can be expressed in standard form as $5 \times 10^{-3}$.

Standard form, often referred to as scientific notation, provides a method for writing extremely large or small numbers in a more concise and manageable way. This format is particularly advantageous in fields such as science and engineering. To convert a number into standard form, you must express it as a product of a number that lies between $1$ and $10$, multiplied by a power of $10$.

For the number $0.005$, the first step is to identify the significant figures, which are the non-zero digits. In this case, the significant figure is $5$. Next, you determine how many places the decimal point must be moved to the right in order to convert $0.005$ into a number that falls within the range of $1$ to $10$. Here, the decimal point shifts three places to the right, transforming $0.005$ into $5$.

Since the decimal point moved three places to the right, we multiply $5$ by $10^{-3}$. The negative exponent signifies that the original number is less than $1$. Consequently, in standard form, $0.005$ is represented as $5 \times 10^{-3}$.

Grasping the concept of standard form is crucial for effectively managing very large or very small numbers, especially in scientific computations. This notation streamlines arithmetic operations and facilitates the comparison of the magnitudes of different quantities.
