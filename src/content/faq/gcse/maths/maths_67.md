Let's consider the division of $5 \times 10^6$ by $2 \times 10^3$. The result of this operation is $2.5 \times 10^3$.

To comprehend this, we will break the process down into manageable parts. When performing divisions involving numbers in scientific notation, it is convenient to separately handle the coefficients (the numbers preceding the powers of ten) and the powers of ten themselves.

Firstly, divide the coefficients: $5 \div 2 = 2.5$.

Subsequently, tackle the powers of ten. When powers of ten are divided, the exponents are subtracted. In this case, we have $10^6$ divided by $10^3$. Following the rules of exponents, subtract the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator: $6 - 3 = 3$. Hence, $10^6 \div 10^3 = 10^3$.

By combining these results, we arrive at $2.5 \times 10^3$. This is an efficient way to manage division operations involving scientific notation, which can be particularly useful when dealing with extremely large or small numbers. It's important to remember the two key steps: divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents. This approach ensures both accuracy and efficiency in your mathematical computations.
