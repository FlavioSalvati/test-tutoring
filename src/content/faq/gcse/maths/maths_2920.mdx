To calculate the expected frequency of obtaining heads when flipping a coin 300 times, we can utilize the binomial distribution formula.

When flipping a fair coin, the probability of achieving heads (which we consider a success) in a single flip is $0.5$. If we flip the coin $300$ times, we can apply the binomial distribution to determine the expected number of heads. The formula for the expected value in a binomial distribution is given by:

$$
E(X) = n \times p
$$

In this formula:
- $E(X)$ represents the expected number of successes (heads),
- $n$ is the total number of trials (coin flips),
- $p$ is the probability of success on each individual trial.

For our scenario, we have:
- $n = 300$ (the number of flips),
- $p = 0.5$ (the probability of flipping heads).

Substituting these values into the formula, we find:

$$
E(X) = 300 \times 0.5 = 150
$$

This indicates that if you were to flip a fair coin $300$ times, you would expect to obtain heads approximately $150$ times.

The binomial distribution is particularly useful because it allows us to understand the probabilities of various outcomes when there are two possible results (such as heads or tails) for each trial. It's essential to note that this expected value is an average; the actual number of heads in $300$ flips could vary slightly from $150$, reflecting the inherent randomness of the process.
