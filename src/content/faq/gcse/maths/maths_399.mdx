The arc length of a circle with a radius of $6 \, \text{cm}$ and an angle of $45^\circ$ is approximately $4.71 \, \text{cm}$.

To calculate the arc length of a circle, we use the formula:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = \theta \times r
$$

where $\theta$ represents the angle in radians and $r$ is the radius of the circle. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. We know that $180^\circ$ is equivalent to $\pi$ radians. Thus, we can convert $45^\circ$ to radians by multiplying by $\frac{\pi}{180}$:

$$
45^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ radians}
$$

Now that we have the angle in radians, we can apply the arc length formula. Given that the radius $r$ is $6 \, \text{cm}$, we substitute the values into the formula:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\pi}{4} \times 6
$$

Simplifying this expression results in:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{6\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{2}
$$

To obtain a numerical approximation, we can use $ \pi \approx 3.14$:

$$
\text{Arc Length} \approx \frac{3 \times 3.14}{2} = 4.71 \, \text{cm}
$$

Therefore, the arc length of a circle with a radius of $6 \, \text{cm}$ and an angle of $45^\circ$ is approximately $4.71 \, \text{cm}$. This method can be applied to any circle, provided you know both the radius and the angle in degrees.
