The cumulative frequency for the highest interval represents the total number of data points that fall within or below that interval.

In statistics, cumulative frequency serves as a method for tracking a running total of frequencies across the various classes in a frequency distribution. To calculate the cumulative frequency for the highest interval, you need to sum all the frequencies from the first interval up to the highest one. This cumulative total indicates how many data points are included in or below the highest interval.

For instance, consider a frequency table that lists intervals alongside their corresponding frequencies. To compute the cumulative frequency, begin by adding the frequency of the first interval to that of the second interval, continuing this process until you reach the highest interval. The resulting sum at the highest interval gives you the cumulative frequency for that interval, reflecting the total number of observations in your dataset.

Understanding cumulative frequency is crucial, as it provides insight into how data accumulates across different intervals. This information can be particularly valuable for analyzing trends and patterns within the data. Moreover, cumulative frequency is especially useful when determining the median or other percentiles, as it allows for a clearer view of data distribution across various ranges.
