The slope in a cost-time graph serves as a vital indicator of the rate at which cost changes with respect to time.

In the context of a cost-time graph, the slope is a fundamental concept because it reveals how rapidly the cost is either increasing or decreasing over time. A positive slope indicates that the cost is rising as time progresses, while a negative slope signifies a decline in cost over the same period. Additionally, a steeper slope reflects a faster rate of change, whereas a gentler slope suggests a slower rate of change.

To compute the slope, one must determine the change in cost (the vertical change) divided by the change in time (the horizontal change). This relationship is often expressed as "rise over run." For instance, if the cost increases by £50 over a duration of 5 hours, the slope can be calculated as:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{£50}{5 \text{ hours}} = £10 \text{ per hour}.
$$

This calculation indicates that for each hour that passes, the cost increases by £10.

Grasping the concept of the slope is essential for making predictions and informed decisions. For example, if you are aware of the slope, you can project future costs or assess the time required for the cost to reach a specific value. This understanding is particularly beneficial in the realms of budgeting and financial planning.

In conclusion, the slope in a cost-time graph is a powerful analytical tool that allows for a detailed examination of how costs fluctuate over time, enabling you to make more informed decisions based on the observed rate of change.
