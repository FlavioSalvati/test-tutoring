To calculate the area of a compound shape formed by two overlapping rectangles, you can follow a systematic approach. The total area is obtained by summing the areas of both rectangles and then subtracting the area of their overlap.

First, compute the area of each rectangle individually. The area of a rectangle is determined by multiplying its length by its width. For instance, if Rectangle A has a length of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and a width of $3 \, \text{cm}$, its area can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Area of Rectangle A} = 5 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 15 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

Similarly, for Rectangle B, if its length is $4 \, \text{cm}$ and its width is $2 \, \text{cm}$, the area is:

$$
\text{Area of Rectangle B} = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 2 \, \text{cm} = 8 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

Next, you need to determine the area of the overlapping section. This involves identifying the dimensions of the overlapping rectangle. For example, if the overlap is a smaller rectangle with a length of $2 \, \text{cm}$ and a width of $1 \, \text{cm}$, the area of the overlap is calculated as:

$$
\text{Area of Overlap} = 2 \, \text{cm} \times 1 \, \text{cm} = 2 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

To find the total area of the compound shape, combine the areas of the two rectangles and subtract the area of the overlap:

$$
\text{Total Area} = \text{Area of Rectangle A} + \text{Area of Rectangle B} - \text{Area of Overlap}.
$$

Substituting the values from our example:

$$
\text{Total Area} = 15 \, \text{cm}^2 + 8 \, \text{cm}^2 - 2 \, \text{cm}^2 = 21 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

This method effectively ensures that the overlapping area is not counted twice, providing you with the correct total area of the compound shape.
