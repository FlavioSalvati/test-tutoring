The slope of a line parallel to the equation $y = -x + 4$ is $-1$.

In mathematics, the slope of a line quantifies its steepness and is commonly represented by the letter $m$ in the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is expressed as $y = mx + c$, where $c$ denotes the y-intercept. In the specific equation $y = -x + 4$, the slope $m$ is $-1$. This indicates that for each unit increase in $x$, the value of $y$ decreases by $1$ unit.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same slope. This property arises because parallel lines extend in the same direction and never intersect, necessitating that their steepness remains constant. Hence, any line parallel to $y = -x + 4$ will also possess a slope of $-1$.

Grasping the concept of slope is essential in GCSE Mathematics, as it aids in analyzing and graphing linear equations. The slope provides insight into how the $y$-value changes in relation to the $x$-value, which is vital for predicting and comprehending the behavior of linear relationships. Therefore, if you encounter another line that is parallel to $y = -x + 4$, you can instantly recognize that its slope is $-1$, simplifying both the analysis and graphing of the line.
