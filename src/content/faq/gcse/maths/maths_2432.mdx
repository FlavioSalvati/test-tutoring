To find the equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by $ y = 2x + 4 $ and passes through the point $ (3, 2) $, we start by recognizing that parallel lines share the same slope. The slope (or gradient) of the given line is $ 2 $. Consequently, any line parallel to it will also have a slope of $ 2 $.

We will employ the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is given by:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

In this expression, $ m $ represents the slope, and $ (x_1, y_1) $ is a point that lies on the line. For our case, we have $ m = 2 $ and the point $ (3, 2) $.

Substituting these values into the point-slope form yields:

$$
y - 2 = 2(x - 3)
$$

Next, we will simplify this equation to convert it into the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $:

Starting with:

$$
y - 2 = 2(x - 3)
$$

Distributing the $ 2 $:

$$
y - 2 = 2x - 6
$$

Now, we will isolate $ y $:

$$
y = 2x - 6 + 2
$$

Combining the constants gives:

$$
y = 2x - 4
$$

Thus, the equation of the line that is parallel to $ y = 2x + 4 $ and passes through the point $ (3, 2) $ is:

$$
y = 2x - 4
$$
