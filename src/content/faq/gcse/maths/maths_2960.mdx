The conditional probability of selecting a red ball given that the first ball drawn was blue depends on the total number of balls in the bag.

To calculate this conditional probability, we need to know the initial quantities of red and blue balls in the bag. Let's denote the number of red balls as $R$ and the number of blue balls as $B$. After drawing the first ball, which turns out to be blue, we are left with $R$ red balls and $B - 1$ blue balls.

The conditional probability is determined by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes after the first event. In this scenario, the favorable outcomes consist of the remaining red balls, which equals $R$. The total number of possible outcomes is the sum of the remaining red balls and the remaining blue balls, which is $R + (B - 1)$.

Therefore, the conditional probability $ P(\text{Red} \mid \text{Blue}) $ is expressed as:

$$
P(\text{Red} \mid \text{Blue}) = \frac{R}{R + B - 1}
$$

To illustrate this with an example, suppose we start with 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. After drawing one blue ball, we would have 3 red balls and 1 blue ball remaining. The conditional probability of selecting a red ball next would then be calculated as follows:

$$
P(\text{Red} \mid \text{Blue}) = \frac{3}{3 + 1} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
$$

This indicates that there is a 75% chance of drawing a red ball after having already drawn a blue one.
