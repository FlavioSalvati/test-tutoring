To calculate the total price of $7$ items, each priced at £$2.75$, you simply multiply the quantity of items by the price per item.

To break this down further, begin with the cost of one item, which is £$2.75$. You will need to determine the total cost for $7$ items. This is a straightforward multiplication problem: multiply the number of items ($7$) by the price of each item (£$2.75$).

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. Start with the multiplication expression: 
   $$ 
   7 \times £2.75 
   $$

2. Now, multiply $7$ by $2.75$. You can simplify this process by breaking it down into smaller steps:
   - First, multiply $7$ by $2$, which gives you $14$.
   - Next, multiply $7$ by $0.75$. To make this easier, you can separate $0.75$ into $0.5$ and $0.25$:
     - Calculate $7 \times 0.5 = 3.5$.
     - Then, calculate $7 \times 0.25 = 1.75$.
   - Now, add these two results together: 
     $$ 
     3.5 + 1.75 = 5.25 
     $$

3. Finally, add the two parts together: 
   $$ 
   14 + 5.25 = 19.25 
   $$

Thus, the total price for $7$ items at £$2.75$ each is £$19.25$. This method clearly outlines each step of the multiplication process, making it easier for you to tackle similar problems in the future.
