A perfect negative correlation is visually represented by a straight line that slopes downward on a scatter plot.

To elaborate, a perfect negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases at a consistent rate. This relationship is quantified by a correlation coefficient of $-1$. On a scatter plot, this would manifest as all data points aligning perfectly along a straight line that extends from the top left to the bottom right. For instance, if you were to plot the number of hours studied against the number of mistakes made on a test, a perfect negative correlation would demonstrate that more hours of study consistently result in fewer mistakes.

In mathematical terms, consider two variables, $X$ and $Y$. A perfect negative correlation implies that for every unit increase in $X$, there is a proportional unit decrease in $Y$. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:

$$Y = -mX + c$$

where $m$ represents the slope of the line and $c$ denotes the Y-intercept. The negative sign in the equation indicates the inverse relationship between the two variables.

Understanding perfect negative correlation is crucial because it allows for the prediction of one variable based on the value of the other. For example, if there is a perfect negative correlation between the amount of exercise and body weight, one can predict that an increase in exercise will lead to a decrease in body weight. This concept is extensively utilized in various fields, including economics, biology, and social sciences, for analyzing and interpreting data effectively.
