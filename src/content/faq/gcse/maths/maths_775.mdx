To convert a fraction into a percentage, you need to multiply the fraction by $100$ and then add the percent symbol ($\%$).

A fraction represents a part of a whole. To express this part as a percentage, you must determine how many parts it comprises out of $100$. This is because a percentage is fundamentally a fraction out of $100$. For instance, consider the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$. We want to find out how this fraction translates when expressed as a percentage.

To begin, multiply the numerator (the top number) of the fraction by $100$. For the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, this means calculating $3 \times 100$, which equals $300$. Next, you divide this result by the denominator (the bottom number) of the fraction. In this case, you divide $300$ by $4$, resulting in $75$. Therefore, the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ can be expressed as $75\%$.

Let's look at another example: the fraction $\frac{1}{5}$. Start by multiplying the numerator, $1$, by $100$ to obtain $100$. Next, divide this result by the denominator, $5$, which gives you $20$. Thus, the fraction $\frac{1}{5}$ corresponds to $20\%$.

If you encounter a more complex fraction, such as $\frac{7}{8}$, the same procedure applies. Multiply $7$ by $100$ to get $700$. Then, divide $700$ by $8$, which equals $87.5$. Therefore, the fraction $\frac{7}{8}$ is equivalent to $87.5\%$.

In summary, the essential steps for converting any fraction to a percentage are as follows: first, multiply the numerator by $100$; second, divide by the denominator; and finally, add the percent symbol. This straightforward method allows you to easily convert fractions into percentages.
