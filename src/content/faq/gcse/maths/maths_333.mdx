The relationship between the volumes of similar shapes is determined by the cube of the ratio of their corresponding lengths.

When analyzing similar shapes, it is essential to recognize that their corresponding dimensions are proportional. This implies that if you have two similar shapes, the ratio of any pair of corresponding lengths—such as heights, widths, or depths—will remain constant. We can denote this ratio as $k$. For instance, if one shape is twice as tall as another, then we have $k = 2$.

The relationship for volumes is slightly more intricate. Since volume is a three-dimensional measure, it scales according to the cube of the ratio of the corresponding lengths. In mathematical terms, if the ratio of the corresponding lengths is $k$, then the ratio of the volumes is given by $k^3$. For example, if one shape is twice as tall, wide, and deep as another (which means $k = 2$), the volume of the larger shape will be $2^3 = 8$ times greater than that of the smaller shape.

This principle is universally applicable to all similar shapes, including cubes, spheres, pyramids, and any other three-dimensional figures. Grasping this concept is vital for solving problems related to scaling in geometry, as it allows you to predict how changes in dimensions will influence the overall size of the shape. Therefore, always keep in mind: for similar shapes, the volume ratio is the cube of the length ratio!
