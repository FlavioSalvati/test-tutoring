An ordered pair is a collection of two elements arranged in a specific sequence, typically represented as $(x, y)$.

In mathematics, ordered pairs are used to denote points in a coordinate system, such as the Cartesian plane. The first element of the pair, commonly referred to as $x$, indicates the horizontal position, while the second element, $y$, signifies the vertical position. For instance, the ordered pair $(3, 5)$ represents a point that is $3$ units to the right of the origin and $5$ units above it.

The sequence of elements in an ordered pair is essential, as $(x, y)$ is distinct from $(y, x)$. For example, the pairs $(2, 4)$ and $(4, 2)$ correspond to different points on the Cartesian plane. This specific ordering is crucial for accurately locating and differentiating points in a two-dimensional space.

Ordered pairs are employed in a variety of mathematical contexts beyond geometry, including functions and relations. In the context of a function, each input $x$ is associated with exactly one output $y$, which can be represented using ordered pairs. For example, if we define a function as $f(x) = x + 2$, the ordered pair $(3, 5)$ illustrates that when $x$ equals $3$, the output $y$ equals $5$.

A solid understanding of ordered pairs is fundamental in GCSE Maths, as they form the basis for graphing equations, analyzing functions, and solving problems in coordinate geometry.
