An example of ratio data is the height of students in a classroom, which is measured in centimeters.

Ratio data is a specific type of quantitative data that features a true zero point. This means that a measurement of zero indicates a complete absence of the quantity being measured. This characteristic distinguishes ratio data from interval data. While both types of data measure quantities, interval data lacks a true zero point. For example, temperature measured in degrees Celsius is considered interval data because a temperature of $0\,^\circ\text{C}$ does not signify a complete absence of temperature; it merely represents a specific point on the temperature scale.

In the context of height, if a student measures $0$ centimeters, it indicates that the student has no height, which represents a meaningful zero. This property enables a wide range of mathematical operations on ratio data, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For instance, if one student is $150$ cm tall and another is $75$ cm tall, we can conclude that the first student is twice the height of the second student.

Additionally, ratio data allows for the calculation of meaningful averages and other statistical measures. For example, if you have the heights of all the students in a classroom, you can compute the average height, determine the range of heights, and even calculate the standard deviation to assess how much the heights vary.

Understanding ratio data is essential because it offers the most comprehensive information and flexibility for analysis. This makes it a powerful tool in both academic research and real-world applications.
