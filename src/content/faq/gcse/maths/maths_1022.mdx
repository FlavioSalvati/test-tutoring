The surface area of a sphere is calculated using the formula 

$$
A = 4\pi r^2,
$$ 

where $ r $ represents the radius of the sphere.

To clarify this concept, letâ€™s break it down further. A sphere is a perfectly round three-dimensional object, resembling a ball. The surface area refers to the total area that the outer surface of the sphere encompasses. The formula $ 4\pi r^2 $ allows us to compute this area effectively. In this formula, $ \pi $ (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $ 3.14159 $, and $ r $ is the radius of the sphere, which is the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on its surface.

For example, consider a sphere with a radius of $ 3 \, \text{cm} $. To determine its surface area, we substitute the radius into the formula:

$$ 
A = 4\pi r^2 
$$

Substituting $ r = 3 $:

$$ 
A = 4\pi (3)^2 
$$

Calculating further, we get:

$$ 
A = 4\pi (9) 
$$

This simplifies to:

$$ 
A = 36\pi 
$$

If you wish to obtain a numerical approximation, you can multiply $ 36 $ by $ \pi $:

$$ 
A \approx 36 \times 3.14159 \approx 113.1 \, \text{cm}^2 
$$

Thus, the surface area of a sphere with a radius of $ 3 \, \text{cm} $ is approximately $ 113.1 \, \text{cm}^2 $. This formula is widely applicable in various fields, including physics, engineering, and even in everyday scenarios involving spherical objects.
