The period of the function $ y = \cos(x) $ is $ 2\pi $ radians.

To elaborate, the period of a function refers to the length of the interval over which the function repeats itself. For the cosine function, $ y = \cos(x) $, this repeating interval is $ 2\pi $ radians. This indicates that if you begin at any point on the graph of $ y = \cos(x) $ and move $ 2\pi $ radians along the x-axis, the graph will appear identical to how it did at the starting point.

To grasp why the period is $ 2\pi $, consider the unit circle. The cosine of an angle $ x $ is represented by the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle that corresponds to that angle. As you traverse the unit circle, the x-coordinate—and consequently the cosine value—repeats every full rotation, which is $ 2\pi $ radians. Hence, we have the relationship $ \cos(x) = \cos(x + 2\pi) $ for any value of $ x $.

In practical terms, if you were to graph $ y = \cos(x) $, you would observe a wave-like pattern that repeats every $ 2\pi $ units along the x-axis. This periodic nature is a fundamental characteristic of trigonometric functions, such as cosine and sine, making them highly valuable for modeling cyclical phenomena, including sound waves, light waves, and seasonal patterns.
