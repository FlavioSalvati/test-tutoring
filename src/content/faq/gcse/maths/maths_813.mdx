Here’s the enhanced content for clarity and readability:

The total cost of purchasing 8 items, each priced at £3.25, amounts to £26.00.

To determine the total cost of multiple items, you multiply the price of a single item by the total number of items. In this scenario, each item costs £3.25 and you are buying 8 items. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

$$ 
3.25 \times 8 = 26.00 
$$

This indicates that acquiring 8 items at a unit price of £3.25 will result in a total expenditure of £26.00.

Let’s simplify this further. To compute £3.25 multiplied by 8, you can approach it by first calculating £3.25 multiplied by 10 and then subtracting the cost of 2 items (since $10 - 2 = 8$).

First, we calculate:

$$ 
3.25 \times 10 = 32.50 
$$

Next, we find the cost of 2 items:

$$ 
3.25 \times 2 = 6.50 
$$

Now, we subtract this amount from the previous result:

$$ 
32.50 - 6.50 = 26.00 
$$

Thus, the total cost for 8 items at a price of £3.25 each is indeed £26.00. This method not only aids in mental arithmetic but also enhances your understanding of the multiplication and subtraction processes in a practical context.
