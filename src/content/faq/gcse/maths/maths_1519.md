The probability of drawing two red cards consecutively without replacement from a standard deck is given as $\frac{25}{102}$.

To clarify this calculation, let's analyze the situation step by step. A standard deck of cards contains a total of $52$ cards, which includes $26$ red cards (comprising $13$ hearts and $13$ diamonds) and $26$ black cards (which consist of $13$ clubs and $13$ spades). 

When we draw the first card, the probability that it is red is given by the ratio of red cards to the total number of cards, which is 

$$
\frac{26}{52}.
$$

This fraction simplifies to 

$$
\frac{1}{2}.
$$

After the first red card is drawn, it is not replaced in the deck. Consequently, there are now $51$ cards remaining, of which $25$ are red. Therefore, the probability of drawing a second red card is 

$$
\frac{25}{51}.
$$

To determine the overall probability of both events occurring (drawing two red cards in succession without replacement), we apply the multiplication rule for probabilities. This involves multiplying the probabilities of the individual draws:

$$
\left(\frac{26}{52}\right) \times \left(\frac{25}{51}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{25}{51}\right) = \frac{25}{102}.
$$

Thus, the probability of successfully drawing two red cards without replacement is 

$$
\frac{25}{102}.
$$

This fraction is in its simplest form and cannot be reduced further. This approach exemplifies the multiplication rule for dependent events, where the outcome of the first draw influences the outcome of the second.
