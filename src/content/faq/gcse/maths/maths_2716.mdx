To determine an angle using the sine ratio, you will need to utilize the inverse sine function on your calculator.

The sine ratio describes the relationship between the length of the opposite side of a right-angled triangle and the hypotenuse. If you know the lengths of these two sides, you can calculate the angle. The formula for the sine ratio is given by:

$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

To solve for the angle $\theta$, you will employ the inverse sine function, which is commonly represented as $\sin^{-1}$ or $\arcsin$.

For example, if the length of the opposite side is $3$ units and the hypotenuse is $5$ units, you can establish the equation:

$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}
$$

To find $\theta$, you will then use your calculator to compute the inverse sine of $\frac{3}{5}$. On most calculators, this can be done by pressing the 'sin⁻¹' button and entering the fraction $\frac{3}{5}$. This will yield the angle in degrees.

Ensure that your calculator is set to the appropriate mode (degrees or radians) based on the requirements of the problem. For GCSE Maths, you will typically work in degrees. If your calculator is set to the incorrect mode, your result may be inaccurate.

Thus, when you input $\sin^{-1}(\frac{3}{5})$ into your calculator, you should obtain approximately $36.87$ degrees. This value represents the measure of the angle $\theta$ in your right-angled triangle.
