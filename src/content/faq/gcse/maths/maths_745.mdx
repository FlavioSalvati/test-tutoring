The limits of accuracy for the number $7.82$ when rounded to two decimal places are $7.815$ and $7.825$.

When rounding a number to two decimal places, we ensure that it is accurate to the nearest hundredth. In this instance, $7.82$ is the rounded value. To establish the limits of accuracy, we need to identify the smallest and largest numbers that would round to $7.82$ when rounded to two decimal places.

The smallest number that rounds to $7.82$ is $7.815$. Any number less than $7.815$ would round down to $7.81$, while $7.815$ itself rounds up to $7.82$. Conversely, the largest number that rounds to $7.82$ is $7.824999...$, which we can effectively consider as $7.825$ for practical purposes. Any number greater than $7.825$ would round up to $7.83$.

Thus, the limits of accuracy for $7.82$ extend from $7.815$ to just under $7.825$. This range guarantees that any number within these bounds, when rounded to two decimal places, will yield $7.82$. Understanding these limits is essential in various contexts, such as measurements and calculations, where precision is of utmost importance.
