To determine what 40% of 80 is, we start by understanding the concept of percentages. A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. Therefore, 40% translates to 40 out of 100. To calculate 40% of 80, we can apply the following formula:

$$
\text{Percentage} \times \text{Whole Number} = \text{Part of the Whole}
$$

In this scenario, the percentage is $40\%$ and the whole number is $80$. The first step is to convert the percentage into a decimal by dividing by $100$:

$$
40\% = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4
$$

Next, we multiply this decimal by the whole number:

$$
0.4 \times 80 = 32
$$

Thus, $40\%$ of $80$ is $32$. This method can be applied to find any percentage of any whole number. Just remember to convert the percentage to a decimal first by dividing by $100$, and then multiply it by the whole number. This straightforward process allows you to determine the portion of the whole that the percentage represents.
