The expected frequency of drawing a heart 13 times in 52 trials is $13$.

In a standard deck of $52$ playing cards, there are $13$ hearts. When you draw a card from the deck and then replace it, the probability of drawing a heart is $\frac{13}{52}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{4}$. This indicates that for each individual draw, there is a $25\%$ chance of drawing a heart.

When conducting $52$ trials, you can utilize the concept of expected frequency to estimate how many times you would expect to draw a heart. The expected frequency is calculated by multiplying the probability of the event by the total number of trials. In this scenario, the probability of drawing a heart, $\frac{1}{4}$, is multiplied by the number of trials, which is $52$.

The calculation can be expressed as follows:
$$ 
\text{Expected frequency} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 52 = 13 
$$

This means that if you were to draw a card $52$ times, replacing the card after each draw, you would expect to draw a heart approximately $13$ times. It's important to note that this is an average value; therefore, the actual number of hearts drawn in any specific set of trials may vary slightly due to the inherent randomness of each draw. However, over numerous sets of $52$ trials, the average number of hearts drawn will tend to converge around $13$.
