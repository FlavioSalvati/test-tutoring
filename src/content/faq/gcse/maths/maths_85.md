The lower bound for $67.8$ rounded to one decimal place is $67.75$.

When we refer to the lower bound of a number rounded to one decimal place, we mean the smallest value that can still round up to that number. In this case, the number is $67.8$. To determine the lower bound, we must identify the range of values that will round to $67.8$ when rounded to one decimal place.

A number will round to $67.8$ if it is at least $67.75$ but less than $67.85$. This is because any number in the range from $67.75$ up to, but not including, $67.85$ will be rounded to $67.8$ when rounding to one decimal place. Hence, we conclude that the lower bound is $67.75$.

To clarify this concept further, let's consider how rounding operates. When rounding a number to one decimal place, you examine the digit in the second decimal place. If this digit is $5$ or greater, you round up the first decimal place. Conversely, if it is $4$ or lower, the first decimal place remains unchanged. Therefore, for the number $67.8$, the smallest value that rounds up to $67.8$ is $67.75$, since $67.749$ would round down to $67.7$. This is the reason why $67.75$ is established as the lower bound for $67.8$ when rounded to one decimal place.
