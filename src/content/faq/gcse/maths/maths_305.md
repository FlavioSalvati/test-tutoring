The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by the equation $ y = -4x + 1 $ is $ \frac{1}{4} $.

To understand this, we first need to identify the gradient of the original line. The equation $ y = -4x + 1 $ is in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the gradient. In this case, the gradient $ m $ is $ -4 $.

A fundamental property of perpendicular lines is that the product of their gradients equals $ -1 $. This means that if the gradient of one line is $ m $, then the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to it can be calculated using the formula:

$$ m_{\text{perpendicular}} = -\frac{1}{m} $$

Given that the gradient of our original line is $ -4 $, we can substitute this value into the formula for perpendicular gradients:

$$ m_{\text{perpendicular}} = -\frac{1}{-4} = \frac{1}{4} $$

Thus, the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = -4x + 1 $ is $ \frac{1}{4} $. This indicates that for every $ 4 $ units moved horizontally, the line will rise $ 1 $ unit vertically. This slope is much gentler compared to the steep descent of the original line, which has a gradient of $ -4 $.
