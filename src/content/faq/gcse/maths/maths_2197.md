A decreasing line on a distance-time graph indicates that an object is moving back toward its starting point.

In a distance-time graph, the x-axis typically represents time, while the y-axis represents the distance from a starting point. When the line on the graph slopes downward, it signifies that the distance from the starting point is decreasing as time progresses. This implies that the object is moving in the opposite direction to its initial movement, effectively returning to its original position.

For instance, consider a scenario where you walk $100$ meters away from your house and then decide to walk back. On the distance-time graph, the line will initially rise as you move away from your house. Once you turn around and begin your return journey, the line will start to decrease, illustrating that the distance between you and your house is diminishing.

It's essential to recognize that a decreasing line does not necessarily indicate that the object is slowing down. The steepness of the line reflects the speed of the object: a steeper line corresponds to a faster speed, while a gentler slope indicates a slower speed. Therefore, a steep decreasing line suggests that the object is quickly returning to the starting point, whereas a gentle decreasing line would imply a slower return.

Grasping this concept is vital for accurately interpreting distance-time graphs, as it enables you to ascertain not only the movement of the object but also its direction and speed.
