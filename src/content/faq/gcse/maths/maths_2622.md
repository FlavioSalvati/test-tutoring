The conversion factor from centimeters to millimeters is $10$.

To convert measurements from centimeters to millimeters, you simply multiply the number of centimeters by $10$. This is because each centimeter consists of $10$ millimeters. For instance, if you have a length of $5$ centimeters and wish to convert it to millimeters, you would perform the calculation:

$$
5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ millimeters}.
$$

Understanding this conversion is quite straightforward. Consider this: a centimeter is a larger unit than a millimeter. Since a millimeter is one-tenth of a centimeter, it follows that $10$ millimeters are needed to make up one centimeter. Therefore, you multiply by $10$ when converting from centimeters to millimeters.

Letâ€™s look at another example. Suppose you have a measurement of $7.2$ centimeters. To convert this to millimeters, you would multiply $7.2$ by $10$, resulting in:

$$
7.2 \times 10 = 72 \text{ millimeters}.
$$

This method is applicable for any quantity in centimeters, whether it is a whole number or a decimal.

Keep in mind that unit conversion is a valuable skill in various fields of mathematics and science. It enables you to understand and compare different measurements more effectively. So, whenever you need to convert from centimeters to millimeters, just remember to multiply by $10$, and you'll arrive at your answer quickly!
