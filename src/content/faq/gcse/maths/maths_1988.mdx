To convert hours into minutes, you simply multiply the number of hours by 60.

Time conversion between hours and minutes is quite straightforward, as there are exactly 60 minutes in one hourâ€”a fundamental unit of time measurement. Therefore, to convert hours into minutes, the process is as simple as multiplying the number of hours by 60.

For instance, if you have $3$ hours and wish to find out how many minutes that equates to, you would perform the following calculation:

$$
3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}
$$

Thus, $3$ hours is equal to $180$ minutes. This conversion method can be applied to any number of hours you wish to convert into minutes. The key point to remember is that $1$ hour is equivalent to $60$ minutes. 

This conversion is particularly useful in various real-life scenarios, such as calculating travel times, determining cooking durations, or even organizing your daily schedule.

Moreover, understanding this basic conversion can assist you in tackling more complex problems that involve converting between different units of time, such as seconds, hours, and days. Keep practicing these conversions to build your confidence in managing time-related questions, especially in your GCSE Maths exams.
