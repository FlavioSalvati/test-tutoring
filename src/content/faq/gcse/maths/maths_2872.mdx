To determine the magnitude of the vector $(5, -5)$, we can calculate it as $\sqrt{50}$, which is approximately $7.07$.

The magnitude of a vector can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. We can visualize the vector $(5, -5)$ as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the x-component is $5$ and the y-component is $-5$. The length of the vector represents the hypotenuse of this triangle.

The formula to calculate the magnitude of a vector $(a, b)$ is given by:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

In our case, $a$ is $5$ and $b$ is $-5$. Substituting these values into the formula gives:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{5^2 + (-5)^2}
$$
$$
= \sqrt{25 + 25}
$$
$$
= \sqrt{50}
$$
$$
= \sqrt{25 \times 2}
$$
$$
= 5\sqrt{2}
$$

For a decimal approximation, $\sqrt{50}$ is about $7.07$. Thus, the vector $(5, -5)$ has a length of approximately $7.07$ units. 

Understanding how to compute the magnitude of a vector is crucial in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it enables you to determine the size or length of the vector, independent of its direction.
