The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by 

$$
A = 4\pi r^2,
$$ 

where $A$ represents the surface area and $r$ is the radius of the sphere.

To gain a clearer understanding of this formula, let's break it down. The symbol $\pi$ (pi) is a mathematical constant that is approximately equal to $3.14159$. It represents the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. The variable $r$ denotes the radius of the sphere, which is the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on its surface.

The formula $A = 4\pi r^2$ indicates that to calculate the surface area of a sphere, we must multiply $4$ by $\pi$ and then by the square of the radius. Squaring the radius involves multiplying the radius by itself. For instance, if the radius of a sphere is $3$ cm, we first square the radius:

$$
3^2 = 9.
$$ 

Next, we multiply this result by $\pi$ and $4$:

$$
A = 4 \times \pi \times 9.
$$ 

Using the approximate value of $\pi$, this calculation becomes:

$$
A \approx 4 \times 3.14159 \times 9 \approx 113.1 \text{ square centimeters}.
$$ 

While the derivation of this formula involves more advanced mathematical concepts, including calculus, for the purposes of GCSE Maths, it is sufficient to know how to apply it. The surface area of a sphere is significant in various real-world applications, such as determining the amount of material needed to create a spherical object or calculating the area exposed to the environment in scientific experiments.
