To determine the interquartile range (IQR) using a cumulative frequency graph, you must identify the values corresponding to the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3).

The interquartile range measures the dispersion of the middle 50% of your data, calculated as the difference between the value at the 75th percentile and the value at the 25th percentile:

$$ \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 $$

Hereâ€™s how to find these values on a cumulative frequency graph:

1. **Locate the Total Frequency**: Begin by identifying the total number of data points, which is represented by the highest point on the cumulative frequency axis.

2. **Find Q1**: Calculate 25% of the total frequency. For example, if the total frequency is 100, then $25\%$ of it is $25$. Draw a horizontal line from this value on the cumulative frequency axis to the curve. Then, drop a vertical line from the curve down to the horizontal axis. The point where this vertical line intersects the horizontal axis is Q1.

3. **Find Q3**: Calculate 75% of the total frequency. For instance, if the total frequency is 100, then $75\%$ of it is $75$. Again, draw a horizontal line from this value on the cumulative frequency axis to the curve, and drop a vertical line from the curve to the horizontal axis. The point where this vertical line intersects the horizontal axis is Q3.

4. **Calculate the IQR**: Now, subtract Q1 from Q3:

$$ \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 $$

By following these steps, you can accurately determine the interquartile range from a cumulative frequency graph, providing valuable insights into the spread and distribution of your data.
