To convert $0.75$ hours into minutes, we start by acknowledging that there are $60$ minutes in one hour. This basic unit conversion is commonly used in various mathematical problems and everyday situations. To determine how many minutes are in $0.75$ hours, you simply multiply by $60$.

The calculation is as follows:

$$
0.75 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 45 \text{ minutes}
$$

Thus, we find that $0.75$ hours is equivalent to $45$ minutes. Mastering this conversion is particularly beneficial for many GCSE Maths problems, especially those that involve calculations with time. For instance, if you're tasked with adding or subtracting time, being able to convert between hours and minutes simplifies the process significantly.

Additionally, this conversion is invaluable in everyday life. Whether you are cooking, planning a trip, or organizing your schedule, the ability to quickly convert hours to minutes can enhance your efficiency and help you stay organized.
