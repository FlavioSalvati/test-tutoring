To solve the equation $5x + 2 = 17$, we will first isolate the variable $x$. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the process.

Starting with the original equation:

$$
5x + 2 = 17
$$

The first step is to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting $2$ from both sides of the equation:

$$
5x + 2 - 2 = 17 - 2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
5x = 15
$$

Now, we need to solve for $x$ by removing the coefficient $5$ that is multiplied by $x$. We accomplish this by dividing both sides of the equation by $5$:

$$
\frac{5x}{5} = \frac{15}{5}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = 3
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation $5x + 2 = 17$ is $x = 3$. This indicates that when $x$ is $3$, the original equation holds true. 

To verify our solution, we can substitute $x = 3$ back into the original equation:

$$
5(3) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17
$$

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is confirmed to be correct.
