The graph of the function $ y = x^3 $ is a smooth, continuous curve that passes through the origin and exhibits an S-shaped profile.

To identify the graph of $ y = x^3 $, it's important to recognize that it represents a cubic function, characterized by the variable $ x $ raised to the third power. Notably, the graph is symmetric about the origin, which indicates that if it were rotated 180 degrees around the origin, it would appear unchanged. This property is referred to as rotational symmetry.

The curve intersects the origin at the point $ (0,0) $, which is a significant feature of the graph. As the value of $ x $ increases, the value of $ y $ also increases, but at an accelerating rate due to the cubic nature of the function. For positive values of $ x $, the graph rises steeply to the right. Conversely, for negative values of $ x $, the graph descends sharply to the left. This behavior creates the characteristic S-shape, where the central portion near the origin is relatively flat, while the ends curve steeply upwards and downwards.

Another method for recognizing the graph involves analyzing its slope. The slope of the graph changes continuously: it is zero at the origin, positive for positive values of $ x $, and negative for negative values of $ x $. This indicates that there is a point of inflection at the origin, where the concavity of the graph transitions.

To aid in sketching the graph, you can plot several key points. For instance, when $ x = 1 $, $ y = 1 $; when $ x = -1 $, $ y = -1 $; when $ x = 2 $, $ y = 8 $; and when $ x = -2 $, $ y = -8 $. These points help to illustrate the steep ascent and descent of the curve, confirming its distinct S-shaped structure.
