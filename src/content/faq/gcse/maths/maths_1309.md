To determine the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with side lengths of $8 \, \text{cm}$ and $15 \, \text{cm}$, we can apply Pythagoras' Theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

where $ c $ represents the length of the hypotenuse, and $ a $ and $ b $ represent the lengths of the other two sides.

In our case, we can set $ a = 8 \, \text{cm} $ and $ b = 15 \, \text{cm} $. To find the hypotenuse $ c $, we can substitute these values into the equation:

$$
c^2 = 8^2 + 15^2
$$

Calculating the squares of the lengths, we have:

$$
c^2 = 64 + 225
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
c^2 = 289
$$

To find $ c $, we take the square root of $289$:

$$
c = \sqrt{289}
$$
$$
c = 17
$$

Thus, the hypotenuse of the triangle measures $17 \, \text{cm}$. 

Understanding Pythagoras' Theorem is crucial in GCSE Maths and is vital for solving problems related to right-angled triangles. Always ensure that the triangle in question is indeed a right-angled triangle before applying this theorem.
