The expanded form of the expression $ 5(b + 4) $ is $ 5b + 20 $.

To expand the expression $ 5(b + 4) $, we apply the distributive property of multiplication over addition. This property can be expressed as $ a(b + c) = ab + ac $. In this instance, we multiply the number $ 5 $ by each term within the parentheses.

First, we multiply $ 5 $ by the variable $ b $, yielding $ 5b $. Next, we multiply $ 5 $ by the constant $ 4 $, which gives us $ 20 $. When we combine these two results, we arrive at the expanded expression $ 5b + 20 $.

Expanding expressions is a fundamental skill in algebra, as it simplifies and facilitates the solving of equations. By rewriting the expression $ 5(b + 4) $ as $ 5b + 20 $, we create a form that is easier to manipulate in subsequent calculations or when solving for $ b $. This technique is especially beneficial when working with more complex algebraic expressions and equations.
