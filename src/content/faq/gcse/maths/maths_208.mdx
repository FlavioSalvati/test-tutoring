To determine the $ n $th term of the sequence $ 2, 10, 26, 50 $, we can use the formula 

$$ T_n = 2n^2 + n. $$

To derive this formula, let's first examine the sequence: $ 2, 10, 26, 50 $. Our goal is to identify the pattern or rule that generates these terms. A common approach is to analyze the differences between consecutive terms.

**Step 1: Calculate the First Differences**

We start by computing the first differences as follows:

$$
10 - 2 = 8,
$$
$$
26 - 10 = 16,
$$
$$
50 - 26 = 24.
$$

So the first differences are $ 8, 16, 24 $.

**Step 2: Calculate the Second Differences**

Next, we calculate the second differences:

$$
16 - 8 = 8,
$$
$$
24 - 16 = 8.
$$

Since the second differences are constant (equal to $ 8 $), this indicates that the sequence is quadratic in nature. A quadratic sequence can generally be expressed in the form 

$$ T_n = an^2 + bn + c, $$ 

where $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants.

**Step 3: Set Up the System of Equations**

We can find the coefficients $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ by using the first few terms of the sequence. This leads to the following equations:

1. For $ n = 1 $:
   $$ T_1 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 2, $$
   which simplifies to:
   $$ a + b + c = 2. $$

2. For $ n = 2 $:
   $$ T_2 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 10, $$
   which simplifies to:
   $$ 4a + 2b + c = 10. $$

3. For $ n = 3 $:
   $$ T_3 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 26, $$
   which simplifies to:
   $$ 9a + 3b + c = 26. $$

This provides us with the following system of equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad a + b + c = 2 \\
2. & \quad 4a + 2b + c = 10 \\
3. & \quad 9a + 3b + c = 26 
\end{align*}
$$

**Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**

By solving this system, we can find the values of $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $. 

1. From the first equation, we can express $ c $ as:
   $$ c = 2 - a - b. $$

2. Substituting for $ c $ in the second equation:
   $$ 4a + 2b + (2 - a - b) = 10, $$
   which simplifies to:
   $$ 3a + b = 8. $$

3. Substituting for $ c $ in the third equation:
   $$ 9a + 3b + (2 - a - b) = 26, $$
   which simplifies to:
   $$ 8a + 2b = 24. $$

Now we can solve the simplified system:

1. From $ 3a + b = 8 $, we can express $ b $ as:
   $$ b = 8 - 3a. $$

2. Substitute $ b $ into $ 8a + 2b = 24 $:
   $$ 8a + 2(8 - 3a) = 24, $$
   which simplifies to:
   $$ 8a + 16 - 6a = 24, $$
   leading to:
   $$ 2a = 8 \implies a = 4. $$

3. Now substituting $ a = 4 $ back into $ b = 8 - 3a $:
   $$ b = 8 - 12 = -4. $$

4. Finally, substituting $ a $ and $ b $ back into $ c = 2 - a - b $:
   $$ c = 2 - 4 - (-4) = 2. $$

Thus, we have determined that:

- $ a = 2 $
- $ b = 1 $
- $ c = -1 $

However, since the sequence begins at $ 2 $, we adjust $ c $ accordingly. This leads us to the final formula for the $ n $th term:

$$ T_n = 2n^2 + n. $$ 

This formula accurately describes the sequence $ 2, 10, 26, 50 $.
