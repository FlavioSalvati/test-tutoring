The length of one leg of the triangle is approximately $8 \, \text{cm}$.

To find the length of the missing leg in a right-angled triangle, we can apply Pythagoras' Theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The relationship is expressed by the formula:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Here, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the other two legs of the triangle.

In this particular problem, we know that the hypotenuse $c$ is $10 \, \text{cm}$ and one leg $a$ measures $6 \, \text{cm}$. We need to determine the length of the other leg, $b$. By substituting the known values into the formula, we obtain:

$$
6^2 + b^2 = 10^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
36 + b^2 = 100
$$

Next, we isolate $b^2$ by subtracting $36$ from both sides:

$$
b^2 = 100 - 36
$$

This results in:

$$
b^2 = 64
$$

To find the value of $b$, we take the square root of both sides:

$$
b = \sqrt{64}
$$
$$
b = 8
$$

Consequently, the length of the other leg is $8 \, \text{cm}$. This method allows us to accurately compute the length of the missing side using fundamental algebraic principles and the properties of right-angled triangles.
