The gradient of the line defined by the equation $ y = x - 5 $ is $ 1 $.

To find the gradient of a line represented by the equation $ y = mx + c $, one must identify the coefficient of $ x $, which is denoted as $ m $. In the equation $ y = x - 5 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 1 $. This coefficient, $ m $, signifies the gradient of the line. The gradient indicates the steepness and direction of the line's slope. A positive gradient means the line rises as it moves from left to right, while a negative gradient indicates that it falls.

In the equation $ y = x - 5 $, since the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 1 $, the gradient is also $ 1 $. This implies that for each unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by $ 1 $ unit. The term $ -5 $ in the equation represents the y-intercept, which is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis. However, it is important to note that the y-intercept does not influence the gradient.

Understanding the gradient is essential for analyzing the behavior of linear functions. It allows us to predict how changes in $ x $ will impact $ y $. For instance, if you were to graph the line $ y = x - 5 $, you would begin at the y-intercept point $ (0, -5) $. Using the gradient, you can determine additional points on the line. From $ (0, -5) $, moving one unit to the right (increasing $ x $ by $ 1 $) results in moving one unit up (increasing $ y $ by $ 1 $), leading to the point $ (1, -4) $, and this pattern continues onward.
