To calculate $15\%$ of $450$ using a calculator, you need to multiply $450$ by $0.15$.

When determining a percentage of a number, the first step is to convert the percentage into its decimal form. For instance, $15\%$ can be expressed as $0.15$. To convert a percentage to a decimal, simply divide by $100$. Thus, we have:

$$
15\% = \frac{15}{100} = 0.15
$$

Next, take the number from which you want to find the percentage, which in this case is $450$, and multiply it by the decimal representation of the percentage. Using your calculator, you would input:

$$
450 \times 0.15
$$

After performing this calculation, you would find:

$$
450 \times 0.15 = 67.5
$$

Therefore, $15\%$ of $450$ is $67.5$. This method is applicable to any percentage and any number. Just remember to convert the percentage into a decimal by dividing by $100$, and then multiply by the number of interest. This straightforward approach guarantees that you arrive at the correct answer every time.
