A regular polygon is defined as a polygon in which all sides and all angles are equal.

To elaborate, a polygon is a two-dimensional shape characterized by straight sides. When we refer to a polygon as "regular," we imply that every side is of the same length and every interior angle has the same measure. This uniformity imparts a symmetrical and often aesthetically pleasing quality to regular polygons. Notable examples of regular polygons include equilateral triangles (which have three equal sides and angles), squares (which consist of four equal sides and angles), and regular pentagons (which possess five equal sides and angles).

Regular polygons can be categorized based on the number of their sides. For instance, a regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles, while a regular octagon has eight sides and angles. As the number of sides increases, a regular polygon closely approximates the shape of a circle. This occurs because the interior angles decrease and the number of sides increases, resulting in a smoother appearance.

An intriguing property of regular polygons is their ability to be inscribed within a circle. This means that all vertices (corners) of the polygon touch the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle is equidistant from all vertices, a result of the equal lengths of the sides and the equality of the angles.

Understanding regular polygons is vital in various branches of mathematics, particularly in geometry and trigonometry. Moreover, they frequently appear in everyday life, from the design of coins to architectural features, making them an engaging and practical subject of study.
