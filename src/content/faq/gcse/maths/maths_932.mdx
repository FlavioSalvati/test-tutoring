The graph of the equation $ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 $ represents a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex located at the point $ (1, 0) $.

To gain a deeper understanding of this graph, let's analyze the equation $ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 $ more closely. This equation is a quadratic in the standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, where the coefficients are $ a = 1 $, $ b = -2 $, and $ c = 1 $. Since the coefficient $ a $ is positive, we can confirm that the parabola opens upwards.

Next, we will determine the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by $ y = a(x - h)^2 + k $, where the point $ (h, k) $ represents the vertex. To convert our equation into this form, we can complete the square. Starting with the original equation $ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 $, we can factor it as follows:

$$
y = (x - 1)^2.
$$

This expression indicates that the vertex of the parabola is at the coordinates $ (1, 0) $.

The axis of symmetry for the parabola is the vertical line that intersects the vertex. In this case, the axis of symmetry is defined by the line $ x = 1 $, which bisects the parabola into two mirror-image halves.

To visualize the shape of the parabola, we can plot several points. For instance:
- When $ x = 0 $, $ y = 1 $.
- When $ x = 2 $, $ y = 1 $.
- When $ x = -1 $ or $ x = 3 $, $ y = 4 $.

By plotting these points and drawing a smooth curve through them, we can illustrate the characteristic U-shape of the parabola.

In conclusion, the graph of the equation $ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 $ is a symmetrical, upward-opening parabola, with its minimum point at the vertex $ (1, 0) $.
