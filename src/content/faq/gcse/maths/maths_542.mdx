To create a tree diagram for rolling two dice, begin by illustrating branches for each possible outcome of the first and second dice.

Start with a single point that represents the initial state before any dice are rolled. From this point, draw six branches, each corresponding to one of the possible outcomes of rolling the first die, which can result in $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, or $6$. Label each branch accordingly.

Next, from the end of each of these six branches, draw a new set of six branches. These branches represent the possible outcomes of rolling the second die. As before, label each branch with the numbers $1$ through $6$.

At this stage, your tree diagram should contain a total of $36$ endpoints, which results from multiplying the $6$ outcomes of the first die by the $6$ outcomes of the second die. Each unique path from the starting point to an endpoint symbolizes a distinct combination of outcomes from rolling the two dice. For instance, one path may extend from the starting point to a branch labeled "3" (from the first die) and then to a branch labeled "5" (from the second die), representing the outcome $(3, 5)$.

This tree diagram effectively visualizes all possible outcomes and is instrumental for calculating probabilities. For example, if you wish to determine the probability of rolling a sum of $7$, you can count the number of paths leading to this sum and divide that count by the total number of paths, which is $36$.
