Trigonometry is a powerful tool for determining a missing angle in a right-angled triangle by utilizing the sine, cosine, or tangent ratios.

To find a missing angle, start by identifying the sides of the triangle you know: 
- **Opposite**: The side opposite the angle you are trying to find.
- **Adjacent**: The side that is next to the angle you are trying to find.
- **Hypotenuse**: The longest side of the triangle, which is opposite the right angle.

Once you have determined which sides you are working with, you can apply one of the following trigonometric ratios:

- **Sine** ($\sin$): This ratio compares the length of the opposite side to that of the hypotenuse.
- **Cosine** ($\cos$): This ratio compares the length of the adjacent side to that of the hypotenuse.
- **Tangent** ($\tan$): This ratio compares the length of the opposite side to that of the adjacent side.

### Example Calculations

1. **Using Sine**:
   If you know the lengths of the opposite side and the hypotenuse, you can express the relationship using the sine function:
   $$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$
   To find the angle $\theta$, take the inverse sine (arcsine):
   $$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\right)$$

2. **Using Cosine**:
   If you have the lengths of the adjacent side and the hypotenuse, you can use the cosine function:
   $$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$
   To find the angle $\theta$, calculate:
   $$\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\right)$$

3. **Using Tangent**:
   If you know the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides, you can apply the tangent function:
   $$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$
   To find the angle $\theta$, use:
   $$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\right)$$

Using these trigonometric functions on a calculator will allow you to determine the measure of the missing angle. Be sure to set your calculator to the appropriate mode (degrees or radians) based on the specific requirements of your problem.
