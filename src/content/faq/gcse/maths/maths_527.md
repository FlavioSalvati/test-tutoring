To determine the relative frequency of an event, you need to divide the number of times that event occurs by the total number of trials conducted.

Relative frequency quantifies how often an event occurs in relation to the total number of trials. In this example, the event occurs $12$ times out of a total of $48$ trials. To calculate the relative frequency, you can use the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of times the event occurs}}{\text{Total number of trials}} 
$$

Applying this formula, we have:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{12}{48} 
$$

When you perform the division of $12$ by $48$, the result is $0.25$. This indicates that the relative frequency of the event occurring is $0.25$.

Relative frequency can also be expressed as a percentage. To convert $0.25$ into a percentage, simply multiply it by $100$:

$$ 
0.25 \times 100 = 25\% 
$$

Thus, the event occurs $25\%$ of the time. This method provides valuable insights into the likelihood of an event based on historical data, making it a crucial concept in probability and statistics.
