A rectangle possesses two lines of symmetry: one vertical and one horizontal.

To identify the lines of symmetry in a rectangle, we must locate the lines that divide the shape into two identical halves. For a rectangle, these lines consist of a vertical line that runs through the center from the top to the bottom, and a horizontal line that extends from the left to the right through the center. These lines ensure that each half of the rectangle is a mirror image of the other.

The vertical line of symmetry can be established by drawing a line from the midpoint of the top side to the midpoint of the bottom side. This line effectively divides the rectangle into two equal parts, each reflecting the other. In a similar manner, the horizontal line of symmetry is drawn from the midpoint of the left side to the midpoint of the right side, thereby splitting the rectangle into two equal halves.

It is crucial to note that a rectangle does not possess diagonal lines of symmetry. In contrast to a square, where the diagonals serve as lines of symmetry, the diagonals of a rectangle do not create mirror images. This discrepancy arises because the lengths of the sides are unequal, resulting in halves created by the diagonals that are not identical.

Understanding lines of symmetry is important in various areas of geometry, as it aids in analyzing shapes, solving reflection-related problems, and comprehending the properties of different polygons. For GCSE Maths, recognizing these lines in a rectangle is a fundamental skill that can be applied to more complex geometric concepts.
