Let's enhance the clarity and readability of the content while ensuring proper formatting for mathematical expressions.

The simplified form of the expression $7y - 2y + 8$ is $5y + 8$.

To simplify the expression $7y - 2y + 8$, you need to combine like terms. Like terms are those that contain the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, $7y$ and $-2y$ are like terms because they both include the variable $y$.

First, concentrate on the terms that contain the variable $y$. You start with $7y$ and then subtract $2y$ from it. When you perform this subtraction, you calculate $7 - 2$, which equals $5$. Therefore, combining these terms gives you $5y$.

Next, consider the constant term, which is $+8$. Since there are no other constant terms to combine with it, this term remains unchanged.

In summary, when you combine the like terms and retain the constant term, the expression $7y - 2y + 8$ simplifies to $5y + 8$. Mastering the process of combining like terms is an essential skill in algebra that simplifies expressions and makes them easier to work with.
