To determine the volume of a cylinder, you can use the following formula:

$$
V = \pi r^2 h
$$

In this equation, $ V $ represents the volume, $ \pi $ (pi) is approximately $3.14159$, $ r $ denotes the radius of the circular base, and $ h $ signifies the height of the cylinder. This formula calculates the volume by multiplying the area of the base (which is a circle) by the height of the cylinder.

To begin, measure the radius of the circular base. The radius is defined as the distance from the center of the circle to its edge. If you have the diameter instead, remember that the radius is half of the diameter. Next, measure the height of the cylinder, which is the distance between the two circular bases.

Once you have both the radius and the height, follow these steps to calculate the volume:

1. Square the radius (multiply it by itself).
2. Multiply the squared radius by $ \pi $.
3. Finally, multiply this result by the height of the cylinder.

This calculation will yield the volume in cubic units, indicating how much space is contained within the cylinder.

For instance, if the radius of the base is $3 \, \text{cm}$ and the height is $5 \, \text{cm}$, the volume can be calculated as follows:

$$
V = \pi \times 3^2 \times 5 = \pi \times 9 \times 5 = 45\pi
$$

Using the approximation $ \pi \approx 3.14159 $, the volume is approximately:

$$
45 \times 3.14159 \approx 141.37 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

Thus, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $141.37$ cubic centimeters.
