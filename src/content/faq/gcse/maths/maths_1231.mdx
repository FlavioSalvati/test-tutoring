To calculate the area of a sector, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
$$

To find the area, you need two key pieces of information: the radius of the circle and the angle of the sector. In this case, the radius $ r $ is $ 7 \, \text{cm} $ and the angle $ \theta $ is $ 30^\circ $. 

Let's substitute the given values into the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{30}{360} \times \pi \times 7^2
$$

Next, we can simplify the fraction $ \frac{30}{360} $:

$$
\frac{30}{360} = \frac{1}{12}
$$

Now we substitute this simplified fraction back into the area formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{12} \times \pi \times 7^2
$$

Next, we calculate $ 7^2 $:

$$
7^2 = 49
$$

Now the formula looks like this:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{12} \times \pi \times 49
$$

Next, we multiply $ \frac{1}{12} $ by $ 49 $:

$$
\frac{1}{12} \times 49 = \frac{49}{12}
$$

Finally, we multiply by $ \pi $:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{49}{12} \pi \approx 12.83 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Therefore, the area of the sector is approximately $ 12.83 \, \text{cm}^2 $.
