The perimeter of an equilateral triangle with a side length of $5 \, \text{cm}$ is $15 \, \text{cm}$.

To calculate the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, you only need to know the length of one of its sides. In an equilateral triangle, all three sides are of equal length. Thus, if one side measures $5 \, \text{cm}$, the other two sides also measure $5 \, \text{cm}$ each.

The formula for the perimeter of any triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. For an equilateral triangle, this can be expressed more simply as:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = \text{side length} \times 3
$$

In this scenario, the side length is $5 \, \text{cm}$. Therefore, we calculate the perimeter by multiplying:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 5 \, \text{cm} \times 3 = 15 \, \text{cm}
$$

Consequently, the total distance around the triangle, or its perimeter, is $15 \, \text{cm}$. This method applies universally to any equilateral triangle, irrespective of the specific side length. Just remember to multiply the side length by $3$ to determine the perimeter.
