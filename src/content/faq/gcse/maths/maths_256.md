The distance formula for calculating the distance between two points in Cartesian coordinates is given by:

$$ 
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} 
$$

To better understand this formula, let's break it down step by step. Consider two points on a graph: Point A with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and Point B with coordinates $(x_2, y_2)$. The distance formula provides a way to determine the straight-line distance between these two points. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which applies to right-angled triangles.

First, we compute the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates: $(x_2 - x_1)$ and $(y_2 - y_1)$. These differences correspond to the lengths of the two legs of a right-angled triangle formed by the points and their coordinate differences. By squaring these differences, that is, calculating $(x_2 - x_1)^2$ and $(y_2 - y_1)^2$, we ensure that the resulting values are non-negative, effectively removing any issues with negative signs.

Next, we add the squared differences together. This sum represents the square of the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle created by the points and the differences in their coordinates. Finally, taking the square root of this sum yields the actual distance between the two points.

For instance, if Point A is located at $(3, 4)$ and Point B is at $(7, 1)$, we find the coordinate differences as follows: 

- The difference in the x-coordinates is $7 - 3 = 4$.
- The difference in the y-coordinates is $1 - 4 = -3$.

Squaring these differences gives us $4^2 = 16$ and $(-3)^2 = 9$, respectively. Adding these squared values together results in $16 + 9 = 25$, and taking the square root of $25$ yields a distance of $5$. Therefore, the distance between the points $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 1)$ is $5$ units.

This distance formula is a fundamental concept in geometry and is widely utilized in various applications, ranging from simple graph plotting to complex engineering challenges.
