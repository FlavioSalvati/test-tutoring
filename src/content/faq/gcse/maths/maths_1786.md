To convert the decimal $0.05$ into a percentage, you multiply it by $100$, resulting in $5\%$.

When you convert a decimal to a percentage, you are essentially determining how many parts out of $100$ the decimal represents. Percentages provide a way to express numbers as fractions of a whole, specifically out of $100$. The term "percent" originates from the Latin phrase "per centum," which translates to "by the hundred."

To illustrate the conversion of $0.05$ to a percentage, you perform the following calculation:

$$
0.05 \times 100 = 5
$$

Thus, $0.05$ expressed as a percentage is $5\%$.

This conversion method applies to any decimal number. For instance, if you have $0.75$, multiplying it by $100$ yields $75\%$. Similarly, if you have $0.123$, the calculation would be:

$$
0.123 \times 100 = 12.3
$$

So, $0.123$ as a percentage is $12.3\%$.

It's important to note that multiplying by $100$ is equivalent to shifting the decimal point two places to the right. This technique offers a quick and straightforward way to convert decimals into percentages, which is a valuable skill applicable in various fields of mathematics, including statistics, probability, and everyday calculations such as discounts and interest rates.
