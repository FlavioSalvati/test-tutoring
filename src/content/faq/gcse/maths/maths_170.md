To find the value of the expression $5b - 7$ when $b = 2$, we begin by substituting the value of $b$ into the expression. This means we replace every occurrence of $b$ with $2$. Thus, the expression becomes:

$$
5(2) - 7.
$$

Next, we apply the order of operations, often referred to as BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). According to these rules, we perform multiplication before subtraction. Therefore, we first calculate:

$$
5 \times 2 = 10.
$$

Now, our expression simplifies to:

$$
10 - 7.
$$

We then proceed with the subtraction:

$$
10 - 7 = 3.
$$

As a result, the value of the expression $5b - 7$ when $b = 2$ is $3$.

This process of substituting a given value into an algebraic expression and simplifying it step-by-step is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths. It enhances our understanding of how variables function and how to manipulate algebraic expressions effectively. Always remember to follow the order of operations to ensure that you arrive at the correct result.
