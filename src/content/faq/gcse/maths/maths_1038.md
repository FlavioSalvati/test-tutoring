To draw a line that is parallel to a given line, you can utilize either a ruler along with a set square or a pair of compasses.

**Method 1: Using a Set Square and Ruler**

1. Begin by positioning the set square against the given line. Make sure that one edge of the set square aligns perfectly with the line.
2. Once the set square is secured in place, take a ruler and align it along the other edge of the set square. This setup will help you maintain the appropriate distance and angle for the new line.
3. Slide the set square along the ruler until it reaches the desired location for your parallel line.
4. When the set square is in the correct position, draw a line along its edge. This new line will be parallel to the original line.

**Method 2: Using Compasses**

1. Place the point of the compasses on the given line and draw an arc that intersects the line at two distinct points.
2. Without altering the width of the compasses, move the point to the location where you wish to establish the parallel line. Draw another arc that intersects the same distance as the first arc.
3. Utilize a ruler to draw a straight line through the points where the two arcs intersect. This newly drawn line will be parallel to the original line.

Both methods ensure that the new line maintains the same distance and angle in relation to the original line, thus confirming its parallelism. Practicing these techniques will enhance your confidence and precision in drawing parallel lines accurately.
