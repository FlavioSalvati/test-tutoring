To effectively utilize the tangent-secant theorem, begin by identifying the tangent and secant lines involved. The theorem can be expressed with the formula:

$$
\text{tangent}^2 = \text{external part} \times \text{whole secant}.
$$

The tangent-secant theorem is a powerful concept in circle geometry. It asserts that if a tangent and a secant are drawn from a point outside a circle, the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the external portion of the secant segment and the entire secant segment.

To apply this theorem, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Tangent and Secant**: 
   - The tangent line touches the circle at exactly one point, while the secant line intersects the circle at two distinct points. 
   - Label the point where the tangent touches the circle as $ T $.
   - Label the point where the secant first intersects the circle (closest to the external point) as $ A $, and the point where it intersects farthest from the external point as $ B $.
   - Let $ P $ denote the external point from which both the tangent and the secant are drawn.

2. **Measure the Lengths of the Segments**:
   - The length of the tangent segment from $ P $ to $ T $ is represented as $ PT $.
   - The external part of the secant is the segment from $ P $ to $ A $, which we denote as $ PA $.
   - The entire secant is the segment from $ P $ to $ B $, denoted as $ PB $.

3. **Apply the Formula**:
   - Substitute the lengths into the formula: 
   
   $$
   PT^2 = PA \times PB.
   $$
   
   This equation states that you must square the length of the tangent segment and set it equal to the product of the lengths of the external part of the secant and the entire secant. This relationship is instrumental in solving for unknown lengths in circle-related problems.
