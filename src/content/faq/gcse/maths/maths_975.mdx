To determine the gradient between two points, you can use the formula for the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$. 

To calculate the gradient (or slope) between two points on a graph, you will need the coordinates of these points. Letâ€™s denote Point A with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and Point B with coordinates $(x_2, y_2)$. The gradient indicates how steep the line connecting these two points is.

The formula for the gradient $m$ is given by:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

This formula computes the "rise" (the change in the $y$-values) over the "run" (the change in the $x$-values). To find the change in $y$, you subtract the $y$-coordinate of Point A from the $y$-coordinate of Point B. Likewise, for the change in $x$, you subtract the $x$-coordinate of Point A from the $x$-coordinate of Point B. The gradient is then obtained by dividing the change in $y$ by the change in $x$.

For instance, consider Point A with coordinates $(2, 3)$ and Point B with coordinates $(5, 11)$. The calculation for the gradient would proceed as follows:

$$
m = \frac{11 - 3}{5 - 2} = \frac{8}{3}
$$

Thus, the gradient of the line connecting these two points is $\frac{8}{3}$, which is approximately $2.67$. This implies that for every 3 units moved horizontally (along the $x$-axis), you would move 8 units vertically (along the $y$-axis). Grasping this concept is essential for analyzing linear relationships in graphs and equations.
