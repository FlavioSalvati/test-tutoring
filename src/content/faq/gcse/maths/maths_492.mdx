To add the vectors $(1, 1)$ and $(-1, -1)$, you combine their corresponding components, resulting in the vector $(0, 0)$.

When performing vector addition, you simply add the components that correspond to each axis. Vectors are typically expressed in the form $(x, y)$, where $x$ represents the horizontal component and $y$ represents the vertical component. For the vectors $(1, 1)$ and $(-1, -1)$, you will add the $x$-components together and the $y$-components together.

Let's start by adding the $x$-components: 

$$
1 + (-1) = 0.
$$ 

Next, we add the $y$-components: 

$$
1 + (-1) = 0.
$$ 

Thus, when you combine the vectors $(1, 1)$ and $(-1, -1)$, the result is the vector $(0, 0)$.

This addition can also be visualized graphically. If you begin at the origin $(0, 0)$ and move 1 unit to the right and 1 unit up—following the vector $(1, 1)$—you arrive at the point $(1, 1)$. Then, if you move 1 unit to the left and 1 unit down—following the vector $(-1, -1)$—you return to the origin $(0, 0)$. This demonstrates that the vectors $(1, 1)$ and $(-1, -1)$ effectively cancel each other out, leading to the zero vector $(0, 0)$.

Understanding vector addition is essential in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it aids in describing movements and forces within a plane. By mastering this fundamental concept, you will be better prepared to address more complex problems involving vectors.
