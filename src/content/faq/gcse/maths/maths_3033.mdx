To create a stem-and-leaf plot, you need to divide each data value into two parts: the "stem" and the "leaf."

A stem-and-leaf plot is an effective method for organizing data, allowing you to visualize the shape of the distribution and easily identify statistical measures such as the median, mode, and range. To construct this plot, begin by splitting each data value into two components: the stem, which typically consists of the leading digit(s), and the leaf, which is the final digit. For example, for the number $47$, the stem would be $4$, and the leaf would be $7$.

First, list the stems in a vertical column, arranged in ascending order. Next to each stem, record the corresponding leaves in ascending order. For instance, consider the following data set: $32, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 51, 53$. The stems extracted from this data would be $3$, $4$, and $5$. You would then organize the leaves adjacent to each stem as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{c|l}
3 & 2 \, 4 \, 5 \\
4 & 1 \, 2 \, 3 \, 5 \, 7 \\
5 & 1 \, 3 \\
\end{array}
$$

This stem-and-leaf plot illustrates that the data values range from $32$ to $53$. It is immediately evident that the $40$s contain the most data points, indicating a concentration of values within that range.

Stem-and-leaf plots are especially beneficial for small to moderately sized data sets, as they facilitate quick analysis of the distribution and help identify patterns or outliers. This visualization technique is a practical tool for presenting data in a clear and concise manner.
