The spread of a data set quantifies the extent of variation among its values and indicates how dispersed they are.

When discussing the spread of a data set, we examine how much the individual numbers differ from one another. This analysis provides valuable insights into the data. For instance, a small spread indicates that the values are closely clustered together, suggesting a high level of consistency. Conversely, a large spread reveals that the values are more widely dispersed, signifying greater variability.

There are several methods to measure the spread of a data set. One of the most common is the range, defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set. Although the range offers a quick overview of the spread, it can be heavily influenced by outliersâ€”values that are significantly higher or lower than the rest.

Another important measure is the interquartile range (IQR), which focuses on the middle $50\%$ of the data. By concentrating on this central portion, the IQR provides a more accurate representation of the typical spread while minimizing the impact of outliers.

The standard deviation is another critical measure of spread. It quantifies how much the individual values in the data set generally differ from the mean (average) value. A small standard deviation indicates that the values are closely grouped around the mean, whereas a large standard deviation suggests that the values are more dispersed.

Understanding the spread of a data set enhances our ability to analyze the data effectively, facilitating the identification of patterns, trends, and potential anomalies. It also aids in comparing different data sets to determine which one exhibits greater variability.
