The image of the point $(3, 3)$ after a $90^\circ$ counterclockwise rotation around the origin is $(-3, 3)$.

When a point is rotated $90^\circ$ counterclockwise, its coordinates undergo a specific transformation: the coordinates are swapped, and the sign of the new x-coordinate is changed. Mathematically, this means that a point $(x, y)$ is transformed into $(-y, x)$.

Let's apply this transformation to the point $(3, 3)$. First, we swap the coordinates, resulting in $(3, 3)$ becoming $(3, 3)$. Next, we change the sign of the new x-coordinate. The new x-coordinate is $3$, and changing its sign yields $-3$. Thus, after the rotation, the new coordinates are $(-3, 3)$.

This transformation can be visualized on a coordinate grid. Consider the point $(3, 3)$, which is located in the first quadrant. Upon rotating it $90^\circ$ counterclockwise, the point moves to the second quadrant, where x-coordinates are negative, and y-coordinates remain positive. This explains why the point $(3, 3)$ transforms into $(-3, 3)$ following the rotation.

Understanding these transformations is crucial for solving various geometric problems and is a fundamental concept in coordinate geometry.
