To effectively order percentages, it is helpful to convert them into either decimals or fractions, allowing for a straightforward comparison of their values.

The first step in ordering percentages is to convert each percentage into a decimal or a fraction. This conversion simplifies the process of directly comparing their values. To convert a percentage to a decimal, simply divide it by $100$. For instance, $25\%$ converts to $0.25$, $50\%$ becomes $0.50$, and $75\%$ translates to $0.75$. Alternatively, if you prefer fractions, you can express $25\%$ as $\frac{25}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{4}$; $50\%$ as $\frac{50}{100}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$; and $75\%$ as $\frac{75}{100}$ or $\frac{3}{4}$.

Once you have converted the percentages, you can compare the resulting decimals or fractions to determine their order. When comparing decimals, the number with the higher value corresponds to the larger percentage. For example, $0.75$ is greater than $0.50$, indicating that $75\%$ is greater than $50\%$. If you are working with fractions, you may need to find a common denominator to facilitate an easy comparison. For instance, to compare $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, you can convert them to have a common denominator of $4$, resulting in $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{2}{4}$, respectively. Since $\frac{2}{4}$ is greater than $\frac{1}{4}$, it follows that $50\%$ is greater than $25\%$.

After comparing the values, you can arrange the percentages in either ascending or descending order as needed. For example, if you are working with $25\%$, $50\%$, and $75\%$, you would list them in ascending order as $25\%$, $50\%$, and $75\%$, or in descending order as $75\%$, $50\%$, and $25\%$. This method ensures that you accurately compare and order percentages.
