Trigonometric ratios are essential for determining angles in three-dimensional (3D) shapes. This is accomplished by examining right-angled triangles that can be found within these shapes.

In the realm of 3D geometry, it is often necessary to calculate angles between edges, faces, or diagonals of various solids, such as cubes, pyramids, and prisms. The first step in this process is to identify right-angled triangles within the 3D shape. These triangles may be formed by connecting vertices to midpoints or by utilizing the edges and diagonals of the shape.

Once a right-angled triangle is established, you can employ trigonometric ratios—sine, cosine, and tangent—to find the angles. For instance, if you have the lengths of the sides of the triangle, you can use the tangent ratio, defined as:

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

to determine an angle. Similarly, you can use the sine ratio:

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$ 

and the cosine ratio:

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$ 

if you know the relevant side lengths.

As an example, consider a cube where you wish to find the angle between a body diagonal and one of its edges. You can create a right-angled triangle using half of the body diagonal, one edge, and the diagonal of one of the cube's faces. By calculating the lengths of these sides, you can subsequently apply the appropriate trigonometric ratios to find the desired angle.

In summary, the key steps for finding angles in 3D shapes using trigonometric ratios are: 

1. Identify the right-angled triangle.
2. Determine the lengths of its sides.
3. Apply the relevant trigonometric ratio to calculate the angle.

This method is applicable to a variety of 3D shapes, making it a valuable tool in the study of geometry.
