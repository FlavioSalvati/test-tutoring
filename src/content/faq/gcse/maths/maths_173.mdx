The expanded form of the expression $3(a - 5)$ is $3a - 15$.

To expand the expression $3(a - 5)$, we employ the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction. This property asserts that for any expression $a(b - c)$, it can be rewritten as $ab - ac$. In our case, the expression is $3(a - 5)$, where $3$ is the multiplier, $a$ is the first term within the parentheses, and $-5$ is the second term.

The expansion process begins by multiplying $3$ by $a$, yielding $3a$. Next, we multiply $3$ by $-5$, which results in $-15$. When we combine these two results, we arrive at the final expression: 

$$
3(a - 5) = 3a - 15.
$$

This technique is fundamental in algebra, as it simplifies expressions and aids in solving equations. By expanding expressions, you can more effectively combine like terms and execute other algebraic operations. It is crucial to carefully distribute the multiplier to each term inside the parentheses.

Practicing this technique will enhance your ability to manage more complex algebraic expressions and equations, particularly as you prepare for your GCSE Maths exams.
