To determine the surface area of a compound solid, you should first calculate the surface areas of the individual shapes that compose it and then sum these values.

Compound solids are three-dimensional shapes formed by the combination of two or more simpler shapes, such as cubes, cuboids, cylinders, cones, spheres, and other common 3D figures. The initial step in calculating the total surface area is to identify each distinct shape that contributes to the compound solid.

Next, compute the surface area of each individual shape. For instance, the surface area of a cube can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area of Cube} = 6 \times \text{side length}^2
$$

In contrast, the surface area of a cylinder is determined by the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi r(h + r)
$$

where $ r $ represents the radius and $ h $ denotes the height.

After calculating the surface areas of the individual shapes, it is important to consider any overlapping or hidden surfaces. In compound solids, certain surfaces may be obscured because they are either located within the solid or are connected to another shape. These hidden surfaces should be excluded from the total surface area calculation.

Finally, sum the surface areas of all the visible components of each shape to arrive at the total surface area of the compound solid. This approach ensures that you account for all external surfaces of the solid while avoiding the inclusion of any internal or obscured surfaces.

By breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable segments and carefully evaluating which surfaces are visible, you can accurately calculate the surface area of even the most complex compound solids.
