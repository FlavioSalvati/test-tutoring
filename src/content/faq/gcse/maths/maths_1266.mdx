The surface area of a compound solid composed of a cube and a hemisphere is determined by summing their individual surface areas and then subtracting the area of the hemisphere's base, which is not exposed.

To calculate the surface area of this compound solid, we first need to evaluate the surface areas of the cube and the hemisphere separately, and then combine them appropriately. 

Starting with the cube, if the side length is denoted as $a$, the surface area of the cube can be computed as follows:

$$
\text{Surface Area of the Cube} = 6a^2
$$ 

This formula arises because a cube has six faces, each with an area of $a^2$.

Next, we examine the hemisphere. If the radius of the hemisphere is represented by $r$, the surface area of a complete sphere is given by:

$$
\text{Surface Area of a Sphere} = 4\pi r^2
$$

Since we are only considering a hemisphere, we take half of this value:

$$
\text{Surface Area of the Hemisphere (curved part)} = 2\pi r^2
$$ 

In addition, the hemisphere has a circular base with an area of:

$$
\text{Area of the Base} = \pi r^2
$$ 

To find the total surface area of the hemisphere, we add the curved surface area and the base area:

$$
\text{Total Surface Area of the Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2 + \pi r^2 = 3\pi r^2
$$

However, when we combine the surface areas of the cube and hemisphere, we must subtract the area of the base of the hemisphere, as it is not visible in the compound solid. Assuming the hemisphere fits perfectly onto one face of the cube, the exposed surface area of the hemisphere is given by:

$$
\text{Exposed Surface Area of the Hemisphere} = 3\pi r^2 - \pi r^2 = 2\pi r^2
$$ 

Consequently, the total surface area of the compound solid is the sum of the surface area of the cube and the exposed surface area of the hemisphere:

$$
\text{Total Surface Area of the Compound Solid} = 6a^2 + 2\pi r^2
$$ 

This expression represents the complete surface area of the combined shapes.
