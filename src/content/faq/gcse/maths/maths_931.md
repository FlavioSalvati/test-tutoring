The graph of the equation $ y = 4 - x^2 $ represents a downward-opening parabola, with its vertex located at the point $ (0, 4) $.

To gain a deeper understanding of this graph, let's analyze its components. The equation $ y = 4 - x^2 $ can be expressed in the general form of a quadratic equation, $ y = a + bx + cx^2 $, where $ a = 4 $, $ b = 0 $, and $ c = -1 $. The negative coefficient of $ x^2 $ signifies that the parabola opens downward.

The vertex of a parabola is the highest point on its graph. In the case of the equation $ y = 4 - x^2 $, the vertex is situated at $ (0, 4) $. This is derived from the fact that when $ x = 0 $, $ y = 4 $, which represents the maximum value of $ y $.

Furthermore, the parabola exhibits symmetry about the y-axis. This implies that if one were to fold the graph along the y-axis, both halves would align perfectly. This symmetry arises from the absence of a linear $ x $ term in the equation (i.e., $ b = 0 $).

To visualize the graph, begin by marking the vertex at $ (0, 4) $. Then, select several values for $ x $ to determine their corresponding $ y $ values. For instance, when $ x = 1 $, we find $ y = 4 - 1^2 = 3 $. Likewise, for $ x = -1 $, the calculation yields $ y = 3 $ as well. Other points to consider include $ (2, 0) $ and $ (-2, 0) $.

By connecting these points with a smooth curve, you will reveal the characteristic U-shape of the downward-opening parabola. This graphical representation aids in comprehending the relationship between the values of $ x $ and $ y $ in the equation $ y = 4 - x^2 $.
