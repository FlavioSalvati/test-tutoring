To determine a distance using the angle of depression, you can apply trigonometric ratios, particularly the tangent function.

The angle of depression is defined as the angle formed by the line of sight from an observer looking downwards at an object, compared to a horizontal line extending from the observer's eye level. To calculate the distance to the object, you need to know either the height from which the observer is looking or the horizontal distance to the object.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose you are standing on a cliff and looking down at a boat on the sea. If the angle of depression from your eyes to the boat is $30^\circ$ and the height of the cliff is $50$ metres, you can find the horizontal distance from the base of the cliff to the boat by using the tangent function from trigonometry. This function relates the angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the lengths of the opposite side (the height of the cliff) and the adjacent side (the horizontal distance).

The relevant formula is:

$$ 
\tan(\text{angle}) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} 
$$

In our scenario, this can be expressed as:

$$ 
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{50}{\text{distance}} 
$$

To solve for the distance, we rearrange the equation:

$$ 
\text{distance} = \frac{50}{\tan(30^\circ)} 
$$

Now, using a calculator, we find:

$$ 
\tan(30^\circ) \approx 0.577 
$$

Substituting this value back into our equation gives:

$$ 
\text{distance} = \frac{50}{0.577} \approx 86.6 \text{ metres} 
$$

Therefore, the horizontal distance from the base of the cliff to the boat is approximately $86.6$ metres. This method can be utilized in various situations where you are aware of the angle of depression and one side of the right triangle, enabling you to compute the unknown distance effectively.
