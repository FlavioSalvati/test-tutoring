Let's enhance the content for clarity and readability while maintaining proper mathematical formatting.

The expression $\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{20}$ can be simplified to $3\sqrt{5}$. 

To clarify this process, letâ€™s break it down step by step. First, we need to simplify the square root of $20$. The number $20$ can be factored into $4$ and $5$, where $4$ is a perfect square. Thus, we can express $\sqrt{20}$ as follows:

$$
\sqrt{20} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 5}
$$

Using the property of square roots that states $\sqrt{a \cdot b} = \sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b}$, we can rewrite this as:

$$
\sqrt{20} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{5}
$$

Since $\sqrt{4} = 2$, this simplifies to:

$$
\sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}
$$

Now, we can substitute this back into the original expression. Therefore, we have:

$$
\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{20} = \sqrt{5} + 2\sqrt{5}
$$

Since both terms contain the common factor $\sqrt{5}$, we can combine them just as we would with any like terms. This results in:

$$
1\sqrt{5} + 2\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
$$

Thus, the final simplified form of the expression $\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{20}$ is:

$$
3\sqrt{5}
$$

This process demonstrates the importance of recognizing the properties of square roots and combining like terms, which are essential skills in GCSE Maths.
