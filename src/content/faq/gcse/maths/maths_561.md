Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values that can be counted individually.

More specifically, discrete data refers to information that can only assume specific, individual values within a defined range. These values are typically whole numbers and are not continuous, meaning there are no fractions or decimals between them. For instance, the number of students in a classroom exemplifies discrete data because each student can be counted individually; it is impossible to have a fraction of a student.

Discrete data is commonly represented using bar charts or pie charts, which facilitate the visualization of distinct categories or groups. In these visual representations, each bar or slice corresponds to a specific value or category, making it straightforward to compare different data points. For example, if you were to tally the number of pets owned by students in your class, you might discover that some students have $0$ pets, some have $1$ pet, and others have $2$ or more. Each of these counts is a discrete value.

Another important characteristic of discrete data is its frequent application in situations involving counting items or occurrences. Examples include the number of books on a shelf, the number of cars in a parking lot, or the number of goals scored in a football match. In these scenarios, the data points are distinct and separate.

Understanding discrete data is crucial as it enables you to analyze and interpret information that is naturally organized into distinct categories. This type of data is prevalent in everyday life and serves as a fundamental concept in statistics and probability.
