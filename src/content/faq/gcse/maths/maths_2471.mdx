To find the equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by $ y = -3x + 6 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 3) $, we start by determining the slope of the original line. The slope (or gradient) of the line $ y = -3x + 6 $ is $ -3 $.

For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must equal $ -1 $. Therefore, if the slope of the original line is $ -3 $, the slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of $ -3 $, which is 

$$
\frac{1}{3}.
$$

Next, we will use the point $ (2, 3) $ through which the perpendicular line passes. We can employ the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is expressed as:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),
$$

where $ m $ is the slope and $ (x_1, y_1) $ is a point on the line. Substituting $ m = \frac{1}{3} $, $ x_1 = 2 $, and $ y_1 = 3 $, we get:

$$
y - 3 = \frac{1}{3}(x - 2).
$$

To simplify this equation, we distribute $ \frac{1}{3} $:

$$
y - 3 = \frac{1}{3}x - \frac{2}{3}.
$$

Next, we add $ 3 $ to both sides to isolate $ y $:

$$
y = \frac{1}{3}x - \frac{2}{3} + 3.
$$

Since $ 3 $ is equivalent to $ \frac{9}{3} $, we can combine the constant terms:

$$
y = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{3}.
$$

Thus, the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = -3x + 6 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 3) $ is 

$$
y = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{3}.
$$
