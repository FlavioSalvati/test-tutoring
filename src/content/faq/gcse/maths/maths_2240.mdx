To sketch the graph of $ y = -\sin(x) $, you simply need to reflect the graph of $ y = \sin(x) $ across the x-axis.

First, let's recall the fundamental shape of the sine curve, represented by $ y = \sin(x) $. This curve oscillates between $ 1 $ and $ -1 $, intersecting the x-axis at multiples of $ \pi $ (specifically at $ 0, \pi, 2\pi, $ etc.). The sine function achieves its maximum value of $ 1 $ at $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $ and its minimum value of $ -1 $ at $ x = \frac{3\pi}{2} $.

For the function $ y = -\sin(x) $, each point on the sine curve is reflected across the x-axis. This reflection means that when $ y = \sin(x) $ is positive, $ y = -\sin(x) $ will be negative, and vice versa. For instance, at $ x = 0 $, we have $ \sin(0) = 0 $, leading to $ -\sin(0) = 0 $. At $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $, since $ \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1 $, it follows that $ -\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -1 $. At $ x = \pi $, $ \sin(\pi) = 0 $, hence $ -\sin(\pi) = 0 $.

To create the sketch of the graph, plot the following key points: $ (0, 0) $, $ \left(\frac{\pi}{2}, -1\right) $, $ (\pi, 0) $, $ \left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, 1\right) $, and $ (2\pi, 0) $. After marking these points, draw a smooth curve that connects them, ensuring that it oscillates between $ -1 $ and $ 1 $ and crosses the x-axis at multiples of $ \pi $. The resulting graph will resemble a wave that is the mirror image of the sine curve, flipped upside down.
