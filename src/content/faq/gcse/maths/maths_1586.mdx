An example of ordinal data is the ranking of students in a class based on their exam scores.

Ordinal data is a type of categorical data where the categories possess a meaningful order or ranking; however, the intervals between these categories are not necessarily equal. In the context of student rankings, for instance, we can state that a student who ranks 1st performed better than a student who ranks 2nd, and so forth. Nevertheless, the difference in performance between the 1st and 2nd ranked students is not guaranteed to be the same as the difference between the 2nd and 3rd ranked students.

Another illustration of ordinal data is found in surveys where respondents rate their satisfaction on a scale from $1$ to $5$, with $1$ representing "very dissatisfied" and $5$ indicating "very satisfied." In this case, the numbers signify an order of satisfaction; however, the differences between the levels are not quantifiable. For example, while a rating of $4$ is indeed better than a rating of $3$, we cannot assert that the satisfaction level of $4$ is exactly one unit greater than that of $3$.

It's important to differentiate ordinal data from nominal data. Nominal data also consists of categories, but these categories lack any inherent order. For example, the types of pets people own—such as dogs, cats, and birds—represent nominal data because there is no ranking or hierarchy among these categories. Understanding the distinction between ordinal and nominal data is crucial for selecting the appropriate statistical methods for data analysis.
