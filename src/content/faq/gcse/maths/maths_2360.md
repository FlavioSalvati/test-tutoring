The gradient of the equation $ y = -x + 4 $ is $ -1 $.

To grasp how to determine the gradient of a linear equation, we first need to consider the general form of a straight line, which is given by:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

In this equation, $ m $ denotes the gradient (or slope) of the line, while $ c $ indicates the y-intercept, the point where the line intersects the y-axis.

For the specific equation $ y = -x + 4 $, we can observe that it is already expressed in the standard form $ y = mx + c $. By comparing it to the general equation, we can identify that $ m = -1 $ and $ c = 4 $. Therefore, the gradient $ m $ is $ -1 $.

The gradient provides insight into the steepness and direction of the line. A positive gradient signifies that the line ascends as you move from left to right, whereas a negative gradient indicates a descent. Since our gradient is $ -1 $, it indicates that the line slopes downwards at a $ 45^\circ $ angle. Specifically, for every unit you advance to the right along the x-axis, the line descends by $ 1 $ unit on the y-axis.

Understanding the gradient is essential for graphing linear equations and analyzing how modifications to the equation influence the line's steepness and direction.
