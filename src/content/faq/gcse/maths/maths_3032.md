To create a scatter plot, you will need to plot each pair of data points on a graph with designated x-axis and y-axis.

**Step 1: Collect Your Data**  
Begin by gathering your data, which should consist of pairs of values. These pairs typically represent two related variables, such as height and weight, or time and distance. Organize your data in a table format, ensuring that there is one column dedicated to each variable.

**Step 2: Draw the Axes**  
Next, create your axes on graph paper or using graphing software. The horizontal axis (x-axis) usually represents the independent variable, while the vertical axis (y-axis) represents the dependent variable. Be sure to label each axis clearly with the appropriate variable name and include the relevant units of measurement.

**Step 3: Determine the Scale**  
Establish the scale for each axis based on the range of your data. It is important that the scale is consistent and encompasses the entire range of your data points. For instance, if your x-values range from $1$ to $10$, your x-axis should reflect this range accurately.

**Step 4: Plot the Data Points**  
Now, proceed to plot each pair of data points on the graph. For each pair, locate the corresponding x-value on the x-axis and the y-value on the y-axis. Mark a point at the intersection of these two values. Repeat this process for all data pairs.

**Step 5: Analyze the Scatter Plot**  
After all points have been plotted, analyze the scatter plot to identify any patterns or relationships between the variables. Look for trends, such as clusters, positive or negative correlations, or outliers. This visual representation is instrumental in understanding how the variables interact with one another.
