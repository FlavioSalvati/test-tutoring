To express the fraction $\frac{3}{8}$ as a percentage, we find that it is equivalent to $37.5\%$.

To convert a fraction into a percentage, the process involves multiplying the fraction by $100$. The term "percent" literally means "per hundred," which allows us to determine how many parts of a hundred the fraction comprises. For the fraction $\frac{3}{8}$, the conversion is carried out as follows:

$$
\frac{3}{8} \times 100 = 37.5
$$

This calculation indicates that $\frac{3}{8}$ is equal to $37.5\%$.

An alternative method to achieve this result is by first converting the fraction into a decimal. This can be done by dividing the numerator ($3$) by the denominator ($8$):

$$
3 \div 8 = 0.375
$$

Next, to convert the decimal to a percentage, multiply it by $100$:

$$
0.375 \times 100 = 37.5
$$

Thus, regardless of whether you multiply the fraction directly by $100$ or convert it to a decimal first, you arrive at the same conclusion: $\frac{3}{8}$ is equal to $37.5\%$. This approach is applicable for converting any fraction to a percentage and enhances your understanding of the connections between fractions, decimals, and percentages.
