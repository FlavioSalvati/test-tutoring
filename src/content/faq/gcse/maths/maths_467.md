To solve for an angle using the sine rule, you need to rearrange the formula while utilizing the given sides and angles of the triangle.

The sine rule states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle remains constant. This relationship can be expressed as:

$$ 
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} 
$$

In this equation, $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent the lengths of the triangle's sides, while $A$, $B$, and $C$ denote the angles opposite those respective sides.

To find an angle, you must know at least one side length and its corresponding opposite angle, in addition to another side length. For instance, if you are given sides $a$ and $b$ along with angle $A$, you can derive angle $B$ by rearranging the sine rule as follows:

$$ 
\sin B = \frac{b \cdot \sin A}{a} 
$$

With this equation, you can calculate $\sin B$ and subsequently use the inverse sine function (also referred to as arcsine) to determine the measure of angle $B$:

$$ 
B = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{b \cdot \sin A}{a} \right) 
$$

Ensure that your calculator is set to the appropriate mode—either degrees or radians—depending on the requirements of your problem. This technique is particularly valuable for finding unknown angles in non-right-angled triangles, making it a useful tool in various geometric and trigonometric applications.
