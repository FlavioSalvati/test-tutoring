Exponential growth and exponential decay are two fundamental concepts that describe how quantities change over time. Exponential growth involves a rapid increase, while exponential decay results in a swift decrease.

In the case of exponential growth, a quantity increases by a fixed percentage over equal time intervals. This characteristic means that as time progresses, the amount grows at an accelerating rate. For instance, if you start with £100 and it increases by 10% each year, after one year you would have £110, and after two years, £121. The general formula for exponential growth is given by 

$$ 
N = N_0 \times (1 + r)^t 
$$ 

where:
- $N$ is the final amount,
- $N_0$ is the initial amount,
- $r$ is the growth rate, and
- $t$ is the time.

Conversely, exponential decay describes a scenario where a quantity decreases by a fixed percentage over equal time intervals. This means that as time passes, the amount diminishes more rapidly. For example, if you have 100 grams of a substance that decays by 10% each year, after one year you would be left with 90 grams, and after two years, only 81 grams. The formula for exponential decay is expressed as 

$$ 
N = N_0 \times (1 - r)^t 
$$ 

where:
- $N$ is the final amount,
- $N_0$ is the initial amount,
- $r$ is the decay rate, and
- $t$ is the time.

Understanding these concepts is essential for numerous real-world applications, including population dynamics, radioactive decay, and financial interest calculations. By recognizing the differences between exponential growth and decay, you can more effectively analyze and predict how quantities evolve over time.
