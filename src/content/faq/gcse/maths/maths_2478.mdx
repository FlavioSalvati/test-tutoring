A prism, in the field of geometry, is a three-dimensional solid characterized by two identical, parallel bases that are connected by rectangular (or more generally, parallelogram-shaped) faces.

More specifically, a prism is classified as a type of polyhedron, which signifies that it comprises flat faces. The two bases of a prism are congruent polygons, meaning they possess the same shape and size. These bases are parallel to one another, and the sides that join them are typically rectangles (or parallelograms). The height of the prism is defined as the perpendicular distance between the two bases.

Prisms are named according to the shape of their bases. For instance, if the bases are triangular, the prism is referred to as a triangular prism. If the bases are square, it is called a square prism, and this naming convention continues with other shapes. Common types of prisms encountered in GCSE Maths include triangular prisms, rectangular prisms (also known as cuboids), and hexagonal prisms.

One significant property of prisms is that their volume can be determined by multiplying the area of the base by the height of the prism. This is due to the fact that the cross-sectional area remains constant along the length of the prism. For example, in the case of a rectangular prism, one would calculate the area of the rectangular base and then multiply it by the height to obtain the volume.

Understanding prisms is beneficial in various real-world applications, such as architecture and engineering, where these geometric shapes are frequently utilized in design and construction. Additionally, prisms feature prominently in many mathematical problems and represent a fundamental concept in geometry.
