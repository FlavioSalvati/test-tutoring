To determine the median from a frequency table, you need to identify the middle value when the data is arranged in order.

### Step 1: Calculate Cumulative Frequency
Begin by calculating the cumulative frequency for each class or category in the table. The cumulative frequency represents the running total of frequencies up to and including the current class. This allows you to observe how the data accumulates across the different classes.

### Step 2: Identify the Total Number of Data Points
Next, find the total number of data points, denoted as $n$, which is simply the sum of all frequencies in the table. If $n$ is odd, the median is the value located at the $\frac{n+1}{2}$th position. Conversely, if $n$ is even, the median is computed as the average of the values at the $\frac{n}{2}$th and $\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)$th positions.

### Step 3: Locate the Median Class
To find the median class, examine the cumulative frequencies and identify the class interval that encompasses the median position. This is the class where the cumulative frequency first exceeds the median position.

### Example:
Consider the following frequency table:

| Class Interval | Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|
| 1-10           | 3         |
| 11-20          | 5         |
| 21-30          | 7         |
| 31-40          | 4         |
| 41-50          | 1         |

#### Step 1: Calculate Cumulative Frequencies

| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1-10           | 3         | 3                    |
| 11-20          | 5         | 8                    |
| 21-30          | 7         | 15                   |
| 31-40          | 4         | 19                   |
| 41-50          | 1         | 20                   |

#### Step 2: Determine the Total Number of Data Points
The total number of data points is $20$. Since $20$ is even, we find the median by averaging the values at the $10$th and $11$th positions.

#### Step 3: Identify the Median Class
From the cumulative frequency, we can observe that both the $10$th and $11$th positions fall within the $21-30$ class interval. Thus, we conclude that the median lies within this interval.

By following these steps, you can accurately determine the median from a frequency table.
