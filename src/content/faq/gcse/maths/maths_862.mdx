To simplify the expression $(x^4)^2$, we apply the exponentiation rule that states when a power is raised to another power, the exponents are multiplied. This rule can be expressed mathematically as:

$$(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$$

In this case, we identify $a$ as $x$, $m$ as $4$, and $n$ as $2$. Thus, we multiply the exponents:

$$4 \cdot 2 = 8$$

Consequently, the expression $(x^4)^2$ simplifies to $x^8$.

This exponentiation rule is based on the principle that exponents indicate repeated multiplication. For instance, $x^4$ is equivalent to $x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x$. When we square $x^4$, we are effectively multiplying $x^4$ by itself:

$$(x^4) \cdot (x^4)$$

This results in:

$$x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x$$

which can be rewritten as $x^8$.

Understanding this exponentiation rule is crucial for simplifying expressions and solving equations efficiently. It is a fundamental concept in algebra that you will encounter frequently, so itâ€™s essential to become comfortable with it.
