To graph the inequality $ x \geq 5 $ on a number line, follow these steps for clarity:

1. **Draw the Number Line**: Begin by sketching a horizontal line to represent the number line.

2. **Mark the Point for 5**: Identify the position of the number $5$ on this line by marking a point at that location. Since the inequality is $ x \geq 5 $, the number $5$ is included in the solution set.

3. **Use a Solid Circle**: To indicate that the number $5$ is part of the solution, draw a solid circle (or dot) at the marked point. A solid circle signifies that $5$ is included in the set of solutions.

4. **Shade to the Right**: Because the inequality symbol is "greater than or equal to" ($\geq$), we need to represent all numbers greater than $5$. To do this, draw a line or an arrow starting from the solid circle at $5$ and extending to the right. This shading indicates that all numbers greater than $5$ are included in the solution set.

5. **Importance of the Solid Circle**: It is important to remember that the solid circle at $5$ conveys that $5$ is included in the solution. If the inequality were instead strictly greater than ($ x > 5 $), you would use an open circle to indicate that $5$ is not part of the solution. However, since the inequality is $ x \geq 5 $, the solid circle is the appropriate representation.

By following these steps, you can accurately depict the inequality $ x \geq 5 $ on a number line, clearly illustrating which numbers satisfy the inequality.
