To multiply fractions, you simply multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

When performing the multiplication, begin by taking the numerators (the top numbers) of each fraction to obtain the new numerator. Next, multiply the denominators (the bottom numbers) of each fraction to find the new denominator. For instance, when multiplying the fractions $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{4}{5}$, you would calculate $2 \times 4$ to get $8$, and $3 \times 5$ to get $15$. Therefore, the result is 

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{8}{15}.
$$

It is often beneficial to simplify the fractions before performing the multiplication, if possible. Simplifying involves reducing the fractions to their lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). For example, in the case of $\frac{6}{8} \times \frac{3}{4}$, you can simplify $\frac{6}{8}$ to $\frac{3}{4}$ since both $6$ and $8$ can be divided by $2$. After simplification, you would then multiply:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16}.
$$

Another effective strategy is to use cross-cancellation before multiplying. Cross-cancelling allows you to simplify the fractions by eliminating any common factors between a numerator of one fraction and a denominator of the other. For example, consider the multiplication of $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{10}{3}$. Here, you can cancel the $2$ in the numerator of the first fraction with the $10$ in the numerator of the second fraction (since $10$ divided by $2$ equals $5$). This simplifies the multiplication to:

$$
\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{1 \times 5}{5 \times 3} = \frac{5}{15},
$$

which further simplifies to 

$$
\frac{1}{3}.
$$

By following these steps, you can multiply fractions both accurately and efficiently.
