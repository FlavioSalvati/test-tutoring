To plot the points $(-2, -3)$ and $(4, 5)$ on a graph, you will need to mark them on the Cartesian plane.

Begin by drawing a set of axes on your graph paper. The horizontal axis is referred to as the x-axis, while the vertical axis is known as the y-axis. Be sure to label both axes clearly and include a scale, such as marking each unit along the axes.

To plot the point $(-2, -3)$, start at the origin $(0, 0)$, where the x-axis and y-axis intersect. Move 2 units to the left along the x-axis, since the x-coordinate is $-2$. From that position, move 3 units down along the y-axis because the y-coordinate is $-3$. Mark this point with a dot and label it $(-2, -3)$.

Next, to plot the point $(4, 5)$, again start at the origin. Move 4 units to the right along the x-axis, as the x-coordinate is $4$. From there, move 5 units up along the y-axis because the y-coordinate is $5$. Mark this point with a dot and label it $(4, 5)$.

By following these steps, you can accurately plot any points on a graph. Remember, the x-coordinate indicates how far to move left or right, while the y-coordinate indicates how far to move up or down. Practicing this technique will help you become more proficient at graphing points.
