Primary data is collected directly by the researcher, whereas secondary data is derived from existing sources.

Primary data is original and gathered specifically for a particular research purpose. This type of data can be obtained through various methods such as surveys, experiments, interviews, or observations. For instance, if you conduct a survey at your school to determine students' favorite subjects, the responses you collect constitute primary data. This data is unique to your study and has not been published or analyzed by anyone else.

In contrast, secondary data refers to information that has already been collected, analyzed, and published by other researchers. This type of data can be found in books, academic articles, reports, or online databases. For example, if you reference statistics from a government report on educational trends to support your project, you are utilizing secondary data. While this data is not original to your research, it can offer valuable context and background information.

In summary, primary data is new and tailored specifically to your research needs, while secondary data is pre-existing and sourced from other researchers. Understanding this distinction is crucial for selecting the appropriate type of data for your study, ensuring that you utilize the most relevant and reliable information available.
