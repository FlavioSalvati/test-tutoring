To calculate the mode in a bimodal distribution, you need to identify the two most frequently occurring values within the dataset.

A bimodal distribution is characterized by the presence of two modes, meaning there are two values that occur with the highest frequency. To locate these modes, the first step is to organize your data. This can be done by either arranging the values in ascending order or by constructing a frequency table. Organizing the data allows you to easily identify which values appear most frequently.

After organizing your data, count the occurrences of each value. The two values that have the highest counts will be your modes. For instance, consider the dataset: $2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6$. In this case, the values $3$ and $5$ each appear twice, which is more frequently than any other values in the dataset. Therefore, the modes of this bimodal distribution are $3$ and $5$.

It is important to remember that a bimodal distribution specifically contains exactly two modes. If more than two values share the highest frequency, the distribution is classified as multimodal. Conversely, if only one value has the highest frequency, the distribution is termed unimodal. Recognizing these distinctions is essential for accurately identifying the mode(s) in any dataset.
