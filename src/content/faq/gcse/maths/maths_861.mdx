To calculate $7^{-1}$, we need to determine the reciprocal of $7$, which is expressed as $\frac{1}{7}$.

When you encounter a negative exponent, it signifies that you should take the reciprocal of the base number. In this instance, the base is $7$, and the exponent is $-1$. The reciprocal of a number is simply $1$ divided by that number, which leads us to conclude that $7^{-1}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{7}$.

To elaborate further, it is important to remember that any number raised to the power of $-1$ equals the reciprocal of that number. This is a fundamental property of exponents. For instance, we can generalize this as $a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}$. Applying this rule to our specific case, we find that $7^{-1} = \frac{1}{7}$.

If we were to convert $\frac{1}{7}$ into decimal form, it would be approximately $0.142857$. This result stems from dividing $1$ by $7$, yielding a repeating decimal. However, for most GCSE Maths problems, it is generally acceptable—and often preferred—to leave your answer as a fraction, $\frac{1}{7}$.

Understanding negative exponents is essential, as it enables you to simplify expressions and solve equations more effectively. The key takeaway is that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal. Therefore, whenever you encounter a negative exponent, simply flip the base number to its reciprocal and convert the exponent to positive.
