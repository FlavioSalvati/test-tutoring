The solution to the equation $\sin(x) = 1$ in the interval from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ is $x = 90^\circ$.

To understand why this is the case, we first need to explore the sine function. The sine function, denoted as $\sin(x)$, corresponds to the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle as the angle $x$ varies. The unit circle is defined as a circle with a radius of $1$ that is centered at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. As the angle $x$ increases from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$, the point moves counterclockwise around the circle.

The sine function achieves its maximum value of $1$ when the point on the unit circle is located at the topmost position. This occurs at an angle of $90^\circ$, where the y-coordinate equals $1$ and the x-coordinate equals $0$. Hence, we find that $\sin(90^\circ) = 1$.

Within the interval from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$, the sine function reaches the value of $1$ only once, specifically at $90^\circ$. This is due to the periodic and symmetric nature of the sine function. The sine function exhibits a repeating pattern and a specific shape. Over the range from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$, the behavior of the sine function is as follows: it starts at $0$, increases to $1$ at $90^\circ$, decreases back to $0$ at $180^\circ$, continues to decrease to $-1$ at $270^\circ$, and returns to $0$ at $360^\circ$.

Thus, we conclude that the only angle between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ for which $\sin(x)$ equals $1$ is at $90^\circ$.
