The perimeter of a compound shape is calculated by summing the lengths of all its sides, which in this case equals $21 \, \text{cm}$.

To find the perimeter of any shape, you simply add the lengths of all its sides. For this particular compound shape, the sides measure $5 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $9 \, \text{cm}$. Adding these lengths together gives:

$$
5 \, \text{cm} + 7 \, \text{cm} + 9 \, \text{cm} = 21 \, \text{cm}
$$

Thus, the perimeter of the shape is $21 \, \text{cm}$.

Understanding perimeter is fundamental in geometry. It represents the total distance around the edge of a shape. For basic shapes like triangles or rectangles, calculating the perimeter is straightforwardâ€”you simply sum the lengths of all their sides. However, for more complex shapes, you may need to decompose them into simpler components, determine the lengths of each side, and then add them together.

In this example, we are dealing with a compound shape, but since only three sides are provided, we assume these are the only ones that need consideration. If the shape were more intricate, additional sides might need to be identified and included in your calculations. Always ensure that you account for all sides to accurately determine the perimeter.

Additionally, be mindful of the units of measurement. In this case, all sides are measured in centimeters, so the perimeter is also expressed in centimeters. If the sides were measured in different units, it would be necessary to convert them to a common unit before performing the addition.
