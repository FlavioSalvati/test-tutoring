The conversion factor from cubic metres to litres is straightforward: 1 cubic metre is equivalent to 1,000 litres.

To grasp this conversion, it's important to recognize that both cubic metres and litres are units of volume. A cubic metre ($\text{m}^3$) represents the volume of a cube with sides measuring one metre each. This unit is often utilized in larger contexts, such as measuring the volume of rooms or swimming pools.

Conversely, a litre ($\text{L}$) is a smaller unit of volume frequently used for everyday items, like bottles of water or milk. One litre is defined as the volume of a cube with each side measuring 10 centimetres (or $0.1$ metres).

To convert from cubic metres to litres, remember that $1 \, \text{m}^3$ corresponds to $1,000 \, \text{L}$. This relationship arises because a cubic metre contains $1,000$ smaller cubes, each with dimensions of $10 \, \text{cm}$ (or $0.1 \, \text{m}$) on each side. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$ 
1 \, \text{m}^3 = (10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm}) = 1,000 \, \text{L} 
$$

Therefore, to convert a volume measured in cubic metres to litres, simply multiply the number of cubic metres by $1,000$. For instance, if you have $2 \, \text{m}^3$, the conversion to litres would be:

$$ 
2 \, \text{m}^3 \times 1,000 = 2,000 \, \text{L} 
$$

This conversion is particularly useful in various practical scenarios, such as when you need to fill a tank or a pool, and the volume is given in cubic metres while the capacity of your containers is measured in litres.
