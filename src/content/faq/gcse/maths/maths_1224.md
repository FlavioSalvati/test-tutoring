To determine the radius of a circle from its area, you can use the following formula:

$$
r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}
$$

Where:
- $r$ is the radius,
- $A$ is the area of the circle, and
- $\pi$ is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $3.14159$.

The area of a circle is calculated using the formula:

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

To derive the radius from the area, you start by rearranging this equation. First, divide both sides by $\pi$:

$$
\frac{A}{\pi} = r^2
$$

Next, to solve for $r$, take the square root of both sides:

$$
r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}
$$

This equation allows you to directly calculate the radius when you know the area of the circle.

For instance, if the area of a circle is $50$ square centimeters, you would substitute $50$ for $A$ in the formula:

$$
r = \sqrt{\frac{50}{\pi}}
$$

Using a calculator, first compute the division of $50$ by $\pi$:

$$
\frac{50}{\pi} \approx 15.92
$$

Then, take the square root of $15.92$, which yields approximately:

$$
r \approx 3.99
$$

Thus, the radius of the circle is approximately $3.99$ centimeters.

This method is particularly useful in various practical contexts, such as determining the dimensions of a circular object or space when only the area is known. Always ensure that you use consistent units for both area and radius to maintain the accuracy of your calculations.
