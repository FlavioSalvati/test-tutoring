To calculate the length of a 3D hypotenuse, you can use the formula:

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$

The 3D hypotenuse represents the diagonal distance between two opposite corners of a rectangular prism, also known as a cuboid. Visualize a box and imagine the longest straight line that can fit inside it, stretching from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner. This line is what we refer to as the 3D hypotenuse.

To determine this length, you will need the measurements of the box's length ($x$), width ($y$), and height ($z$). These dimensions correspond to the three sides of a right-angled triangle in three-dimensional space. The formula 

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$ 

is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which is well-known for two-dimensional right-angled triangles, where the relationship is expressed as 

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$ 

Here's how the calculation works step-by-step:

1. **Square each of the three dimensions**: Compute $x^2$, $y^2$, and $z^2$.
2. **Sum the squared values**: Add these three results together.
3. **Take the square root**: Finally, compute the square root of the sum to obtain the length of the 3D hypotenuse.

For example, consider a box with dimensions $3 \, \text{cm}$ (length), $4 \, \text{cm}$ (width), and $12 \, \text{cm}$ (height). The calculation of the hypotenuse would proceed as follows:

1. **Square each dimension**:
   - $3^2 = 9$
   - $4^2 = 16$
   - $12^2 = 144$

2. **Add the squared values**:
   - $9 + 16 + 144 = 169$

3. **Take the square root of the sum**:
   - $\sqrt{169} = 13$

Therefore, the length of the 3D hypotenuse is $13 \, \text{cm}$.
