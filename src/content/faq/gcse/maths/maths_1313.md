Elevation angles are measured upwards from the horizontal, while depression angles are measured downwards from the horizontal.

To elaborate, when considering angles of elevation and depression, you are essentially examining how you perceive objects in relation to a horizontal reference line. For instance, if you are standing on the ground and looking up at a bird soaring in the sky, the angle formed between your line of sight and the horizontal ground is referred to as the angle of elevation. This angle is consistently measured upwards from the horizontal line.

Conversely, if you find yourself on a cliff looking down at a boat on the water, the angle between your line of sight and the horizontal line is termed the angle of depression. This angle is always measured downwards from the horizontal reference.

Both angles play a significant role in trigonometry, particularly when you need to calculate distances or heights that cannot be directly measured. For example, if you know the angle of elevation to the top of a tree and the distance from the tree, you can utilize trigonometric ratios, such as tangent, to determine the height of the tree. Similarly, if you are aware of the angle of depression from a cliff to a boat and the height of the cliff, you can calculate the horizontal distance to the boat.

Grasping these angles is essential for solving various real-world problems, including navigation, construction, and even sports such as golf or archery, where accurate measurements are crucial.
