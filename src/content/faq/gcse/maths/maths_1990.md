To convert $2.5$ hours into hours and minutes, we find that it comprises $2$ hours and $30$ minutes.

To clarify this conversion, it is essential to recognize that $1$ hour equals $60$ minutes. When dealing with a decimal number of hours, such as $2.5$, we need to separate the whole number from the decimal part. Here, the whole number is $2$, which represents $2$ complete hours.

Next, we examine the decimal part, which is $0.5$. To convert this decimal into minutes, we multiply it by $60$ (since there are $60$ minutes in one hour). Thus, we perform the calculation:

$$
0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Consequently, $2.5$ hours can be expressed as $2$ hours and $30$ minutes.

This method of conversion can be applied to any decimal representation of hours. For instance, if we were to convert $3.75$ hours, we would take the whole number part, which is $3$ hours. Then, we would convert the decimal portion, $0.75$, into minutes by multiplying it by $60$:

$$
0.75 \times 60 = 45 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Therefore, $3.75$ hours is equivalent to $3$ hours and $45$ minutes.

Understanding this conversion process is valuable in various real-world contexts, such as calculating travel durations, work hours, or cooking times. It simplifies the task by breaking it down into manageable steps: identify the whole hours, convert the decimal part into minutes, and then combine the two for the final result.
