A Venn diagram is a powerful visual tool used to explore the relationships between different sets and to find the probabilities of combined events by analyzing their overlapping regions.

To begin, you represent each event with a distinct circle in the diagram. The intersections of these circles reveal where the events overlap, indicating the scenarios in which both events occur simultaneously.

For instance, consider two events, denoted as $A$ and $B$. Event $A$ is illustrated by one circle, while event $B$ is represented by another. The area where these two circles overlap corresponds to the probability of both events occurring at the same time, which is referred to as the intersection, denoted as $A \cap B$.

To determine the probability of either event $A$ or event $B$ occurring, you need to analyze the union of the two sets, denoted as $A \cup B$. This encompasses all regions covered by both circles, including their overlapping section. The probability of the union can be calculated using the formula:

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B).
$$

In this formula, $P(A \cap B)$ is subtracted to avoid double-counting the overlapping area.

If you want to find the probability that neither event occurs, you should examine the area outside both circles. This region is known as the complement of the union of $A$ and $B$, and can be calculated using:

$$
P(\text{neither } A \text{ nor } B) = 1 - P(A \cup B).
$$

By utilizing a Venn diagram, you can visually decompose complex probability problems into more manageable components, facilitating a clearer understanding and a more straightforward approach to solving them.
