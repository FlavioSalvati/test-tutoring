The perimeter of a rectangle with a length of $8 \, \text{cm}$ and a width of $2 \, \text{cm}$ is $20 \, \text{cm}$.

To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, you need to sum the lengths of all four sides. A rectangle consists of two pairs of equal sides: two lengths and two widths. The formula for the perimeter $ P $ of a rectangle is:

$$
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
$$

In this example, the length $ l $ is $8 \, \text{cm}$ and the width $ w $ is $2 \, \text{cm}$. Substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
P = 2 \times (8 \, \text{cm} + 2 \, \text{cm})
$$
$$
P = 2 \times 10 \, \text{cm}
$$
$$
P = 20 \, \text{cm}
$$

Thus, the perimeter of the rectangle is $20 \, \text{cm}$.

Grasping this concept is essential for addressing various geometric problems. The perimeter represents the total distance around the boundary of the rectangle. This formula can be applied to any rectangle, irrespective of its dimensions, as long as you have the length and the width. Additionally, remember that the units of measurement for the perimeter will match those used for the length and width; in this instance, they are in centimeters.
