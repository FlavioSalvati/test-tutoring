The standard form of the number $0.00045$ is expressed as $$4.5 \times 10^{-4}$$.

Standard form, commonly referred to as scientific notation, provides a method for representing very large or very small numbers in a concise and easily manageable way. This format is especially beneficial in fields such as science and engineering. To convert a number into standard form, you express it as a product of a coefficient that lies between $1$ and $10$, and a power of $10$.

For the number $0.00045$, we begin by identifying the significant figures, which are $4$ and $5$. Next, we place the decimal point after the first significant figure to obtain $4.5$. Then, we count how many places the decimal point has shifted from its original position to its new position. In this case, the decimal point has moved $4$ places to the right. Since we are dealing with a number that is less than $1$, the exponent for the power of $10$ will be negative. Thus, we write $0.00045$ as $$4.5 \times 10^{-4}$$.

This notation simplifies calculations and facilitates comparisons between the magnitudes of different numbers. For instance, in scientific contexts, one might encounter extremely small measurements, such as the size of a cell, or very large distances, such as those between stars. Utilizing standard form allows these numbers to be represented in a manner that is both compact and easy to comprehend.
