The formula for calculating the surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
$$

To understand this formula, letâ€™s first clarify what a rectangular prism is. A rectangular prism is a three-dimensional shape composed of six rectangular faces. The surface area refers to the total area of all these faces combined. In the formula, $ l $ denotes the length, $ w $ represents the width, and $ h $ signifies the height of the prism.

Breaking down the components of the formula:
- The term $ 2lw $ calculates the area of the two faces that have dimensions length by width. Since there are two such faces, we multiply the area of one face, $ lw $, by 2.
- Similarly, $ 2lh $ accounts for the two faces that measure length by height, while $ 2wh $ corresponds to the two faces that have width by height. Adding these three terms together provides the total surface area of the rectangular prism.

To illustrate this with an example, consider a rectangular prism with a length of $5 \, \text{cm}$, a width of $3 \, \text{cm}$, and a height of $4 \, \text{cm}$. The surface area can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2(5 \times 3) + 2(5 \times 4) + 2(3 \times 4)
$$

Breaking it down further:

$$
= 2(15) + 2(20) + 2(12)
$$

Calculating each term gives:

$$
= 30 + 40 + 24
$$

Thus, the total surface area is:

$$
= 94 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Therefore, the surface area of this specific rectangular prism is $94 \, \text{cm}^2$. This formula is crucial in solving various practical problems, such as determining the amount of material required to cover a box.
