The next term in the sequence $ 7, 14, 21, 28 $ is $ 35 $.

This sequence is a clear example of an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant value. In this case, the common difference is $ 7 $. To determine the next term, you simply add the common difference to the last term of the sequence. Therefore, $ 28 + 7 = 35 $.

Arithmetic sequences are a fundamental concept in GCSE Mathematics. They adhere to a straightforward rule: each term is derived from the previous term by adding a constant difference. This property makes these sequences predictable and easy to manipulate. For instance, if you begin with $ 7 $ and consistently add $ 7 $, you generate the sequence $ 7, 14, 21, 28, $ and so forth. This pattern continues indefinitely.

A solid understanding of arithmetic sequences enables you to solve a variety of mathematical problems, including the task of finding the $ n $-th term. The formula for the $ n $-th term of an arithmetic sequence is expressed as:

$$
a_n = a + (n-1)d
$$

where $ a $ represents the first term, $ d $ denotes the common difference, and $ n $ indicates the term number. In this specific sequence, the first term $ a $ is $ 7 $, and the common difference $ d $ is also $ 7 $. Consequently, the $ n $-th term can be calculated as:

$$
7 + (n-1) \times 7
$$

By mastering these concepts, you will be well-equipped to tackle more complex mathematical problems and explore various types of sequences.
