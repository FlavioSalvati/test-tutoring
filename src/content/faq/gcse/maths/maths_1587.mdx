A positively skewed distribution is characterized by a longer tail on the right side of its peak.

In this type of distribution, most data points are concentrated on the left side, with fewer data points trailing off toward the right. This indicates that the majority of values are relatively low, while there are some higher values that extend the distribution. Visualize a graph where the peak is positioned toward the left, and the tail stretches out to the right. This shape signifies that, although most of the data clusters around lower values, a few exceptionally high values are pulling the mean to the right.

For instance, consider the distribution of incomes within a country. While most individuals may earn a modest wage, a small number of people earn significantly higher amounts, resulting in a long tail on the right. This scenario exemplifies a positively skewed distribution. In such cases, the mean (average) income is typically greater than the median (the middle value), as the high incomes pull the mean upward.

When analyzing data, it is crucial to recognize the presence of a positively skewed distribution, as it influences the interpretation of measures of central tendency, such as the mean, median, and mode. The mean can be misleading in a positively skewed distribution because it is disproportionately affected by the extreme values on the right. Consequently, the median often serves as a more reliable measure of central tendency in these instances, as it is not influenced by outliers and better represents the typical value within the dataset.
