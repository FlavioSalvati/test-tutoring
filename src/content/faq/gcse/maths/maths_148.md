The formula for exponential growth is given by:

$$ P(t) = P_0 \times e^{rt} $$

In this equation, $ P(t) $ represents the quantity at time $ t $, while $ P_0 $ denotes the initial quantity. The symbol $ e $ is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to $ 2.71828 $. The variable $ r $ indicates the growth rate, and $ t $ signifies the elapsed time. Exponential growth occurs when the growth rate of a function is proportional to its current value, resulting in acceleration of growth over time.

To clarify, $ P_0 $ is your starting point. For example, if you begin with $ 100 $ bacteria, then $ P_0 $ would be $ 100 $. The constant $ e $ in the formula serves to model continuous growth. The growth rate $ r $ is typically expressed as a percentage but should be converted to a decimal for use in the formula. For instance, a growth rate of $ 5\% $ would be represented as $ 0.05 $.

The variable $ t $ represents the time period over which growth occurs, which can be measured in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or any other unit of time.

Suppose you want to calculate the number of bacteria after $ 3 $ hours, given a growth rate of $ 5\% $ per hour. Starting with $ 100 $ bacteria, you would substitute these values into the formula:

$$ P(3) = 100 \times e^{0.05 \times 3} $$

Using a calculator, you find that $ e^{0.15} $ is approximately $ 1.1618 $. Thus, you can compute:

$$ P(3) \approx 100 \times 1.1618 \approx 116.18 $$

Therefore, after $ 3 $ hours, you would have approximately $ 116 $ bacteria.
