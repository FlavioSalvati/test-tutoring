The gradient of the line given by the equation $ y = 4x - 1 $ is $ 4 $.

In the standard form of a linear equation, typically expressed as $ y = mx + c $, the gradient (also known as the slope) is denoted by the coefficient $ m $. This coefficient indicates the steepness of the line. In the equation $ y = 4x - 1 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 4 $. Thus, we can conclude that the gradient of this line is $ 4 $.

To clarify this concept further, let's examine what the gradient represents. The gradient of a line quantifies how much the $ y $-value changes in response to a one-unit change in the $ x $-value. Specifically, a gradient of $ 4 $ implies that for every $ 1 $ unit increase in $ x $, the $ y $-value increases by $ 4 $ units. This indicates that the line has a relatively steep incline.

To visualize this on a graph, consider starting at any point along the line. If you move $ 1 $ unit to the right (along the $ x $-axis), you would need to move $ 4 $ units up (along the $ y $-axis) to remain on the line. This consistent rate of change is what characterizes the gradient.

In summary, the gradient serves as a measure of both the steepness and the direction of a line. A positive gradient, such as $ 4 $ in this example, indicates that the line slopes upward from left to right. Understanding gradients is essential for analyzing and interpreting linear relationships in various mathematical scenarios.
