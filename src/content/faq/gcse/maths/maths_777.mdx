To determine what $30\%$ of $200$ is, we can follow a systematic approach that utilizes the percentage formula:

$$
\text{Percentage} \times \text{Whole Number} = \text{Result}
$$

In this instance, the percentage is $30\%$, and the whole number is $200$. The first step is to convert the percentage into a decimal by dividing by $100$. Thus, $30\%$ becomes $0.30$. We then multiply this decimal by the whole number:

$$
0.30 \times 200 = 60.
$$

Alternatively, we can break the calculation down into simpler steps. It is known that $10\%$ of $200$ equals $20$ because calculating $10\%$ involves dividing by $10$:

$$
200 \div 10 = 20.
$$

Since $30\%$ is three times $10\%$, we can find $30\%$ by multiplying $20$ by $3$:

$$
20 \times 3 = 60.
$$

Another approach is to use the method of proportions. We can set up a proportion where $30\%$ is to $100\%$ as $x$ is to $200$. This can be represented as:

$$
\frac{30}{100} = \frac{x}{200}.
$$

To solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply:

$$
30 \times 200 = 100 \times x.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
6000 = 100x.
$$

By dividing both sides by $100$, we find:

$$
x = 60.
$$

In conclusion, all methods yield the same result: $30\%$ of $200$ is $60$.
