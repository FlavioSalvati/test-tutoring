To translate a triangle using the vector $(2, 2)$, you simply add $2$ to each of the x-coordinates and $2$ to each of the y-coordinates of the triangle's vertices.

When you translate a shape, you essentially move it without altering its orientation or size. In this case, the vector $(2, 2)$ indicates that the triangle should be shifted $2$ units to the right and $2$ units upwards. Every vertex of the triangle will be moved in this same manner.

Suppose the vertices of your triangle are defined as $A(1, 1)$, $B(3, 1)$, and $C(2, 4)$. To carry out the translation by the vector $(2, 2)$, you will add $2$ to each x-coordinate and $2$ to each y-coordinate. The calculations for the new coordinates are as follows:

- For vertex $A$: 
  $$ A' = (1 + 2, 1 + 2) = A'(3, 3) $$
  
- For vertex $B$: 
  $$ B' = (3 + 2, 1 + 2) = B'(5, 3) $$
  
- For vertex $C$: 
  $$ C' = (2 + 2, 4 + 2) = C'(4, 6) $$

After the translation, the new coordinates of the triangle's vertices are $A'(3, 3)$, $B'(5, 3)$, and $C'(4, 6)$. This translated triangle maintains the same shape and size as the original triangle, but it is now positioned differently on the coordinate plane.

Translating shapes is a fundamental concept in geometry that enhances your understanding of how shapes can move within a plane. This concept has practical applications in areas such as computer graphics and solving real-world problems. Remember, the essential principle is to consistently apply the same translation vector to each vertex of the shape.
