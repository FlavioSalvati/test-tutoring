The power of a power rule is expressed mathematically as 

$$(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}.$$

This rule states that when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. It is a valuable tool for simplifying expressions that involve exponents. 

For instance, consider the expression $(x^2)^3$. To simplify it, you multiply the exponents: 

$$2 \times 3 = 6,$$ 

which leads to 

$$(x^2)^3 = x^6.$$

Letâ€™s delve deeper into the concept. When you have $(a^m)^n$, the power of a power rule dictates that you multiply the exponent $m$ by the exponent $n$. This multiplication occurs because raising a number to a power means multiplying that number by itself a specified number of times. Therefore, raising $a^m$ to the power of $n$ involves multiplying $a^m$ by itself $n$ times. Each multiplication adds the exponents, resulting in the need to multiply $m$ and $n$.

To illustrate this with a practical example, consider $(2^3)^4$. First, compute $2^3$, which equals $8$. Next, raise $8$ to the power of $4$:

$$8 \times 8 \times 8 \times 8 = 4096.$$

Alternatively, applying the power of a power rule allows you to directly multiply the exponents:

$$3 \times 4 = 12,$$ 

thus simplifying the expression to 

$$(2^3)^4 = 2^{12}.$$ 

Calculating $2^{12}$ also yields $4096$.

This rule not only simplifies complex expressions but also makes calculations more manageable, especially when dealing with large exponents. It is a fundamental concept in algebra that aids in solving equations and enhances the understanding of the properties of exponents.
