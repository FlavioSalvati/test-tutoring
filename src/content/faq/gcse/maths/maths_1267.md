To determine the area of a compound shape, begin by dividing it into simpler, more manageable geometric figures. Then, calculate the area of each individual shape and sum them to find the total area.

The first step when working with compound shapes is to break the overall figure down into basic shapes such as rectangles, triangles, and circles. This simplification allows for easier area calculations. For instance, if you have an L-shaped figure, you can partition it into two rectangles.

After identifying the simpler shapes, apply the appropriate formulas to compute the area of each one. For rectangles, the area is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
$$

For triangles, the area can be found using the formula:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

For circles, the area is determined by the formula:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{circle}} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2
$$

Once you have computed the areas of all individual shapes, sum them to obtain the total area of the compound shape. It is important to double-check your calculations for accuracy. Additionally, if there are any sections that need to be subtracted from the total area—such as holes or cut-out parts—calculate the area of these sections and subtract that value from the total.

By following these systematic steps, you can accurately and efficiently find the area of any compound shape, making the process manageable even for more complex figures.
