To identify points of inflection, we need to determine where the second derivative of a function changes its sign.

Points of inflection occur where a curve transitions between concave up and concave down, or vice versa. To locate these points, the first step is to compute the second derivative of the function, denoted as $f''(x)$. This derivative provides crucial information regarding the curvature of the function.

Begin by finding the first derivative, $f'(x)$, of the function $f(x)$. This first derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any given point. Next, differentiate $f'(x)$ to obtain the second derivative, $f''(x)$.

Once you have calculated $f''(x)$, solve the equation 

$$ 
f''(x) = 0 
$$ 

to identify potential points of inflection. The solutions to this equation yield x-values where the second derivative is zero, which suggests a possible change in concavity. However, not every solution to $f''(x) = 0$ guarantees a point of inflection.

To confirm whether a point is indeed an inflection point, you must check if the second derivative changes sign at these x-values. Select values that are slightly less than and slightly greater than each candidate point of inflection and substitute them into $f''(x)$. If $f''(x)$ transitions from positive to negative or from negative to positive, then the function has a point of inflection at that specific x-value.

For instance, if $f''(x)$ changes from positive to negative, it indicates that the curve shifts from concave up to concave down, confirming a point of inflection. Conversely, if $f''(x)$ changes from negative to positive, this signifies a transition from concave down to concave up, also indicating a point of inflection.
