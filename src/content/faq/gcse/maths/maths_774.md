To calculate 20% of 50, we start by understanding the concept of percentages. A percentage represents a fraction of 100; thus, 20% signifies 20 out of every 100. 

To find 20% of 50, we can use the following formula:

$$ 
\text{Percentage} \times \text{Whole Number} = \text{Part} 
$$

In this scenario, the percentage is $20\%$, and the whole number is $50$. The first step is to convert the percentage into a decimal by dividing it by $100$:

$$ 
20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 
$$

Next, we multiply this decimal by the whole number:

$$ 
0.2 \times 50 = 10 
$$

Therefore, we find that $20\%$ of $50$ is $10$. This method can be applied to determine any percentage of any whole number. Just remember the key steps: convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by $100$, and then multiply by the whole number. This straightforward approach allows you to find the portion of the whole that the percentage represents.
