An even number is defined as an integer that can be divided by $2$ without leaving a remainder.

To identify whether a number is even, you can examine its last digit. If the last digit is $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, or $8$, the number is classified as even. For instance, the numbers $14$, $28$, and $102$ are all even because their last digits are $4$, $8$, and $2$, respectively.

Another way to determine if a number is even is by dividing it by $2$. If the result is an integer (a whole number), then the original number is even. For example, dividing $16$ by $2$ yields $8$, which is an integer, confirming that $16$ is indeed even. In contrast, dividing $15$ by $2$ gives $7.5$, which is not an integer, indicating that $15$ is not an even number.

Mathematically, an even number can be expressed in the form $2n$, where $n$ is any integer. This formulation illustrates that any number that can be represented as twice another whole number is even. For example, since $2 \times 3 = 6$, it follows that $6$ is an even number.

Understanding even numbers is crucial in various branches of mathematics, including algebra and number theory. Recognizing even numbers can simplify calculations and enhance problem-solving efficiency. For instance, the sum of two even numbers is always even, and the product of an even number with any integer is also even.
