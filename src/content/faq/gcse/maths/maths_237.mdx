The derivative of the function $ y = x^2 $ is given by 

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x. 
$$

To understand why this is true, let's break down the concept of derivatives. A derivative measures the rate at which a function's value changes in response to changes in its input. In simpler terms, it represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any specific point.

For the function $ y = x^2 $, we can apply the power rule to find the derivative. The power rule states that if you have a function of the form $ y = x^n $, where $ n $ is a constant, then the derivative is calculated as 

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = nx^{n-1}. 
$$

In our case, since $ y = x^2 $, we set $ n = 2 $. By applying the power rule, we derive:

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x^{2-1} = 2x. 
$$

This result indicates that, for any given value of $ x $, the slope of the tangent line to the curve $ y = x^2 $ is $ 2x $. For instance, when $ x = 1 $, the slope becomes $ 2 \times 1 = 2 $. Similarly, when $ x = 3 $, the slope is $ 2 \times 3 = 6 $.

Understanding derivatives is essential in various fields of mathematics and science, as they allow us to analyze how quantities change. In this example, knowing that the derivative of $ y = x^2 $ is $ 2x $ helps us predict the behavior of the function as $ x $ increases or decreases.
