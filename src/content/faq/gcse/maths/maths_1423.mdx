To translate a shape using the vector $(3, -2)$, you need to move each point of the shape 3 units to the right and 2 units down.

Translation is a process that shifts a shape without altering its orientation or size. The vector $(3, -2)$ provides specific instructions for this movement. Here, the first component, $3$, indicates that each point of the shape should be moved $3$ units to the right. The second component, $-2$, signifies that each point should be moved $2$ units downward.

Consider a point on the shape located at coordinates $(x, y)$. To translate this point by the vector $(3, -2)$, you simply adjust the coordinates: add $3$ to the $x$-coordinate and subtract $2$ from the $y$-coordinate. Consequently, the new coordinates of the point will be $(x + 3, y - 2)$.

For instance, letâ€™s say you have a triangle with vertices located at $(1, 2)$, $(4, 5)$, and $(6, 3)$. To translate each of these points according to the vector $(3, -2)$, calculate the new coordinates as follows:
- For the vertex $(1, 2)$: 
  $$ (1 + 3, 2 - 2) = (4, 0) $$
- For the vertex $(4, 5)$: 
  $$ (4 + 3, 5 - 2) = (7, 3) $$
- For the vertex $(6, 3)$: 
  $$ (6 + 3, 3 - 2) = (9, 1) $$

After translating all the vertices, you can redraw the triangle using these new coordinates. The resulting shape will maintain its form but will be positioned differently on the graph. This translation method applies to any geometric figure, including triangles, squares, and other polygons.
