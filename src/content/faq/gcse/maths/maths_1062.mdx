To construct a scalene triangle, you need to draw three sides of different lengths that connect to form a closed shape.

### Materials Needed
Begin by gathering the following tools:
- A ruler
- A protractor
- A pencil

### Steps to Create a Scalene Triangle

1. **Draw the First Side**: Start by drawing the first side of your triangle. Choose a specific length, for example, $5 \, \text{cm}$.

2. **Draw the Second Side**: Select a different length for the second side, such as $7 \, \text{cm}$. At one end of the first side, use your protractor to measure an angle. Draw the second side at this angle, ensuring it measures exactly $7 \, \text{cm}$.

3. **Draw the Third Side**: For the third side, choose yet another length distinct from the first two, for instance, $6 \, \text{cm}$. Connect the end of the second side to the free end of the first side, ensuring that this length is exactly $6 \, \text{cm}$.

By following these steps, you will form a closed shape with three sides of different lengths, which is the defining trait of a scalene triangle.

### Important Characteristics
In a scalene triangle, not only are all the sides of different lengths, but all the angles are also unique. To verify your construction, use the protractor to measure each angle and ensure that they are all distinct. This careful approach guarantees that your triangle is indeed scalene, with no sides or angles being equal.
