To determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, you can apply Pythagoras' theorem, which states:

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side and is positioned opposite the right angle. Pythagoras' theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that establishes a relationship among the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. Specifically, it asserts that the square of the length of the hypotenuse, denoted as $c$, is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, $a$ and $b$. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

To calculate the hypotenuse, you first need to know the lengths of the two shorter sides. For example, if the lengths of these sides are $3 \, \text{cm}$ and $4 \, \text{cm}$, you would first square these lengths:

$$
3^2 = 9 \quad \text{and} \quad 4^2 = 16.
$$

Next, you add these squared values together:

$$
9 + 16 = 25.
$$

Finally, to find the length of the hypotenuse, you take the square root of this sum:

$$
\sqrt{25} = 5.
$$

Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is $5 \, \text{cm}$.

This method is applicable to any right-angled triangle, regardless of the specific lengths of the sides. Just remember to square the lengths of the two shorter sides, add those squares together, and then take the square root of the result to find the hypotenuse. This simple yet powerful theorem is a cornerstone of geometry and finds extensive application in various fields, including construction and navigation.
