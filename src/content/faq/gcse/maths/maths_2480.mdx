An octagon is a polygon characterized by eight sides and eight angles.

In geometric terms, a polygon is a two-dimensional shape formed by straight line segments. An octagon, in particular, is a specific type of polygon that consists of exactly eight sides. Each side meets at a vertex, resulting in eight internal angles. The sum of these internal angles in an octagon is always $1080$ degrees. This value can be derived using the formula for calculating the sum of internal angles in a polygon, which is given by $(n-2) \times 180$ degrees, where $n$ represents the number of sides. For an octagon, where $n = 8$, the calculation is as follows: 

$$
(8-2) \times 180 = 1080 \text{ degrees}.
$$

Octagons can be classified as either regular or irregular. A regular octagon has all sides of equal length and all internal angles equal, with each angle measuring $135$ degrees. A common example of a regular octagon is the stop sign, frequently encountered in traffic signage. In contrast, irregular octagons feature sides and angles of varying lengths and measures.

Understanding octagons is essential across various disciplines, including architecture, engineering, and art. For example, octagonal shapes are often employed in design and construction due to their aesthetic appeal and advantageous structural properties. In mathematics, the study of octagons aids students in grasping broader concepts related to polygons and geometry, such as symmetry, tessellation, and the properties of angles and sides.

By exploring the characteristics of octagons, GCSE Maths students can cultivate a deeper understanding of geometric principles and their practical applications in the real world.
