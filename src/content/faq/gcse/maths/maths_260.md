The y-intercept of the equation $ y = -3x + 4 $ is $ 4 $.

In the equation $ y = -3x + 4 $, the y-intercept is defined as the point where the line intersects the y-axis. This intersection occurs when the value of $ x $ is $ 0 $. To determine the y-intercept, we substitute $ x = 0 $ into the equation. This yields:

$$
y = -3(0) + 4 = 4.
$$

Thus, the y-intercept is $ 4 $.

The y-intercept is a significant characteristic of a linear equation expressed in the form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. In this particular case, the slope is $ -3 $ and the y-intercept is $ 4 $. This indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, 4) $.

Understanding the y-intercept is crucial for graphing the line and analyzing its behavior. For example, knowing the y-intercept allows you to quickly plot the starting point of the line on a graph, facilitating a more accurate representation of the entire line.
