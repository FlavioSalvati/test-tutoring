To compute the fifth power of 3, you would need to multiply 3 by itself five times, which yields 243.

To provide a more detailed explanation, the process of raising a number to a power involves multiplying that number by itself a specific number of times. The expression for the fifth power of 3 is written as $3^5$. In this notation, the understanding is that you need to multiply 3 by itself five times. Therefore, you would perform the following calculation:

$$3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$$

Initially, you multiply the first pair of 3s:

$$3 \times 3 = 9$$

Next, you take this result and multiply it by the next 3:

$$9 \times 3 = 27$$

Subsequently, multiply this result by another 3:

$$27 \times 3 = 81$$

Finally, multiply this last result by the remaining 3:

$$81 \times 3 = 243$$

Thus, the end result is that $3^5 = 243$. This step-by-step breakdown of the calculation can enhance your understanding of the process of exponentiation, a fundamental concept in mathematics. Keep in mind, the exponent (in this case, 5) specifies how many times to use the base number (here, 3) as a factor in the multiplication.
