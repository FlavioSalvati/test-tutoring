The graph of the function $ y = \frac{1}{x} $ is characterized as a hyperbola consisting of two distinct branches, each located in separate quadrants of the Cartesian coordinate system.

To gain a clearer understanding, letâ€™s analyze the function in more detail. The equation $ y = \frac{1}{x} $ defines a reciprocal function, indicating that for every value of $ x $, the corresponding $ y $ value is the reciprocal of $ x $. When this function is plotted, it results in two separate curves that form the hyperbola.

In the first quadrant, where both $ x $ and $ y $ are positive, the behavior of the function is as follows: as $ x $ increases, $ y $ decreases, approaching zero but never actually reaching it. Conversely, as $ x $ approaches zero from the positive side, $ y $ increases rapidly towards positive infinity. This behavior creates a curve that asymptotically approaches both the x-axis and y-axis without ever touching them.

In the third quadrant, where both $ x $ and $ y $ are negative, the function exhibits similar behavior, but it is mirrored. As $ x $ decreases (becoming more negative), $ y $ also decreases (becoming more negative), approaching zero from the negative side. As $ x $ nears zero from the negative side, $ y $ decreases rapidly towards negative infinity. This results in a second curve that also gets infinitely close to the x-axis and y-axis without intersecting them.

These two branches of the hyperbola are asymptotic to both the x-axis and y-axis, meaning they approach these axes infinitely closely but never actually intersect them. This property is a fundamental characteristic of hyperbolas and is essential for identifying the graph of the function $ y = \frac{1}{x} $.
