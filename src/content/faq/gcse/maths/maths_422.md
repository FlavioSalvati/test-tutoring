To determine the area of a compound shape consisting of a semicircle and a square, we will calculate the areas of each individual shape separately and then combine them.

First, we need to identify the dimensions of both the square and the semicircle. Let's denote the side length of the square as $s$. The diameter of the semicircle is equal to the side length of the square, which means the radius $r$ of the semicircle can be expressed as:

$$
r = \frac{s}{2}
$$

Next, we will calculate the area of the square using the formula for the area of a square:

$$
\text{Area of the square} = s^2
$$

Now, we will proceed to calculate the area of the semicircle. The formula for the area of a full circle is given by $ \pi r^2 $. Since we only require the area of a semicircle, we will take half of this value:

$$
\text{Area of the semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
$$

Substituting the expression for the radius $r = \frac{s}{2}$ into the formula, we get:

$$
\text{Area of the semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{s}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{s^2}{4} \right) = \frac{\pi s^2}{8}
$$

Finally, to obtain the total area of the compound shape, we will add the areas of the square and the semicircle:

$$
\text{Total area} = s^2 + \frac{\pi s^2}{8}
$$

This systematic approach ensures that both components of the compound shape are accurately accounted for in the final calculation of the total area.
