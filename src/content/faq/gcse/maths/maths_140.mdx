The cost per item is £3.

To determine the cost per item when the total cost for 4 items is £12, we need to perform a division calculation. Specifically, we begin with the total cost of £12 and the quantity of items, which is 4.

We can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Cost per item} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of items}}
$$

Now, let's substitute the provided values into this formula:

$$
\text{Cost per item} = \frac{£12}{4}
$$

When we divide £12 by 4, we find that the cost per item is £3. Thus, each item costs £3.

This approach can be applied to any similar situation where you need to calculate the cost per item. Simply remember to divide the total cost by the number of items. Knowing how to accurately break down costs is a valuable skill in everyday life, whether you are shopping, budgeting, or planning events. This understanding can significantly enhance your ability to manage your finances effectively.
