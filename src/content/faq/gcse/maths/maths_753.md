To convert a ratio into a fraction, simply write the first number as the numerator and the second number as the denominator.

A ratio compares two quantities, illustrating how many times one value is contained within or relates to the other. For example, a ratio of $3:4$ indicates that for every $3$ units of the first quantity, there are $4$ units of the second quantity. To express this ratio as a fraction, you take the first number ($3$) and place it over the second number ($4$), resulting in the fraction $$\frac{3}{4}$$.

This fraction can be utilized in various mathematical operations, similar to any other fraction. For instance, you can simplify it, convert it to a decimal, or incorporate it into equations. If the ratio is more complex, such as $6:8$, you can simplify the corresponding fraction by identifying the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. In this case, the GCD of $6$ and $8$ is $2$, so you divide both the numerator and denominator by $2$, thereby simplifying the fraction to $$\frac{3}{4}$$.

Understanding the process of converting ratios to fractions is crucial in many mathematical fields, including proportions, scaling, and probability. It enables you to work with values in a more standardized and flexible format, facilitating calculations and the analysis of relationships between quantities.
