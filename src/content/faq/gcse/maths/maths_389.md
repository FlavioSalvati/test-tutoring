The formula for the circumference of a circle can be expressed as 

$$ C = 2\pi r $$ 

or 

$$ C = \pi d $$.

The circumference, denoted as $C$, represents the distance around the perimeter of the circle. To compute this distance, you can use either the radius ($r$) or the diameter ($d$) of the circle. The radius is defined as the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its edge, while the diameter is the distance across the circle, passing through the center. The diameter is precisely twice the length of the radius, or $d = 2r$.

In the formula 

$$ C = 2\pi r $$, 

the circumference is calculated using the radius. Here, $\pi$ (pi) is a mathematical constant that is approximately equal to $3.14159$. Thus, if you know the radius of the circle, you can find the circumference by multiplying the radius by $2$ and then by $\pi$.

Alternatively, the formula 

$$ C = \pi d $$ 

utilizes the diameter. Since the diameter is double the radius, this equation is essentially a simplified version of the first formula, eliminating the need to calculate the radius. To find the circumference, you simply multiply the diameter by $\pi$.

These formulas are fundamental concepts in geometry and have numerous practical applications, such as determining the length of a circular track or the perimeter of a round table. Mastering these formulas will greatly assist you in solving various problems related to circles, particularly in your GCSE Maths exams.
