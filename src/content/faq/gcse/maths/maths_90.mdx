The ratio $20:25$ can be simplified to $4:5$.

To simplify a ratio, you must first determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The GCD is the largest integer that divides both numbers evenly, without leaving a remainder. For the numbers $20$ and $25$, the GCD is $5$.

To simplify the ratio, divide both terms by their GCD. Specifically, dividing $20$ by $5$ results in $4$, and dividing $25$ by $5$ results in $5$. Thus, the simplified form of the ratio $20:25$ is $4:5$.

Simplifying ratios is analogous to simplifying fractions. This process makes the ratio clearer and more manageable, especially when comparing different ratios. In this instance, the ratio $4:5$ indicates that for every $4$ parts of one quantity, there are $5$ parts of another quantity. This simplified representation is particularly beneficial in various mathematical contexts and real-life scenarios, such as mixing ingredients or comparing quantities.
