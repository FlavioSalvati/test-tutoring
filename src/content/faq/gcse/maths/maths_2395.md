The y-intercept of the given linear equation is $-5$.

To find the y-intercept from the equation $ y = 2x - 5 $, it is essential to understand what the y-intercept signifies. In a linear equation expressed in the form $ y = mx + c $, the y-intercept is the value of $ y $ when $ x = 0 $. This is because the y-intercept indicates the point where the line intersects the y-axis, and at this intersection, the value of $ x $ is always $0$.

In the equation $ y = 2x - 5 $, it is already in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ represents the y-intercept. Here, we identify $ m = 2 $ and $ c = -5 $. Thus, the y-intercept is $-5$.

To confirm this, we can substitute $ x = 0 $ into the equation and solve for $ y $:

$$
y = 2(0) - 5 \\
y = -5
$$

This calculation verifies that the y-intercept is indeed $-5$. Consequently, the line intersects the y-axis at the point $(0, -5)$. Grasping this concept is vital for accurately graphing linear equations and analyzing their behavior.
