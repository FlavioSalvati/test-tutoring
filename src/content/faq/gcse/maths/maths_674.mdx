To calculate the percentage of a given number, you can follow a simple process: multiply the number by the percentage and then divide the result by $100$.

Let's break this down with an example. Suppose you want to determine $20\%$ of $50$. The first step is to convert the percentage into a decimal by dividing it by $100$. Thus, $20\%$ becomes $0.20$. Next, you multiply this decimal by the number you are interested in:

$$
0.20 \times 50 = 10.
$$

Therefore, $20\%$ of $50$ is $10$.

Alternatively, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Percentage of a Number} = \frac{\text{Percentage} \times \text{Number}}{100}.
$$

For instance, if you want to find $15\%$ of $200$, you would apply the formula as follows:

$$
\frac{15 \times 200}{100}.
$$

First, calculate $15 \times 200$ to get $3000$. Then, divide $3000$ by $100$:

$$
\frac{3000}{100} = 30.
$$

Thus, $15\%$ of $200$ is $30$.

This method is applicable for any percentage and any number. Remember to either convert the percentage to a decimal or use the formula to simplify your calculations. Practicing with various numbers and percentages will enhance your comfort and proficiency with these calculations.
