The expression representing "3 more than twice $ y $" is given by:

$$
2y + 3.
$$

To clarify this further, let's analyze the phrase "twice $ y $." In mathematical language, "twice" refers to multiplying by two, which is expressed as $ 2y $. Following this, we need to incorporate the phrase "3 more than," which indicates that we should add $ 3 $ to our previous result. Thus, when we add $ 3 $ to $ 2y $, we arrive at the expression $ 2y + 3 $. This expression is a straightforward linear equation where $ y $ serves as the variable, and the coefficients and constants are clearly defined.

In GCSE Mathematics, it is essential to grasp how to convert verbal phrases into algebraic expressions. The phrase "3 more than twice $ y $" can be divided into two distinct components: "twice $ y $" and "3 more than." First, we evaluate "twice $ y $," resulting in $ 2y $. Next, we add $ 3 $ to this value, culminating in the final expression $ 2y + 3 $.

Such problems are frequently encountered in algebra and provide valuable practice in forming and manipulating expressions. It is crucial to adhere to the order of operations and accurately translate verbal descriptions into mathematical symbols. Note that "more than" signifies addition, while "twice" indicates multiplication by $ 2 $. By mastering these translations, you will be better equipped to tackle more complex algebraic challenges.
