To graph the inequality $ x \geq -3 $ on a number line, begin by placing a solid dot at the point $ -3 $ and then shade the region extending to the right.

First, identify the point $ -3 $ on the number line; this serves as your reference point. The inequality $ x \geq -3 $ indicates that $ x $ can be equal to $ -3 $ or any value greater than $ -3 $. To visually represent this on the number line, it is essential to show that $ -3 $ is included in the solution set. You can indicate this by drawing a solid dot (or a filled circle) at $ -3 $. The solid dot signifies that $ -3 $ is part of the solution.

Next, you need to illustrate that all numbers greater than $ -3 $ are also included in the solution set. To accomplish this, draw a line or shade the area to the right of $ -3 $. Ensure that this shading extends infinitely to the right, indicating that every number greater than $ -3 $ is part of the solution set. You can add an arrow at the end of the shading to represent that it continues indefinitely.

In summary, the solid dot at $ -3 $ indicates that $ -3 $ is included in the solution, while the shading to the right signifies that all numbers greater than $ -3 $ are also included. This clear visual representation helps you and others quickly grasp the range of values that satisfy the inequality $ x \geq -3 $.
