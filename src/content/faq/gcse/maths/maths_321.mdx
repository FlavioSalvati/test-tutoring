To draw a tangent line to a circle, you must first locate the point of tangency and then construct a line that is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

Begin by identifying the center of the circle and the radius. The radius is defined as the line segment extending from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference. Next, select the point on the circle where you wish the tangent line to make contact; this is known as the point of tangency.

Now, draw the radius that connects the center of the circle to the point of tangency. The tangent line will be perpendicular to this radius at the point of tangency. To achieve this, use a protractor or a set square to draw a line that forms a $90^\circ$ angle with the radius at the point of tangency. This newly drawn line represents your tangent line, which will touch the circle at exactly one point without intersecting it.

If you need to draw a tangent from a point located outside the circle, begin by drawing a line from this external point to the center of the circle. Next, utilize a compass to create a circle with the same radius as the original circle, centered at the external point. The intersections of this new circle with the original circle will provide the points of tangency. Finally, draw lines from the external point to these points of tangency; these lines will serve as the tangents to the original circle.
