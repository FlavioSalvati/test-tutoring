The coordinates of the y-intercept for the equation $ y = x - 4 $ are given by the point $ (0, -4) $.

In a linear equation represented by the form $ y = mx + c $, the y-intercept is the specific point where the line intersects the y-axis. This intersection occurs when the value of $ x $ is equal to $0$. To determine the y-intercept, we substitute $ x = 0 $ into the equation and solve for $ y $.

For the equation $ y = x - 4 $, we perform the substitution as follows:

$$
y = 0 - 4 
$$
$$
y = -4 
$$

Thus, when $ x = 0 $, we find that $ y = -4 $. This means that the line intersects the y-axis at the point $ (0, -4) $. The y-intercept is an important point as it provides a reference for graphing the line and understanding its overall behavior.

In this scenario, the y-intercept indicates that the line begins 4 units below the origin on the y-axis. This information, along with the slope of the line (which is $ 1 $ in this equation, corresponding to a 45-degree angle ascending to the right), is essential for accurately sketching the graph. It's important to note that the y-intercept is always expressed as a coordinate pair, where the x-coordinate is $ 0 $ and the y-coordinate represents the constant term from the equation.
