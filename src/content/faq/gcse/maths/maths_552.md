The probability of drawing a heart after the first card drawn is a diamond is given by the fraction $\frac{13}{51}$.

In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, there are 13 cards in each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. When you draw the first card and it is a diamond, one of the 13 diamonds is removed from the deck. As a result, there are now 51 cards remaining.

Since the first card drawn is a diamond, the number of hearts in the deck remains unchanged at 13. To determine the probability of drawing a heart next, we need to analyze the number of favorable outcomes (drawing a heart) relative to the total number of possible outcomes (the remaining cards in the deck).

The number of favorable outcomes is 13 (the number of hearts), and the total number of possible outcomes is 51 (the cards left in the deck). Therefore, the probability of drawing a heart given that the first card was a diamond is 

$$
P(\text{Heart} | \text{Diamond}) = \frac{13}{51}.
$$

This fraction represents the likelihood of drawing a heart after a diamond has been drawn first. While this probability can also be expressed as a decimal or a percentage, it is perfectly acceptable to leave it in fractional form for most GCSE Maths problems.
