To determine the area of a circle, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2
$$

The area of a circle represents the amount of space enclosed within its boundary. To compute this area, it is essential to know the radius of the circle, which is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference. The formula for the area is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \pi \times r^2
$$

where $\pi$ (pi) is a mathematical constant, approximately equal to $3.14159$.

For instance, if the radius of the circle is $5 \, \text{cm}$, you would substitute this value into the formula to calculate the area:

$$
\text{Area} = \pi \times 5^2 = \pi \times 25
$$

Using the approximate value of $\pi$, the area can be computed as:

$$
\text{Area} \approx 3.14159 \times 25 \approx 78.54 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

It is crucial to square the radius before multiplying by $\pi$. Squaring the radius entails multiplying the radius by itself; in this case, $5$ squared is $25$. After obtaining this result, you then multiply by $\pi$ to arrive at the final area.

Keep in mind that the radius is half of the diameter of the circle. If you are provided with the diameter instead, you can easily find the radius by dividing the diameter by $2$. For example, if the diameter is $10 \, \text{cm}$, the radius would be:

$$
\text{radius} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{cm}
$$

Grasping this formula is essential for addressing various problems in geometry and has practical applications in real life, such as determining the area of circular gardens, pizzas, or any round objects.
