Differentiation is a fundamental mathematical process used to determine the rate of change of a function with respect to its variable.

In essence, differentiation calculates the derivative of a function. The derivative quantifies how the value of the function changes as its input varies. For instance, if we have a function $ f(x) $ that models the position of a car over time, the derivative $ f'(x) $ provides the car's speed at any specific moment.

To differentiate a function, certain rules must be applied. The most basic of these is the power rule, which states that if $ f(x) = x^n $, then the derivative is given by $ f'(x) = nx^{n-1} $. There are additional rules for differentiating sums, products, and quotients of functions, as well as for composite functions, which utilize the chain rule.

Consider the function $ y = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 $. To find the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $, we differentiate each term individually. Applying the power rule, we find that the derivative of $ 3x^2 $ is $ 6x $, the derivative of $ 2x $ is $ 2 $, and the derivative of the constant $ 1 $ is $ 0 $. Thus, the derivative can be expressed as:

$$
y' = 6x + 2.
$$

This derivative $ y' $ indicates how $ y $ changes as $ x $ changes. For example, if we set $ x = 1 $, we calculate:

$$
y' = 6(1) + 2 = 8.
$$

This result means that at $ x = 1 $, the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ is $ 8 $.
