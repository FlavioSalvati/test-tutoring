The probability of rolling a 5 on a fair six-sided die is $\frac{1}{6}$.

To clarify this concept, letâ€™s first define what a fair six-sided die is. A fair die is one where each of the six faces, numbered from $1$ to $6$, has an equal chance of landing face up when rolled. This impartiality is crucial because it ensures that no particular number is favored over others.

Probability quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring. It is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, we are particularly interested in the event of rolling a 5.

On a six-sided die, only one face displays the number 5, which means there is exactly one favorable outcome. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling the die is $6$, corresponding to its six faces.

Using the probability formula:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

we can substitute the relevant values:

$$
\text{Probability of rolling a 5} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

This fraction, $\frac{1}{6}$, indicates the likelihood of rolling a 5 on a fair six-sided die. In decimal form, this probability is approximately $0.1667$, which corresponds to $16.67\%$ when expressed as a percentage. This implies that if you roll the die numerous times, you can expect to roll a 5 about $16.67\%$ of the time.
