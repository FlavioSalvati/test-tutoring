To calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of $7 \, \text{cm}$, we can use the formula:

$$
C = 2\pi r
$$

Here, $C$ represents the circumference, $\pi$ (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $3.14159$, and $r$ is the radius of the circle.

In this specific case, the radius $r$ is given as $7 \, \text{cm}$. By substituting this value into the formula, we have:

$$
C = 2 \times \pi \times 7
$$

Next, we proceed to perform the multiplication:

$$
C = 2 \times 3.14159 \times 7
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
C \approx 2 \times 3.14159 \times 7 \approx 43.98226
$$

Thus, the circumference of the circle is approximately $43.98 \, \text{cm}$. 

For GCSE Maths purposes, it is common to use the value of $\pi$ as $3.14$ for simplicity. Using this approximation, we can calculate the circumference as follows:

$$
C = 2 \times 3.14 \times 7 = 43.96
$$

Therefore, when using $\pi \approx 3.14$, the circumference is $43.96 \, \text{cm}$. This approach allows you to accurately determine the circumference of any circle provided you know its radius.
