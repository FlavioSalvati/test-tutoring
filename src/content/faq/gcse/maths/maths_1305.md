To determine the missing side of a right-angled triangle, you can utilize the formula derived from Pythagoras' Theorem: 

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry specifically applicable to right-angled triangles. It states that in such a triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this formula, $c$ denotes the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ represent the two other sides.

To apply Pythagoras' Theorem, first, identify the hypotenuse, which is always the longest side and is located opposite the right angle. If you are provided with the lengths of the two shorter sides and need to calculate the hypotenuse, follow these steps: square the lengths of both sides, add the squares together, and then take the square root of this sum. For example, if $a = 3$ and $b = 4$, the calculation for $c$ would be:

$$
c = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
$$

Alternatively, if you need to find the length of one of the shorter sides and you know the length of the hypotenuse and the other side, you can rearrange the formula to isolate the missing side. For instance, if you know $c$ and $a$, and need to find $b$, the formula can be rearranged to:

$$
b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}.
$$

As an example, if $c = 5$ and $a = 3$, then $b$ can be calculated as follows:

$$
b = \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{25 - 9} = \sqrt{16} = 4.
$$

It is crucial to verify that the triangle in question is indeed a right-angled triangle before employing Pythagoras' Theorem, as this theorem is only valid for such triangles.
