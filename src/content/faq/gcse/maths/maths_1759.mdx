To simplify the expression $2^{3+2}$, we begin by evaluating the exponent first, which leads us to calculate $2^5$, resulting in $32$.

When simplifying expressions with exponents, it is crucial to adhere to the order of operations, commonly remembered by the acronym BIDMAS, which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction. In this specific case, the expression $2^{3+2}$ has an exponent that includes an addition operation. According to BIDMAS, we should first resolve any calculations inside brackets before dealing with the indices (exponents).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Evaluate the expression inside the exponent**: 
   $$3 + 2 = 5$$
   Thus, we can rewrite $2^{3+2}$ as $2^5$.

2. **Calculate $2^5$**:
   This means we multiply $2$ by itself five times:
   $$2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$$
   We can simplify this multiplication step-by-step:
   - First, calculate $2 \times 2$:
     $$2 \times 2 = 4$$
   - Next, take that result and multiply by $2$:
     $$4 \times 2 = 8$$
   - Then, multiply by $2$ again:
     $$8 \times 2 = 16$$
   - Finally, multiply by $2$ one last time:
     $$16 \times 2 = 32$$

Thus, we find that $2^5 = 32$. Therefore, the simplified form of $2^{3+2}$ is $32$. This method ensures that we follow the correct order of operations and arrive at the correct answer.
