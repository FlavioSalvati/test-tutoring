To divide $45$ by $9$ using a calculator, follow these simple steps:

1. Turn on your calculator.
2. Input the number $45$ by pressing the '4' key followed by the '5' key.
3. Locate the division key, which is typically represented by the symbol 'รท' or sometimes by a forward slash '/'.
4. Press the division key to indicate that you wish to perform a division operation.
5. Now, input the divisor by pressing the number '9'.
6. Finally, press the equals key '=' to execute the division.

The display will then show the result, which is $5$.

This process is straightforward and allows you to obtain the correct answer quickly. It is essential to follow these steps in the correct order to avoid any errors. Calculators are designed to efficiently perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, making them valuable tools for verifying your calculations in GCSE Maths. 

However, remember that practicing these operations manually is also crucial for developing a solid understanding of mathematical concepts.
