To determine the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the hypotenuse measures $5 \, \text{cm}$ in this example.

The Pythagorean theorem is a crucial concept in geometry specifically relating to right-angled triangles. It asserts that in such a triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship is expressed with the formula:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

where $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the legs, and $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse.

In our current scenario, the lengths of the legs are $3 \, \text{cm}$ and $4 \, \text{cm}$. Substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
3^2 + 4^2 = c^2
$$

Calculating the squares gives us:

$$
9 + 16 = c^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
25 = c^2
$$

To find $c$, we take the square root of both sides:

$$
c = \sqrt{25}
$$

Thus, we find that:

$$
c = 5 \, \text{cm}
$$

Therefore, the hypotenuse of this triangle measures $5 \, \text{cm}$. This method is applicable to any right-angled triangle, provided that the lengths of the two legs are known. It is important to note that the Pythagorean theorem is only valid for right-angled triangles, so ensure that the triangle has a $90$-degree angle before using this formula.
