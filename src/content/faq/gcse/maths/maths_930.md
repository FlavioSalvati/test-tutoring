Let's enhance the clarity and readability of your content while ensuring all mathematical expressions are formatted correctly using LaTeX. Here's the revised version:

You can recognize the graph of the equation 

$$
y = (x+1)^2 - 4 
$$

as a parabola that opens upwards, which has been shifted both horizontally to the left and vertically downward.

To analyze this graph in greater detail, we will begin with the standard form of a parabola, given by 

$$
y = x^2. 
$$ 

This represents a U-shaped curve that opens upwards, with its vertex located at the origin, specifically at the point $ (0, 0) $. The equation 

$$
y = (x+1)^2 - 4 
$$ 

can be viewed as a transformation of this basic parabola.

First, letâ€™s examine the term $ (x+1)^2 $. This component introduces a horizontal shift; specifically, the expression $ (x+1) $ indicates that the graph is shifted 1 unit to the left. As a result, the vertex, which originally was at $ (0, 0) $, moves to $ (-1, 0) $.

Next, we consider the term $-4$ that appears outside the squared expression. This term signifies a vertical shift. By subtracting 4, we move the entire graph 4 units downward. Consequently, the vertex, which was located at $ (-1, 0) $ after the horizontal shift, is now relocated to $ (-1, -4) $.

In summary, the graph of 

$$
y = (x+1)^2 - 4 
$$ 

is a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex positioned at the point $ (-1, -4) $. While the shape of the parabola remains unchanged compared to $ y = x^2 $, its position has been shifted accordingly.

To sketch this graph, begin by plotting the vertex at $ (-1, -4) $. Next, draw the U-shaped curve that opens upwards, ensuring it is symmetrical about the vertical line $ x = -1 $. The graph will also pass through points such as $ (-2, -3) $ and $ (0, -3) $. You can determine these points by substituting specific values of $ x $ into the equation.
