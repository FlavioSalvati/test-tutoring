To determine the length of a missing side in a right-angled triangle, you can apply Pythagoras' theorem, which is expressed as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

In this theorem, the side opposite the right angle is known as the hypotenuse, denoted by $c$, and it is the longest side of the triangle. The other two sides are referred to as the legs, labeled $a$ and $b$.

Pythagoras' theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse's length ($c$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs ($a$ and $b$). 

If you are given the lengths of both legs ($a$ and $b$), you can find the length of the hypotenuse ($c$) by rearranging the formula as follows:

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

For example, if one leg measures $3$ units and the other leg measures $4$ units, you can calculate the hypotenuse as follows:

$$
c = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \text{ units}
$$

Conversely, if you know the length of the hypotenuse and one leg, you can find the length of the other leg by rearranging the formula. You can use:

$$
a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2} \quad \text{or} \quad b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}
$$

For instance, if the hypotenuse is $10$ units and one leg is $6$ units, you can find the length of the other leg as follows:

$$
b = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8 \text{ units}
$$

Always remember to verify that the triangle in question is indeed a right-angled triangle before applying Pythagoras' theorem, as this principle is specifically applicable to right-angled triangles.
