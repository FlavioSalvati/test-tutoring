The metric unit commonly used for measuring temperature is the degree Celsius, denoted as °C.

In the metric system, temperature is typically expressed in degrees Celsius. This unit is named in honor of the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who devised a similar temperature scale. The Celsius scale is grounded in the behavior of water, where $0\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ marks the freezing point and $100\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ signifies the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric pressure. This framework makes the Celsius scale both intuitive and practical for everyday applications, particularly in scientific contexts.

The Celsius scale is an integral part of the International System of Units (SI), which is the predominant system of measurement used globally. In scientific research and calculations, the Celsius scale is frequently employed due to its compatibility with the Kelvin scale, another significant temperature scale in scientific disciplines. The Kelvin scale begins at absolute zero—theoretical lowest temperature possible—and each increment on the Kelvin scale corresponds directly to one degree Celsius. To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, simply add $273.15$ to the Celsius value.

A solid understanding of the Celsius scale is essential for GCSE Maths students, as it often features in problems related to temperature variations, energy calculations, and scientific experiments. For instance, you may be required to determine the change in temperature when a substance is either heated or cooled, or to convert temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin. Being familiar with the Celsius scale will significantly enhance your ability to solve these types of problems with confidence.
