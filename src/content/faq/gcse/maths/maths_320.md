To construct a triangle when given one angle and two sides, you can utilize either the angle-side-side (ASS) or side-angle-side (SAS) method.

First, identify the components you have: the angle (denote it as $ \angle A $) and the two sides (label them as $ b $ and $ c $). If the given angle is positioned between the two sides, the SAS method should be employed. Conversely, if the angle is not situated between the two sides, the ASS method is appropriate.

### Using the SAS Method:

1. Begin by drawing one of the given sides, let’s say side $ b $, using a ruler.
2. At one end of side $ b $, employ a protractor to measure and draw the specified angle $ \angle A $.
3. From the vertex of the angle, extend the measurement of the second side $ c $ along the direction defined by the angle.
4. Finally, connect the endpoint of side $ c $ to the other endpoint of side $ b $ to complete the triangle.

### Using the ASS Method:

1. Start by drawing one of the given sides, again let’s choose side $ b $, with a ruler.
2. At one end of side $ b $, use a protractor to accurately measure and draw the given angle $ \angle A $.
3. From the vertex of the angle, measure the length of the second side $ c $ along the direction indicated by the angle.
4. If the second side does not intersect with the first side, you may need to adjust the angle or the length of the side to ensure they connect and form a triangle.

### Important Considerations:

Be aware that the ASS method may lead to scenarios where no triangle is formed or where two distinct triangles can be created. Therefore, it is crucial to double-check your measurements to ensure accuracy in constructing the triangle.
