The formula for calculating the distance between two points is based on the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in their coordinates.

To determine the distance between two points, $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $, on a Cartesian coordinate plane, we employ the distance formula. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle. In this context, envision a right-angled triangle where the horizontal leg represents the difference in the x-coordinates, $ (x_2 - x_1) $, and the vertical leg represents the difference in the y-coordinates, $ (y_2 - y_1) $. The distance between these two points corresponds to the hypotenuse of this triangle.

The distance formula is expressed as:

$$ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} $$

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how to use this formula:

1. Compute the horizontal distance by subtracting the x-coordinate of the first point from the x-coordinate of the second point: $ x_2 - x_1 $.
2. Calculate the vertical distance by subtracting the y-coordinate of the first point from the y-coordinate of the second point: $ y_2 - y_1 $.
3. Square both of these differences: $ (x_2 - x_1)^2 $ and $ (y_2 - y_1)^2 $.
4. Add the squared differences together: $ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 $.
5. Finally, take the square root of this sum to find the distance: 

$$ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} $$

This formula provides the straight-line distance between the two points, often referred to as the Euclidean distance. It is a fundamental concept in geometry and has widespread applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science.
