To find the equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by the equation $y = -x + 7$ and passes through the point $(3, 5)$, we start by determining the slope (gradient) of the original line. 

The slope of the line $y = -x + 7$ is $-1$. For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must equal $-1$. Therefore, the slope of the line that is perpendicular to the original line will be the negative reciprocal of $-1$, which is $1$.

Next, we utilize the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is expressed as:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

In this equation, $m$ represents the slope, and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. In our case, we have $m = 1$ and the point $(3, 5)$.

Substituting these values into the point-slope form, we get:

$$
y - 5 = 1(x - 3)
$$

Now, we simplify this equation step by step:

1. Distributing the slope on the right side:
   $$
   y - 5 = x - 3
   $$

2. Adding $5$ to both sides to isolate $y$:
   $$
   y = x + 2
   $$

Thus, the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $y = -x + 7$ and passes through the point $(3, 5)$ is 

$$
y = x + 2.
$$

This method ensures that the new line has the correct slope and accurately passes through the specified point.
