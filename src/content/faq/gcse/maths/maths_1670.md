The formula for the correlation coefficient is given by:

$$
r = \frac{n(\sum xy) - (\sum x)(\sum y)}{\sqrt{[n\sum x^2 - (\sum x)^2][n\sum y^2 - (\sum y)^2]}}.
$$

The correlation coefficient, commonly denoted as $ r $, quantifies both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Its value ranges from $-1$ to $1$: a value of $-1$ signifies a perfect negative linear relationship, $1$ indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and $0$ denotes the absence of a linear relationship.

In this formula, $ n $ represents the total number of data points. The term $ \sum xy $ denotes the sum of the products of each pair of corresponding values from the two datasets. Meanwhile, $ \sum x $ and $ \sum y $ represent the sums of the values in each dataset, respectively. Additionally, $ \sum x^2 $ and $ \sum y^2 $ are the sums of the squares of the values in each dataset.

To further clarify, the numerator $ n(\sum xy) - (\sum x)(\sum y) $ computes the covariance between the two variables, which reflects the degree to which the variables change together. The denominator, 

$$
\sqrt{[n\sum x^2 - (\sum x)^2][n\sum y^2 - (\sum y)^2]},
$$ 

normalizes this covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables. This normalization ensures that the correlation coefficient is dimensionless and constrained between $-1$ and $1$.

Grasping this formula is essential for analyzing the relationship between two variables, a valuable skill across various fields such as economics, biology, and social sciences.
