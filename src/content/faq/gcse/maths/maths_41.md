In order to compare whole numbers, it is necessary to examine their digits in a left-to-right sequence, starting with the most significant place value--the leftmost digit. 

The initial step in comparing whole numbers involves aligning them according to their place value. This ensures that every digit is correctly positioned in its respective column. The comparison begins with the most significant place value. If the digits in this place value differ, the number with the larger digit is considered the greater number. As an illustration, when comparing $345$ and $678$, the comparison commences at the hundreds place, comparing $3$ versus $6$. As $6$ is greater than $3$, $678$ is thus the larger number.

In instances where the digits in the highest place value are identical, the comparison should proceed to the next place value on the right. This process is repeated until you encounter a place where the digits are different. For example, when comparing $456$ and $459$, the hundreds and tens digits are identical, being $4$ and $5$, respectively. Hence, the comparison then shifts to the units place, comparing $6$ versus $9$. As $9$ is larger than $6$, $459$ is therefore the larger number.

For cases where the numbers have varying lengths, the number with more digits is the larger number. For instance, $1234$ is larger than $234$ because it has an extra digit in the thousands place. This comparison method ensures an accurate determination of which whole number is larger, smaller, or if they are indeed equal.
