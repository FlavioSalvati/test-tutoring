The general solution to the equation $\cos(x) = 1$ is given by 

$$x = 2k\pi,$$ 

where $k$ can be any integer.

To comprehend why this is the correct solution, let's first revisit the meaning of the cosine function. In the context of a right-angled triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. However, when we consider the unit circle—a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin—the cosine of an angle corresponds to the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle.

The cosine function, $\cos(x)$, has a range that spans from $-1$ to $1$. It achieves its maximum value of $1$ at specific angles. On the unit circle, $\cos(x) = 1$ occurs when the angle $x$ corresponds to the coordinate point $(1, 0)$. This situation arises at $0$ radians. Since the cosine function is periodic with a period of $2\pi$, it repeats every $2\pi$ radians. Consequently, $\cos(x) = 1$ at angles such as $0$, $2\pi$, $4\pi$, $-2\pi$, $-4\pi$, and so forth.

In mathematical notation, we express this periodicity as 

$$x = 2k\pi,$$ 

where $k$ is any integer (i.e., $k \in \mathbb{Z}$). This indicates that $x$ can take any multiple of $2\pi$, including both positive and negative values. For instance, if $k = 0$, then $x = 0$; if $k = 1$, then $x = 2\pi$; if $k = -1$, then $x = -2\pi$, and so on.

Grasping this concept is essential for solving trigonometric equations and analyzing periodic functions, which are common topics in GCSE Mathematics.
