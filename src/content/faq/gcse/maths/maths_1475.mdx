The vector representation for translating the point $(2, -1)$ by the vector $(5, 3)$ is given by:

$$(2 + 5, -1 + 3) = (7, 2).$$

To elaborate, translating a point in a coordinate plane means shifting it by a specified distance in both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions. This shift is indicated by a vector. In this instance, the vector $(5, 3)$ signifies that we should move the point $5$ units to the right and $3$ units upward.

To determine the new coordinates of the translated point, you simply add the components of the translation vector to the original coordinates of the point. For the original point $(2, -1)$, you would perform the following calculations:

- **Original point:** $(2, -1)$
- **Translation vector:** $(5, 3)$

Calculating the new coordinates involves:

- **New x-coordinate:** $2 + 5 = 7$
- **New y-coordinate:** $-1 + 3 = 2$

Thus, the new coordinates after the translation are $(7, 2)$.

Utilizing vectors to translate points is a valuable method in various fields of mathematics and physics. It provides a clear and concise framework for describing movement and changes in position. Mastering this concept will enhance your ability to tackle more complex problems involving transformations and coordinate geometry.
