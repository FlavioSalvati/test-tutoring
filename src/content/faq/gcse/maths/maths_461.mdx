To determine an angle using the sine rule, you need to rearrange the formula to solve for the desired angle. 

The sine rule states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle remains constant. This relationship can be expressed as:

$$ 
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} 
$$

In this equation, $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle, while $A$, $B$, and $C$ denote the angles opposite those respective sides.

To find an angle, such as $A$, you will need the lengths of sides $a$ and $b$, as well as the measure of angle $B$. Rearranging the sine rule allows you to solve for $\sin A$:

$$ 
\sin A = \frac{a \cdot \sin B}{b} 
$$

Once you have calculated $\sin A$, you can use the inverse sine function, often referred to as arcsine, to find the angle $A$:

$$ 
A = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{a \cdot \sin B}{b} \right) 
$$

It is important to ensure that your calculator is set to the appropriate mode (degrees or radians) based on the requirements of your problem. This approach enables you to find an unknown angle in a triangle when you know two sides and the angle that is not situated between them.
