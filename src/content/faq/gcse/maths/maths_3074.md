A cumulative frequency graph provides a visual representation of how many data points fall below a specific value within a dataset.

When examining a cumulative frequency graph, you can quickly discern the overall distribution of the data. The graph begins at zero and increases as you move to the right, representing the cumulative total of frequencies. This feature allows you to grasp how the data accumulates across a range of values. For instance, if you wish to determine how many students scored below $70$ on a test, you can locate $70$ on the x-axis and identify the corresponding value on the y-axis.

The shape of the cumulative frequency graph conveys important insights about the data. If the graph rises steeply at the beginning and then levels off, it suggests that many data points are concentrated at the lower end of the range. Conversely, if the graph rises slowly at first and then steepens toward the end, it indicates that the majority of data points are situated at the higher end.

Moreover, a cumulative frequency graph can be used to identify key statistical measures, such as the median, lower quartile, and upper quartile. The median represents the value at which $50\%$ of the data points fall below. You can determine this by locating the point where the cumulative frequency equals half of the total frequency. Similarly, the lower quartile corresponds to $25\%$, while the upper quartile corresponds to $75\%$. These quartiles are essential for understanding the spread and central tendency of the data.

In summary, a cumulative frequency graph is a valuable tool for visualizing and analyzing the distribution of data, facilitating easier interpretation and comprehension.
