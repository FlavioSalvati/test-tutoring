To create a stem-and-leaf plot, you'll need to divide each data value into two parts: the stem and the leaf.

Begin by organizing your data set in ascending order. This step facilitates a clearer view of the distribution of values. Next, determine the place value for the stems and leaves. For instance, if your data set contains numbers like $34$, $45$, and $56$, the tens place digits ($3$, $4$, and $5$) will serve as the stems, while the units place digits ($4$, $5$, and $6$) will be the leaves.

Next, write the stems in a vertical column, starting with the smallest value at the top. Draw a vertical line to the right of this column to separate the stems from the leaves. For each data value, place the corresponding leaf next to its respective stem. If a stem has multiple leaves, arrange them in ascending order next to that stem.

For example, consider the data set $34$, $36$, $45$, $47$, $56$, and $58$. The resulting stem-and-leaf plot would be displayed as follows:

$$
3 | 4 \; 6 \\
4 | 5 \; 7 \\
5 | 6 \; 8
$$

This plot indicates that in the $30$s range, there are values $34$ and $36$; in the $40$s range, there are $45$ and $47$; and in the $50$s range, there are $56$ and $58$. This visual representation allows for a quick analysis of the distribution and frequency of data points in your set.
