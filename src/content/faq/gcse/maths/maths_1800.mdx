To find the sum of $456$ and $789$, we can use the column addition method. This involves writing the numbers one below the other, ensuring that the digits are aligned by place value (units, tens, hundreds). Hereâ€™s how it looks:

$$
\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
  & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
+ & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

We begin by adding the units column. Adding $6$ and $9$ gives us $15$. We write down the $5$ in the units place and carry over the $1$ to the tens column.

Next, we move to the tens column. We add $5$ and $8$, which equals $13$. Adding the $1$ we carried over results in $14$. We write down $4$ in the tens place and carry over another $1$ to the hundreds column.

Finally, we add the hundreds column. $4$ plus $7$ equals $11$, and adding the $1$ carried over brings us to $12$. We write down $2$ in the hundreds place and place the $1$ in the thousands place.

The completed addition looks like this:

$$
\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
  & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
+ & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
1 & 2 & 4 & 5 \\
\end{array}
$$

Thus, the sum of $456$ and $789$ is $1,245$. This method is effective for accurately managing any carrying of values to the next column, making it a reliable technique for adding large numbers.
