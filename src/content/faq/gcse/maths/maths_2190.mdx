The nth term of the sequence $3, 8, 15, 24$ can be expressed using the formula 

$$
n^2 + 2n.
$$

To derive the nth term of a sequence, we must first identify the underlying pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's analyze the given terms: $3, 8, 15, 24$. We begin by calculating the differences between consecutive terms:

$$
8 - 3 = 5,
$$
$$
15 - 8 = 7,
$$
$$
24 - 15 = 9.
$$

The first differences are $5, 7, 9$. Since these differences are not constant, we proceed to examine the second differences:

$$
7 - 5 = 2,
$$
$$
9 - 7 = 2.
$$

The second differences are constant (equal to $2$), which indicates that the sequence is quadratic. A quadratic sequence can generally be represented in the form 

$$
an^2 + bn + c.$$

Next, we need to determine the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$. We can utilize the first few terms of the sequence to set up a system of equations:

1. For $n = 1$:
   $$
   a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 3 \implies a + b + c = 3.
   $$
   
2. For $n = 2$:
   $$
   a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 8 \implies 4a + 2b + c = 8.
   $$
   
3. For $n = 3$:
   $$
   a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 15 \implies 9a + 3b + c = 15.
   $$

This leads to the following system of equations:

1. $ a + b + c = 3 $  (Equation 1)
2. $ 4a + 2b + c = 8 $  (Equation 2)
3. $ 9a + 3b + c = 15 $  (Equation 3)

By solving this system of equations, we find the values of the coefficients: $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 0$. 

Thus, we conclude that the nth term of the sequence is given by 

$$
n^2 + 2n.
$$

With this formula, we can calculate any term in the sequence by substituting the desired value of $n$.
