The gradient of the line represented by the equation $y = 3x + 5$ is $3$.

In the equation of a straight line, which is generally expressed in the form $y = mx + c$, the gradient (or slope) is denoted by the coefficient of $x$. In this particular case, the equation is $y = 3x + 5$. Here, the coefficient of $x$ is $3$, indicating that the gradient of the line is $3$.

The gradient of a line reflects its steepness. Specifically, it quantifies the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$. This means that for every unit increase in $x$, the value of $y$ increases by $3$ units. This relationship is often summarized by the term "rise over run," which describes how much $y$ "rises" for a given "run" along the $x$-axis.

Grasping the concept of the gradient is essential when analyzing the behavior of linear functions. A positive gradient, such as $3$ in this scenario, indicates that the line slopes upwards from left to right. In contrast, a negative gradient would signify that the line slopes downwards. If the gradient were $0$, the line would be horizontal, indicating that there is no change in $y$ as $x$ varies.

In summary, the gradient of $3$ in the equation $y = 3x + 5$ indicates a steep upward slope, with $y$ increasing by $3$ units for every $1$ unit increase in $x$. Understanding this concept is fundamental in GCSE Maths and is crucial for interpreting how various linear equations behave graphically.
