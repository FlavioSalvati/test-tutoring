An example of interval data is temperature measured in degrees Celsius.

Interval data refers to a type of quantitative data where the differences between values are meaningful. This characteristic allows for the addition and subtraction of values, as the intervals between them remain consistent. For example, the difference between $20^\circ C$ and $30^\circ C$ is the same as the difference between $30^\circ C$ and $40^\circ C$, both of which have an interval of $10$ degrees.

However, it is important to note that interval data does not possess a true zero point. In the context of temperature in degrees Celsius, $0^\circ C$ does not signify the absence of temperature; rather, it is simply a reference point on the scale. This contrasts with ratio data, which does have a true zero point indicating the complete absence of the quantity being measured. For instance, $0$ kilograms represents no weight at all.

Understanding interval data is crucial as it enables a variety of statistical analyses. You can compute the mean and standard deviation, as well as perform various statistical tests. However, it is not meaningful to multiply or divide interval data, since there is no true zero. For example, claiming that $20^\circ C$ is twice as hot as $10^\circ C$ is nonsensical in the same way it would be for ratio data.

In summary, temperature measured in degrees Celsius serves as a classic illustration of interval data, characterized by meaningful differences between values but lacking a true zero point.
