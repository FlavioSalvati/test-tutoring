The equation of a line perpendicular to $ y = -x + 6 $ is $ y = x + c $.

To understand why, let's start by looking at the given equation $ y = -x + 6 $. This is in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + b $, where $ m $ is the slope and $ b $ is the y-intercept. For $ y = -x + 6 $, the slope $ m $ is $-1$.

When two lines are perpendicular, their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. The negative reciprocal of $-1$ is $1$. Therefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to $ y = -x + 6 $ must be $1$.

Using the slope-intercept form again, a line with a slope of $1$ can be written as $ y = x + c $, where $ c $ is the y-intercept. The value of $ c $ can be any real number, depending on where the line crosses the y-axis.

For example, if $ c = 2 $, the equation of the perpendicular line would be $ y = x + 2 $. If $ c = -3 $, the equation would be $ y = x - 3 $. The key point is that the slope must be $1$ for the line to be perpendicular to $ y = -x + 6 $.

So, any line of the form $ y = x + c $ will be perpendicular to the given line, with $ c $ determining the specific position of the line on the graph.
