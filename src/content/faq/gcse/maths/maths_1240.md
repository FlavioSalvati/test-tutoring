The volume of a rectangular prism with dimensions of $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, and $5 \, \text{cm}$ is $60 \, \text{cm}^3$.

To calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, you need to multiply its length, width, and height. In this scenario, the dimensions provided are $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, and $5 \, \text{cm}$. The formula for the volume $V$ of a rectangular prism is given by:

$$
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
$$

Substituting the specified dimensions into this formula, we have:

$$
V = 3 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm}
$$

First, we multiply the length and width:

$$
3 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} = 12 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Next, we multiply this result by the height:

$$
12 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 60 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

Thus, the volume of the rectangular prism is $60 \, \text{cm}^3$. This indicates that if you were to fill the prism with unit cubes of $1 \, \text{cm}^3$, you would require $60$ such cubes to completely occupy the interior of the prism.

Understanding how to compute the volume of a rectangular prism is an essential skill in GCSE Mathematics, as it provides insight into the concept of three-dimensional space and how to quantify it effectively.
