To convert a fraction into a decimal, you can divide the numerator by the denominator using either long division or a calculator.

A fraction consists of two parts: the numerator, which is the top number, and the denominator, which is the bottom number. To transform a fraction into a decimal, you need to divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, when dealing with the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, you would perform the division $3 \div 4$.

You can carry out this division using long division, a systematic method for dividing numbers. Start by determining how many times the denominator fits into the numerator. If the denominator does not fit, you can add a decimal point and additional zeros to the numerator, continuing the division process until you reach either a repeating or a terminating decimal.

Alternatively, for a quicker and simpler method, you can use a calculator. Simply input the numerator, press the division symbol, and then input the denominator. The calculator will provide you with the decimal equivalent of the fraction.

For instance, to convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to a decimal using a calculator, you would enter $3 \div 4$, which yields $0.75$. Thus, the decimal representation of $\frac{3}{4}$ is $0.75$.

Mastering the conversion of fractions to decimals is an essential skill in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, and everyday calculations. Regular practice of this conversion will enhance your comfort and proficiency with both fractions and decimals.
