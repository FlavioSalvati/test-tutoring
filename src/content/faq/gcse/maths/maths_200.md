The inequality that represents "q is less than or equal to -1" is expressed mathematically as:

$$
q \leq -1.
$$

In mathematics, inequalities illustrate the relationship between two values when they are not equal. The symbol $ \leq $ denotes "less than or equal to." Therefore, when we state that 

$$
q \leq -1,
$$ 

we indicate that the value of $ q $ can be any number that is either less than $ -1 $ or exactly equal to $ -1 $.

To visualize this on a number line, you would begin by drawing a horizontal line and marking the point at $ -1 $. Next, you would shade the line to the left of $ -1 $ to represent all numbers that are less than $ -1 $. Additionally, you would place a closed circle (or dot) at $ -1 $ to signify that this value is included in the set of possible values for $ q $.

In practical terms, if you encounter the inequality $ q \leq -1 $ while solving a problem, you can conclude that any number such as $ -2, -3, -4, $ and so forth, including $ -1 $ itself, satisfies this inequality. This understanding is valuable in various mathematical contexts, such as solving equations, graphing functions, and analyzing data sets.

Grasping the concept of inequalities is a fundamental skill in GCSE Mathematics, as it enables you to describe and work with ranges of values rather than focusing solely on specific numbers. This skill proves particularly useful in real-world applications, such as determining acceptable ranges for measurements or analyzing trends in data.
