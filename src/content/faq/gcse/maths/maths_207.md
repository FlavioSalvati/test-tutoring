The given sequence $ 5, 11, 17, 23 $ follows a clear pattern: each term increases by $ 6 $ from the previous term.

To analyze this sequence in greater detail, letâ€™s examine the differences between each consecutive term. Starting with the first term, $ 5 $, and moving to the second term, $ 11 $, we find that:

$$
11 - 5 = 6.
$$

Next, we consider the difference between the second term $ 11 $ and the third term $ 17 $:

$$
17 - 11 = 6.
$$

Lastly, we check the difference between the third term $ 17 $ and the fourth term $ 23 $:

$$
23 - 17 = 6.
$$

The consistent difference of $ 6 $ indicates that this sequence is an arithmetic sequence. In such a sequence, each term is derived by adding a fixed value, referred to as the common difference, to the preceding term.

In an arithmetic sequence, the $ n $-th term can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d,
$$

where $ a_n $ represents the $ n $-th term, $ a_1 $ is the first term, $ n $ is the term number, and $ d $ is the common difference. For our sequence, the first term $ a_1 $ is $ 5 $ and the common difference $ d $ is $ 6 $. Consequently, the formula for the $ n $-th term of this sequence is:

$$
a_n = 5 + (n - 1) \times 6.
$$

For instance, to find the $ 4 $-th term, we substitute $ n = 4 $ into the formula:

$$
a_4 = 5 + (4 - 1) \times 6 = 5 + 18 = 23.
$$

This calculation confirms the $ 4 $-th term of the sequence indeed matches the given value. Understanding this pattern not only aids in predicting future terms but also equips students to tackle related problems in GCSE Mathematics.
