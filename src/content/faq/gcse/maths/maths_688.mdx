To effectively compare numbers presented in various forms, such as fractions, decimals, and percentages, it is essential to convert them to a common format. This approach simplifies the process of directly comparing their values.

For example, consider the numbers $\frac{1}{2}$, $0.75$, and $50\%$. To facilitate comparison, we can convert each of these into decimal form: 

- The fraction $\frac{1}{2}$ converts to $0.5$,
- The decimal $0.75$ remains $0.75$,
- The percentage $50\%$ converts to $0.5$.

After conversion, it is clear that $0.75$ is the largest value, followed by $0.5$.

### Converting Fractions to Decimals
To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. For instance, to convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to a decimal, you would perform the division $3 \div 4$, resulting in $0.75$.

### Converting Percentages to Decimals
To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide the percentage by $100$. For example, $25\%$ is converted to a decimal by calculating $25 \div 100$, which yields $0.25$.

### Converting Decimals and Percentages to Fractions
If you prefer working with fractions, you can also convert decimals and percentages into fraction form. 

- **Decimal to Fraction**: To convert a decimal to a fraction, express it as a fraction with a denominator of $1$, then multiply both the numerator and denominator by $10$ until the numerator is an integer. For example, $0.75$ can be expressed as $\frac{75}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{3}{4}$.

- **Percentage to Fraction**: To convert a percentage to a fraction, place the percentage over $100$ and simplify if possible. For instance, $50\%$ can be written as $\frac{50}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}$.

By converting all numbers to a common form, you can effortlessly compare their values and determine which number is larger or smaller.
