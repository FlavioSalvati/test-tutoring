The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the equation $ y = 5x - 2 $ is $ -\frac{1}{5} $.

To understand this result, let's first examine the equation $ y = 5x - 2 $. This equation is formatted as $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the gradient of the line. In this instance, the gradient $ m $ is equal to $5$.

A fundamental property of coordinate geometry states that when two lines are perpendicular, the product of their gradients is always equal to $-1$. This relationship is crucial for solving problems involving perpendicular lines. Therefore, if the gradient of one line is $ m $, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to it can be calculated using the formula $ -\frac{1}{m} $.

Given that the gradient of the original line is $5$, we can determine the gradient of the perpendicular line by finding the negative reciprocal of $5$. The negative reciprocal of $5$ is $ -\frac{1}{5} $. Hence, the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = 5x - 2 $ is indeed $ -\frac{1}{5} $.

This concept is particularly useful in various mathematical problems, such as determining the equation of a line that is perpendicular to a specified line and passes through a designated point. Remember, the crucial step is to take the negative reciprocal of the given gradient.
