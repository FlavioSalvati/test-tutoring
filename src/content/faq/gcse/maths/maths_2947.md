A tree diagram for combined events serves as a visual representation of all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities, illustrating the process step-by-step.

To create a tree diagram for combined events, begin by sketching a branching structure. Each branch corresponds to a potential outcome of an event. For instance, if you are flipping a coin followed by rolling a die, the initial set of branches will indicate the outcomes of the coin flip (either Heads or Tails). From each of these branches, extend further branches to depict the outcomes of the die roll, which can be any of the numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$ or $6$.

Label each branch with the probability of that outcome. For a fair coin, the probability of landing on Heads is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of Tails is also $\frac{1}{2}$. For a fair six-sided die, each face has an equal probability of $\frac{1}{6}$. To find the combined probability of each sequence of events, multiply the probabilities along the branches. For example, the probability of flipping Heads and subsequently rolling a $3$ can be calculated as:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{12}.
$$

Tree diagrams are particularly valuable for visualizing and calculating the probabilities of combined events, especially when the events are independent. They allow for a systematic listing of all possible outcomes, ensuring that no potential outcome is overlooked. This approach is also beneficial for more complex scenarios, such as drawing cards from a deck or navigating multiple stages of a game, where each stage may depend on the preceding one.

By breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable components, tree diagrams facilitate the analysis and resolution of probability questions, providing a clear and organized method for tackling these challenges.
