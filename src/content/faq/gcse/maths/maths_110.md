To express $85\%$ as a decimal, you can write it as $0.85$.

To convert a percentage into a decimal, you simply divide the percentage by $100$. This is because the term "percent" translates to "per hundred." Thus, $85\%$ can be interpreted as $85$ per $100$. When you perform the division, $85 \div 100$, you arrive at $0.85$.

Alternatively, you can visualize the conversion by shifting the decimal point two places to the left. For example, starting with $85.0$ (since $85\%$ is equivalent to $85.0\%$), moving the decimal point two positions left results in $0.85$.

Grasping how to convert percentages into decimals is essential in various mathematical fields, including probability, statistics, and financial calculations. For instance, if you achieve a test score of $85\%$, you can express this as $0.85$ when calculating your overall average. Likewise, if a bank advertises an interest rate of $85\%$, you would use $0.85$ in your computations to determine the interest you would earn.

Practicing these conversions will enhance your familiarity with different numerical formats and improve your overall mathematical proficiency.
