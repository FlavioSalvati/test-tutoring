The length of the line segment defined by the endpoints $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 8)$ is approximately $5.66$ units.

To calculate the length of a line segment between two points, we utilize the distance formula. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and is expressed as:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In this equation, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two endpoints. For our specific points, $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 8)$, we can substitute these values into the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (8 - 4)^2}
$$

First, we compute the differences in the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates:

$$
7 - 3 = 4
$$

$$
8 - 4 = 4
$$

Next, we square these differences:

$$
4^2 = 16
$$

$$
4^2 = 16
$$

Now, we sum these squared differences:

$$
16 + 16 = 32
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to determine the distance:

$$
\sqrt{32} \approx 5.66
$$

Thus, the length of the line segment is approximately $5.66$ units. This method is applicable for any pair of points in a coordinate plane, making it a valuable tool in geometry.
