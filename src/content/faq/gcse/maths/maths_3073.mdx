A cumulative frequency graph displays the running total of frequencies up to each data point, which is useful for determining medians and quartiles.

To interpret a cumulative frequency graph, begin by noting that the y-axis represents the cumulative frequency, defined as the sum of all frequencies up to a specific point on the x-axis. The x-axis typically denotes the data values or class intervals. As you progress from left to right along the x-axis, the cumulative frequency increases, resulting in a curve that never decreases.

To find the median, first identify the point on the y-axis that corresponds to half of the total frequency. From this point, draw a horizontal line until it intersects the cumulative frequency curve. Then, draw a vertical line from the intersection down to the x-axis. The x-coordinate of this intersection point represents the median.

For quartiles, you can apply a similar method. The lower quartile (denoted as $Q_1$) is located by finding the point on the y-axis that corresponds to one-quarter of the total frequency, while the upper quartile (denoted as $Q_3$) corresponds to three-quarters of the total frequency. Draw horizontal lines from these points to the curve, and then vertical lines down to the x-axis to determine the respective quartile values.

Furthermore, the cumulative frequency graph can be used to identify the interquartile range (IQR), which is calculated as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles ($Q_3 - Q_1$). This range provides insight into the spread of the middle 50% of the data. By analyzing the steepness of the curve, one can also infer the distribution of the data; a steeper curve indicates a higher concentration of data points within a specific range.
