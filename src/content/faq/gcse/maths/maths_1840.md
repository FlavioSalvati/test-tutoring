To divide numbers expressed in standard form, you need to follow a systematic approach: divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents of the powers of ten.

When dividing numbers in standard form, you begin by focusing on the coefficients, which are the numerical parts preceding the powers of ten. For example, consider the division $ (3 \times 10^5) \div (6 \times 10^2) $. The first step is to divide the coefficients: 

$$
\frac{3}{6} = 0.5.
$$

Next, you address the powers of ten. In standard form, these are represented as $ 10^n $, where $ n $ is the exponent. When performing the division, you subtract the exponent of the divisor from the exponent of the dividend. Continuing with our example, you calculate the exponent subtraction:

$$
5 - 2 = 3.
$$ 

Thus, we have 

$$
\frac{10^5}{10^2} = 10^3.
$$ 

Now, you combine the results from the coefficient division and the exponent subtraction. For the given example, this results in:

$$
(3 \times 10^5) \div (6 \times 10^2) = 0.5 \times 10^3.
$$ 

However, standard form requires that the coefficient must be between 1 and 10. Therefore, we need to adjust $ 0.5 \times 10^3 $ to fit this requirement. We can do this by moving the decimal point one place to the right, which gives us $ 5 $, and correspondingly, we decrease the exponent by one to maintain the equality:

$$
0.5 \times 10^3 = 5 \times 10^2.
$$ 

In summary, the key steps for dividing numbers in standard form are: divide the coefficients, subtract the exponents, and adjust the result to ensure the coefficient lies between 1 and 10. Practicing these steps will help you become more proficient in dividing numbers in standard form.
