The perimeter of a square with a side length of $4 \, \text{cm}$ is $16 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the perimeter of a square, you simply add the lengths of all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, you can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by $4$. In this example, each side measures $4 \, \text{cm}$. Therefore, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 4 = 16 \, \text{cm}.
$$

The concept of perimeter is fundamental in geometry, representing the total distance around a two-dimensional shape. For squares, the calculation is straightforward due to the equal lengths of all sides. Mastering how to calculate the perimeter is essential, as it can facilitate solving more intricate problems involving various shapes. Additionally, this skill is practical in everyday scenarios, such as estimating the amount of material required to frame a picture or to construct a fence around a garden.

Keep in mind that the formula for the perimeter $ P $ of a square is given by:

$$
P = 4 \times \text{side length}.
$$

This formula is universally applicable to any square, irrespective of its size. Thus, whenever you need to find the perimeter of a square, simply multiply the length of one side by $4$, and you will arrive at the correct answer.
