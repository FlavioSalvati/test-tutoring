The conversion factor from kilometres to metres is straightforward: $1$ kilometre is equal to $1,000$ metres.

When converting units of measurement, it is essential to grasp the relationship between the different units involved. In this instance, we are dealing with the metric system, which is a decimal-based system of measurement. This implies that each unit is a power of ten. For example, $1$ kilometre (km) corresponds to $1,000$ metres (m). The prefix 'kilo-' signifies a factor of $1,000$, so when you encounter the term 'kilometre', you can think of it as $1,000$ metres.

To convert kilometres to metres, you simply multiply the number of kilometres by $1,000$. For instance, if you have $3$ kilometres and wish to determine how many metres that equates to, you would perform the calculation: 

$$
3 \text{ km} \times 1,000 = 3,000 \text{ m}.
$$

This simple multiplication process makes it easy to transition between these units of measurement.

Understanding this conversion is valuable in various real-world applications, such as calculating distances on maps, measuring lengths in scientific experiments, or even planning a trip. It is also a fundamental concept in GCSE Maths, where you may encounter problems requiring unit conversions. Keeping in mind that $1$ kilometre equals $1,000$ metres will enhance your confidence in tackling these types of problems.
