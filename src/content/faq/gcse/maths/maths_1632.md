The interquartile range (IQR) of a data set with first quartile $ Q_1 = 15 $ and third quartile $ Q_3 = 25 $ is calculated to be $ 10 $.

The IQR serves as a measure of statistical dispersion, quantifying how spread out the values in a data set are. It is computed by subtracting the first quartile $ (Q_1) $ from the third quartile $ (Q_3) $. In this instance, with $ Q_1 = 15 $ and $ Q_3 = 25 $, the calculation yields:

$$
\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 = 25 - 15 = 10.
$$

The IQR is particularly valuable because it concentrates on the central 50% of the data, effectively disregarding extreme values or outliers. This characteristic makes it a more robust indicator of spread compared to the range, which only considers the minimum and maximum values. For instance, in a data set where some values are significantly higher or lower than the others, the range might present a distorted view of the data's distribution. In contrast, the IQR offers a clearer representation of where most of the data points lie.

Grasping the concept of the IQR can significantly enhance your data analysis skills, especially when comparing different data sets. If one data set exhibits a notably larger IQR than another, it implies that the values in the first data set are more widely dispersed. This insight can be particularly useful in a variety of real-world applications, such as comparing test scores, analyzing survey results, or studying scientific measurements.
