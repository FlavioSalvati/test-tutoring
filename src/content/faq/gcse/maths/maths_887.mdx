To calculate the diagonal of a three-dimensional rectangle, commonly known as a rectangular prism or cuboid, you can use the following formula:

$$
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
$$

In this formula, the cuboid is defined by its three dimensions: length ($l$), width ($w$), and height ($h$). The diagonal $d$ extends from one corner of the cuboid to the diagonally opposite corner, and its calculation is grounded in the Pythagorean theorem applied in three dimensions.

First, let's consider the diagonal of the rectangular base of the cuboid. For a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$, the diagonal can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem in two dimensions:

$$
d_{base} = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
$$

Next, we treat this diagonal as one side of a right triangle, where the height $h$ of the cuboid serves as the other perpendicular side. We can then apply the Pythagorean theorem a second time in the three-dimensional context. The formula can be expressed as:

$$
d = \sqrt{(\sqrt{l^2 + w^2})^2 + h^2}
$$

By simplifying this expression, we obtain:

$$
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
$$

This final formula enables you to easily compute the length of the diagonal of any cuboid, given its length, width, and height. To find the diagonal, square each dimension, sum the results, and then take the square root of that sum. This approach is a straightforward application of the Pythagorean theorem, extended into three dimensions.
