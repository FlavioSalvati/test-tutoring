The range of the function $y = \sin(x)$ is given by the interval $[-1, 1]$.

The sine function, represented as $\sin(x)$, is a periodic function that oscillates between $-1$ and $1$. This characteristic implies that for any value of $x$, the output of $\sin(x)$ will always fall within this range. The sine function reaches its maximum value of $1$ and its minimum value of $-1$ at specific points in its cycle. For instance, we have the following key values: $\sin(0) = 0$, $\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1$, $\sin(\pi) = 0$, $\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -1$, and $\sin(2\pi) = 0$.

Due to its periodic nature, the sine function repeats its values in a consistent pattern every $2\pi$ radians, which is referred to as the period of the sine function. Within each period, the function transitions smoothly from $0$ to $1$, back to $0$, down to $-1$, and finally returns to $0$. This continuous, wave-like behavior is known as a sinusoidal wave.

Understanding the range of the sine function is essential for solving trigonometric equations and analyzing graphs. It allows you to anticipate the possible values of $\sin(x)$ and guarantees that you do not expect results outside the interval $[-1, 1]$. This understanding is particularly valuable in various fields, including physics, engineering, and music, where wave patterns and oscillatory motions frequently occur.
