The distance between the points $(5, 5)$ and $(10, 10)$ is approximately $7.07$ units.

To determine the distance between two points on a coordinate plane, we employ the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The distance formula is expressed as:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In this scenario, the coordinates of the first point are $(5, 5)$ and those of the second point are $(10, 10)$. We can denote these points as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, respectively. Thus, we have $x_1 = 5$, $y_1 = 5$, $x_2 = 10$, and $y_2 = 10$.

Now, we substitute these values into the distance formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(10 - 5)^2 + (10 - 5)^2}
$$

Next, we simplify the expressions within the square root:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(5)^2 + (5)^2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{25 + 25}
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{50}
$$

The square root of $50$ can be further simplified:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{25 \times 2}
$$

This gives us:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2}
$$

Therefore, we find:

$$
\text{Distance} = 5\sqrt{2}
$$

Since $\sqrt{2}$ is approximately $1.414$, we can calculate a decimal approximation as follows:

$$
\text{Distance} \approx 5 \times 1.414
$$

This results in:

$$
\text{Distance} \approx 7.07
$$

In conclusion, the distance between the points $(5, 5)$ and $(10, 10)$ is approximately $7.07$ units.
