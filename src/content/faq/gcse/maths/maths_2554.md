A kite features a single line of symmetry that runs through its two unequal angles and its two equal sides.

To locate the line of symmetry in a kite, look for the line that divides the kite into two mirror-image halves. A kite is a specific type of quadrilateral characterized by having two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length. This unique configuration means that the kite possesses exactly one line of symmetry. This line extends from the top vertex, where the two shorter sides intersect, down to the bottom vertex, where the two longer sides converge. Essentially, this line of symmetry bisects the kite's two unequal angles and its two equal sides.

When you fold the kite along this line, the two halves will align perfectly. This perfect alignment occurs because the line of symmetry guarantees that every point on one side of the line corresponds to a point on the opposite side at an equal distance from the line. This property is what establishes the kite's symmetry along this axis.

To visualize this concept, imagine drawing a vertical line from the top to the bottom of the kite. This line will traverse the center of the kite, dividing it into two equal parts. Each part serves as a mirror image of the other, confirming the presence of the line of symmetry. It is important to note that a kite does not exhibit horizontal symmetry due to the unequal lengths of its sides in that direction.
