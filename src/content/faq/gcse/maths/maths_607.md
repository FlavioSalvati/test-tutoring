The cumulative frequency of a data set defined by the intervals $0-10$, $10-20$, and $20-30$ represents the running total of frequencies up to each interval.

To clarify the concept of cumulative frequency, let’s define it more precisely. Cumulative frequency is the total of the frequencies for all intervals up to and including the current interval. This measure provides insight into the distribution of data across various intervals.

Consider a data set where the frequencies for each interval are specified. For instance, let’s assume the frequency for the interval $0-10$ is $5$, for $10-20$ is $7$, and for $20-30$ is $3$. The cumulative frequency for the first interval ($0-10$) is simply the frequency of that interval, which is $5$.

For the second interval ($10-20$), the cumulative frequency is calculated by summing the frequencies of the first and second intervals. Therefore, it would be:

$$
5 \text{ (from } 0-10\text{)} + 7 \text{ (from } 10-20\text{)} = 12.
$$

For the third interval ($20-30$), the cumulative frequency is the total of the frequencies from all three intervals. Thus, it is calculated as follows:

$$
5 \text{ (from } 0-10\text{)} + 7 \text{ (from } 10-20\text{)} + 3 \text{ (from } 20-30\text{)} = 15.
$$

In summary, the cumulative frequencies for the intervals $0-10$, $10-20$, and $20-30$ are $5$, $12$, and $15$, respectively. This running total illustrates how the data accumulates across the intervals, facilitating a clearer analysis of the overall distribution.
