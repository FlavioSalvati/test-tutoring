Quartiles are a statistical tool used to divide a data set into four equal parts, which aids in understanding the distribution and variability of the data.

To interpret quartiles effectively, it is essential to grasp their significance. A data set is partitioned into four sections by three quartiles: the first quartile ($Q_1$), the second quartile ($Q_2$), commonly known as the median, and the third quartile ($Q_3$). Each quartile establishes a boundary, indicating that $25\%$, $50\%$, and $75\%$ of the data points lie below these thresholds, respectively.

- The **first quartile** ($Q_1$) represents the median of the lower half of the data set. This value signifies that $25\%$ of the data points are less than or equal to $Q_1$, providing insight into the lower end of the data distribution.

- The **second quartile** ($Q_2$), or median, is the middle value of the entire data set. It indicates that $50\%$ of the data points are less than or equal to $Q_2$. This measure is crucial as it reflects the central tendency of the data, allowing you to assess the data's center.

- The **third quartile** ($Q_3$) is defined as the median of the upper half of the data set. This quartile shows that $75\%$ of the data points are less than or equal to $Q_3$, thus providing insight into the upper end of the data distribution.

By analyzing the quartiles, you can also compute the **interquartile range** (IQR), which is the difference between $Q_3$ and $Q_1$. The IQR quantifies the spread of the middle $50\%$ of the data, offering valuable insights into the variability and consistency of the data set.
