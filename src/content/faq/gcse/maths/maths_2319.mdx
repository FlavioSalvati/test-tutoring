To plot the graph of the equation $ y = 2x + 1 $, we'll begin by creating a table of values and then plotting the corresponding points.

First, it's important to recognize that $ y = 2x + 1 $ is a linear equation, which means its graph will take the shape of a straight line. This equation is in the format $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ stands for the y-intercept. In this case, we have $ m = 2 $ and $ c = 1 $.

Next, we will create a table of values for $ x $ and $ y $. We can select several values for $ x $, such as $-2$, $-1$, $0$, $1$, and $2$. By substituting these values into the equation, we can determine the corresponding $ y $ values:

- For $ x = -2 $: 
  $$ 
  y = 2(-2) + 1 = -4 + 1 = -3 
  $$
- For $ x = -1 $: 
  $$ 
  y = 2(-1) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1 
  $$
- For $ x = 0 $: 
  $$ 
  y = 2(0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 
  $$
- For $ x = 1 $: 
  $$ 
  y = 2(1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 
  $$
- For $ x = 2 $: 
  $$ 
  y = 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 
  $$

Now that we have our values, we can plot the points on a graph: 
$(-2, -3)$, $(-1, -1)$, $(0, 1)$, $(1, 3)$, and $(2, 5)$.

After plotting these points, the next step is to draw a straight line that passes through them. This line represents the equation $ y = 2x + 1 $. The slope of $ 2 $ indicates that for every $1$ unit the line moves to the right, it rises by $2$ units. The y-intercept of $1$ signifies that the line crosses the y-axis at $ y = 1 $.

By following these steps, you will be able to accurately plot the graph of the equation $ y = 2x + 1 $.
