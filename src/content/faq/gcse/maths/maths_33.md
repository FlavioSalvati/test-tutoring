The fraction $5/6$ converted into a decimal form yields approximately $0.8333$.

To transform the fraction $5/6$ into a decimal, it is necessary to divide the numerator (which is $5$) by the denominator (which is $6$). The result of this division operation, $5$ divided by $6$, is $0.8333\ldots$, where the digit $3$ recurs indefinitely. This recurring decimal is often represented as $0.8333\ldots$ or $0.83\bar{3}$, with the bar above the $3$ signifying its repetitiveness.

Mastering the technique of converting fractions into decimals is a valuable skill in GCSE Mathematics. It assists in a variety of areas such as comparing the magnitudes of different fractions, executing arithmetic operations, and resolving real-world mathematical problems. When dividing $5$ by $6$, you can utilize the method of long division to observe the recurring nature of the decimal. Begin by determining how many times $6$ fits into $5$, which is $0$ times. Subsequently, append a decimal point and a zero, converting it to $50$. The number $6$ fits into $50$ eight times (based on the multiplication $6 \times 8 = 48$), leaving a remainder of $2$. Introduce another zero, making it $20$. The number $6$ fits into $20$ three times (based on the multiplication $6 \times 3 = 18$), leaving a remainder of $2$ once again. This procedure repeats, illustrating that the decimal is $0.8333\ldots$

Armed with this knowledge, you can confidently convert fractions into decimals, comprehending their recurring nature, which is an integral aspect of mastering GCSE Mathematics.
