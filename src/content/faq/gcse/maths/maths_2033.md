To determine the rate of change of an exponential function, you need to differentiate the function with respect to its variable.

An exponential function is generally expressed in the form:

$$
f(x) = a \cdot b^x
$$

where $ a $ is a constant, $ b $ is the base of the exponential, and $ x $ is the variable. To find the rate of change, we differentiate this function with respect to $ x $. Differentiation is a key mathematical process that results in the derivative, which indicates how the function changes as its input varies.

For the function $ f(x) = a \cdot b^x $, we can find the derivative $ f'(x) $ using the chain rule. The chain rule states that when differentiating a composite function, you first differentiate the outer function and then multiply it by the derivative of the inner function. In this scenario, the outer function is $ a \cdot b^x $, while the inner function is simply $ x $.

The derivative of $ b^x $ with respect to $ x $ is given by:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(b^x) = b^x \ln(b)
$$

where $ \ln(b) $ represents the natural logarithm of $ b $. Consequently, the derivative of the function $ f(x) = a \cdot b^x $ can be expressed as:

$$
f'(x) = a \cdot b^x \cdot \ln(b)
$$

This derivative $ f'(x) $ provides the rate of change of the exponential function at any point $ x $. Essentially, it indicates how quickly the value of the function is increasing or decreasing at that specific point. Grasping this concept is essential for analyzing the behavior of exponential functions in a variety of contexts, such as population growth, radioactive decay, and financial investments.
