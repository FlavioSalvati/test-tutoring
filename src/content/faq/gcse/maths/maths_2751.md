To sketch the graph of the function $ y = 3\cos(x) $, follow these steps: plot key points, identify the amplitude and period, and then connect the points smoothly to illustrate the wave-like shape.

First, recognize that $ y = 3\cos(x) $ is a transformation of the basic cosine function $ y = \cos(x) $. The coefficient $ 3 $ in front of $ \cos(x) $ represents the amplitude of the function. This means the graph will stretch vertically, affecting the maximum and minimum values of the function. For $ y = 3\cos(x) $, the amplitude is $ 3 $, indicating that the graph oscillates between the values $ 3 $ and $ -3 $.

Next, consider the period of the cosine function. The period is defined as the length of one complete cycle of the graph. For the standard cosine function $ y = \cos(x) $, the period is $ 2\pi $. Since there are no horizontal scaling factors (like a coefficient affecting the $ x $ variable inside the cosine), the period of $ y = 3\cos(x) $ remains $ 2\pi $.

Now, let's plot the key points. Start with the fundamental points of the cosine function: 
- $ (0, 1) $ 
- $ \left(\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right) $ 
- $ (\pi, -1) $ 
- $ \left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, 0\right) $ 
- $ (2\pi, 1) $

To adapt these points for $ y = 3\cos(x) $, multiply the $ y $-values by $ 3 $. This results in the following transformed points:
- $ (0, 3) $ 
- $ \left(\frac{\pi}{2}, 0\right) $ 
- $ (\pi, -3) $ 
- $ \left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, 0\right) $ 
- $ (2\pi, 3) $

Next, draw the x-axis and y-axis on your graph paper. Label the x-axis with intervals of $ \frac{\pi}{2} $ and the y-axis with intervals of $ 1 $, ensuring the scale extends from $ 3 $ to $ -3 $. Plot the transformed points accordingly on the graph.

Finally, connect these points with a smooth, continuous curve, ensuring that it resembles the characteristic wave shape of the cosine function. The graph will begin at $ (0, 3) $, dip down to $ (\pi, -3) $, and then rise back up to $ (2\pi, 3) $, completing one full cycle. If needed, you can repeat this pattern to illustrate additional cycles of the cosine wave.
