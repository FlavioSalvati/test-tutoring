The y-coordinate of the midpoint between the points $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 8)$ is $6$.

To determine the y-coordinate of the midpoint between two points, we employ the midpoint formula, which is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. In our case, the points are $(3, 4)$ and $(7, 8)$.

First, we need to identify the y-coordinates of the provided points. For the point $(3, 4)$, the y-coordinate is $4$, and for the point $(7, 8)$, the y-coordinate is $8$. To compute the y-coordinate of the midpoint, we calculate the average of these two y-coordinates. This involves summing them and then dividing by $2$.

Thus, we perform the calculation:

$$
\frac{4 + 8}{2}
$$

Adding $4$ and $8$ results in $12$. Next, dividing $12$ by $2$ yields $6$. Consequently, the y-coordinate of the midpoint is $6$.

This method ensures that the midpoint is precisely halfway between the two points in both the x and y directions. By averaging the y-coordinates, we find the central point along the vertical axis, which is essential for grasping the concept of midpoints in coordinate geometry.
