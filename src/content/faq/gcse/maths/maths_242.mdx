The derivative of the function $ y = \frac{1}{x} $ is given by 

$$ y' = -\frac{1}{x^2}. $$

To understand how we arrive at this result, let's break the process down step by step. The derivative measures the rate at which $ y $ changes with respect to $ x $. In simpler terms, it helps us find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any given point.

First, we can rewrite the function $ y = \frac{1}{x} $ in a more convenient form for differentiation:

$$ y = x^{-1}. $$

This transformation is valid because $ \frac{1}{x} $ is equivalent to $ x $ raised to the power of $-1$.

Next, we apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if you have a function of the form $ y = x^n $, the derivative $ y' $ is computed as 

$$ y' = nx^{n-1}. $$

Using this rule on our function $ y = x^{-1} $, we find:

$$ y' = -1 \cdot x^{-1-1}. $$

Now, simplifying the exponent yields:

$$ y' = -1 \cdot x^{-2}. $$

Finally, we can rewrite $ x^{-2} $ in terms of a fraction:

$$ y' = -\frac{1}{x^2}. $$

This result tells us that for any value of $ x $, the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ is 

$$ -\frac{1}{x^2}. $$

The negative sign in the derivative indicates that as $ x $ increases, $ y $ decreases, and conversely, as $ x $ decreases, $ y $ increases.
