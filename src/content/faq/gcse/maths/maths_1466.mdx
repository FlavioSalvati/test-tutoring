To determine the length of the vector $(12, 16)$, we calculate its magnitude, which is found to be $20$ units.

The length of a vector can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem. We can visualize a vector as a line segment extending from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the point $(12, 16)$ in a Cartesian coordinate system. The length of this line segment represents the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the other two sides correspond to the vector's x-component ($12$) and y-component ($16$).

According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

For the vector $(12, 16)$, we substitute $ x = 12 $ and $ y = 16 $:

$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{12^2 + 16^2}
$$

Calculating further, we find:

$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{144 + 256}
$$
$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{400}
$$
$$
\text{Length} = 20
$$

Thus, the length of the vector $(12, 16)$ is $20$ units. This method can be applied to find the length of any vector, regardless of its components. Simply square each component, sum the results, and then take the square root of the total.
