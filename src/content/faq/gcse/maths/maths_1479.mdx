The vector from the point $(1, 2)$ to the point $(3, 5)$ is given by the coordinates $(2, 3)$.

To determine the vector from one point to another, you subtract the coordinates of the starting point from the coordinates of the ending point. In this scenario, the starting point is $(1, 2)$ and the ending point is $(3, 5)$.

First, calculate the difference between the x-coordinates: 

$$
3 - 1 = 2.
$$ 

This result gives you the x-component of the vector. Next, find the difference between the y-coordinates: 

$$
5 - 2 = 3.
$$ 

This result provides the y-component of the vector. Therefore, the vector from $(1, 2)$ to $(3, 5)$ is represented as $(2, 3)$.

In simpler terms, a vector signifies both a direction and a distance from one point to another. In this example, the vector $(2, 3)$ indicates that to travel from $(1, 2)$ to $(3, 5)$, you need to move 2 units to the right (along the x-axis) and 3 units upward (along the y-axis).

Vectors play a crucial role in various fields, including mathematics and physics, as they can effectively describe movement and forces. Mastering the calculation and interpretation of vectors is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, aiding in solving problems related to geometry, physics, and even computer graphics.
