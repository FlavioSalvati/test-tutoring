To express $200\%$ as a decimal, the result is $2.0$.

To convert a percentage into a decimal, you divide the percentage by $100$. The term "percent" literally means "per hundred," which is why this division is necessary. For example, to convert $200\%$, you perform the calculation $200 \div 100$, resulting in $2.0$.

Let's break this down further. Percentages represent numbers as fractions of a whole, specifically out of $100$. Therefore, $200\%$ can also be expressed as the fraction $\frac{200}{100}$. When you carry out the division, you find that $200$ divided by $100$ equals $2.0$.

This conversion process is essential in various mathematical contexts and real-life situations, such as calculating discounts, determining interest rates, and analyzing data. Mastering the ability to convert between percentages, decimals, and fractions is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths.

Keep in mind that the general rule for converting any percentage to a decimal is to divide by $100$. For instance, $50\%$ converts to $0.5$, $75\%$ becomes $0.75$, and so forth. This conversion method applies universally, whether the percentage is below $100\%$, exactly $100\%$, or exceeds $100\%$, as in the example of $200\%$.
