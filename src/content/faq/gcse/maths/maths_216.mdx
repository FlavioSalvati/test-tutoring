A constant slope on a distance-time graph represents constant speed.

In a distance-time graph, the slope (or gradient) of the line indicates the speed at which an object is moving. When the slope is constant, it signifies that the object is traveling at a steady speed, without any acceleration or deceleration. This occurs because the distance covered per unit of time remains unchanged throughout the journey.

To clarify this concept, let's examine the components of the distance-time graph. The vertical axis (y-axis) represents distance, while the horizontal axis (x-axis) represents time. The slope of the line is determined by the ratio of the change in distance ($\Delta y$) to the change in time ($\Delta x$). If this ratio remains constant, it indicates that the slope is constant, which in turn means that the speed is uniform.

For instance, if a car travels $10$ kilometers every hour, the graph will depict a straight line with a constant slope. This straight line indicates that the car is moving at a constant speed of $10$ kilometers per hour. If the line were to curve or change its slope, it would suggest a change in speed, either indicating acceleration or deceleration.

In summary, a constant slope on a distance-time graph is a clear indicator of constant speed, making it straightforward to analyze and understand the motion of an object over time.
