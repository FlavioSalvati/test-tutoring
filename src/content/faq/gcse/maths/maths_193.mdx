To graph the inequality $x \leq 4$ on a number line, follow these steps for clarity:

1. **Draw the Number Line**: Begin by sketching a horizontal line that represents the number line. Be sure to mark several key points along this line, particularly the point corresponding to the number $4$.

2. **Indicate the Boundary Point**: Since the inequality is $x \leq 4$, it is essential to signal that all numbers less than or equal to $4$ are included in the solution set. Place a filled (or solid) circle directly at the point $4$. This filled circle signifies that $4$ is included in the solution because the inequality uses "less than or equal to" (≤). If the inequality were simply "less than" ($<$), you would instead use an open circle to indicate that $4$ is not part of the solution.

3. **Shade the Appropriate Region**: Next, shade the portion of the number line to the left of the point $4$. This shaded area represents all numbers that are less than $4$. You can use a pencil or a different color to enhance the visibility of the shading. Ensure that the shading extends indefinitely to the left, indicating that all numbers less than $4$ are included in the solution set.

By completing these steps, you effectively illustrate that any number to the left of $4$, including $4$ itself, satisfies the inequality $x \leq 4$. This visual representation provides a clear understanding of how to solve and interpret inequalities on a number line.
