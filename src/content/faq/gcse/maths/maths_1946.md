To determine the rotational rate of an object, you need to measure the number of complete rotations or revolutions it makes within a specific time frame. This measurement is commonly referred to as the rotational speed or angular velocity. The standard units for expressing this rate are revolutions per minute (RPM) or revolutions per second (RPS).

To begin, observe the rotating object and count the total number of full rotations it completes. You can utilize a stopwatch to record the duration of these rotations. For instance, if you count $30$ rotations in $15$ seconds, you can calculate the rate by dividing the number of rotations by the time in seconds. In this scenario, $30$ rotations divided by $15$ seconds equals $2$ rotations per second (RPS).

To convert this rate to revolutions per minute (RPM), multiply the RPS by $60$, as there are $60$ seconds in a minute. Continuing with the previous example, $2$ RPS multiplied by $60$ yields $120$ RPM.

Alternatively, you can use a tachometer, which is a device specifically designed to measure the rotational speed of an object. Simply place the tachometer against the rotating component, and it will provide a direct reading of the rate, typically in RPM.

Understanding the rate of rotation is essential across various applications, from engineering to everyday machinery, as it helps ensure that devices operate safely and efficiently.
