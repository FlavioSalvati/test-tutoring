The angle formed between a tangent to a circle and the radius drawn to the point of tangency is always $90$ degrees.

When a tangent touches a circle, it does so at precisely one point, which is referred to as the point of tangency. At this point, the radius of the circle that intersects the tangent is perpendicular to the tangent line. Consequently, the angle between the radius and the tangent line is a right angle, measuring $90$ degrees.

To visualize this, consider a circle with a center point $O$ and a radius that extends to the point of tangency, denoted as $P$. If you draw the tangent line at point $P$, you will observe that the radius $OP$ and the tangent line create a right angle. This property holds true for any circle and its respective tangent line, making it a fundamental characteristic of circles and tangents.

Understanding this property is particularly beneficial for solving various geometric problems. For instance, if you know the length of the radius and need to determine the length of a tangent segment from a point outside the circle, you can apply the Pythagorean theorem. This is because the radius, the tangent segment, and the line segment connecting the external point to the center of the circle form a right-angled triangle.

Remembering that the angle between a tangent and a radius is always $90$ degrees can greatly assist you in tackling many problems involving circles and tangents, especially in your GCSE Maths examinations.
