In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to $180^\circ$.

A cyclic quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon whose vertices all lie on the circumference of a circle. This unique characteristic gives rise to an interesting relationship between its angles. Specifically, if you take any pair of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral and add them together, their total will always be $180^\circ$. This phenomenon is referred to as the supplementary property of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral.

To comprehend why this occurs, letâ€™s explore the concept further. Consider a cyclic quadrilateral labeled as $ABCD$, inscribed within a circle. The pairs of opposite angles are $\angle A$ and $\angle C$, as well as $\angle B$ and $\angle D$. According to the inscribed angle theorem, an angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the angle subtended by the same arc at the center of the circle. 

As a result, the angles subtended by arcs $AB$ and $CD$ at the center of the circle together add up to $360^\circ$, since they encompass the entire circle. Since each angle at the circumference is half of the corresponding central angle, the sum of the opposite angles at the circumference will be half of $360^\circ$, which equals $180^\circ$.

This property is particularly useful for solving a variety of geometric problems and theorems. For instance, if you know the measures of three angles in a cyclic quadrilateral, you can easily determine the fourth angle by subtracting the sum of the known opposite angle from $180^\circ$. Grasping this relationship enhances your ability to analyze and tackle problems involving cyclic quadrilaterals with greater efficiency.
