A vector $ \mathbf{g} $ can be expressed in terms of its magnitude and the direction it points.

To define a vector in terms of its magnitude and direction, it is essential to comprehend what these terms entail. The magnitude of a vector refers to its length, which can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem if the vector's components are known. For instance, if vector $ \mathbf{g} $ has components $ (g_x, g_y) $, its magnitude $ |\mathbf{g}| $ can be calculated as:

$$
|\mathbf{g}| = \sqrt{g_x^2 + g_y^2}.
$$

The direction of a vector is described by the angle it makes with a reference axis, typically the positive x-axis. This angle can be obtained using trigonometric functions. For vector $ \mathbf{g} $ with components $ (g_x, g_y) $, the direction $ \theta $ can be calculated using the tangent function:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{g_y}{g_x}\right).
$$

This equation yields the angle $ \theta $ in degrees or radians.

For example, consider vector $ \mathbf{g} $ with components $ (3, 4) $. Its magnitude $ |\mathbf{g}| $ would be computed as:

$$
|\mathbf{g}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5.
$$

The direction $ \theta $ would then be:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 53.13^\circ.
$$

Thus, vector $ \mathbf{g} $ can be characterized as having a magnitude of $ 5 $ units and pointing in a direction of approximately $ 53.13^\circ $ from the positive x-axis.

Understanding vectors in terms of their magnitude and direction is vital in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it aids in visualizing and analyzing forces, velocities, and other vector quantities.
