To determine the ratio of lengths in similar shapes, you should compare the corresponding sides of these shapes.

When working with similar shapes, it is crucial to recognize that they share the same geometric proportions but differ in size. This implies that their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional. To calculate the ratio of lengths, you must first identify which sides of the shapes correspond to one another.

For instance, consider two similar triangles, Triangle A and Triangle B. If you know the lengths of some of their sides, you can establish a ratio. Suppose the length of one side of Triangle A is $4 \, \text{cm}$, while the length of the corresponding side of Triangle B is $8 \, \text{cm}$. The ratio of these lengths can be expressed as $4:8$, which simplifies to $1:2$. This indicates that every side of Triangle B is twice as long as the corresponding side of Triangle A.

If you have the ratio of one pair of corresponding sides, you can use this information to calculate the lengths of other sides. For example, if another side of Triangle A measures $5 \, \text{cm}$, and you know that the ratio is $1:2$, the corresponding side in Triangle B would be calculated as $5 \, \text{cm} \times 2 = 10 \, \text{cm}$.

To summarize, the essential steps are to identify the corresponding sides, measure their lengths, and then create a ratio. This ratio will remain consistent for all pairs of corresponding sides in the similar shapes.
