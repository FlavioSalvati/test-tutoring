The range of a data set quantifies the difference between its highest and lowest values.

As a straightforward measure of dispersion, the range provides insight into how spread out the values in a data set are. To compute the range, simply subtract the smallest value from the largest value. For instance, consider a data set of exam scores: $55$, $67$, $72$, $88$, and $91$. The range can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Range} = 91 - 55 = 36
$$

This indicates that the scores span a range of $36$ marks.

Understanding the range allows you to quickly gauge the variability within your data. A large range signifies that the data points are widely dispersed, which can suggest greater variability or diversity among the values. In contrast, a small range implies that the data points are closer together, indicating less variability.

Nevertheless, the range has its limitations. It only takes into account the two extreme values—the maximum and minimum—and disregards the rest of the data. As a result, the range can be significantly affected by outliers, which are values that are unusually high or low. For example, if one student scored $100$ on the exam while the others scored between $55$ and $72$, the range would be:

$$
\text{Range} = 100 - 55 = 45
$$

This could create a misleading impression of the overall distribution of scores.

In conclusion, while the range is a valuable initial tool for assessing data spread, it is often beneficial to complement it with additional measures, such as the interquartile range or standard deviation, for a more thorough analysis of the data's variability.
