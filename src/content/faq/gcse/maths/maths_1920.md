To convert a speed from meters per second (m/s) to kilometers per hour (km/h), you simply multiply the speed in m/s by $3.6$.

Understanding the conversion between these two units requires knowledge of their relationship. Specifically, one meter is one-thousandth of a kilometer, and one hour consists of $3600$ seconds. Consequently, the conversion from m/s to km/h involves a factor that accounts for both the distance and time conversions.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the conversion process:

1. **Distance Conversion**: Since there are $1000$ meters in a kilometer, to convert meters to kilometers, you divide by $1000$.
2. **Time Conversion**: Given that there are $3600$ seconds in an hour, to convert seconds to hours, you divide by $3600$.

By combining these two conversions, you can derive the following formula:

$$
\text{Speed in km/h} = \text{Speed in m/s} \times \frac{3600 \text{ seconds/hour}}{1000 \text{ metres/kilometre}}
$$

Now, simplifying the fraction yields:

$$
\frac{3600}{1000} = 3.6
$$

Thus, the conversion factor is $3.6$. 

For instance, if you have a speed of $5$ m/s and wish to convert it to km/h, you would perform the following calculation:

$$
5 \text{ m/s} \times 3.6 = 18 \text{ km/h}
$$

This method guarantees an accurate conversion from m/s to km/h, which is especially beneficial in fields such as physics and in everyday situations like understanding speed limits.
