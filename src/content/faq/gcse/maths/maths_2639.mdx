The area of a circle with a radius of $5 \, \text{cm}$ is approximately $78.54 \, \text{cm}^2$.

To calculate the area of a circle, you can use the formula:

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

In this formula, $ A $ represents the area, $ \pi $ (pi) is a mathematical constant roughly equal to $3.14159$, and $ r $ denotes the radius of the circle. For our example, the radius $ r $ is $5 \, \text{cm}$.

We start by squaring the radius:

$$
5^2 = 25
$$

Next, we multiply this squared value by $ \pi $:

$$
25 \times \pi \approx 25 \times 3.14159 = 78.53975
$$

When we round this result to two decimal places, the area becomes approximately $78.54 \, \text{cm}^2$.

Understanding this formula is essential for tackling various problems involving circlesâ€”whether you're calculating the area of a garden, a pizza, or any circular object. It's important to note that the radius is always half of the diameter. Therefore, if you are provided with the diameter instead of the radius, you can easily find the radius by dividing the diameter by two. This approach ensures that you can accurately compute the area of any circle as long as you know its radius.
