In the expression $5v - 6$, the letter $v$ represents a variable that can take on any numerical value.

In mathematics, a variable is a symbol, typically a letter, that denotes a number whose value can change. In the expression $5v - 6$, the variable is $v$. The number $5$ is known as a coefficient, which indicates that it multiplies the variable. The term $-6$ is a constant term, meaning it is a fixed value that remains unchanged.

When you encounter an expression like $5v - 6$, you can substitute different values for $v$ to observe how the expression varies. For example, if we set $v = 2$, the expression becomes:

$$
5(2) - 6
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
10 - 6 = 4.
$$

Similarly, if we let $v = -1$, the expression changes to:

$$
5(-1) - 6,
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
-5 - 6 = -11.
$$

Understanding variables is essential in algebra because they enable us to create general expressions and equations that model real-world scenarios. For instance, if you were calculating the total cost of purchasing $v$ items, each priced at £5, and you received a £6 discount, the expression $5v - 6$ would accurately represent your total cost.

Thus, the variable $v$ serves as a placeholder that can assume various values, making it a fundamental concept in algebra. This flexibility is crucial for solving equations and comprehending mathematical relationships.
