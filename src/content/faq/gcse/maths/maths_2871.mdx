To determine the magnitude of the vector $(-3, -4)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which is expressed as:

$$
\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-4)^2}
$$

The magnitude of a vector represents its length. For a vector defined by coordinates $(x, y)$, the magnitude can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Considering the vector $(-3, -4)$, we can visualize it as a point in a two-dimensional coordinate system where $-3$ is the x-coordinate and $-4$ is the y-coordinate. To find the magnitude, we need to compute the distance from this point to the origin $(0, 0)$. This distance corresponds to the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, with the legs of the triangle represented by the x and y coordinates.

We start by squaring both the x and y coordinates:

$(-3)^2 = 9$ and $(-4)^2 = 16$.

Next, we add these squares:

$$
9 + 16 = 25.
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the magnitude:

$$
\sqrt{25} = 5.
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(-3, -4)$ is $5$.

This method is applicable to any vector in two-dimensional space and is a fundamental concept in vector mathematics, providing insight into distances and directions within a coordinate plane.
