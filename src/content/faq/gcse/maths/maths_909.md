To create a graph based on weekly sales data, you'll want to plot the sales figures on the vertical axis (y-axis) and the weeks on the horizontal axis (x-axis).

Begin by compiling your weekly sales data into a table with two columns: one for the weeks and another for the corresponding sales figures. Label the weeks sequentially as Week 1, Week 2, and so forth, and record the associated sales figures next to each week.

Next, draw your axes either on graph paper or using graphing software. The horizontal axis (x-axis) will denote the weeks, while the vertical axis (y-axis) will represent the sales figures. Be sure to clearly label each axis, including the units of measurement for the sales figures (for instance, pounds or items sold).

Now, determine an appropriate scale for each axis. For the x-axis, you can mark each week at equal intervals. For the y-axis, select a scale that can accommodate the full range of your sales data. For example, if your sales figures range from $0$ to $100$, you might consider a scale with increments of $10$.

Once your axes are set up, plot each week's sales figure as a point on the graph. For instance, if Week 1 had sales of $50$, locate Week 1 on the x-axis and $50$ on the y-axis, then place a dot at the intersection of these two values. Repeat this process for each subsequent week.

Finally, connect the dots with straight lines to create a line graph. This visual representation will enable you to identify trends in the sales data over time, such as increases, decreases, or recurring patterns. Additionally, consider adding a descriptive title to your graph, such as "Weekly Sales Data for January," to clarify what the graph represents.
