The result of rotating the point $(2, 3)$ by $270^\circ$ clockwise about the origin is $(3, -2)$.

To grasp this transformation, let’s break down the process of rotating a point around the origin. When we rotate a point $(x, y)$ by $270^\circ$ clockwise, we can apply a specific transformation rule. This rule states that the new coordinates $(x', y')$ after a $270^\circ$ clockwise rotation are given by:

$$(x', y') = (y, -x)$$

Now, let’s apply this rule to our point $(2, 3)$:
- The new x-coordinate will be the original y-coordinate, which is $3$.
- The new y-coordinate will be the negative of the original x-coordinate, which is $-2$.

Thus, after applying the transformation, the point $(2, 3)$ becomes $(3, -2)$ following a $270^\circ$ clockwise rotation.

Visualizing this on a coordinate plane can further clarify the transformation. Imagine the point $(2, 3)$, which is located in the first quadrant. When we rotate it $270^\circ$ clockwise, it moves through the fourth quadrant, then the third quadrant, and finally lands in the second quadrant. This corresponds perfectly with our calculated coordinates of $(3, -2)$, which indeed resides in the second quadrant.

Understanding these transformations is essential in geometry, as they facilitate the analysis of shapes and their properties when they are rotated, reflected, or translated.
