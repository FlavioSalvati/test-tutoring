The fraction equivalent of $80\%$ is $\frac{4}{5}$.

The process to convert a percentage to a fraction begins by expressing the given percentage as a fraction over $100$. For instance, $80\%$ would be written as $\frac{80}{100}$. The next step is to simplify this fraction, which can be achieved by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator ($80$) and the denominator ($100$). In this case, the GCD of $80$ and $100$ is $20$.

To simplify the fraction, both the numerator and the denominator are divided by their GCD. Therefore, $80 \div 20 = 4$ and $100 \div 20 = 5$, which simplifies the fraction to $\frac{4}{5}$. Thus, we can conclude that $80\%$ is equivalent to the fraction $\frac{4}{5}$.

Mastering the conversion of percentages to fractions is a valuable skill in GCSE Maths. It plays a significant role in various topics, including probability, ratios, and proportions. The key steps involve expressing the percentage as a fraction over $100$ and then simplifying it by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. This method guarantees the derivation of the fraction in its simplest form, making it more manageable for calculations and problem-solving.
