The nth term of the sequence 2, 8, 18, 32 can be represented by the formula $n^2 + n$.

To derive the nth term of a sequence, we first need to identify a pattern or rule that governs the terms. In the case of the sequence 2, 8, 18, 32, we can begin by examining the differences between consecutive terms. The first differences are 6, 10, and 14. Notably, these differences increase by 4 each time, suggesting that the sequence is quadratic in nature.

A quadratic sequence can be expressed in the general form $$an^2 + bn + c$$. To find the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can establish equations based on the first few terms of the sequence. For the first term (when $n=1$), we have:

$$a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 2$$

For the second term (when $n=2$), we have:

$$a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 8$$

For the third term (when $n=3$), we have:

$$a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 18$$

This leads to the following system of equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad a + b + c = 2 \\
2. & \quad 4a + 2b + c = 8 \\
3. & \quad 9a + 3b + c = 18 \\
\end{align*}
$$

By solving this system, we find that $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = 0$. Thus, the formula for the nth term of the sequence is $n^2 + n$. This formula enables us to calculate any term in the sequence by substituting the appropriate value of $n$. For instance, to calculate the 4th term (when $n=4$), we find:

$$4^2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20.$$ 

Therefore, the 4th term of the sequence is 20.
