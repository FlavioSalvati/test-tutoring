To find the second largest number in the set $ \{4, 8, 2, 6\} $, we start by identifying the largest number.

In this set, the numbers are $ 4, 8, 2, $ and $ 6 $. Upon comparison, we can see that the largest number is $ 8 $. Once we have identified the largest number, we can exclude it from our consideration and then look for the largest number among the remaining values.

After excluding $ 8 $, we are left with the numbers $ 4, 2, $ and $ 6 $. Among these, the largest number is $ 6 $. Therefore, the second largest number in the original set is $ 6 $. This systematic approach ensures that we accurately determine the second largest number by carefully comparing each value.

Understanding how to identify the second largest number is a valuable skill in both mathematics and everyday problem-solving. This process involves fundamental concepts of comparison and ordering, which are essential components of GCSE Maths. By practicing these skills, you can enhance your confidence in handling numerical data and improve your analytical abilities.
