The derivative of the function $ y = \ln(x) $ is given by $ \frac{1}{x} $.

When we discuss the derivative of a function, we are essentially examining how the function's output changes in response to changes in its input. For the natural logarithm function $ y = \ln(x) $, the derivative provides insight into the rate at which $ y $ changes concerning $ x $.

To compute the derivative of $ y = \ln(x) $, we apply the rules of differentiation. The natural logarithm function is distinctive because its derivative is particularly straightforward. According to the differentiation rule, if $ y = \ln(x) $, then the derivative $ \frac{dy}{dx} $ is equal to $ \frac{1}{x} $. This implies that for any positive value of $ x $, the rate of change of $ y $ is the reciprocal of $ x $.

For instance, when $ x = 2 $, the derivative $ \frac{dy}{dx} $ evaluates to $ \frac{1}{2} $. This indicates that at $ x = 2 $, the function $ y = \ln(x) $ is increasing at a rate of $ \frac{1}{2} $ units for each unit increase in $ x $.

Grasping this concept is fundamental in calculus, as it enables us to analyze the behavior of logarithmic functions. Notably, the derivative $ \frac{1}{x} $ remains positive for $ x > 0 $, signifying that $ \ln(x) $ is an increasing function. This understanding is valuable in numerous applications, including solving problems related to growth rates and decay processes.
