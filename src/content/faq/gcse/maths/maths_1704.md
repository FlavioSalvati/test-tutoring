The height of the bars in a histogram indicates the frequency of data points that fall within each specified interval, also referred to as a bin.

In a histogram, data is organized into ranges or intervals known as bins. Each bar corresponds to one of these bins, and its height reflects the number of data points that fall within that particular range. For instance, if a bar reaches a height of $10$ on the vertical axis, this signifies that there are $10$ data points within that interval.

To construct a histogram, you first need to determine the intervals or bins. It is essential that these bins are of equal width to represent the data fairly. Once the bins are established, you count how many data points fall into each bin. This count represents the frequency and dictates the height of the bar for that bin.

Histograms are valuable tools for visualizing the distribution of data. They allow you to observe patterns, such as which intervals contain the most data points—indicated by the tallest bars—and which intervals contain the fewest—indicated by the shortest bars. This analysis can provide insights into the shape of the data distribution, revealing whether it is skewed to one side, exhibits a single peak, or displays multiple peaks.

It's important to note that the vertical axis of a histogram represents frequency, while the horizontal axis represents the intervals or bins. By examining the heights of the bars, you can quickly gain a clear understanding of how your data is distributed across various ranges.
