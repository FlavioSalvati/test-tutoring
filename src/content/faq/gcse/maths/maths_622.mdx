A histogram featuring a single peak is referred to as unimodal, indicating that the dataset has one predominant mode or the most frequently occurring value.

In a histogram, the height of each bar signifies the frequency of data points within a specific interval. When a histogram displays one peak, it suggests that there is a particular range where the data points are most densely concentrated. This peak represents the mode of the dataset, which is defined as the value or range of values that appear with the highest frequency.

Unimodal histograms can exhibit a variety of shapes. If the peak is located at the center and the histogram is approximately symmetrical, it indicates a normal distribution, commonly known as a bell curve. This shape is frequently observed in many natural phenomena, such as human heights or standardized test scores, where most values cluster around the mean.

Nevertheless, a unimodal histogram need not be symmetrical. It may be skewed either to the left (negatively skewed) or to the right (positively skewed). In a left-skewed histogram, the peak is positioned towards the right, with the tail extending to the left. In contrast, a right-skewed histogram features the peak on the left side, with the tail extending to the right. These varying shapes can reveal important characteristics of the data, such as whether there is a predominance of lower or higher values.

Analyzing the shape of a histogram is essential for understanding the distribution and spread of the data, which plays a crucial role in making informed decisions based on the dataset.
