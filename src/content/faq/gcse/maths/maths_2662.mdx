The length of the arc is given as $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ cm.

To calculate the length of an arc, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = r \theta
$$

where $r$ is the radius and $\theta$ is the angle in radians. If your angle is initially in degrees, you will first need to convert it to radians. 

Since $180^\circ$ is equivalent to $\pi$ radians, you can convert $60^\circ$ to radians by multiplying by $\frac{\pi}{180}$. The conversion is as follows:

$$
60^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{3} \text{ radians}
$$

With the angle now in radians, you can apply the arc length formula. In this case, the radius $r$ is given as $4$ cm, and the angle $\theta$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians. Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = 4 \times \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{4\pi}{3} \text{ cm}
$$

Thus, the length of the arc is $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ cm. This method ensures accurate calculation of the arc length by first converting the angle from degrees to radians, and then using the arc length formula. Remember, the critical steps are converting the angle to radians and then applying the arc length formula correctly.
