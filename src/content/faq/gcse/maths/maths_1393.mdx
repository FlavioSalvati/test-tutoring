The sine rule, also referred to as the law of sines, is a fundamental principle in trigonometry that is particularly useful for solving problems involving non-right-angled triangles. It establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the sines of its corresponding angles. Specifically, for a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively, the sine rule can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}.
$$

To determine an unknown angle using the sine rule, you must have information about at least one side length along with its opposite angle, as well as another side length with its corresponding angle. For instance, if you know the lengths of sides $a$ and $b$ and the measure of angle $A$, you can calculate angle $B$ using the following formula:

$$
\sin B = \frac{b \cdot \sin A}{a}.
$$

After calculating $\sin B$, you can then employ the inverse sine function, also known as arcsine, to find the measure of angle $B$.

The sine rule is especially advantageous when the simpler trigonometric ratios applicable to right-angled triangles cannot be used. It enables you to solve for unknown angles and side lengths in any triangle, making it a versatile and valuable tool in your mathematical arsenal. 

Always remember to verify that the sum of the angles in your triangle equals $180$ degrees, as this can serve as a useful check on your calculations.
