To calculate the square of $5$, denoted as $5^2$, you multiply $5$ by itself, yielding a result of $25$.

When we refer to squaring a number, we mean that we multiply that number by itself. The notation $5^2$ is read as "five squared," indicating that it represents the multiplication of $5$ by $5$. Thus, to determine $5^2$, we perform the operation:

$$
5 \times 5.
$$

Let's break this process down step-by-step. In this expression, the base number is $5$, and the exponent is $2$. The exponent indicates how many times to use the base number in the multiplication. Specifically, since the exponent is $2$, we multiply $5$ by itself once:

$$
5 \times 5.
$$

Carrying out the multiplication, we find:

$$
5 \times 5 = 25.
$$

Consequently, the square of $5$ is $25$. This concept is fundamental in mathematics, particularly in GCSE Maths, where a solid understanding of exponents is essential. It's important to remember that squaring a number always yields a positive value, and this notation provides a convenient way to express repeated multiplication of the same number.
