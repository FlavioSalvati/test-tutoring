To determine the angle formed by two tangents drawn from a common external point, we can use the formula:

$$
\theta = 180^\circ - 2\alpha
$$

When two tangents are drawn from a common external point to a circle, they create two equal angles at the points where they touch the circle. Let's designate the points where the tangents touch the circle as $ A $ and $ B $, and let the external point from which the tangents are drawn be $ P $. The center of the circle is represented by $ O $. The lengths of the tangents $ PA $ and $ PB $ are equal because they originate from the same external point.

The angle $ \alpha $ represents the angle between the radius $ OA $ (or $ OB $) and the tangent $ PA $ (or $ PB $). Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact, $ \alpha $ is a right angle, specifically $ 90^\circ $.

The angle formed by the two tangents at the external point $ P $ is denoted as $ \theta $. To derive $ \theta $, we can analyze the quadrilateral $ OAPB $. The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is $ 360^\circ $. In the quadrilateral $ OAPB $, there are two right angles at points $ A $ and $ B $, each measuring $ 90^\circ $. Consequently, the remaining angles $ \angle OAP $ and $ \angle OBP $ must sum to $ 180^\circ $.

Since $ \angle OAP $ and $ \angle OBP $ are equal, we can conclude that each angle measures $ \alpha $. As a result, the angle $ \theta $ at point $ P $ is given by:

$$
\theta = 180^\circ - 2\alpha
$$

If we substitute $ \alpha = 90^\circ $, we find:

$$
\theta = 180^\circ - 2 \times 90^\circ = 0^\circ
$$

This outcome represents a special case where the tangents are collinear. In general scenarios, you should apply the formula $ \theta = 180^\circ - 2\alpha $, using the appropriate value of $ \alpha $ for the specific circle in question.
