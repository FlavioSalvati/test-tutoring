The perimeter of a rectangle with a length of $5 \, \text{cm}$ and a width of $3 \, \text{cm}$ is $16 \, \text{cm}$.

To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, you need to sum the lengths of all four sides. A rectangle consists of two pairs of equal sides: two lengths and two widths. The formula for the perimeter $ P $ of a rectangle is expressed as:

$$
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
$$

In this particular case, the length $ l $ is $5 \, \text{cm}$ and the width $ w $ is $3 \, \text{cm}$. By substituting these values into the formula, we can compute the perimeter:

$$
P = 2 \times (5 \, \text{cm} + 3 \, \text{cm})
$$

First, we add the length and the width:

$$
5 \, \text{cm} + 3 \, \text{cm} = 8 \, \text{cm}
$$

Next, we multiply this sum by $2$:

$$
2 \times 8 \, \text{cm} = 16 \, \text{cm}
$$

Thus, the perimeter of the rectangle is $16 \, \text{cm}$. This means that if you were to walk around the edge of the rectangle, you would cover a distance of $16 \, \text{cm}$. 

Understanding how to calculate the perimeter is valuable in various real-life scenarios, such as determining the amount of material needed to frame a picture or calculating the length of fencing required to enclose a garden.
