The total cost of purchasing 3 items, each priced at £4.50, amounts to £13.50.

To calculate the total cost for multiple items, you simply multiply the cost of a single item by the total number of items. In this scenario, each item costs £4.50, and you wish to buy 3 of them. Therefore, the calculation involves multiplying £4.50 by 3.

Here’s the calculation broken down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the cost of one item**: £4.50.
2. **Determine the number of items**: 3.
3. **Perform the multiplication**: 

   $$ 
   £4.50 \times 3 = £13.50 
   $$

To clarify the multiplication process further, you can break it down into its components:
- First, multiply the whole number part: 
  $$ 
  4 \times 3 = 12 
  $$
- Next, multiply the decimal part: 
  $$ 
  0.50 \times 3 = 1.50 
  $$
- Finally, add these two results together: 
  $$ 
  12 + 1.50 = 13.50 
  $$

Thus, the total cost for purchasing 3 items at £4.50 each is indeed £13.50. This method of calculation can be applied to any number of items and prices, making it a valuable skill for everyday tasks such as shopping or budgeting.
