To simplify the expression $(4^3) \times (4^{-1})$, we can use the properties of exponents. According to the product of powers rule, when multiplying two powers with the same base, we can add their exponents. In this case, the base is $4$. 

We have the terms $4^3$ and $4^{-1}$. Applying the product of powers rule, we combine the exponents:

$$
4^3 \times 4^{-1} = 4^{3 + (-1)} = 4^{3 - 1} = 4^2.
$$

To clarify further, the term $4^3$ represents the multiplication $4 \times 4 \times 4$, which equals $64$. The term $4^{-1}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{4}$. 

Now, when we multiply $64$ by $\frac{1}{4}$, we obtain:

$$
64 \times \frac{1}{4} = 16.
$$

This result, $16$, is indeed the same as $4^2$. Therefore, we can conclude that the simplified form of $(4^3) \times (4^{-1})$ is:

$$
4^2.
$$

In summary, through the product of powers rule and basic multiplication, we have confirmed that $(4^3) \times (4^{-1}) = 4^2$.
