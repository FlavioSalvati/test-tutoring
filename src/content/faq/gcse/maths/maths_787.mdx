To calculate the tangent of an angle using a calculator, simply input the angle and press the 'tan' button.

To clarify, the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. On a scientific calculator, this function is usually labeled as 'tan'. Here’s a step-by-step guide to finding the tangent:

1. **Ensure the Calculator is in the Correct Mode**: Calculators can operate in either degrees or radians. For GCSE Maths, you typically work in degrees. Look for a 'DEG' indicator on your calculator's display. If it displays 'RAD' (indicating radians), switch it to degrees by pressing the 'MODE' button until 'DEG' appears.

2. **Input the Angle**: Enter the angle for which you wish to calculate the tangent. For instance, to find the tangent of $45^\circ$, simply press '4', followed by '5'.

3. **Press the 'tan' Button**: Once you have entered the angle, press the 'tan' button. The calculator will then display the tangent of the angle. For $45^\circ$, the expected result is $1$, since $$\tan(45^\circ) = 1$$.

4. **Interpreting the Result**: The number shown on the display is the tangent of the angle you entered. This value can be utilized in various trigonometric calculations, such as solving triangles or analyzing wave functions.

Additionally, if you need to determine the angle from a given tangent value, you can use the inverse tangent function, commonly labeled as 'tan⁻¹' or 'arctan' on your calculator.
