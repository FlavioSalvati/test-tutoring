To find the composition of functions $(g \circ f)(x)$, we begin by substituting $f(x)$ into $g(x)$. This gives us the expression:

$$(g \circ f)(x) = (3x)^2.$$

Let’s break this down step by step for clarity. The notation $(g \circ f)(x)$ indicates that we first apply the function $f(x)$, and then we apply the function $g(x)$ to the result obtained from $f(x)$. We are given the functions $f(x) = 3x$ and $g(x) = x^2$. Our first step is to compute $f(x)$.

First, we calculate $f(x)$:

$$ f(x) = 3x. $$

Next, we substitute this result into the function $g(x)$. This means that wherever we see $x$ in $g(x)$, we will replace it with $f(x)$:

$$ g(f(x)) = g(3x). $$

Since we know that $g(x) = x^2$, we substitute $3x$ for $x$ in the expression for $g(x)$:

$$ g(3x) = (3x)^2. $$

Now, we simplify this expression:

$$ (3x)^2 = 9x^2. $$

Thus, we conclude that 

$$(g \circ f)(x) = 9x^2.$$

This process is known as function composition, where one function is applied to the output of another function. Function composition is a valuable technique in mathematics, allowing us to combine functions and analyze their collective effects.
