The total duration of $45$ minutes plus $1$ hour and $15$ minutes amounts to $2$ hours.

To clarify the calculation, we will first convert all time durations to the same unit. We have $45$ minutes, and we need to convert $1$ hour and $15$ minutes into minutes. Since $1$ hour is equivalent to $60$ minutes, we can express $1$ hour and $15$ minutes as:

$$
1 \text{ hour} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Now, we can add the two time durations together:

$$
45 \text{ minutes} + 75 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}.
$$

Next, we will convert the total of $120$ minutes back into hours and minutes. Since $1$ hour is $60$ minutes, we divide the total by $60$:

$$
120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours}.
$$

Therefore, $45$ minutes plus $1$ hour and $15$ minutes equals $2$ hours. This method of converting all time durations to the same unit before performing the addition simplifies the process and allows for an easier conversion back to hours and minutes if needed. This technique is particularly useful for solving time-related problems in GCSE Maths.
