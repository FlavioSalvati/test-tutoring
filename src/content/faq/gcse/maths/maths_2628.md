To determine the perimeter of a pentagon, you simply add the lengths of all five of its sides together.

To elaborate, the perimeter of any polygon, including a pentagon, is defined as the total distance around its edges. For a pentagon, which consists of five sides, the perimeter is calculated by summing the lengths of these sides. If the pentagon is regular, meaning all sides are of equal length, you can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by five. For instance, if each side of a regular pentagon measures $6 \, \text{cm}$, the perimeter would be:

$$
5 \times 6 = 30 \, \text{cm}.
$$

In contrast, if the pentagon is irregular, meaning its sides have different lengths, you will need to know the length of each individual side. For example, if the side lengths are $4 \, \text{cm}$, $5 \, \text{cm}$, $6 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, and $8 \, \text{cm}$, you would add these lengths together as follows:

$$
4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 30 \, \text{cm}.
$$

It's essential to ensure that you have accurate measurements for each side. If you are working from a diagram, use a ruler to measure each side precisely. If the lengths are already provided, simply add them up. This method is applicable to any polygon, not just pentagons, and is a fundamental concept in geometry.
