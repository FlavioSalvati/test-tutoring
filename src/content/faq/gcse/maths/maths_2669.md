To determine the volume of a cone with a radius of $4$ cm and a height of $9$ cm, we can employ the formula:

$$
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
$$

In this equation, $V$ represents the volume of the cone, $r$ denotes the radius of its base, and $h$ signifies its height. For this specific cone, we have a radius $r = 4$ cm and a height $h = 9$ cm.

We begin the calculation by squaring the radius:

$$
4^2 = 16
$$

Next, we multiply this squared value by the height:

$$
16 \times 9 = 144
$$

Following that, we multiply the result by $\pi$:

$$
144 \pi
$$

Finally, we apply the factor of $\frac{1}{3}$:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 144 \pi = 48 \pi
$$

Thus, the volume of the cone is $48 \pi$ cubic centimeters. If you require a numerical approximation, you can use $\pi \approx 3.14$, which gives:

$$
48 \times 3.14 \approx 150.72
$$

Therefore, the approximated volume of the cone is about $150.72$ cubic centimeters.
