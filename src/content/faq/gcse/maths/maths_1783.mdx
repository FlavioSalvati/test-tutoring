To convert $25\%$ to a decimal, you simply need to divide $25$ by $100$, resulting in $0.25$.

When transforming a percentage into a decimal, you are essentially determining how the percentage relates to a fraction of $100$. The term "percent" literally means "per hundred," which indicates that $25\%$ is equivalent to $25$ out of $100$. Thus, to convert this percentage into a decimal, you divide the percentage value by $100$.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to the conversion process:

1. Begin with the percentage you wish to convert; in this case, it is $25\%$.
2. Eliminate the percentage sign ($\%$) to treat it as a whole number. Therefore, $25\%$ becomes $25$.
3. Divide this whole number by $100$: $$25 \div 100$$.
4. The result of this division is $0.25$.

Alternatively, you can visualize this process as shifting the decimal point two places to the left. For instance, if you start with $25$, moving the decimal point two places to the left gives you $0.25$. This method is applicable to any percentage.

Understanding how to convert percentages to decimals is essential in various mathematical contexts, including probability assessments, financial calculations, and data analysis. Mastering this skill will benefit you in numerous academic pursuits and everyday situations.
