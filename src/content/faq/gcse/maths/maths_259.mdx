The x-coordinate of the point $(2, -8)$ is $2$.

In a coordinate system, each point is represented by an ordered pair of numbers enclosed in parentheses, such as $(x, y)$. In this notation, the first number represents the x-coordinate, while the second number denotes the y-coordinate. The x-coordinate indicates the horizontal displacement from the origin $(0, 0)$, and the y-coordinate indicates the vertical displacement.

For the specific point $(2, -8)$, the x-coordinate is $2$. This indicates that you move $2$ units to the right from the origin. The y-coordinate is $-8$, which means you move $8$ units down from the origin. Together, these coordinates pinpoint the exact location of the point on the Cartesian plane.

Understanding coordinates is essential in GCSE Maths, as it facilitates plotting points, drawing graphs, and solving geometric problems. The x-coordinate is always the first number in the pair, making it straightforward to identify. Therefore, whenever you encounter a point such as $(2, -8)$, you can easily conclude that the x-coordinate is $2$.
