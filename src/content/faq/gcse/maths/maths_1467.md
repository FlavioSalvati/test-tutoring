To determine the magnitude of the vector $(2, -2)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. The magnitude is calculated using the formula:

$$
\sqrt{2^2 + (-2)^2}
$$

To elaborate, the magnitude of a vector represents its length. In two-dimensional space, a vector like $(2, -2)$ can be visualized as a point in the Cartesian coordinate system. The magnitude indicates the distance from this point to the origin, which is located at $(0, 0)$. To compute this distance, we utilize the Pythagorean theorem, a foundational concept in geometry.

The Pythagorean theorem asserts that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. For the vector $(2, -2)$, we can conceptualize a right-angled triangle where one leg is $2$ units long (the x-component) and the other leg is $-2$ units long (the y-component).

To find the magnitude, we first square the lengths of both components: $2^2$ and $(-2)^2$. This yields:

$$
2^2 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad (-2)^2 = 4
$$

Adding these results together gives us:

$$
4 + 4 = 8
$$

The final step involves taking the square root of this sum to determine the length of the hypotenuse, which corresponds to the vector's magnitude:

$$
\sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(2, -2)$ is $2\sqrt{2}$.
