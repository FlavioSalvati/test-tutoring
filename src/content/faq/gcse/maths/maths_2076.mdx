To substitute the value $3$ for the variable $a$ in the expression $4a + 6$, you will replace $a$ with $3$ and then simplify the resulting expression.

When substituting a value into an algebraic expression, the variable is replaced by the specified number. In this instance, the expression is $4a + 6$, and we need to substitute $a$ with $3$. Begin by rewriting the expression with $3$ in place of $a$:

$$
4(3) + 6.
$$

Next, perform the multiplication:

$$
4 \times 3 = 12.
$$

Thus, the expression now becomes:

$$
12 + 6.
$$

Finally, add the two numbers together:

$$
12 + 6 = 18.
$$

Therefore, when you substitute $3$ for $a$ in the expression $4a + 6$, the simplified result is $18$.

This substitution process is a fundamental skill in algebra, as it enables you to evaluate expressions and solve equations. Remember to always adhere to the order of operations: brackets, orders (such as powers and roots), division and multiplication (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often summarized by the acronym BODMAS.
