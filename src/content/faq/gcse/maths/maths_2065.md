To multiply the surds $\sqrt{7}$ and $\sqrt{21}$, you can utilize the property of surds that states:

$$
\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \times b}.
$$

Applying this property, we have:

$$
\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{21} = \sqrt{7 \times 21}.
$$

Now, let's calculate the product of $7$ and $21$. Performing the multiplication yields:

$$
7 \times 21 = 147.
$$

Consequently, we can express this as:

$$
\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{21} = \sqrt{147}.
$$

Next, we can simplify $\sqrt{147}$ by identifying any square factors within $147$. The prime factorization of $147$ is:

$$
147 = 3 \times 7 \times 7.
$$

Since $7 \times 7 = 49$, which is a perfect square, we can rewrite $\sqrt{147}$ as:

$$
\sqrt{147} = \sqrt{49 \times 3}.
$$

Using the property of surds again, this simplifies to:

$$
\sqrt{49} \times \sqrt{3} = 7\sqrt{3}.
$$

Thus, the final simplified form of the expression $\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{21}$ is:

$$
7\sqrt{3}.
$$
