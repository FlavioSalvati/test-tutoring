To sketch the graph of the function $ y = \log(x) $, we will first identify key points, draw the curve, and observe its asymptotic behavior.

It is important to note that $ y = \log(x) $ represents the logarithmic function with base 10, commonly expressed as $ \log_{10}(x) $. This function is defined only for $ x > 0 $. A critical point on the graph is $ (1, 0) $, since $ \log(1) = 0 $. Another significant point is $ (10, 1) $ because $ \log(10) = 1 $.

Next, we will plot these points on a coordinate grid. As $ x $ approaches $ 0 $ from the right, $ y $ decreases indefinitely, meaning the graph approaches the y-axis but never intersects it. This behavior indicates that there is a vertical asymptote at $ x = 0 $.

For larger values of $ x $, the graph rises slowly. For instance, we can calculate $ \log(100) = 2 $, allowing us to plot the point $ (100, 2) $. As a result, the curve will gently ascend to the right, illustrating that while $ y $ increases as $ x $ increases, this growth occurs at a diminishing rate.

In summary, begin by plotting the points $ (1, 0) $ and $ (10, 1) $. Then, draw a smooth curve that passes through these points, approaching the y-axis without ever touching it, and rising gradually to the right. Keep in mind the vertical asymptote at $ x = 0 $. Following these steps will provide you with a clear sketch of the graph of $ y = \log(x) $.
