To compare mixed numbers, we usually transform them into either improper fractions or decimals, and then directly compare these values.

The initial step in comparing mixed numbers is to convert each mixed number to an improper fraction. A mixed number consists of a whole number and a fraction. To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction and then add the numerator. This sum becomes the new numerator, while the denominator remains unchanged. For instance, if we want to convert $2 \frac{3}{4}$ to an improper fraction, we multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 3 to get 11. This results in $\frac{11}{4}$.

Alternatively, we can also convert mixed numbers to decimals for comparison. This can be done by dividing the numerator by the denominator to get the decimal part and then adding this to the whole number. For example, the mixed number $2 \frac{3}{4}$ can be converted to a decimal by dividing 3 by 4 to get 0.75, and then adding this to 2 to get 2.75.

After converting both mixed numbers to either improper fractions or decimals, we can directly compare these values. If we choose to use improper fractions, we need to ensure that they have a common denominator before comparing their numerators. If we convert the mixed numbers to decimals, we can simply compare these decimal values. For instance, to compare $2 \frac{3}{4}$ and $3 \frac{1}{2}$, we could convert them to decimals (which are 2.75 and 3.5, respectively) and notice that 3.5 is larger than 2.75.

In conclusion, by converting mixed numbers to a single, common format, it becomes straightforward to determine which value is larger or smaller.
