To calculate angles formed when parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, one can apply the rules pertaining to corresponding angles, alternate angles, and co-interior angles.

When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, it creates several types of angle relationships. Understanding these relationships is crucial for determining the measures of the angles involved. The primary angle relationships to consider are as follows:

**Corresponding Angles**: These angles are located on the same side of the transversal and occupy matching positions relative to the parallel lines. For instance, if one angle is located above a parallel line and to the right of the transversal, its corresponding angle will be situated above the other parallel line and also to the right of the transversal. Notably, corresponding angles are always equal in measure.

**Alternate Angles**: These angles lie on opposite sides of the transversal and are situated between the parallel lines. They form a 'Z' shape (or an 'N' shape when the diagram is rotated). Alternate angles are also equal. For example, if one angle is positioned to the left of the transversal and above one of the parallel lines, its alternate angle will be found to the right of the transversal and below the other parallel line.

**Co-Interior Angles**: These angles are on the same side of the transversal and lie between the parallel lines, creating a 'C' shape. Co-interior angles are supplementary, which means that their measures sum to $180^\circ$. For instance, if one angle is located to the left of the transversal and between the parallel lines, its co-interior angle will also be to the left of the transversal but on the other parallel line.

By recognizing these angle relationships, you can effectively calculate unknown angles when parallel lines are intersected by a transversal.
