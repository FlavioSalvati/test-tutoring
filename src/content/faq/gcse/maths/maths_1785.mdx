To convert the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ into its equivalent decimal form, you need to divide the numerator by the denominator. Specifically, you will divide $3$ by $4$, which results in $0.75$.

Hereâ€™s how to perform the conversion step-by-step using long division:

1. **Set Up the Division**: Start by arranging the division with $3$ as the dividend (the number being divided) and $4$ as the divisor (the number you are dividing by). 
2. **Add a Decimal**: Since $4$ cannot divide into $3$, you introduce a decimal point and add a zero to $3$, making it $30$.
3. **Divide**: Determine how many times $4$ fits into $30$. It fits $7$ times, since $4 \times 7 = 28$. Write $7$ after the decimal point.
4. **Subtract**: Subtract $28$ from $30$, leaving you with $2$.
5. **Bring Down a Zero**: Add another zero, making it $20$. 
6. **Divide Again**: Now, see how many times $4$ fits into $20$. It fits $5$ times, as $4 \times 5 = 20$. Write $5$ next to the $7$, resulting in $0.75$.

Alternatively, if you prefer a quicker method, you can use a calculator. Simply input $3 \div 4$, and the calculator will show $0.75$. This approach is often faster and ensures accuracy, especially when dealing with more complex fractions.

Mastering the conversion of fractions to decimals is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it is applicable in various topics, including percentages, ratios, and algebra.
