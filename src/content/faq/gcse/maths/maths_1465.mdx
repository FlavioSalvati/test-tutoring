To determine the length of the vector $ (4, -3) $, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the length (or magnitude) of a vector can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Length} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

where $ x $ and $ y $ are the components of the vector. This relationship arises because the vector forms a right-angled triangle with the x and y axes, with the vector itself representing the hypotenuse of this triangle.

For the specific vector $ (4, -3) $:

- The x-component is $ 4 $.
- The y-component is $ -3 $.

To find the magnitude, we first square each component:

- $ 4^2 = 16 $
- $ (-3)^2 = 9 $

Next, we add these squared values together:

$$
16 + 9 = 25
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the sum to find the length of the vector:

$$
\sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Thus, the length of the vector $ (4, -3) $ is $ 5 $ units. This calculation method can be utilized for any vector in two-dimensional space to determine its magnitude.
