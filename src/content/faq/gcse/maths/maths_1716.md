A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction.

To recognize a mixed number, look for two distinct parts: a whole number and a fraction. The whole number is an integer, while the fraction is a proper fraction, meaning that the numerator (the top number) is less than the denominator (the bottom number). For instance, in the mixed number $3 \frac{1}{2}$, the whole number is $3$, and the proper fraction is $\frac{1}{2}$.

Mixed numbers are particularly useful for representing quantities that exceed a whole but are less than the next whole number. They often come in handy in everyday scenarios, such as measuring ingredients in cooking or describing distances. For example, if you have $2$ whole pizzas and half of another pizza, you can express this quantity as $2 \frac{1}{2}$ pizzas.

When writing a mixed number, the whole number should be placed to the left of the fraction. It is important to ensure that the fraction is in its simplest form, meaning it cannot be reduced any further. For example, $4 \frac{1}{3}$ is a mixed number, where $4$ is the whole number and $\frac{1}{3}$ is the proper fraction.

Understanding mixed numbers is crucial for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division involving both fractions and whole numbers. Being able to recognize and convert between improper fractions (where the numerator is greater than the denominator) and mixed numbers is an essential skill in GCSE Maths. For instance, the improper fraction $\frac{7}{4}$ can be converted to the mixed number $1 \frac{3}{4}$.
