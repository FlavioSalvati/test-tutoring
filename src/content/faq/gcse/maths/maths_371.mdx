### Angles Subtended by the Same Arc are Equal

In circle geometry, a fundamental property states that angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Specifically, when two or more angles are formed by the endpoints of an arc in a circle, these angles are always congruent. This principle is crucial for solving various problems involving circles.

To illustrate this concept, consider a circle with an arc denoted as $AB$. If we draw two angles, $\angle ACB$ and $\angle ADB$, where points $C$ and $D$ are located on the circumference of the circle, both angles will be equal to each other.

This equality arises because the angles subtended by the same arc are effectively "viewing" the same segment of the circle. The arc $AB$ defines a specific "slice" of the circle, and any angle formed by connecting the endpoints of this arc to another point on the circumference will have the same measure. This phenomenon occurs because these angles are classified as inscribed angles, and the measure of an inscribed angle is always half that of the central angle subtending the same arc.

For example, if the central angle $\angle AOB$ (where $O$ represents the center of the circle) measures $80^\circ$, then any angle subtended by the arc $AB$, such as $\angle ACB$ or $\angle ADB$, will measure $40^\circ$. 

This property is particularly useful for solving problems related to circle theorems, as it enables you to easily identify and equate angles. This simplification can significantly streamline the process of determining unknown angles or proving specific geometric properties.
