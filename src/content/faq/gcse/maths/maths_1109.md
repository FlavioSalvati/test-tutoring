Rotational symmetry refers to a property of a shape that allows it to appear unchanged after being rotated around a central point.

More specifically, a shape possesses rotational symmetry if it can be rotated through an angle less than a full circle (i.e., less than $360^\circ$) and still look identical to its original form. The number of times a shape aligns with its original position during one complete rotation is known as its order of rotational symmetry. For instance, a square has an order of rotational symmetry equal to $4$, as it maintains its appearance after rotations of $90^\circ$, $180^\circ$, $270^\circ$, and $360^\circ$.

To determine if a shape has rotational symmetry, one can either visualize or physically rotate the shape around its center. If the shape appears unchanged at certain angles during this rotation, it demonstrates rotational symmetry. Common examples of shapes that exhibit this property include regular polygons such as equilateral triangles, squares, and hexagons. Each of these shapes can be rotated by specific angles—$120^\circ$ for an equilateral triangle, $90^\circ$ for a square, and $60^\circ$ for a hexagon—while still appearing the same.

Understanding rotational symmetry is beneficial in various fields of mathematics and everyday life, including design, art, and the natural world. For example, many flowers and starfish display rotational symmetry, contributing to their aesthetic appeal and structural balance. In GCSE Mathematics, recognizing and analyzing rotational symmetry is essential for solving problems related to geometry and transformations.
