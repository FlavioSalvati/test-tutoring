summary: "The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded, and t is the time."

To calculate compound interest, you can use the following formula:

$$ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} $$

In this formula, the components are defined as follows:

- **A**: The total amount of money accumulated after $n$ years, including interest.
- **P**: The principal amount, which is the initial sum of money invested or borrowed.
- **r**: The annual interest rate expressed in decimal form (for example, $5\%$ becomes $0.05$).
- **n**: The number of times interest is compounded within a year.
- **t**: The duration for which the money is invested or borrowed, measured in years.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose you invest £1,000 (where $P = 1000$) at an annual interest rate of $5\%$ (where $r = 0.05$), compounded quarterly (where $n = 4$), for a period of $3$ years (where $t = 3$).

Here are the steps to calculate the accumulated amount:

1. Convert the interest rate to decimal form: $5\%$ becomes $0.05$.
2. Divide the annual interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year: 
   $$ \frac{0.05}{4} = 0.0125. $$
3. Multiply the number of compounding periods per year by the number of years: 
   $$ 4 \times 3 = 12. $$
4. Substitute these values into the compound interest formula:
   $$ A = 1000 \left(1 + 0.0125\right)^{12}. $$

Now, let's perform the calculations step-by-step:

1. Add $1$ to the interest rate per period: 
   $$ 1 + 0.0125 = 1.0125. $$
2. Raise this result to the power of the total number of compounding periods: 
   $$ 1.0125^{12} \approx 1.1616. $$
3. Finally, multiply this value by the principal amount: 
   $$ 1000 \times 1.1616 \approx 1161.60. $$

Therefore, after $3$ years, your investment would grow to approximately £1161.60.
