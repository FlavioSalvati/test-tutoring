The sum of co-interior angles formed by parallel lines is always equal to $180^\circ$.

When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal—a line that crosses both parallel lines—several pairs of angles are created. Among these pairs are the co-interior angles, which are also referred to as consecutive interior angles or allied angles. Co-interior angles are positioned on the same side of the transversal and lie between the parallel lines.

To grasp why the sum of co-interior angles is $180^\circ$, we need to consider the properties of parallel lines and the angles formed when a transversal intersects them. Since parallel lines never intersect and remain equidistant from each other, the angles created by the transversal exhibit specific relationships. In particular, the co-interior angles are supplementary, meaning that the sum of their measures is equal to that of a straight line.

For instance, if one co-interior angle measures $110^\circ$, then the corresponding co-interior angle on the same side of the transversal will measure $70^\circ$, because $110 + 70 = 180$. This relationship is consistent for any pair of co-interior angles formed by a transversal crossing parallel lines.

Understanding this concept is essential for tackling various problems in geometry, such as determining unknown angle measures or proving that two lines are parallel. Remembering that the sum of co-interior angles equals $180^\circ$ can significantly aid in recognizing and working with these angles across different geometric scenarios.
