To determine the surface area of a compound solid formed by two cylinders, you need to calculate and then sum the areas of all exposed surfaces.

First, identify the dimensions of both cylinders, specifically their radii and heights. We will denote the radii as $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $, and the heights as $ h_1 $ and $ h_2 $. The surface area of a single cylinder can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2,
$$

which accounts for the areas of the two circular bases as well as the curved surface area.

When calculating the surface area of the compound solid, consider how the cylinders are arranged. If they are connected end-to-end, the total surface area will consist of the curved surfaces of both cylinders, along with the area of the two exposed circular bases. Conversely, if the cylinders are positioned side-by-side, you will need to subtract the area of the overlapping parts.

For instance, if the cylinders are joined end-to-end, the surface area can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Total Surface Area} = 2\pi r_1 h_1 + 2\pi r_2 h_2 + 2\pi r_1^2 + 2\pi r_2^2 - 2\pi r_1^2,
$$

In this case, we subtract the area of one circular base from the total because it is not exposed.

In scenarios where the cylinders are joined side-by-side, the calculation becomes more intricate, as you will need to account for the area of the overlapping curved surface. This may require further geometric analysis to accurately determine the extent of the overlap.

By meticulously analyzing the structure and applying the appropriate formulas, you can accurately compute the surface area of the compound solid.
