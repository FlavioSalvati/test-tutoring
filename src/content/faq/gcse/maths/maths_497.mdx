To determine the length of the vector $(0, 5)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which gives us the following calculation:

$$ \text{Length} = \sqrt{0^2 + 5^2} = 5. $$

To elaborate, the length of a vector, often referred to as its magnitude, can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem. For a vector defined by its components $(x, y)$, the formula for calculating its length is given by:

$$ \text{Length} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. $$

This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

For the specific vector $(0, 5)$, the $x$-component is $0$ and the $y$-component is $5$. Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$ \text{Length} = \sqrt{0^2 + 5^2}. $$

We can break this down into steps:

1. First, calculate the squares of the components:
   $$ 0^2 = 0, $$
   $$ 5^2 = 25. $$

2. Next, add these squared values together:
   $$ 0 + 25 = 25. $$

3. Finally, take the square root of the sum:
   $$ \sqrt{25} = 5. $$

Thus, the length of the vector $(0, 5)$ is $5$. This result is intuitive, as the vector points directly upward along the $y$-axis. Its length represents the distance from the origin point $(0, 0)$ to the point $(0, 5)$, which is exactly $5$ units.
