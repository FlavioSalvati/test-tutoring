To determine 50% of $120$, we find that the result is $60$.

To calculate 50% of a number, it's important to recognize that 50% represents half of that number. Percentages express values as parts of $100$. Therefore, $50\%$ is equivalent to $50$ out of $100$, or in decimal form, $0.5$. To find 50% of any number, you simply multiply that number by $0.5$.

In this case, to find 50% of $120$, you can perform the following multiplication:
$$ 
120 \times 0.5 = 60 
$$

Alternatively, you can think of finding 50% as dividing the number by $2$, since $50\%$ is half of the value:
$$ 
120 \div 2 = 60 
$$

Both methods yield the same answer. This technique is particularly useful for quickly calculating percentages, especially common ones like $50\%$, $25\%$, or $10\%$. Mastering percentages is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it applies to a wide range of real-world scenarios, including calculating discounts, interest rates, and various statistical analyses.
