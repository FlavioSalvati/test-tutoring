To find the midpoint between the points $(3, 3)$ and $(7, 7)$, we can use the midpoint formula, which is given by:

$$
\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right).
$$

The midpoint formula provides a simple and effective way to identify the exact center point between two coordinates on a Cartesian plane. In this scenario, we have the coordinates $(3, 3)$ and $(7, 7)$. To calculate the midpoint, we need to determine the averages of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately.

First, we will sum the x-coordinates:

$$
3 + 7 = 10.
$$

Next, we divide this sum by $2$ to find the average:

$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5.
$$

This result gives us the x-coordinate of the midpoint.

Now, we will repeat the process for the y-coordinates. We add them together:

$$
3 + 7 = 10.
$$

We then divide this sum by $2$ to find the average:

$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5.
$$

This provides us with the y-coordinate of the midpoint.

Therefore, the midpoint between the points $(3, 3)$ and $(7, 7)$ is $(5, 5)$. This method is applicable to any pair of points and is particularly valuable in geometry and coordinate graphing. By averaging the x and y values, we effectively find the point that is equidistant from both original points.
