The order of rotational symmetry for a regular decagon is $10$.

A regular decagon is defined as a ten-sided polygon in which all sides and angles are equal. Rotational symmetry refers to the property of a shape that allows it to appear unchanged after a certain degree of rotation. In the case of a regular decagon, it can be rotated by $36$ degrees (which is calculated as $\frac{360}{10}$) and will look exactly as it did prior to the rotation. This phenomenon occurs because each of the ten sides and angles is identical, enabling the shape to align with its original position multiple times throughout a complete $360$-degree rotation.

To determine the order of rotational symmetry, we divide $360$ degrees by the smallest angle of rotation that maps the shape onto itself. For a regular decagon, this smallest angle is $36$ degrees. Consequently, we find:

$$
\text{Order of rotational symmetry} = \frac{360^\circ}{36^\circ} = 10.
$$

This indicates that a regular decagon has $10$ distinct orientations in which it appears unchanged during a full rotation, thereby establishing its order of rotational symmetry as $10$.

Comprehending rotational symmetry is essential in various mathematical fields, as it aids in recognizing patterns and properties of geometric shapes. Additionally, it holds practical significance in areas such as design, art, and architecture, where symmetry is pivotal for both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.
