To identify local maxima of a function, the first step is to determine where the first derivative is equal to zero. This process involves checking the second derivative or observing sign changes in the first derivative.

Begin by calculating the derivative of the function, which represents the gradient or slope at any given point. The first derivative, denoted as $f'(x)$, reflects how the function is changing. A local maximum occurs at a point where the function transitions from increasing to decreasing, indicating that the slope changes from positive to negative.

Start by setting the first derivative equal to zero:

$$
f'(x) = 0
$$

This equation will yield critical points, which are potential candidates for local maxima (or minima). Solving this equation provides the $x$-values at which the slope of the function is zero.

Next, to confirm whether these critical points are indeed local maxima, you can use the second derivative, denoted as $f''(x)$. The second derivative provides information about the concavity of the function. If $f''(x)$ is negative at a critical point, the function is concave down, indicating the presence of a local maximum. Conversely, if $f''(x)$ is positive, the function is concave up, which indicates a local minimum.

Alternatively, you can employ the first derivative test. Examine the sign of $f'(x)$ both before and after each critical point. If $f'(x)$ changes from positive to negative as you move through the critical point, it signifies a local maximum. Conversely, if it changes from negative to positive, it indicates a local minimum.

By following these procedures, you can effectively identify the local maxima of a function using its first derivative.
