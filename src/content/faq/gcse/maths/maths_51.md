To carry out multiplication involving a decimal and a percentage, it is necessary to convert the percentage into a decimal form first. This conversion is achieved by dividing the percentage by 100.

As an illustration, consider a percentage of 25%. This can be converted to a decimal by performing the operation $\frac{25}{100}$, which yields $0.25$.

Subsequently, you simply multiply the original decimal by the converted decimal. For example, if you wish to multiply $0.6$ by 25%, you first convert 25% into its decimal form, $0.25$. The multiplication is then performed as $0.6 \times 0.25$, giving a result of $0.15$.

Let's delve into another example for clarity. If you aim to multiply $0.75$ by 40%, you initially convert 40% into a decimal, which is $\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$. You then perform the multiplication as $0.75 \times 0.4$, resulting in $0.3$.

It's essential to note that converting the percentage to a decimal is a vital step because it allows for straightforward multiplication. This technique applies to any combination of decimals and percentages, making it a versatile and vital skill in GCSE Maths.
