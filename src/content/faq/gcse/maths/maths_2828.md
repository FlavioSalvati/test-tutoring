The outcome of this transformation is a circle with a radius that is double that of the original and an area that is four times greater.

When you enlarge a circle by a scale factor of $2$ about the origin, each point on the circle moves twice as far from the origin. Consequently, the radius of the new circle is twice the radius of the original circle. For instance, if the original circle has a radius of $3$ units, the new circle will have a radius of $6$ units.

To comprehend the impact on the area, recall that the area of a circle is determined by the formula:

$$
A = \pi r^2,
$$

where $r$ represents the radius. If the radius is doubled, the new radius $r'$ becomes $2r$. Substituting $2r$ into the area formula yields:

$$
A' = \pi (2r)^2 = \pi \cdot 4r^2 = 4\pi r^2.
$$

This calculation demonstrates that the area of the new circle is four times the area of the original circle.

In summary, enlarging a circle by a scale factor of $2$ about the origin produces a new circle with a radius that is twice as large and an area that is four times greater than that of the original circle. Understanding this concept is crucial for grasping how geometric transformations influence shapes and their properties.
