The tangent-tangent angle theorem states that the angle formed between two tangents drawn from a point outside a circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

When two tangents are drawn to a circle from a single external point, they touch the circle at two distinct points. The angle created between these two tangents is referred to as the tangent-tangent angle. According to the theorem, this angle is equal to half the difference between the measures of the arcs intercepted by the tangents.

To illustrate this concept, consider a circle with center $O$ and a point $P$ located outside the circle. From point $P$, draw two tangents that touch the circle at points $A$ and $B$. The intercepted arcs are the segments of the circle's circumference that lie between points $A$ and $B$. There are two arcs to consider: the major arc (the longer segment) and the minor arc (the shorter segment).

The tangent-tangent angle theorem states that the angle $\angle APB$ is given by:

$$
\angle APB = \frac{1}{2} (M - m)
$$

where $M$ represents the measure of the major arc $AB$, and $m$ represents the measure of the minor arc $AB$. 

This theorem serves as a valuable tool in various geometric problems and proofs, allowing for a deeper understanding of the relationships between angles and arcs in circles. It simplifies the process of solving problems involving tangents and circles, making it easier to determine unknown angles and lengths.
