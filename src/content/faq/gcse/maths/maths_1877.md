The number $678$ rounded to the nearest hundred is $700$.

When rounding numbers, we focus on the digit in the place value immediately to the right of the digit we are rounding. In this instance, since we are rounding to the nearest hundred, we need to examine the tens digit of $678$, which is $7$. According to standard rounding rules, if this digit is $5$ or greater, we round up. Conversely, if it is less than $5$, we round down.

Since $7$ is greater than $5$, we round the hundreds digit (which is $6$) up by one, resulting in $7$. Consequently, all digits to the right of the hundreds place are replaced with zero. Thus, $678$ rounded to the nearest hundred becomes $700$.

Rounding is a valuable tool for simplifying numbers, making them easier to handleâ€”particularly in mental arithmetic or estimation. This skill is beneficial in various areas of mathematics and everyday life, such as managing finances, measuring quantities, or analyzing data. Remember, the essential steps in rounding are: identify the place value to which you are rounding, check the digit immediately to the right, and determine whether to round up or down based on that digit.
