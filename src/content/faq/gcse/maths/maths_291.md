The equation of a line that is parallel to the line given by $ y = -3x + 4 $ can be expressed as $ y = -3x + c $.

To understand this, let's first analyze the equation $ y = -3x + 4 $. This equation is in the slope-intercept form, $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ is the y-intercept. In this case, the slope $ m $ is equal to $ -3 $.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same slope. Therefore, any line parallel to $ y = -3x + 4 $ will also have a slope of $ -3 $. The only difference between these parallel lines lies in their y-intercepts, which are represented by $ c $ in the equation $ y = -3x + c $.

For instance, if we select $ c = 2 $, the equation of the parallel line would be $ y = -3x + 2 $. Alternatively, if we choose $ c = -5 $, the equation becomes $ y = -3x - 5 $. The value of $ c $ can be any real number, and it determines the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

In summary, the crucial takeaway is that the slope must remain consistent for two lines to be parallel. The y-intercept can vary, allowing us to create a family of parallel lines, each following the form $ y = -3x + c $.
