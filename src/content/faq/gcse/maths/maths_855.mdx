To simplify the expression $9p + 3p - 5$, we start by combining like terms, which results in $12p - 5$.

When simplifying algebraic expressions, the first step is to identify and combine like terms. In the expression $9p + 3p - 5$, the terms $9p$ and $3p$ are considered like terms because they both share the variable $p$. To combine these terms, you simply add their coefficients (the numerical values in front of the variables). Thus, we have:

$$
9p + 3p = (9 + 3)p = 12p.
$$

The term $-5$ is a constant and does not contain a variable, so it remains unchanged in the expression. Consequently, after combining the like terms, the simplified form of the expression is:

$$
12p - 5.
$$

This process of combining like terms is crucial for making expressions more manageable, particularly when solving equations or performing further manipulations. Remember, the key is to identify terms that share the same variable and then correctly add or subtract their coefficients as needed.
