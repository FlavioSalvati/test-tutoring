To determine the height of a similar pyramid, you can utilize the ratios of their corresponding sides or volumes.

For similar pyramids, the corresponding linear dimensions are proportional. This means that if you know the height of one pyramid and the ratio of their corresponding sides, you can calculate the height of the other pyramid. For instance, if the ratio of the sides of two similar pyramids is $1:2$, and the height of the smaller pyramid is $5$ meters, the height of the larger pyramid can be found by multiplying $5$ meters by $2$. This results in a height of $10$ meters for the larger pyramid.

If you have the volumes of the similar pyramids instead, you can find the ratio of the heights by taking the cube root of the volume ratio. This is because the volume of a pyramid is proportional to the cube of its linear dimensions. For example, if the volume of the smaller pyramid is $27$ cubic meters and the volume of the larger pyramid is $216$ cubic meters, the volume ratio is $1:8$. Taking the cube root of $8$ yields $2$, which represents the ratio of the heights. Therefore, if the height of the smaller pyramid is $3$ meters, the height of the larger pyramid would be $3$ meters multiplied by $2$, resulting in a height of $6$ meters for the larger pyramid.

In summary, it is essential to identify whether you are working with the ratio of the sides or the volumes, and then apply the corresponding mathematical relationship to accurately find the height of the similar pyramid.
