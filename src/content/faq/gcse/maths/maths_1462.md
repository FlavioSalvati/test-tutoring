To determine the direction of the vector $(4, 3)$, we need to calculate the angle $\theta$ it forms with the positive x-axis.

To find this angle, we can use trigonometry, specifically the tangent function. In a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. For the vector $(4, 3)$, the 'opposite' side corresponds to the y-component, which is $3$, while the 'adjacent' side corresponds to the x-component, which is $4$.

The formula to calculate the angle $\theta$ is given by:

$$ 
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) 
$$

Using a calculator, we can evaluate this expression:

$$ 
\theta \approx \tan^{-1}(0.75) \approx 36.87^\circ 
$$

Thus, the direction of the vector $(4, 3)$ is approximately $36.87^\circ$ above the positive x-axis. This angle provides insight into the vector's orientation in the plane, clearly indicating its direction.
