The solution to the equation $\cos(x) = -1$ within the interval from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ is $x = 180^\circ$.

In trigonometry, the cosine function, denoted as $\cos(x)$, represents the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle that corresponds to an angle $x$. The cosine of an angle is equal to $-1$ when the point is located at the far left of the unit circle. This specific point occurs at an angle of $180^\circ$, where the angle is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.

To understand why $180^\circ$ is the solution, we can refer to the unit circle. The unit circle is defined as a circle with a radius of $1$, centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. The cosine of an angle represents the horizontal distance from the origin to the point on the circumference of the circle. At both $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$, the point is located at $(1, 0)$, which gives us $\cos(0^\circ) = \cos(360^\circ) = 1$. As the angle increases, the point moves counterclockwise around the circle. At $90^\circ$, the point is at $(0, 1)$, resulting in $\cos(90^\circ) = 0$. Continuing to $180^\circ$, the point reaches $(-1, 0)$, leading to $\cos(180^\circ) = -1$.

It is important to note that the cosine function is periodic, with a period of $360^\circ$. This means it repeats its values every $360^\circ$. However, within the specific interval from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$, the only angle at which $\cos(x)$ equals $-1$ is precisely at $180^\circ$. During one complete rotation around the unit circle, the point $(-1, 0)$ is encountered only once, which occurs at $180^\circ$. Therefore, the unique solution to the equation $\cos(x) = -1$ in the interval from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ is $x = 180^\circ$.
