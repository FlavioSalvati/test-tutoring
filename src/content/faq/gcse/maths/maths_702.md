To divide a mixed number by a whole number, the first step is to convert the mixed number into an improper fraction.

A mixed number consists of a whole number and a fractional part, such as $3 \frac{1}{2}$. To divide this mixed number by a whole number, for example, $2$, you need to convert it to an improper fraction. This involves multiplying the whole number part by the denominator of the fractional part and then adding the numerator. For $3 \frac{1}{2}$, this calculation is as follows:

$$
3 \times 2 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7
$$

Thus, $3 \frac{1}{2}$ can be expressed as the improper fraction $\frac{7}{2}$.

Next, to divide this improper fraction by the whole number, remember that dividing by a whole number is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of $2$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, you will multiply $\frac{7}{2}$ by $\frac{1}{2}$. 

To perform this multiplication, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

$$
\frac{7}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7 \times 1}{2 \times 2} = \frac{7}{4}
$$

Finally, if desired, you can convert the improper fraction back into a mixed number. To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator to find the whole number part, and the remainder will serve as the new numerator. For the fraction $\frac{7}{4}$, when you divide $7$ by $4$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $3$. Therefore, $\frac{7}{4}$ can be expressed as the mixed number:

$$
1 \frac{3}{4}
$$

In conclusion, $3 \frac{1}{2}$ divided by $2$ equals $1 \frac{3}{4}$. This method allows you to confidently handle the division of any mixed number by a whole number.
