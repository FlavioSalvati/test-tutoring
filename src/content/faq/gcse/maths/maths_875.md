To solve the equation 6x - 5 = 7, add 5 to both sides and then divide by 6.

First, let's look at the equation: 6x - 5 = 7. The goal is to isolate the variable $ x $ on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to get rid of the -5 on the left-hand side. We can achieve this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation. This gives us:

$$ 6x - 5 + 5 = 7 + 5 $$

Simplifying both sides, we get:

$$ 6x = 12 $$

Now, we need to isolate $ x $ by getting rid of the 6 that is multiplying it. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

$$ \frac{6x}{6} = \frac{12}{6} $$

This simplifies to:

$$ x = 2 $$

So, the solution to the equation 6x - 5 = 7 is $ x = 2 $. This means that if you substitute $ x $ with 2 in the original equation, both sides will be equal, confirming that our solution is correct.
