The distance between the points $(0, 0)$ and $(3, 4)$ is $5$ units.

To calculate the distance between two points on a coordinate plane, we utilize the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The distance formula is expressed as:

$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} 
$$

In our example, the points are $(0, 0)$ and $(3, 4)$. Here, we define the coordinates as follows: $x_1 = 0$, $y_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 3$, and $y_2 = 4$. By substituting these values into the formula, we can compute the distance:

$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{9 + 16} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{25} 
$$
$$ 
\text{Distance} = 5 
$$

Thus, the distance between the points $(0, 0)$ and $(3, 4)$ is indeed $5$ units. This method can be applied to any pair of points on a coordinate plane and is a fundamental concept in geometry. By understanding and utilizing the distance formula, you can efficiently determine the straight-line distance between any two points, a vital skill in various fields of mathematics and science.
