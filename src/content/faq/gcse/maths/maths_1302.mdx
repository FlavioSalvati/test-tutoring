To determine the length of the unknown leg in a right-angled triangle, you can apply the Pythagorean theorem.

The Pythagorean theorem asserts that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

In this equation, $ c $ represents the length of the hypotenuse, while $ a $ and $ b $ denote the lengths of the other two legs. If you know the lengths of the hypotenuse and one leg, you can rearrange the formula to find the length of the other leg. For instance, if you have the values for $ c $ and $ a $, you can calculate $ b $ using the following formula:

$$
b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}
$$

Consider a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse measuring $10$ cm and one leg measuring $6$ cm. To find the length of the other leg, substitute these values into the formula:

$$
b = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2}
$$

Calculating further, we have:

$$
b = \sqrt{100 - 36}
$$
$$
b = \sqrt{64}
$$
$$
b = 8
$$

Thus, the length of the other leg is $8$ cm.

It is important to note that the Pythagorean theorem is applicable solely to right-angled triangles. Always ensure that the triangle in question is a right triangle before utilizing this method. For other types of triangles, you will need to employ different methods or formulas to find the missing lengths.
