The coordinates of the point that lies exactly halfway between the points $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$ are $(2, 4)$.

To determine the midpoint between two points, we can utilize the midpoint formula. The formula for the midpoint $M$ of two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is expressed as:

$$
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

In this scenario, the two points are $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$. By substituting these values into the formula, we find:

$$
M = \left( \frac{1 + 3}{2}, \frac{2 + 6}{2} \right)
$$

Letâ€™s begin by calculating the x-coordinate of the midpoint:

$$
\frac{1 + 3}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

Next, we compute the y-coordinate of the midpoint:

$$
\frac{2 + 6}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

Thus, the coordinates of the midpoint are $(2, 4)$.

This indicates that if you were to draw a line segment connecting the points $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$, the point $(2, 4)$ would be precisely at the midpoint of that segment. This method is invaluable in geometry and can be applied to any pair of points on a coordinate plane.
