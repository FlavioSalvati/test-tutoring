The order of rotational symmetry in a cylinder is infinite.

Rotational symmetry pertains to the number of times a shape appears unchanged during a complete $360^\circ$ rotation. For a cylinder, when you rotate it around its central axis, you'll observe that it maintains the same appearance at every angle of rotation. This means that regardless of how small the angle of rotation is, the cylinder looks identical. Consequently, we describe a cylinder as having an infinite order of rotational symmetry.

To illustrate this concept, consider a can of soup. When you place the can upright on a table and spin it around its vertical axis, it looks the same from every angle throughout the spin. This characteristic is distinctly different from shapes such as squares or triangles, which only appear unchanged at specific anglesâ€”$90^\circ$ for a square and $120^\circ$ for an equilateral triangle, for example. In contrast, a cylinder exhibits no such limitations and preserves its appearance continuously during rotation.

Understanding this principle is crucial in geometry as it aids in classifying shapes and comprehending their properties. Recognizing that a cylinder possesses infinite rotational symmetry is also valuable in practical applications, such as in engineering and design, where the consistent uniformity of cylindrical objects is often a crucial attribute.
