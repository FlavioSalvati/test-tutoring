To determine the length of the line segment connecting the points $(2, 3)$ and $(5, 7)$, we will apply the distance formula.

The distance formula is based on the Pythagorean theorem and is utilized to calculate the distance between two points in a Cartesian plane. The formula is expressed as:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points $(2, 3)$ and $(5, 7)$, we can assign the coordinates as follows:
- $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)$
- $(x_2, y_2) = (5, 7)$

Next, we will substitute these values into the distance formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (7 - 3)^2}
$$

First, we calculate the differences in the coordinates:

$$
5 - 2 = 3
$$

$$
7 - 3 = 4
$$

Now, we proceed to square these differences:

$$
3^2 = 9
$$

$$
4^2 = 16
$$

After squaring the differences, we add the results together:

$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the sum:

$$
\sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Therefore, the length of the segment from $(2, 3)$ to $(5, 7)$ is $5$ units.
