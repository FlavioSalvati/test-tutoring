The result of subtracting the vector $(1, 2)$ from the vector $(5, 6)$ yields the vector $(4, 4)$.

To perform vector subtraction, you subtract the corresponding components of the vectors involved. In this case, we have two vectors: $(5, 6)$ and $(1, 2)$. The first component of the resulting vector is calculated by subtracting the first component of the second vector from the first component of the first vector. Similarly, the second component of the resulting vector is determined by subtracting the second component of the second vector from the second component of the first vector.

To illustrate this, for the first component we have:

$$
5 - 1 = 4
$$

And for the second component, we have:

$$
6 - 2 = 4
$$

Thus, the resulting vector is $(4, 4)$.

This operation can be visualized on a coordinate plane. If you begin at the point $(5, 6)$ and move $1$ unit to the left (which corresponds to subtracting $1$ from the x-coordinate) and $2$ units down (which corresponds to subtracting $2$ from the y-coordinate), you will arrive at the point $(4, 4)$. This new point represents the vector $(4, 4)$, which is the outcome of the subtraction process.

Understanding vector subtraction is crucial in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it is fundamental for analyzing movements, forces, and other vector quantities. By mastering this basic operation, you can establish a solid foundation for more advanced vector manipulations.
