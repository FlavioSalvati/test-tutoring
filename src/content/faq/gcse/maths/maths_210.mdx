The sequence $4, 9, 16, 25$ showcases a clear pattern: each number is a perfect square of consecutive integers.

To delve deeper into this pattern, let's clarify what a perfect square is. A perfect square is defined as a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer multiplied by itself. For instance, $4$ is a perfect square because it can be represented as $2 \times 2$ or $2^2$. Similarly, $9$ is $3 \times 3$ (or $3^2$), $16$ is $4 \times 4$ (or $4^2$), and $25$ is $5 \times 5$ (or $5^2$).

In this sequence, each term corresponds to the square of consecutive integers starting from $2$. Specifically, the first term is $2^2$, the second term is $3^2$, the third term is $4^2$, and the fourth term is $5^2$. If we extend this pattern, the subsequent term would be $6^2$, which equals $36$.

Recognizing such patterns is invaluable in mathematics, as it enables us to predict future terms in a sequence and comprehend the relationships among numbers. In this instance, understanding that the sequence consists of perfect squares allows us to quickly identify the next terms without resorting to complex calculations. This skill of pattern recognition is fundamental in GCSE Maths and serves as a powerful tool for solving various mathematical problems more efficiently.
