To calculate the total cost, including a 20% VAT on £50, you can simply multiply £50 by 1.20.

When adding Value Added Tax (VAT) to a price, a straightforward multiplication method can be employed. VAT is a percentage of the original price; in this instance, it is set at 20%. To determine the total cost including VAT, the first step is to convert the percentage into a decimal. For 20%, this is achieved by dividing 20 by 100, resulting in $0.20$.

Next, this decimal is added to $1$. This operation reflects the original price along with the VAT. Thus, we have:

$$
1 + 0.20 = 1.20
$$

The value $1.20$ is known as the multiplier.

Now, you simply multiply the original price by the multiplier. In this case, the original price is £50. Therefore, the calculation is:

$$
£50 \times 1.20 = £60
$$

The result of this multiplication is £60, which represents the total cost inclusive of the 20% VAT.

To summarize the steps involved in this calculation:

1. Convert the VAT percentage to a decimal: $20\%$ becomes $0.20$.
2. Add this decimal to $1$ to obtain the multiplier: $1 + 0.20 = 1.20$.
3. Multiply the original price by the multiplier: $£50 \times 1.20 = £60$.

This method ensures that VAT is accurately added to the original price, resulting in the total amount payable.
