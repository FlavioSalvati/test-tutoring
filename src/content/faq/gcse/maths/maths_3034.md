To create a pie chart that displays percentages, the first step is to calculate the percentage that each category contributes to the total.

**Step 1: Gather Your Data**
Begin by collecting your data and determining the total sum of all values. For example, if you are analyzing the preferences of students for various subjects, add the number of students for each subject to find the total number of students.

**Step 2: Calculate Percentages**
Next, compute the percentage for each category. To do this, divide the value of each category by the total sum and multiply by $100$. For instance, if $30$ students prefer Mathematics out of a total of $100$ students, the percentage for Mathematics can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage for Mathematics} = \left(\frac{30}{100}\right) \times 100 = 30\%
$$

**Step 3: Draw the Pie Chart**
Once you have determined the percentages, you can proceed to draw the pie chart. A pie chart is a circular graphic divided into slices, where each slice represents a different category. The size of each slice corresponds to the percentage of that category.

To accurately represent the slices, use a protractor to measure the angles. Since a full circle encompasses $360$ degrees, convert each percentage into degrees by multiplying by $3.6$. For example, to find the angle for $30\%$, you would calculate:

$$
\text{Angle for Mathematics} = 30 \times 3.6 = 108 \text{ degrees}
$$

**Step 4: Label the Slices**
Finally, label each slice with the corresponding category name and its percentage. This labeling allows viewers to quickly grasp the distribution of data represented in the chart. To enhance clarity and visual appeal, consider using different colors for each slice, which will make the chart easier to read and interpret.
