To calculate the height of a cone using Pythagoras' Theorem, you can apply the following formula:

$$ h = \sqrt{l^2 - r^2} $$

where $h$ represents the height of the cone, $l$ is the slant height, and $r$ is the radius of the base.

Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle. When applied to a cone, consider a vertical cross-section that runs through the apex and the center of the base, resulting in a right-angled triangle. In this triangle, the slant height of the cone acts as the hypotenuse, the radius of the base is one leg, and the height of the cone is the other leg.

To determine the height of the cone, you must know both the slant height ($l$) and the radius ($r$) of the base. According to Pythagoras' Theorem, the square of the hypotenuse (the slant height) equals the sum of the squares of the two other sides (the radius and the height). This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$ l^2 = r^2 + h^2 $$

To isolate the height ($h$), we can rearrange the equation:

$$ h^2 = l^2 - r^2 $$

Taking the square root of both sides yields:

$$ h = \sqrt{l^2 - r^2} $$

Thus, if you have the values for the slant height and the radius of the cone, you can substitute them into this formula to find the height. For instance, if the slant height is $10 \text{ cm}$ and the radius is $6 \text{ cm}$, you would calculate the height as follows:

$$ h = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8 \text{ cm} $$

This method effectively allows you to determine the vertical height of the cone by utilizing the geometric relationship established by the sides of a right-angled triangle.
