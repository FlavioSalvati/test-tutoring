The fraction $\frac{1}{8}$ can be expressed as a decimal, which is $0.125$.

To convert the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$ into a decimal, you perform the division of $1$ by $8$. When you carry out this division, you obtain $0.125$. Therefore, we can say that $1$ divided by $8$ equals $0.125$.

Understanding how to make this conversion is important in many areas of mathematics, including percentages, ratios, and practical applications such as measuring ingredients in recipes or calculating probabilities. For instance, if you have a pizza that you cut into $8$ equal slices, each slice represents $\frac{1}{8}$ of the entire pizza. If you want to express this fraction as a decimal, you would say that each slice is $0.125$ of the whole pizza.

Knowing how to convert fractions to decimals also facilitates the comparison of different quantities. For example, if you have two fractions, $\frac{1}{8}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$, converting them to decimals—$0.125$ and $0.25$, respectively—makes it clear that $\frac{1}{4}$ is twice as large as $\frac{1}{8}$.

In summary, converting $\frac{1}{8}$ to a decimal involves dividing $1$ by $8$, which results in $0.125$. This skill is valuable for various mathematical calculations and real-life scenarios.
