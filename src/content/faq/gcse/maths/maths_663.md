To convert the decimal $0.75$ into a fraction, we can start by expressing it as $\frac{75}{100}$ and then simplify it to $\frac{3}{4}$.

The initial step in converting a decimal to a fraction is to represent the decimal with a denominator of $100$. For the decimal $0.75$, this means we can express it as $\frac{75}{100}$, since $0.75$ indicates $75$ hundredths.

Next, we need to simplify the fraction. Simplifying a fraction involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator, and then dividing both by this common factor. In the case of $75$ and $100$, the GCD is $25$.

To simplify, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by $25$:
$$ 
\frac{75 \div 25}{100 \div 25} = \frac{3}{4} 
$$

Thus, $0.75$ in its simplest fractional form is $\frac{3}{4}$. This method of converting a decimal into a fraction and subsequently simplifying it is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it enhances your understanding of the relationships between different numerical representations.
