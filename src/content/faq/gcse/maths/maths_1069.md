To effectively interpret a 1:50 scale drawing, you need to multiply the measurements shown in the drawing by $50$ to determine the actual dimensions in real life.

A scale drawing serves as a proportional representation of an object or space, either smaller or larger than its true size. In a $1:50$ scale drawing, each unit measured on the drawing corresponds to $50$ units in reality. For instance, if a wall measures $2 \, \text{cm}$ in the drawing, it represents a real wall length of:

$$
2 \, \text{cm} \times 50 = 100 \, \text{cm} \quad \text{(or } 1 \, \text{metre)}
$$

To interpret the drawing accurately, start by identifying the scale, which is typically indicated in the drawing's title block or legend. Next, use a ruler to measure the dimensions on the drawing. To convert these measurements into real-life dimensions, multiply them by the scale factor, which in this case is $50$. For example, if a room measures $4 \, \text{cm}$ by $3 \, \text{cm}$ on the drawing, the actual dimensions of the room would be:

$$
4 \, \text{cm} \times 50 = 200 \, \text{cm} \quad \text{(or } 2 \, \text{metres)}
$$

and 

$$
3 \, \text{cm} \times 50 = 150 \, \text{cm} \quad \text{(or } 1.5 \, \text{metres)}
$$

Understanding how to read scale drawings is essential in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and design, where precise representations of objects and spaces are vital. Regular practice with different scales and conversion of measurements will enhance your ability to interpret these drawings with confidence. Remember, the key principle is to always multiply the drawing's measurements by the scale factor to obtain the corresponding real-life sizes.
