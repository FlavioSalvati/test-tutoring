The expanded form of the expression $2(a + 3)$ is $2a + 6$.

To expand the expression $2(a + 3)$, you'll need to apply the distributive property of multiplication over addition. This property states that for any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, the expression $a(b + c)$ is equivalent to $ab + ac$. In this particular case, the number $2$ is multiplied by each term within the parentheses, which are $a$ and $3$.

To begin the expansion, multiply $2$ by the variable $a$. This results in $2a$. Next, multiply $2$ by the constant $3$, yielding $6$. When you combine these two results, you obtain the expanded expression: 

$$
2a + 6.
$$

This method is crucial in algebra as it aids in simplifying expressions and solving equations. By expanding expressions, you can more readily combine like terms and carry out various algebraic operations. It's important to remember that the distributive property is a foundational concept that will prove invaluable as you tackle more complex problems in your mathematics studies.
