The graph of the function $ y = \tan(x) $ within the interval from $ 0^\circ $ to $ 360^\circ $ features vertical asymptotes at $ 90^\circ $ and $ 270^\circ $.

The tangent function, $ \tan(x) $, is periodic with a period of $ 180^\circ $. This characteristic implies that the graph exhibits a repeating pattern every $ 180^\circ $. Consequently, within the interval from $ 0^\circ $ to $ 360^\circ $, the graph completes two full cycles. It is important to highlight the vertical asymptotes, which occur at points where the function is undefined. Specifically, these asymptotes are located at $ 90^\circ $ and $ 270^\circ $, where the tangent function approaches infinity.

At the angles $ 0^\circ $, $ 180^\circ $, and $ 360^\circ $, the value of $ \tan(x) $ is $ 0 $. In the interval from $ 0^\circ $ to $ 90^\circ $, the graph rises from $ 0 $ to positive infinity. As it approaches $ 90^\circ $, the values of $ \tan(x) $ increase significantly, resulting in a vertical asymptote at $ 90^\circ $. Between $ 90^\circ $ and $ 180^\circ $, the graph descends from negative infinity to $ 0 $. This pattern continues, repeating between $ 180^\circ $ and $ 270^\circ $, as well as from $ 270^\circ $ to $ 360^\circ $.

The graph of $ y = \tan(x) $ maintains continuity within each interval bounded by the asymptotes, although it features discontinuities at the asymptotes themselves. The function is positive in the intervals $ (0^\circ, 90^\circ) $ and $ (180^\circ, 270^\circ) $, while it is negative in the intervals $ (90^\circ, 180^\circ) $ and $ (270^\circ, 360^\circ) $. Familiarity with these key characteristics will aid you in accurately sketching the graph and analyzing its behavior within the specified range.
