To calculate the area of a sector, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
$$

A sector represents a section of a circle, similar to a "slice of pie." The formula for the area of a sector depends on the central angle ($\theta$) expressed in degrees and the radius ($r$) of the circle. The central angle is the angle formed at the center of the circle by the two radii that define the boundaries of the sector.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the formula works: 

- The term $\frac{\theta}{360}$ indicates the fraction of the entire circle that the sector occupies. Since a full circle encompasses $360$ degrees, dividing the central angle by $360$ provides the proportion of the circle represented by the sector.
- To find the area of the sector, this fraction is multiplied by the total area of the circle, given by $\pi r^2$.

For instance, consider a sector with a central angle of $90$ degrees and a radius of $5$ cm. We can substitute these values into the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{90}{360} \times \pi \times 5^2
$$

Next, simplify the fraction:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \times \pi \times 25
$$

Now, multiply the terms:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{25\pi}{4} \approx 19.63 \text{ cm}^2
$$

Thus, the area of the sector is approximately $19.63$ square centimeters. 

It's important to ensure that the units for the radius are consistent and to convert the angle to degrees if it is provided in a different unit.
