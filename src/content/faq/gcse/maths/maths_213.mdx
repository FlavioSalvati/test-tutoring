To create a graph from rainfall data, follow these steps: select an appropriate graph type, label the axes clearly, and accurately plot the data points.

First, determine the type of graph that best represents your data. For rainfall data, a bar chart or a line graph is typically the most effective choice. A bar chart is particularly useful for displaying the amount of rainfall across different months or years, while a line graph effectively illustrates trends over time.

Next, label your axes. The horizontal axis (x-axis) usually represents time, which can be in the form of months or years. The vertical axis (y-axis) denotes the amount of rainfall, typically measured in millimeters ($\text{mm}$). Additionally, provide a descriptive title for your graph, such as "Monthly Rainfall in 2023," to convey the context of the data.

Now, proceed to plot your data points. In the case of a bar chart, draw a bar for each time period, ensuring the height of each bar accurately reflects the corresponding amount of rainfall. For a line graph, plot a point for each time period and connect these points with straight lines. Precision in your measurements is crucial to maintain the accuracy of your graph.

Finally, review your graph for any potential errors. Ensure that all data points are plotted correctly and that your axes are clearly labeled. This attention to detail will enhance the clarity of your graph, making it easier for viewers to understand the rainfall data presented.
