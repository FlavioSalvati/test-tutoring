To determine the measure of an interior angle in a regular pentagon, we can utilize the formula for the interior angles of any regular polygon, given by:

$$
\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
$$

where $n$ represents the number of sides. In the case of a regular pentagon, $n$ is equal to $5$.

To find the interior angle, we first substitute $5$ for $n$ in the formula:

$$
\frac{(5-2) \times 180^\circ}{5}
$$

Next, we simplify the expression within the parentheses:

$$
\frac{3 \times 180^\circ}{5}
$$

Now, we calculate $3 \times 180^\circ$:

$$
\frac{540^\circ}{5}
$$

Finally, we divide $540^\circ$ by $5$:

$$
108^\circ
$$

Thus, each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures $108^\circ$. 

This method is effective because the sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula:

$$
(n-2) \times 180^\circ
$$

For a pentagon, this results in:

$$
(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
$$

Since a regular pentagon has all angles equal, we find the measure of each interior angle by dividing the total sum of the angles by the number of angles (which is $5$). Therefore, each angle is:

$$
\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
$$

In conclusion, each interior angle of a regular pentagon is $108^\circ$.
