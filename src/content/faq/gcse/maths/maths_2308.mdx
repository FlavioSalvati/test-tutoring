The point $(3, -7)$ is located in the fourth quadrant of the Cartesian plane.

To identify the quadrant of a point $(x, y)$ on the Cartesian plane, we examine the signs of its coordinates. The Cartesian plane is divided into four distinct quadrants based on these signs:

1. **First Quadrant**: Both coordinates are positive, i.e., $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.
2. **Second Quadrant**: The $x$ coordinate is negative while the $y$ coordinate is positive, i.e., $x < 0$ and $y > 0$.
3. **Third Quadrant**: Both coordinates are negative, i.e., $x < 0$ and $y < 0$.
4. **Fourth Quadrant**: The $x$ coordinate is positive, and the $y$ coordinate is negative, i.e., $x > 0$ and $y < 0$.

For the specific point $(3, -7)$, the $x$ coordinate is $3$, which is positive, while the $y$ coordinate is $-7$, which is negative. According to the definitions above, a point with a positive $x$ coordinate and a negative $y$ coordinate resides in the fourth quadrant.

Visualizing the Cartesian plane can further aid understanding. The plane is divided by the $x$-axis (horizontal) and the $y$-axis (vertical). The fourth quadrant is situated in the bottom-right section of this plane, where all points with positive $x$ values and negative $y$ values are found. Therefore, by analyzing the signs of the coordinates, we can confidently conclude that the point $(3, -7)$ is indeed located in the fourth quadrant.
