To compare the ranges of two data sets, you need to subtract the smallest value from the largest value in each set.

The range of a data set serves as a measure of the spread or variability of its values. To calculate the range, start by identifying the smallest and largest values within the data set. The range is then determined by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. For example, consider a data set with the values $3$, $7$, $8$, $2$, and $10$. Here, the smallest value is $2$ and the largest value is $10$. Thus, the range can be calculated as:

$$
10 - 2 = 8.
$$

After calculating the ranges for both data sets, you can compare them directly. A larger range indicates that a data set is more spread out, whereas a smaller range suggests that the values are closer together. For instance, if one data set has a range of $15$ and another has a range of $5$, it is evident that the first data set is more spread out than the second.

Comparing ranges allows you to gain insights into the variability of different data sets. This can be particularly useful in various contexts, such as comparing test scores, temperatures, or any other measurements. However, it is important to remember that while the range provides a quick indication of spread, it does not convey information about the distribution of values within the data set. For a more comprehensive analysis, you might also want to consider additional measures such as the interquartile range or standard deviation.
