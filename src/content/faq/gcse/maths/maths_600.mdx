To create a bar chart that displays grouped data, it's essential to use different colors for the bars representing each group within every category.

**Step 1: Gather and Organize Your Data**  
Begin by collecting your data and organizing it into distinct categories and groups. For instance, if you are comparing the favorite fruits of boys and girls in a class, your categories could be various fruits such as apples, bananas, and oranges, while your groups would consist of boys and girls.

**Step 2: Draw the Axes**  
Next, draw your axes. The horizontal axis (x-axis) will represent the categories (i.e., different fruits), while the vertical axis (y-axis) will indicate the frequency or count (the number of boys and girls who like each fruit). Be sure to label both axes clearly to enhance comprehension.

**Step 3: Create the Bars**  
For each category, draw bars adjacent to one another for each group. For example, under the category 'apples', you would draw one bar for boys and another bar for girls, positioned side by side. Utilize distinct colors or patterns to differentiate between the groups, which facilitates easier visual comparison of the data.

**Step 4: Maintain Consistency**  
Ensure that all bars are of equal width and spaced evenly apart. The height of each bar should accurately reflect the frequency or count for that specific group within the category. For instance, if $10$ boys and $15$ girls prefer apples, the height of the boys' bar will reach $10$ units, while the girls' bar will reach $15$ units.

**Step 5: Add a Key or Legend**  
Finally, include a key or legend to clarify what each color or pattern represents. This addition will help anyone reviewing the chart quickly understand which bars correspond to which groups, enhancing the overall clarity of your presentation.
