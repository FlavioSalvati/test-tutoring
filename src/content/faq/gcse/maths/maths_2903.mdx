The expression for the resultant vector of vectors $p$ and $q$ can be represented as:

$$ \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q} $$

In vector mathematics, the resultant vector is defined as the vector that emerges from the addition of two or more vectors. When you have two vectors, $p$ and $q$, you can determine their resultant vector, $\mathbf{r}$, by adding their corresponding components. For instance, if $\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (q_1, q_2)$, then the resultant vector can be calculated as:

$$ \mathbf{r} = (p_1 + q_1, p_2 + q_2) $$

To visualize this process, consider two arrows that represent the vectors $p$ and $q$. You can place the tail of vector $q$ at the head of vector $p$. The arrow that extends from the tail of $p$ to the head of $q$ represents the resultant vector $\mathbf{r}$. This technique is referred to as the "tip-to-tail" method.

For a more concrete example, if we have vectors in two dimensions where $\mathbf{p} = (3, 4)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (1, 2)$, then the resultant vector $\mathbf{r}$ can be calculated as follows:

$$ \mathbf{r} = (3 + 1, 4 + 2) = (4, 6) $$

This means that if you move 3 units to the right and 4 units up (representing vector $\mathbf{p}$), followed by moving 1 unit to the right and 2 units up (representing vector $\mathbf{q}$), you will arrive at the point $(4, 6)$, which corresponds to the resultant vector $\mathbf{r}$.

Understanding how to add vectors is essential in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it plays a critical role in analyzing forces, velocities, and other vector quantities.
