The metric unit used for measuring area is the square metre, denoted as $m^2$.

In the metric system, the square metre ($m^2$) serves as the standard unit for area measurement. This unit is derived from the metre, which is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). When measuring the area of a surface, you are essentially determining how many square metres it encompasses. For instance, if you have a square where each side measures $1$ metre, the area of that square is $1$ square metre, or $1\,m^2$.

For larger areas, you might use units such as square kilometres ($km^2$), where $1\,km^2$ is equivalent to $1,000,000\,m^2$. Conversely, for smaller areas, you might employ square centimetres ($cm^2$) or square millimetres ($mm^2$). Specifically, one square centimetre ($1\,cm^2$) equals $0.0001\,m^2$, and one square millimetre ($1\,mm^2$) equals $0.000001\,m^2$. These smaller units are particularly useful when dealing with tiny surfaces, such as those of a postage stamp or a small electronic component.

Understanding how to convert between these units is essential for various real-world applications. For example, when designing a garden, you may measure the area in square metres to determine how much turf is needed. Similarly, architects and engineers frequently use square metres to calculate the area of floors, walls, and other surfaces within buildings.

In summary, the square metre ($m^2$) is the primary metric unit for measuring area, with additional units such as square kilometres, square centimetres, and square millimetres employed for different scales of measurement.
