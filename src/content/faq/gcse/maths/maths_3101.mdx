The width of each bar in a histogram represents the range of data values within that specific interval.

In a histogram, data is organized into intervals, commonly referred to as bins or classes. The width of each bar corresponds to the size of these intervals. For instance, if you are analyzing the ages of a group of individuals and decide to use intervals of $5$ years, one bar could represent ages $0-4$, the next $5-9$, and so on. In this case, the width of each bar would encompass these $5$-year ranges.

The choice of interval width can significantly impact both the appearance and interpretation of the histogram. If the intervals are excessively wide, important details regarding the data distribution may be obscured. Conversely, if the intervals are too narrow, the histogram may become cluttered and challenging to read. Therefore, selecting an appropriate interval width is essential for accurately representing the data.

In some histograms, particularly those that deal with continuous data, the intervals may not all have the same width. In such instances, the height of the bars is adjusted to reflect the frequency density, ensuring that the area of each bar accurately represents the number of data points within that interval. This approach is particularly useful when working with data that is unevenly distributed.

Understanding the width of each bar allows for a better interpretation of the histogram, enabling you to observe how data is distributed across various ranges and to identify patterns or trends within the dataset.
