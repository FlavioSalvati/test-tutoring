To determine the number of vertices in a solid shape, you should count the distinct points where the edges converge.

A vertex (plural: vertices) is defined as a point where two or more edges of a solid shape intersect. The method used to find the number of vertices may vary depending on the type of solid you are examining. For common polyhedra, such as cubes, pyramids, and prisms, you can often rely on established formulas or properties.

For instance, a cube has $8$ vertices. This is due to the fact that it has $6$ faces, each of which is a square, and each corner of the cube serves as a vertex where three edges meet. Similarly, a triangular prism features $6$ vertices, as it is comprised of two triangular bases connected by three rectangular faces.

For more complex shapes, you may need to apply Euler's formula, which connects the number of vertices ($V$), edges ($E$), and faces ($F$) of a polyhedron with the equation:

$$
V - E + F = 2.
$$

By knowing the number of edges and faces, you can rearrange this formula to solve for the number of vertices.

When dealing with irregular or less common shapes, it can be beneficial to create a diagram and label each vertex to ensure an accurate count. Keep in mind that practice with various shapes will enhance your ability to identify and count vertices effectively.
