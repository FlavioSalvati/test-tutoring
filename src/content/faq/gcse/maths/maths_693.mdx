To divide a decimal by a whole number, it is important to align the decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the dividend.

When performing the division of a decimal by a whole number, begin by setting up the problem as you would with whole numbers. Place the decimal number (the dividend) inside the division bracket and the whole number (the divisor) outside. Start the division from the leftmost digit of the dividend. If the divisor does not fit into the first digit, move to the next digit, considering the first and second digits together.

As you carry out the division, ensure that you bring the decimal point straight up into the quotient (the result) directly above its position in the dividend. This practice guarantees the correct placement of the decimal point in your final answer. Continue the division process as you would with whole numbers, bringing down additional digits from the dividend as necessary.

For example, if you need to divide $4.56$ by $3$, you would set it up as $4.56 \div 3$. Start by determining how many times $3$ fits into $4$, which is $1$ time. Write $1$ above the $4$ in the quotient. Next, multiply $1$ by $3$ to get $3$, and subtract this from $4$, leaving you with $1$. Bring down the next digit, $5$, making it $15$. Now, determine how many times $3$ fits into $15$, which is $5$ times. Write $5$ in the quotient. Multiply $5$ by $3$ to obtain $15$, subtract to get $0$, and bring down the next digit, $6$. Finally, $3$ fits into $6$ exactly $2$ times. Write $2$ in the quotient. Thus, the final answer is $1.52$.

In summary, the key to successfully dividing a decimal by a whole number is to keep the decimal point aligned and to proceed with the division just as you would with whole numbers.
