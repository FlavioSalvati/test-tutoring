The exact value of $\tan 60^\circ$ is $\sqrt{3}$.

To find the exact value of $\tan 60^\circ$, we can employ the properties of special triangles, specifically the $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle. In this type of triangle, the lengths of the sides adhere to a specific ratio: the side opposite the $30^\circ$ angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, while the side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter side. The hypotenuse itself is twice the length of the shorter side.

Let’s consider a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle where the shorter side (opposite the $30^\circ$ angle) measures $1$ unit. Consequently, the hypotenuse will measure $2$ units, and the longer side (opposite the $60^\circ$ angle) will measure $\sqrt{3}$ units. 

The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. 

For $\tan 60^\circ$, the opposite side corresponds to the longer side, which is $\sqrt{3}$ units, while the adjacent side corresponds to the shorter side, which is $1$ unit. Thus, we have:

$$
\tan 60^\circ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3}.
$$

This approach relies on a solid understanding of the properties of the $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, a fundamental concept in trigonometry. By memorizing these side ratios, you can easily determine the exact values of trigonometric functions for these special angles.
