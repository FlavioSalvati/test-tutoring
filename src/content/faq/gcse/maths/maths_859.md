The expression $ 8z - 4z + 10 $ simplifies to $ 4z + 10 $.

To simplify $ 8z - 4z + 10 $, we begin by combining like terms. Like terms are those that contain the same variable raised to the same power. In this case, $ 8z $ and $ 4z $ are like terms, as they both include the variable $ z $.

We start by subtracting $ 4z $ from $ 8z $:
$$
8z - 4z = 4z
$$

After this operation, we are left with:
$$
4z + 10
$$

Since there are no additional like terms to combine, the expression is already in its simplest form. The constant term $ 10 $ remains unchanged, as it does not have a variable associated with it.

Thus, the simplified form of the expression $ 8z - 4z + 10 $ is $ 4z + 10 $. This technique of combining like terms is a fundamental skill in algebra, making expressions more manageable and easier to understand.
