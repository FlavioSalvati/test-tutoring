The formula for calculating the diagonal of a rectangular prism is given by 

$$
D = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}.
$$

To better understand this formula, let's break it down step by step. A rectangular prism, also known as a cuboid, has three dimensions: length ($l$), width ($w$), and height ($h$). The diagonal we are calculating is the longest line that can be drawn from one corner of the prism to the opposite corner, traversing through the interior of the prism.

First, let's consider the base of the prism, which is shaped like a rectangle. The diagonal of this rectangle can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem. For a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$, the diagonal $d_1$ of the base is calculated as follows:

$$
d_1 = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}.
$$

Next, envision this diagonal $d_1$ as one side of a right triangle, where the height $h$ of the prism serves as the other perpendicular side. To find the diagonal $D$ of the entire prism, we apply the Pythagorean theorem once more:

$$
D = \sqrt{d_1^2 + h^2}.
$$

By substituting our expression for $d_1$ into this equation, we arrive at:

$$
D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{l^2 + w^2})^2 + h^2}.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
D = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}.
$$

Thus, the formula 

$$
D = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
$$ 

enables you to calculate the diagonal of a rectangular prism by taking into account the contributions of all three dimensions. This formula is a direct application of the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions, making it a valuable tool for solving problems related to three-dimensional shapes.
