The sequence $0, 2, 6, 12$ follows a distinct pattern where each term represents the sum of consecutive even numbers.

To delve deeper into this sequence, letâ€™s examine each term and its composition. The first term is $0$, which can be interpreted as the sum of zero even numbers. The second term is $2$, the first even number. The third term, $6$, is the sum of the first two even numbers: $2 + 4$. The fourth term, $12$, results from adding the first three even numbers together: $2 + 4 + 6$.

To generalize this pattern, we can state that the $n$th term of the sequence is the sum of the first $n$ even numbers. Mathematically, the $n$th even number is represented as $2n$. Consequently, the $n$th term of the sequence is the sum of the series $2, 4, 6, 8,$ and so forth.

We can employ the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to determine the $n$th term. The sum of the first $n$ even numbers is given by the formula:

$$ S = n(n + 1) $$

For instance, when $n = 3$, the sum is computed as:

$$ S = 3(3 + 1) = 3 \times 4 = 12 $$

This result aligns perfectly with our sequence.

In conclusion, the sequence $0, 2, 6, 12$ adheres to the pattern where each term is the sum of the first $n$ even numbers, and this can be calculated using the formula $n(n + 1)$.
