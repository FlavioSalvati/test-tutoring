The image of a shape after being enlarged by a scale factor of $0.5$ results in a smaller, yet similar shape.

When you enlarge a shape by a scale factor of $0.5$, each side of the shape is reduced to half its original length. Consequently, the new shape will retain the same proportions and angles as the original, but it will be smaller in scale. For instance, if you begin with a square that has side lengths of $4 \, \text{cm}$, after applying a scale factor of $0.5$, each side will measure $2 \, \text{cm}$.

In mathematical terms, a scale factor of $0.5$ indicates that every dimension of the original shape is multiplied by $0.5$. This reduction impacts not only the lengths of the sides but also the area of the shape. The area of the new shape will be one-quarter of the original area, as area scales with the square of the scale factor: 

$$
(0.5)^2 = 0.25.
$$

Thus, if the original shape has an area of $16 \, \text{cm}^2$, the area of the new shape will be $4 \, \text{cm}^2$.

It is crucial to understand that while the size of the shape changes, the angles within the shape remain unchanged. This property is what defines the new shape as "similar" to the original. Similar shapes share the same angles and proportional side lengths, even though their overall sizes differ. This concept is fundamental in various fields of geometry and is essential for grasping how shapes can be transformed while preserving their inherent characteristics.
