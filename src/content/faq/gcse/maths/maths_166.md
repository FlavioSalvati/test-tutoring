Let's enhance the clarity and readability of your content while ensuring proper mathematical formatting.

In the equation 

$$ n + 6 = 10, $$ 

the variable $ n $ represents the unknown number that, when combined with 6, results in 10.

To determine the value of $ n $, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. This process is known as solving the equation. We begin with the original equation:

$$ n + 6 = 10. $$

To isolate $ n $, we must eliminate the 6 that is added to it. We can achieve this by performing the inverse operation, which is subtraction. Therefore, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

$$ n + 6 - 6 = 10 - 6. $$

This simplifies to:

$$ n = 4. $$

Thus, we find that $ n $ is equal to 4. This indicates that the unknown number $ n $ is indeed 4, because when we add 4 to 6, the sum is 10.

In algebra, the variable $ n $ is frequently used to represent an unknown value that we need to calculate. The equation 

$$ n + 6 = 10 $$ 

is a straightforward linear equation, and solving it involves basic arithmetic operations. By mastering the technique of manipulating equations to isolate $ n $, you can successfully determine the value of the unknown number. This skill is fundamental in algebra and will prove invaluable as you advance to more complex equations in your mathematics studies.
