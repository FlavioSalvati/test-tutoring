The solution to the equation $\sin(x) = -1$ within the interval from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$ is $x = 270^\circ$.

To clarify why this is the case, let’s revisit the concept of the sine function. The function $\sin(x)$ represents the $y$-coordinate of a point located on the unit circle. The unit circle is defined as a circle with a radius of $1$, centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. As you traverse around the circle, the sine of an angle corresponds to the vertical distance from the $x$-axis to the point on the circle.

The sine function attains its minimum value of $-1$ at a specific point on the unit circle. This occurs at the angle $x = 270^\circ$, which points directly downward from the center of the circle. At this position, the $y$-coordinate is $-1$, which gives us the result $\sin(270^\circ) = -1$.

You can also derive this solution by considering the properties of the sine function. The sine function is periodic, with a period of $360^\circ$, meaning it repeats its values every $360^\circ$. Within a single cycle, from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$, the sine function reaches the value of $-1$ only once, specifically at $270^\circ$.

In conclusion, the sole angle between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ for which $\sin(x) = -1$ is at $x = 270^\circ$. This is an essential point to keep in mind when solving trigonometric equations involving the sine function within a given interval.
