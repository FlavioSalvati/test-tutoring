To calculate the volume of a rectangular prism, you need to multiply its length, width, and height together.

In this example, we have a rectangular prism with the following dimensions: a length of $7 \, \text{cm}$, a width of $3 \, \text{cm}$, and a height of $2 \, \text{cm}$. The formula for the volume $V$ of a rectangular prism is given by:

$$
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
$$

Now, let's substitute the provided dimensions into the formula:

$$
V = 7 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} \times 2 \, \text{cm}
$$

First, we will calculate the product of the length and the width:

$$
7 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 21 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Next, we will multiply the result by the height:

$$
21 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 2 \, \text{cm} = 42 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

Thus, the volume of the rectangular prism is $42 \, \text{cm}^3$. This indicates that the prism can contain $42 \, \text{cm}^3$ of space within it. Remember that volume is always expressed in cubic units; in this case, we use cubic centimetres (cmÂ³) because volume quantifies three-dimensional space.
