To calculate the relative frequency of rolling a 4 on a die, you need to divide the number of times a 4 is rolled by the total number of rolls.

Relative frequency is a statistical measure that indicates how often a specific event occurs compared to the total number of trials. When rolling a fair six-sided die, each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) has an equal probability of landing face up. To determine the relative frequency of rolling a 4, you must conduct an experiment where you roll the die multiple times and record the results.

For instance, suppose you roll the die $50$ times and keep track of how many times each number appears. If the number $4$ shows up $8$ times in those $50$ rolls, you can calculate the relative frequency by dividing the number of times you rolled a $4$ by the total number of rolls. In this scenario, the calculation would be:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{8}{50} = 0.16
$$

This result can also be expressed as $16\%$.

Relative frequency can be represented in various forms: as a fraction, a decimal, or a percentage. This measure provides insight into the likelihood of an event based on experimental data. As you increase the number of rolls, the relative frequency will tend to converge towards the theoretical probability. For rolling a $4$ on a fair die, the theoretical probability is given by:

$$
\frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167 \text{ (or } 16.7\%\text{)}
$$

It's important to note that relative frequency is particularly beneficial in real-life situations where theoretical probabilities may not be applicable or reliable. It offers a practical assessment based on actual outcomes, making it a valuable tool for understanding probabilities in everyday scenarios.
