To determine the angle at the center of a circle, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{angle} = \left( \frac{\text{arc length}}{\text{circumference}} \right) \times 360^\circ.
$$

The angle at the center of a circle is defined as the angle formed by two radii that extend from the center to the circumference. To calculate this angle, you must know two key measurements: the arc length (the distance along the curved portion of the circle) and the circumference (the total distance around the circle).

To find the angle, follow these steps:

1. **Measure the Arc Length**: This is the length of the curved edge of the circle between the two radii.
2. **Calculate the Circumference**: Use the formula:
   $$
   \text{circumference} = 2\pi r,
   $$
   where $r$ is the radius of the circle.
3. **Calculate the Fraction**: Divide the arc length by the circumference to determine the fraction of the circle that the arc represents:
   $$
   \text{fraction} = \frac{\text{arc length}}{\text{circumference}}.
   $$
4. **Convert to Angle**: Multiply this fraction by $360^\circ$ to obtain the central angle.

For example, if the arc length is $5 \, \text{cm}$ and the circumference is $20 \, \text{cm}$, the fraction of the circle is:

$$
\frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4}.
$$

Multiplying this fraction by $360^\circ$ yields a central angle of:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 360^\circ = 90^\circ.
$$

This method allows you to accurately determine the central angle using the arc length and the total circumference of the circle.
