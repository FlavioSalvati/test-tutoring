The variance of the data set consisting of the numbers $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and $10$ is $8$.

To calculate the variance, we start by determining the mean (average) of the data set. The mean is calculated by summing all the values and then dividing by the total number of values. For the data set $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and $10$, the sum is:

$$
2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30.
$$

Since there are $5$ values in the data set, we find the mean as follows:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{30}{5} = 6.
$$

Next, we compute the squared differences between each number and the mean. The differences are calculated as follows:

- For $2$: $2 - 6 = -4$
- For $4$: $4 - 6 = -2$
- For $6$: $6 - 6 = 0$
- For $8$: $8 - 6 = 2$
- For $10$: $10 - 6 = 4$

Now, we square each of these differences:

- $(-4)^2 = 16$
- $(-2)^2 = 4$
- $0^2 = 0$
- $2^2 = 4$
- $4^2 = 16$

Next, we sum these squared differences:

$$
16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 40.
$$

Finally, to calculate the variance, we divide this total by the number of values in the data set. With $5$ numbers, the variance is given by:

$$
\text{Variance} = \frac{40}{5} = 8.
$$

Thus, the variance of the data set $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and $10$ is $8$. This value indicates the extent to which the numbers in the data set deviate from the mean.
