The volume of a cube with a side length of $2.5 \, \text{cm}$ is $15.625 \, \text{cm}^3$.

To find the volume of a cube, you can use the formula:

$$
V = a^3
$$

where $ V $ denotes the volume and $ a $ is the length of one side of the cube. In this case, the side length $ a $ is $2.5 \, \text{cm}$.

The calculation involves cubing the side length, which means you multiply the side length by itself three times:

$$
2.5 \times 2.5 \times 2.5
$$

Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, multiply $2.5$ by $2.5$:

$$
2.5 \times 2.5 = 6.25
$$

2. Next, take the result and multiply it by $2.5$ again:

$$
6.25 \times 2.5 = 15.625
$$

Thus, the volume of the cube is $15.625 \, \text{cm}^3$.

It is important to remember that cubing a number gives you the volume of a space represented by that number when used as the length of each side of a cube. Consequently, the units of volume are expressed in cubic centimeters ($\text{cm}^3$) in this scenario.

Understanding how to calculate the volume of a cube is a fundamental skill in geometry and has practical applications in various fields, such as determining the capacity of a container or calculating the amount of material needed to build a cubic structure.
