Exponential growth in mathematics refers to a situation where a quantity increases by a fixed percentage over equal time intervals.

More specifically, exponential growth occurs when the rate of increase of a quantity is proportional to its current size. This implies that as the quantity grows, the rate at which it grows also accelerates. A classic example of exponential growth is the population dynamics of organisms, such as bacteria, which can double in size at regular intervals under optimal conditions.

The general formula for exponential growth is given by:

$$ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t $$

where:
- $ P(t) $ represents the amount of the quantity at time $ t $,
- $ P_0 $ denotes the initial amount of the quantity,
- $ r $ is the growth rate (expressed as a decimal),
- $ t $ signifies the time period.

For example, if you begin with $ 100 $ bacteria and they double every hour, after $ 1 $ hour, you would have $ 200 $ bacteria. After $ 2 $ hours, the population would increase to $ 400 $, and this trend continues. This rapid escalation is a hallmark of exponential growth.

In graphical representations, exponential growth is depicted by a curve that starts off slowly and then rises sharply. This contrasts with linear growth, where the increase remains constant, resulting in a straight line graph.

Understanding exponential growth is crucial across various disciplines, including biology, finance, and computer science, as it provides insights into how rapidly quantities can change over time.
