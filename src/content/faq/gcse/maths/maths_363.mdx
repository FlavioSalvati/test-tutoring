Alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines are always equal.

When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, alternate interior angles are created on opposite sides of the transversal but within the confines of the parallel lines. These angles are congruent, meaning they have the same measure. This property is a fundamental characteristic of parallel lines and is frequently utilized in geometric proofs and problem-solving.

To visualize this concept, consider two parallel lines, which we will refer to as Line A and Line B, along with a third line, the transversal, that crosses them. The points where the transversal intersects the parallel lines generate four angles at each intersection. The alternate interior angles are specifically the pairs of angles located between the parallel lines, situated on opposite sides of the transversal. For example, if the transversal intersects Line A at point $P$ and Line B at point $Q$, the angles formed at points $P$ and $Q$ that lie on opposite sides of the transversal and within the parallel lines are identified as alternate interior angles.

This property is particularly useful in various geometric problems. For instance, if you know the measure of one alternate interior angle, you can immediately deduce the measure of its corresponding angle. This ability to ascertain unknown angles is invaluable in more complex geometric scenarios and in demonstrating that two lines are parallel. Grasping this concept is essential for solving many types of problems in GCSE Maths, particularly those involving parallel lines and transversals.
