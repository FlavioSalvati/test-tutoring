To determine the magnitude of the vector $(-16, -30)$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. The magnitude of a vector represents its length and is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

where $ (x, y) $ are the coordinates of the vector. For our specific vector $(-16, -30)$, we can proceed step by step.

First, we square each component of the vector. For the x-component $-16$, squaring it yields:

$$
(-16)^2 = 256.
$$

Next, we square the y-component $-30$:

$$
(-30)^2 = 900.
$$

Now, we sum these squared values:

$$
256 + 900 = 1156.
$$

Finally, we take the square root of this sum to find the magnitude:

$$
\sqrt{1156} = 34.
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(-16, -30)$ is $34$. This method can be applied to any vector in two dimensions, allowing you to understand the distance from the origin to the point defined by the vector.
