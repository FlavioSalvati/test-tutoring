To determine the solutions to the equation $ y = x^2 - x - 6 $ graphically, we will focus on finding the x-intercepts of the corresponding parabola.

The solutions to the equation $ y = x^2 - x - 6 $ are the x-values at which the graph intersects the x-axis. These points are commonly referred to as the roots or zeros of the equation.

To begin, plot the quadratic equation $ y = x^2 - x - 6 $ on a coordinate plane. This equation describes a parabola, which has a characteristic U-shaped curve. To accurately graph it, create a table of values by substituting various x-values into the equation to calculate their corresponding y-values. For instance, when $ x = -2 $:

$$
y = (-2)^2 - (-2) - 6 = 4 + 2 - 6 = 0
$$

Continue this process for several additional x-values to gain a comprehensive understanding of the parabola's shape.

Once you have your table of values, use these points to sketch the parabola on your graph. The x-intercepts are identified as the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis, which occurs when $ y = 0 $. For the equation $ y = x^2 - x - 6 $, you will observe that the parabola crosses the x-axis at $ x = -2 $ and $ x = 3 $. Thus, the solutions to the equation are $ x = -2 $ and $ x = 3 $.

By pinpointing these x-intercepts on the graph, you successfully find the solutions to the quadratic equation through graphical analysis.
