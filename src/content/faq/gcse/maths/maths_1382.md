To determine the angles that satisfy the equation $\tan(x) = -1$, we identify the general solutions as follows:

$$
x = 135^\circ + 180^\circ n \quad \text{or} \quad x = -45^\circ + 180^\circ n
$$

where $n$ is any integer (which can be positive, negative, or zero).

When working with trigonometric functions such as the tangent, it is essential to recognize their periodic nature. The tangent function repeats its values at regular intervals, specifically every $180^\circ$. This characteristic means that once we find one angle that satisfies our equation, we can generate additional solutions by adding or subtracting multiples of $180^\circ$.

The equation $\tan(x) = -1$ indicates we are looking for angles where the tangent value is $-1$. The tangent function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. We know that the reference angle corresponding to $\tan(x) = 1$ is $45^\circ$. Consequently, the angles in the second and fourth quadrants where the tangent equals $-1$ are:

- In the second quadrant: $180^\circ - 45^\circ = 135^\circ$
- In the fourth quadrant: $360^\circ - 45^\circ = -45^\circ$

To find all possible angles that satisfy the equation, we again utilize the periodicity of the tangent function. This leads us to the general solutions:

- For the second quadrant: 
  $$
  x = 135^\circ + 180^\circ n
  $$

- For the fourth quadrant:
  $$
  x = -45^\circ + 180^\circ n
  $$

By substituting different integer values for $n$, you can generate an infinite number of angles that satisfy the equation $\tan(x) = -1$.
