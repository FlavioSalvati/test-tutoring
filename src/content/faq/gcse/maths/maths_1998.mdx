When £150 is divided equally among 3 people, each person will receive £50.

To perform this equal division, we need to use basic arithmetic division, one of the four fundamental operations in mathematics, alongside addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In this scenario, we will divide the total amount of £150 by the number of people, which is 3.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Set Up the Division**: Begin by writing down the total amount (£150) and the number of people (3). This can be expressed as the equation: 
   $$ 
   150 \div 3 
   $$

2. **Perform the Division**: Next, we divide £150 by 3. This involves determining how many times 3 can fit into 150.

3. **Calculate**: First, we consider how many times 3 fits into 15. Since $3 \times 5 = 15$, we find that 3 goes into 15 five times. After this step, we bring down the next digit, which is 0. Consequently, we see that 3 fits into 150 a total of 50 times, as $3 \times 50 = 150$.

Thus, each person receives £50. This method guarantees that everyone shares the total amount equally. Mastering division is a crucial mathematical skill that is widely applicable in everyday situations, such as fairly distributing money, resources, or time.
