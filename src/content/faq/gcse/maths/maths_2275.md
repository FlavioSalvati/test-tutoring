A relation is classified as a function if each input corresponds to exactly one output.

To determine if a relation qualifies as a function, you must verify that every input value, often referred to as the domain, is linked to a single output value, known as the range. This stipulation implies that for every $x$-value, there should be only one associated $y$-value. If any $x$-value corresponds to multiple $y$-values, then the relation cannot be considered a function.

One effective method to check this is by employing the "Vertical Line Test" on a graph. To perform this test, draw vertical lines through the graph of the relation. If any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, the relation is not a function. This occurrence indicates that a single $x$-value is associated with multiple $y$-values.

Alternatively, you can analyze a set of ordered pairs. For instance, consider the pairs $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, and $(1, 4)$. In this case, the input $1$ is linked to both $2$ and $4$, which means the relation is not a function. Conversely, if the pairs were $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, and $(3, 4)$, each input would have a unique output, thereby confirming that it is indeed a function.

Understanding whether a relation is a function is vital in various branches of mathematics, as functions possess specific properties and behaviors that are essential for solving equations and modeling real-world scenarios.
