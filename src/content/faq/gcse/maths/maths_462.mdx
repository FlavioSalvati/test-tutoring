The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(C)
$$

To better understand this formula, let's break it down. In this equation, $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of two sides of the triangle, while $C$ represents the angle formed between those two sides. The sine function, denoted as $\sin$, is a trigonometric function that connects an angle to the ratio of the length of the opposite side to that of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. Interestingly, this function can also be applied to non-right-angled triangles to determine their area.

Consider a triangle with sides $a$ and $b$, along with the angle $C$ between them. By employing the formula 

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(C),
$$

you are effectively calculating the area of a parallelogram that is formed by duplicating the triangle and then dividing the result in half, since a triangle is essentially half of a parallelogram.

For instance, letâ€™s say you have a triangle where $a = 5 \, \text{cm}$, $b = 7 \, \text{cm}$, and the angle $C = 30^\circ$ between these sides. You can determine the area as follows:

1. First, calculate $\sin(30^\circ)$, which equals $0.5$.
2. Next, substitute the values into the formula: 

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 7 \times 0.5.
$$

3. This expression simplifies to 

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 35 \times 0.5 = 8.75 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

This method is particularly advantageous when you do not have the height of the triangle but are aware of the lengths of two sides and the included angle. It serves as a valuable tool in your GCSE Maths toolkit!
