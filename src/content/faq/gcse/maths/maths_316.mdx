To construct a perpendicular bisector, you can utilize a compass and straightedge to identify and connect the midpoint of a line segment.

Begin with the line segment that you want to bisect. Place the point of the compass on one endpoint of the line segment and draw an arc above and below the line. Without altering the compass width, repeat this process from the other endpoint of the line segment. You should now observe two pairs of arcs that intersect at points located both above and below the line.

Next, employ a straightedge to draw a line through the intersection points of the arcs. This line is the perpendicular bisector of the original line segment. It will intersect the original segment at a right angle ($90^\circ$) and divide it into two equal parts.

This method ensures accuracy since the arcs created with the compass are equidistant from the endpoints of the line segment. This guarantees that the bisector is not only perpendicular but also passes through the midpoint. This technique is fundamental in geometry and is frequently used in various constructions and proofs.
