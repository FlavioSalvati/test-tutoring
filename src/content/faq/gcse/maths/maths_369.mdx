To apply the tangent-chord angle theorem effectively, start by identifying both the tangent line and the chord. Then, utilize the theorem to determine the angle of interest.

The tangent-chord angle theorem states that the angle formed between a tangent to a circle and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment of the circle. To implement this theorem, first pinpoint the tangent line and the chord that intersect at a specific point on the circle, known as the point of tangency.

Next, locate the angle created between the tangent and the chord. This angle, which we will refer to as $\angle TAB$, is the primary focus of your analysis. According to the theorem, this angle is equal to the angle that lies in the alternate segment of the circle. The alternate segment is defined as the area of the circle that is opposite the chord. The angle in this segment is formed by drawing lines from the endpoints of the chord to another point on the circumference of the circle.

For instance, consider a circle with a tangent at point $A$ and a chord $AB$. The angle between the tangent and the chord, $\angle TAB$, is equal to the angle subtended by the chord $AB$ at the opposite side of the circle, which we will denote as $\angle ACB$. By identifying these angles, you can apply the tangent-chord angle theorem to solve various problems in circle geometry, such as determining unknown angles or demonstrating the equality of two angles.
