The fourth root of $81$ is $3$.

To find the fourth root of $81$, we need to identify a number that, when multiplied by itself four times, equals $81$. This can be expressed mathematically as $ \sqrt[4]{81} $.

First, letâ€™s examine the prime factorization of $81$. The number $81$ can be expressed as the product of its prime factors: 

$$ 81 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 $$ 

or, more concisely, 

$$ 81 = 3^4. $$

Since $81$ is equal to $3^4$, calculating the fourth root of $3^4$ is quite straightforward. The fourth root of $3^4$ is simply $3$, because 

$$ 3^1 = 3. $$

In other words, we can write:

$$ \sqrt[4]{81} = \sqrt[4]{3^4} = 3. $$

To confirm this result, we can multiply $3$ by itself four times: 

$$ 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81. $$ 

Thus, we can conclude that the fourth root of $81$ is indeed $3$.
