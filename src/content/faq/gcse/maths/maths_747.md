To determine the bounds for the number $123.45$ when rounded to two decimal places, we need to identify both the smallest and largest possible values that would round to this figure.

When rounding a number to two decimal places, we focus on the hundredths place. In the case of $123.45$, the digit in the hundredths place is $5$. To find the bounds, we must establish the minimum and maximum values that would still round to $123.45$.

The smallest number that rounds to $123.45$ is $123.445$. Any number less than $123.445$ would round down to $123.44$. Thus, $123.445$ serves as the lower bound.

Conversely, the largest number that rounds to $123.45$ is $123.454999...$, where the nines continue indefinitely. Any value greater than $123.454999...$ would round up to $123.46$. For practical purposes, we can approximate this upper bound as $123.455$, but it is important to note that it is actually infinitesimally less than this value.

In summary, the bounds for $123.45$ when rounded to two decimal places are $123.445$ (inclusive) and just below $123.455$. This means that any number within this range, when rounded to two decimal places, will yield $123.45$.
