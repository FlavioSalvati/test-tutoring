To determine the roots of the quadratic equation $y = x^2 - 4x + 4$ graphically, we need to identify the points where the graph intersects the x-axis.

Begin by plotting the equation $y = x^2 - 4x + 4$ on a coordinate plane. This equation describes a parabola. The roots of the equation correspond to the x-values where the graph crosses the x-axis, which occurs when $y = 0$.

Start by creating a table of values for both $x$ and $y$. Select a range of $x$ values, substitute them into the equation, and compute the corresponding $y$ values. For example, if we take $x = 0$, we find that $y = 0^2 - 4(0) + 4 = 4$. Continue this process for several $x$ values to generate a comprehensive set of points.

Next, plot these calculated points on the graph and draw a smooth curve that connects them. For the equation $y = x^2 - 4x + 4$, you will observe that the graph forms a parabola that opens upwards.

To locate the roots, look for the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis. These intersections occur at the points where $y = 0$. In this particular case, you will notice that the parabola touches the x-axis at a single point, indicating a repeated root. This point is located at $x = 2$.

Thus, the root of the equation $y = x^2 - 4x + 4$ is $x = 2$. This is further validated by factoring the quadratic expression, which can be expressed as $(x - 2)^2 = 0$, confirming the existence of a repeated root at $x = 2$.
