To convert $2.8$ metres to millimetres, you simply multiply $2.8$ by $1,000$. This calculation yields a result of $2,800$ millimetres.

To elaborate, converting between units of measurement typically involves either multiplication or division by powers of ten. This straightforward process is due to the structure of the metric system, which is fundamentally based on these powers. In this instance, we are converting from metres (m) to millimetres (mm).

The key relationship to remember is that $1$ metre is equivalent to $1,000$ millimetres. Therefore, to convert from metres to millimetres, you multiply the number of metres by $1,000$.

For example, with $2.8$ metres, the conversion is calculated as follows:

$$
2.8 \, \text{metres} \times 1,000 = 2,800 \, \text{millimetres}
$$

This multiplication effectively shifts the decimal point three places to the right, which is equivalent to multiplying by $1,000$.

Grasping this concept is beneficial not only for this specific conversion but for any metric conversions. For instance, converting from kilometres to metres also requires multiplying by $1,000$, since $1$ kilometre equals $1,000$ metres. Likewise, converting from centimetres to millimetres involves multiplying by $10$, as $1$ centimetre equals $10$ millimetres.

By keeping these basic relationships in mind, you can efficiently and accurately convert between various metric units.
