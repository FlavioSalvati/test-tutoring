The conditional probability of drawing an ace, given that the first card drawn is a king, is $\frac{4}{51}$.

To clarify this concept, letâ€™s break it down step by step. A standard deck of cards consists of 52 cards divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains 13 cards, which includes one king and one ace. When the first card drawn is a king, it leaves us with 51 cards remaining in the deck.

Since one king has already been drawn, there are still 4 aces left among these 51 cards. To calculate the conditional probability, we consider the number of favorable outcomes (drawing an ace) relative to the total number of possible outcomes (the remaining cards in the deck).

Thus, the probability of drawing an ace given that the first card drawn was a king can be expressed as:

$$ 
\frac{\text{Number of aces remaining}}{\text{Total number of remaining cards}} = \frac{4}{51} 
$$

This fraction indicates the likelihood of drawing an ace after a king has already been drawn. It is crucial to note that the earlier draw of the king alters the total number of cards remaining in the deck; hence, we use 51 as the denominator instead of 52. This illustrates an essential principle in conditional probability, where the condition (drawing a king first) modifies the sample space (the cards left in the deck).
