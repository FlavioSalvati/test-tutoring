To estimate the gradient of the function $y = x^2 + 3$ at the point where $x = 1$, we utilize the derivative, which is given by 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x.
$$

The gradient of a curve at a specific point corresponds to the derivative of the function evaluated at that point. For the function $y = x^2 + 3$, we begin by calculating its derivative. We differentiate each term individually: the derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$, while the derivative of the constant $3$ is $0$. Thus, we can conclude that the derivative of the function is 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x.
$$

To determine the gradient at $x = 1$, we substitute $x = 1$ into the derivative:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} \bigg|_{x=1} = 2 \times 1 = 2.
$$

Therefore, the gradient of the curve $y = x^2 + 3$ at the point where $x = 1$ is $2$. This indicates that at this specific point, the slope of the tangent line to the curve is $2$, which provides insight into the steepness of the curve at that location.
