The derivative of the function $ y = 5x^4 $ is calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 20x^3.
$$

To derive $ y = 5x^4 $, we utilize the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that for a function of the form $ y = ax^n $, where $ a $ is a constant and $ n $ is a positive integer, the derivative $ \frac{dy}{dx} $ is expressed as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = a \cdot n \cdot x^{n-1}.
$$

In our case, the function is $ y = 5x^4 $, where $ a = 5 $ and $ n = 4 $. To apply the power rule, we multiply the coefficient $ 5 $ by the exponent $ 4 $ and then decrease the exponent by $ 1 $. This results in the following calculation:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot x^{4-1}.
$$

Simplifying this expression yields:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 20x^3.
$$

Thus, the derivative of $ y = 5x^4 $ is $ 20x^3 $. This indicates that for any value of $ x $, the rate of change of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ is represented by $ 20x^3 $. Understanding this derivative is essential in various fields of mathematics and science, such as determining the slope of a curve at a specific point or analyzing the behavior of functions.
