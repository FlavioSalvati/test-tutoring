The graph of $ y = \cos(x) $ is characterized by a wave-like curve that oscillates between the values of $1$ and $-1$.

As a periodic function, the cosine graph exhibits a repeating pattern at regular intervals. Specifically, for $ y = \cos(x) $, the period is $ 2\pi $, indicating that the pattern repeats every $ 2\pi $ units along the x-axis. The highest point on this graph, known as the maximum, occurs at $ y = 1 $, while the lowest point, referred to as the minimum, is at $ y = -1 $.

Beginning at $ x = 0 $, the graph starts at its maximum value of $1$. As $ x $ increases, the graph smoothly decreases to $0$ at $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $, reaches its minimum value of $-1$ at $ x = \pi $, rises back to $0$ at $ x = \frac{3\pi}{2} $, and finally returns to $1$ at $ x = 2\pi $. This sequence completes one full cycle of the cosine wave.

The graph is symmetric about the y-axis, meaning it is identical on both sides of the y-axis. This property is referred to as even symmetry. Furthermore, the graph is devoid of sharp corners or breaks; it is a smooth and continuous curve.

Gaining a clear understanding of the shape and properties of the cosine graph is crucial for solving trigonometric equations and analyzing wave patterns in various fields, including physics and engineering.
