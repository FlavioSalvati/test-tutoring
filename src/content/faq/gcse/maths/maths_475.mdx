To calculate the distance between the points $(1, 2, 3)$ and $(4, 5, 6)$, we can use the three-dimensional distance formula.

This formula is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem, allowing us to determine the straight-line distance between two points in three-dimensional space. The formula is expressed as:

$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} 
$$

In this equation, $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. For our specific points $(1, 2, 3)$ and $(4, 5, 6)$, we can substitute the coordinates into the formula:

$$ 
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (5 - 2)^2 + (6 - 3)^2} 
$$

First, we calculate the differences in each coordinate:

$$ 
x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 1 = 3 
$$
$$ 
y_2 - y_1 = 5 - 2 = 3 
$$
$$ 
z_2 - z_1 = 6 - 3 = 3 
$$

Next, we square each of these differences:

$$ 
(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 3^2 = 9 
$$
$$ 
(y_2 - y_1)^2 = 3^2 = 9 
$$
$$ 
(z_2 - z_1)^2 = 3^2 = 9 
$$

Now, we add these squared differences together:

$$ 
9 + 9 + 9 = 27 
$$

Finally, we take the square root of the sum:

$$ 
\sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3} 
$$

Thus, the distance between the points $(1, 2, 3)$ and $(4, 5, 6)$ is $3\sqrt{3}$ units.
