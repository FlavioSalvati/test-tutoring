To determine the midpoint of a line segment, you can average the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of its endpoints.

The midpoint formula is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

In this formula, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the endpoints of the line segment. For this example, the endpoints are $(0, 0)$ and $(4, 8)$.

Let's begin by calculating the average of the x-coordinates. The x-coordinates here are $0$ and $4$. To find their average, we add them together and divide by $2$:

$$
\frac{0 + 4}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

Next, we will calculate the average of the y-coordinates. The y-coordinates in this case are $0$ and $8$. Similar to the previous calculation, we add these values together and divide by $2$:

$$
\frac{0 + 8}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
$$

Consequently, the midpoint of the line segment that connects the points $(0, 0)$ and $(4, 8)$ is $(2, 4)$. This indicates that if you were to plot the line segment on a graph, the point $(2, 4)$ would lie exactly halfway between the two endpoints. You can apply this method for any pair of points to find the midpoint of the line segment that connects them.
