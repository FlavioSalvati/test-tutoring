To determine the magnitude of the vector $(6, 8)$, we can apply the formula $$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$.

The magnitude of a vector corresponds to its length and can be computed using Pythagoras' theorem. For a vector represented by its components $(x, y)$, the magnitude is found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. Here, the vector in question is $(6, 8)$.

To calculate the magnitude, we begin by squaring each component: 

- For the first component, we have $6^2 = 36$.
- For the second component, we compute $8^2 = 64$.

Next, we add these squared values together:

$$36 + 64 = 100.$$

Finally, we take the square root of the sum:

$$\sqrt{100} = 10.$$

Thus, the magnitude of the vector $(6, 8)$ is $10$.

This method is effective because a vector can be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, with the vector's components representing the lengths of the two shorter sides. The magnitude is then calculated using Pythagoras' theorem. This approach is essential in vector mathematics and is frequently utilized in fields such as physics and engineering to determine distances and lengths.
