The equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by $y = x - 5$ can be expressed as $y = -x + c$, where $c$ is a constant.

To understand this concept, let's first examine the slope (or gradient) of the original line $y = x - 5$. The slope of this line is $1$, which is the coefficient of $x$. For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must equal $-1$. This implies that if one line has a slope of $m$, the slope of the line that is perpendicular to it must be $-\frac{1}{m}$.

In our case, the slope of the original line is $1$. Therefore, the slope of the line that is perpendicular to it must be:

$$
-\frac{1}{1} = -1.
$$

Thus, the slope of the perpendicular line is $-1$.

Now we can formulate the equation of this perpendicular line. The general equation for a straight line is given by:

$$
y = mx + c,
$$

where $m$ represents the slope and $c$ denotes the y-intercept. Since we have established that the slope of our perpendicular line is $-1$, the equation simplifies to:

$$
y = -x + c,
$$

with $c$ being a constant that can take any real value.

This constant $c$ affects the point at which the line intersects the y-axis. For instance, if $c = 2$, the equation of the line would be:

$$
y = -x + 2.
$$

Conversely, if $c = -3$, the equation would change to:

$$
y = -x - 3.
$$

The value of $c$ can vary based on the specific perpendicular line you wish to describe, but the slope will consistently remain $-1$ for any line that is perpendicular to $y = x - 5$.
