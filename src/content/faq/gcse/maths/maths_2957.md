The conditional probability of rolling a $5$ given that the first roll resulted in a $3$ is $\frac{1}{6}$.

When rolling a fair six-sided die, each face, which ranges from $1$ to $6$, has an equal probability of landing face up. The probability for each face is $\frac{1}{6}$, which is approximately $0.1667$. Importantly, the outcome of one roll does not influence the outcome of another; each roll is an independent event. Thus, the probability of rolling a $5$ on the second roll remains the same, irrespective of the result of the first roll.

In probabilistic terms, the event of rolling a $5$ on the second roll is independent of the event of rolling a $3$ on the first roll. Therefore, the conditional probability $P(5 \text{ on second roll} \mid 3 \text{ on first roll})$ is simply the probability of rolling a $5$, which is $\frac{1}{6}$.

In other words, the occurrence of rolling a $3$ first does not alter the likelihood of rolling a $5$ next. Each roll of the die is treated as a distinct event, each with its own probabilities. Thus, whether the first roll is a $3$, a $1$, or any other number, the probability of rolling a $5$ on the subsequent roll remains $\frac{1}{6}$.
