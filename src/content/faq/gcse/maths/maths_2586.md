Co-interior angles in parallel lines sum to $180^\circ$.

When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal—a line that crosses both parallel lines—co-interior angles are formed. These angles are pairs that lie on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines. They are also referred to as "consecutive interior angles" or "allied angles."

To determine the measure of co-interior angles, remember that their sum is always $180^\circ$. This property arises from the fact that the parallel lines create supplementary angles. For instance, if one of the co-interior angles measures $110^\circ$, the other angle must measure $70^\circ$ because $110 + 70 = 180$.

To identify co-interior angles, look for the "U" or "C" shape formed by the parallel lines and the transversal. The angles located inside this shape, on the same side of the transversal, are the co-interior angles. If you know the measure of one angle, you can easily find the other by subtracting the known angle from $180^\circ$.

Understanding this concept is essential for solving various geometric problems, particularly those involving parallel lines and transversals. It also aids in proving other geometric properties and theorems. Therefore, always keep in mind: co-interior angles add up to $180^\circ$!
