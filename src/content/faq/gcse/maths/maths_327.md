A drawing with a scale of 1:200 indicates that 1 unit on the drawing corresponds to 200 units in reality.

To elaborate, a scale drawing is a method of representing objects or spaces accurately, albeit in a smaller and more manageable format. When you encounter a scale of 1:200, it signifies that each unit of measurement on the drawing (such as a centimeter or an inch) is equivalent to 200 of the same units in the actual object or space. For instance, if a wall measures $3 \, \text{cm}$ on the drawing, its real-life length would be calculated as $3 \times 200 = 600 \, \text{cm}$, which is equivalent to $6 \, \text{m}$.

This type of scale is particularly beneficial in fields such as architecture, engineering, and urban planning, where precise and detailed representations of large structures or areas are essential. By employing a scale, it becomes possible to depict a large building or expansive area on paper or a computer screen while maintaining the proportions and relationships among various parts.

To interpret a drawing with a 1:200 scale, you can utilize a ruler to measure distances on the drawing and then multiply those measurements by $200$ to determine the actual distances. For example, if you measure a room on the drawing and find it to be $5 \, \text{cm}$ long, you would calculate its true length as $5 \times 200 = 1000 \, \text{cm}$, or $10 \, \text{m}$.

Understanding scale drawings is a valuable skill in numerous practical scenarios, enabling accurate visualization and planning of real-world spaces and objects.
