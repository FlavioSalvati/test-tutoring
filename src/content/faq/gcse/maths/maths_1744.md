The cardinality of a set refers to the number of elements contained within that set.

In mathematical terms, a set is defined as a collection of distinct objects, treated as a single entity. The cardinality of a set serves as a measure of the "number of elements" present in that set. For instance, consider the set $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$. The cardinality of set $A$ is $3$, since it contains three distinct elements.

We often denote cardinality using vertical bars, as follows: $|A|$. Therefore, for our example set $A$, we can express its cardinality as $|A| = 3$. This notation is akin to the notation used for the absolute value of a number; however, in this context, it specifically indicates the number of elements in the set.

Cardinality applies to both finite and infinite sets. For finite sets, cardinality simply represents the total count of elements. For example, the set $B = \{\text{apple}, \text{banana}, \text{cherry}\}$ has a cardinality of $3$, which we write as $|B| = 3$. In contrast, infinite sets present a more intricate scenario. Take the set of all natural numbers, $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$, which is infinite. The cardinality of this set is denoted by the symbol $\aleph_0$ (aleph-null).

Grasping the concept of cardinality is essential for comparing the sizes of different sets. It is a foundational idea in set theory, a branch of mathematics dedicated to the exploration of sets and their properties.
