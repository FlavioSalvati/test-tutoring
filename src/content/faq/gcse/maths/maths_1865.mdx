The scientific notation $6.3 \times 10^7$ can be expressed as a standard number, which is $63,000,000$.

To clarify what $6.3 \times 10^7$ represents, let's analyze it step by step. The term $10^7$ indicates that $10$ is raised to the power of $7$, meaning you multiply $10$ by itself a total of $7$ times. This calculation results in $10,000,000$.

When you multiply $6.3$ by $10,000,000$, you are effectively shifting the decimal point in $6.3$ seven places to the right. Starting with $6.3$, moving the decimal one place to the right yields $63$. Moving it two places results in $630$, and this process continues. After shifting the decimal point seven places, you arrive at $63,000,000$.

This representation of numbers is known as scientific notation, which is especially advantageous for working with very large or very small values. It simplifies calculations and makes it easier to read and write these numbers without needing to count numerous zeros.

Therefore, whenever you encounter a number in the form $a \times 10^b$, remember that you shift the decimal point in $a$ by $b$ places to the right if $b$ is positive, or to the left if $b$ is negative. In this instance, $6.3 \times 10^7$ translates to $63,000,000$.
