The duration between 4:00 PM and 7:30 PM is 3 hours and 30 minutes.

To calculate the duration between two times, it is useful to break the process into hours and minutes. Begin by examining the hours first. From 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, there are exactly 3 hours.

Next, letâ€™s consider the minutes. The interval from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM consists of 30 minutes.

Now, combine the hours and minutes. You have 3 hours from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM, along with an additional 30 minutes from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM. Therefore, the total duration is 3 hours and 30 minutes.

When calculating time durations, it can be beneficial to utilize a timeline or a clock to visualize the intervals. This approach ensures that you accurately account for both the hours and the minutes. Keep in mind that there are 60 minutes in an hour; if your minutes total 60 or more, you will need to convert them into hours. For instance, 90 minutes converts to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Practicing with various time intervals can enhance your comfort with these calculations. Try breaking down different problems step by step, and soon, this process will become second nature!
