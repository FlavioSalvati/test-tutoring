Pythagoras' Theorem can be extended into three dimensions to determine the distance between two points in 3D space.

In three dimensions, this theorem assists in calculating the length of the diagonal connecting two points, denoted as $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$. The formula used for this calculation is:

$$ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} $$

In this equation, $d$ represents the distance between the two points. The expressions $(x_2 - x_1)$, $(y_2 - y_1)$, and $(z_2 - z_1)$ correspond to the differences in the x, y, and z coordinates of the two points, respectively.

To visualize this, consider a cuboid (a three-dimensional rectangle) and the task of finding the length of its diagonal, which stretches from one corner to the opposite corner. Initially, you can calculate the diagonal of the base of the cuboid using the two-dimensional version of Pythagoras' Theorem:

$$ \text{Base diagonal} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} $$

Next, treat this base diagonal as one side of a right-angled triangle, with the height of the cuboid serving as the other side. You then apply Pythagoras' Theorem once more in the three-dimensional context:

$$ d = \sqrt{(\text{Base diagonal})^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} $$

By substituting the expression for the base diagonal back into this formula, you arrive at the complete three-dimensional distance formula:

$$ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} $$

This approach enables you to calculate the straight-line distance between any two points in three-dimensional space, making it an invaluable tool in both geometry and physics.
