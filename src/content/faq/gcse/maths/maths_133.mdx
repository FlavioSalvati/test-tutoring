To determine the end time when the start time is $11:00 \text{ AM}$ and the duration is $4$ hours, we can follow a straightforward process of adding the duration to the start time.

In our example, the start time is $11:00 \text{ AM}$ and the duration is $4$ hours. To find the end time, we simply add $4$ hours to $11:00 \text{ AM}$, progressing forward on the clock.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. Begin at $11:00 \text{ AM}$.
2. Add $1$ hour to reach $12:00 \text{ PM}$ (noon).
3. Add another hour to reach $1:00 \text{ PM}$.
4. Add yet another hour to reach $2:00 \text{ PM}$.
5. Finally, add the last hour to arrive at $3:00 \text{ PM}$.

Thus, $11:00 \text{ AM}$ plus $4$ hours equates to $3:00 \text{ PM}$.

It's essential to remember that the clock resets after $12:00 \text{ PM}$. This means that after $12:00 \text{ PM}$, the next hour is $1:00 \text{ PM}$, not $13:00 \text{ PM}$. This reset is a characteristic of the $12$-hour clock system, which is commonly utilized in everyday life, particularly in the UK.

Mastering the addition of hours to a given time is a valuable skill, especially for effective planning and scheduling of various activities. Practicing with different start times and durations will help enhance your confidence and proficiency in these calculations.
