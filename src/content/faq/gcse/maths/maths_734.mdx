When rounding the number $4567$ to the nearest hundred, we find that it becomes $4600$.

To round a number to the nearest hundred, we focus on the tens digit. In the case of $4567$, the tens digit is $6$. According to standard rounding rules, if the tens digit is $5$ or greater, we round up. Conversely, if it is less than $5$, we round down.

Since the tens digit in $4567$ is $6$, which exceeds $5$, we round up. This process involves increasing the hundreds digit by $1$ and changing the tens and units digits to $0$. Consequently, $4567$ rounded to the nearest hundred is $4600$.

Rounding is an essential skill in mathematics, as it simplifies numbers, making them easier to work with, particularly in mental arithmetic and estimation. Understanding the place value of digits in a number is crucial for accurate rounding. In this example, the hundreds place is the third digit from the right, which is $5$ in $4567$. By applying the rounding rules, we can efficiently conclude that $4567$ rounds up to $4600$.
