The elapsed time from 8:00 AM to 11:15 AM is a total of 3 hours and 15 minutes.

To find the elapsed time between two points, you need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. In this scenario, the start time is 8:00 AM, and the end time is 11:15 AM.

Let's break it down step by step. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, there are exactly 3 hours. Next, we need to consider the additional 15 minutes that extend from 11:00 AM to 11:15 AM.

When we add these two intervals together, we have 3 hours plus 15 minutes, resulting in a total elapsed time of 3 hours and 15 minutes.

This approach of decomposing the time into hours and minutes can be very beneficial, particularly when managing more complex time intervals. It allows for a clearer visualization of time, such as picturing it on a clock or even sketching a timeline to facilitate the calculation.

Always remember, when calculating elapsed time, to maintain consistency with the units you are using (hours and minutes) and to double-check your calculations to prevent any errors.
