The slope of a distance-time graph represents the speed of an object.

In a distance-time graph, the distance traveled by an object is plotted on the vertical (y) axis, while the time taken is represented on the horizontal (x) axis. The slope, or gradient, of the line on this graph indicates how quickly the distance changes concerning time. Essentially, it conveys the speed at which the object is moving. A steeper slope indicates a higher speed, while a gentler slope suggests a lower speed.

To calculate the slope, you need to determine the change in distance, denoted as $\Delta y$, divided by the change in time, denoted as $\Delta x$. This relationship is expressed using the formula:

$$ \text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$

For example, if an object travels $100$ meters in $20$ seconds, the slope of the line would be calculated as:

$$ \text{slope} = \frac{100 \text{ meters}}{20 \text{ seconds}} = 5 \text{ meters per second} $$

This outcome indicates that the object is moving at a speed of $5$ meters per second.

If the line on the graph is horizontal, the slope is zero, which signifies that the object is stationary and not moving at all. Conversely, if the line were vertical—though this scenario is practically impossible in real-life contexts—it would imply an infinite speed, suggesting the object would cover an infinite distance in zero time.

Understanding the slope of a distance-time graph is essential for analyzing motion. It enables you to determine not only how far an object has traveled but also how fast it was moving at any specific point in time. This concept is fundamental in physics and has broad applications in various real-world situations, from calculating the speed of a car to understanding the motion of celestial bodies.
