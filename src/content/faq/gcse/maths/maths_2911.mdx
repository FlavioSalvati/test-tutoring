The complementary probability of rolling a 2 on a six-sided die is given by $\frac{5}{6}$.

When we refer to complementary probability, we are discussing the likelihood that a specific event does not occur. In this particular case, the event in question is rolling a 2 on a standard six-sided die. Each face of the die displays a different number, ranging from 1 to 6. Consequently, the probability of rolling any specific number, including a 2, is $\frac{1}{6}$.

To determine the complementary probability, we must calculate the probability of not rolling a 2. Since there are six possible outcomes when rolling the die, and only one of these outcomes results in a 2, it follows that five outcomes do not yield a 2. These outcomes include rolling a 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

The probability of not rolling a 2 can thus be expressed as the number of favorable outcomes (not rolling a 2) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling the die). This calculation yields:

$$
P(\text{not rolling a 2}) = \frac{5}{6}.
$$

In conclusion, the complementary probability is simply calculated as 1 minus the probability of the event occurring. Therefore, since the probability of rolling a 2 is $\frac{1}{6}$, the complementary probability is given by:

$$
1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}.
$$

This indicates that when you roll a six-sided die, there is a $\frac{5}{6}$ chance that you will not roll a 2.
