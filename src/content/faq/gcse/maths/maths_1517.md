Relative frequency is expressed as $0.2$, or $20\%$.

Relative frequency quantifies how often a specific event occurs in relation to the total number of trials conducted. To determine relative frequency, you divide the number of times the event occurs by the total number of trials. In this scenario, the event occurs $18$ times out of $90$ trials. Thus, the calculation for relative frequency is as follows:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of times the event occurs}}{\text{Total number of trials}} = \frac{18}{90} 
$$

When you perform the division $18 \div 90$, the result is $0.2$. This value can be converted into a percentage by multiplying by $100$, yielding $20\%$. Therefore, the relative frequency of the event occurring is $0.2$, or $20\%$.

Understanding relative frequency is crucial as it allows for the analysis of the likelihood of an event based on experimental data. For instance, if you were rolling a die and wanted to determine how frequently you rolled a $3$, you could use relative frequency to estimate this probability. The accuracy of your relative frequency estimate improves with the number of trials conducted, making it a valuable concept in statistics and probability. Ultimately, it aids in making predictions based on historical data.
