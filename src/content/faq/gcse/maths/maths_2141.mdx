To determine the value of $ x $ in the equation $ 2x + 4 = 8 $, we can follow a systematic approach to solve it step by step. Our objective is to isolate $ x $ on one side of the equation.

We start with the equation:

$$
2x + 4 = 8
$$

**Step 1: Eliminate the constant term.**

First, we subtract $ 4 $ from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term from the left:

$$
2x + 4 - 4 = 8 - 4
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
2x = 4
$$

**Step 2: Isolate $ x $.**

Next, we need to isolate $ x $ by eliminating the coefficient $ 2 $ that is multiplying $ x $. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $ 2 $:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{4}{2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = 2
$$

Thus, the value of $ x $ is $ 2 $. To verify our solution, we can substitute $ x $ back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:

$$
2(2) + 4 = 8
$$

Calculating the left side gives:

$$
4 + 4 = 8
$$

Since both sides of the equation are equal ($ 8 = 8 $), our solution $ x = 2 $ is confirmed to be correct.

This method of solving linear equations by isolating the variable is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths and will be valuable for tackling more complex problems in the future.
