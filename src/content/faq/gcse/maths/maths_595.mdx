To ascertain the direction of correlation in a scatter plot, you should examine the overall trend of the data points.

In a scatter plot, each point represents a pair of values. To identify the direction of correlation, observe the arrangement of these points. If the points trend upwards from left to right, this indicates a positive correlation. In this case, as one variable increases, the other variable also increases. For instance, if you plot the number of hours studied against exam scores, you may notice that an increase in study hours generally corresponds with higher exam scores, illustrating a positive correlation.

Conversely, if the points trend downwards from left to right, this signifies a negative correlation. This means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. For example, if you plot the number of hours spent watching television against exam scores, you might find that more hours of television viewing are associated with lower exam scores, indicating a negative correlation.

If the points do not display any discernible upward or downward trend and appear scattered randomly, this suggests that there is no correlation. In this scenario, there is no evident relationship between the two variables. For example, if you plot shoe size against exam scores, you would likely observe no correlation, as these two variables are unrelated.

By carefully analyzing the overall pattern of the data points in a scatter plot, you can determine whether the correlation is positive, negative, or non-existent.
