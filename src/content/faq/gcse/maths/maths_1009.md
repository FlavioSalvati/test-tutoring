The equation of the line is given by 

$$
y = 2x - 4.
$$

To fully grasp how we arrive at this equation, let's break it down step by step. The equation of a straight line is typically expressed in the form 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$ 

where $ m $ denotes the slope (or gradient) of the line, and $ c $ signifies the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the point where the line intersects the y-axis.

In this particular case, we have a slope of $ 2 $ and a y-intercept of $ -4 $. The slope indicates the steepness of the line; specifically, a slope of $ 2 $ implies that for every increase of $ 1 $ unit in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by $ 2 $ units. The y-intercept of $ -4 $ indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, -4) $.

To construct the equation, we simply substitute the given slope and y-intercept into the general form $ y = mx + c $. Here, we have $ m = 2 $ and $ c = -4 $, leading to the equation:

$$
y = 2x - 4.
$$

This equation encapsulates all the essential information about the line. For any specific value of $ x $, you can determine the corresponding $ y $ value by substituting $ x $ into the equation. For example, if $ x = 1 $, then 

$$
y = 2(1) - 4 = -2. 
$$ 

This result indicates that the point $ (1, -2) $ lies on the line.

Understanding this form of the equation is fundamental for analyzing and graphing linear relationships, particularly in the context of GCSE Mathematics.
