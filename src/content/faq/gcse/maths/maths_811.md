Linear growth and exponential growth are two distinct types of growth patterns that behave differently over time.

**Linear Growth** refers to a situation where a quantity increases by a constant amount during each time period. For example, if you save £10 every week, your savings will grow linearly. After one week, your savings will be £10; after two weeks, it will be £20; and so forth. In mathematical terms, the relationship can be expressed as:

$$
S(n) = 10n
$$

where $S(n)$ represents the savings after $n$ weeks. The graph of linear growth is a straight line, which is why it is referred to as "linear."

In contrast, **Exponential Growth** occurs when a quantity increases by a fixed percentage or factor in each time period. For instance, if you start with £100 and it grows by 10% each week, the amounts will increase as follows: after the first week, you will have £110; after the second week, your total will be £121; and so on. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
A(n) = 100(1.1)^n
$$

where $A(n)$ is the amount after $n$ weeks. Notice that with exponential growth, the increase each week becomes larger because you are adding a percentage of an ever-increasing amount. The graph of exponential growth is a curve that becomes steeper over time.

In summary, with linear growth, you consistently add the same amount each period (e.g., £10 every week). Conversely, with exponential growth, you multiply by the same factor each period (e.g., increasing by 10% each week). 

This distinction is crucial in various real-world applications, such as population growth, interest rates, and the spread of diseases, where exponential growth can lead to rapid increases. Understanding these concepts equips you with the tools to analyze and predict how different quantities evolve over time.
