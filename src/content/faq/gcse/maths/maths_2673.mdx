The surface area of a cube with a side length of $9 \, \text{cm}$ is $486 \, \text{cm}^2$.

To calculate the surface area of a cube, you need to know the length of one of its sides. A cube consists of six identical faces, each shaped as a square. The area of a single square face can be determined by squaring the side length. In this case, with a side length of $9 \, \text{cm}$, the area of one face is calculated as:

$$
9 \, \text{cm} \times 9 \, \text{cm} = 81 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

Since a cube has six of these square faces, the total surface area is obtained by multiplying the area of one face by $6$:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 6 \times 81 \, \text{cm}^2 = 486 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

This method is applicable to any cube, regardless of its side length. Remember the formula for surface area:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 6 \times (\text{side length})^2.
$$

For a side length of $9 \, \text{cm}$, substituting into the formula yields:

$$
6 \times 9^2 = 6 \times 81 = 486 \, \text{cm}^2.
$$

This straightforward calculation is fundamental for understanding how to work with three-dimensional shapes in geometry.
