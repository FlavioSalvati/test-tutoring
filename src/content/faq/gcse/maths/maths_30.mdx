The decimal $0.125$ can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$.

In order to convert the decimal $0.125$ to a fraction, it's important to understand that $0.125$ is equivalent to $125$ thousandths, or $\frac{125}{1000}$. The subsequent step involves simplifying this fraction, which requires finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator ($125$) and the denominator ($1000$). The GCD of $125$ and $1000$ happens to be $125$.

When both the numerator and the denominator are divided by their GCD, the resulting fraction is:

$$ \frac{125 \div 125}{1000 \div 125} = \frac{1}{8} $$

Hence, the decimal $0.125$ simplifies to the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$.

Comprehending this methodology is vital for GCSE Maths, as it enables the conversion between decimals and fractions, a frequent requirement in numerous problems. Furthermore, the skill of simplifying fractions is crucial, as it facilitates easier calculations and results that are more comprehensible. Always remember the key steps: initially express the decimal as a fraction with a power of ten in the denominator, then proceed to simplify by dividing by the GCD.
