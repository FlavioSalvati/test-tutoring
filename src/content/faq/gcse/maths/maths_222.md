To graph the equation $ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 $, we will plot the vertex, the axis of symmetry, and several points on either side of the vertex.

First, we need to find the vertex of the parabola. The equation is in standard form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $ where $ a = 1 $, $ b = -2 $, and $ c = 1 $. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be calculated using the formula:

$$
x = -\frac{b}{2a}.
$$

Substituting the values of $ b $ and $ a $, we have:

$$
x = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot 1} = 1.
$$

Next, we can determine the y-coordinate of the vertex by substituting $ x = 1 $ back into the original equation:

$$
y = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 1 = 0.
$$

Thus, the vertex of the parabola is at the point $ (1, 0) $.

Now, let's identify the axis of symmetry, which is the vertical line that passes through the vertex. For this quadratic equation, the axis of symmetry is given by:

$$
x = 1.
$$

Next, we will choose a few values of $ x $ on either side of the vertex to find the corresponding $ y $-values. For instance, if we take $ x = 0 $:

$$
y = (0)^2 - 2(0) + 1 = 1,
$$

yielding the point $ (0, 1) $. Similarly, for $ x = 2 $:

$$
y = (2)^2 - 2(2) + 1 = 1,
$$

which gives us the point $ (2, 1) $. We can now plot these points: $ (0, 1) $ and $ (2, 1) $.

To create a more detailed graph, we can compute additional points. For example, if we let $ x = -1 $:

$$
y = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) + 1 = 4,
$$

resulting in the point $ (-1, 4) $. If we choose $ x = 3 $:

$$
y = (3)^2 - 2(3) + 1 = 4,
$$

which gives the point $ (3, 4) $. We can now plot these additional points: $ (-1, 4) $ and $ (3, 4) $.

Finally, we will draw a smooth curve that passes through all of the plotted points, ensuring that it is symmetrical about the axis of symmetry. This will produce the graph of the equation $ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 $.
