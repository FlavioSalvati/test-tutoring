In order to determine the upper bound of a measurement, one should add half of the measurement's precision to the observed value.

When a measurement is taken, it's often approximated to a certain degree of precision. For instance, if you measure an object to the nearest centimetre, the real value could be slightly more or less than what was measured. The upper bound represents the maximum possible value that the actual measurement could be, given its precision.

Consider a scenario where a length is measured as $5$ cm, rounded to the nearest centimetre. Here, the precision is $1$ cm. The upper bound can be found by adding half of this precision (which is $0.5$ cm) to the measured value. Hence, the upper bound would be $5$ cm $+ 0.5$ cm $= 5.5$ cm.

This methodology is applicable to any level of precision. If you measure something to the nearest tenth ($0.1$), the precision is $0.1$, and half of that is $0.05$. Therefore, if your measurement is $7.3$, the upper bound would be $7.3 + 0.05 = 7.35$.

Comprehending upper bounds is crucial in ensuring that measurements are accurate and reliable, particularly in areas like science and engineering where precision is vital. This understanding allows you to identify the maximum potential value that a measurement could be, which proves invaluable in calculations and when setting tolerances.
