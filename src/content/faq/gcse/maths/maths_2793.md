To determine the slant height of a three-dimensional shape, you can apply the Pythagorean theorem or trigonometric ratios, depending on the specific geometry of the shape.

### Finding Slant Height

The approach to calculate the slant height varies based on the type of 3D shape involved. 

#### Right Circular Cone

For a right circular cone, the slant height, denoted as $l$, can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. If you have the radius $r$ of the base and the vertical height $h$ of the cone, the formula is:

$$
l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
$$

This formula derives from the right triangle formed by the radius, the height, and the slant height of the cone.

#### Pyramid

In a pyramid, the slant height is defined as the distance from the apex to the midpoint of one of the edges of the base. If you know the perpendicular height $h$ of the pyramid and the half-length of the base edge, represented as $\frac{a}{2}$, you can again apply the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
l = \sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + h^2}
$$

#### Trigonometric Ratios

In certain situations, you may need to utilize trigonometric ratios to find the slant height. For example, in a cone, if you know the angle $\theta$ between the slant height and the base, along with the radius $r$, you can use the cosine function:

$$
l = \frac{r}{\cos(\theta)}
$$

### Conclusion

Familiarizing yourself with these methods will enable you to effectively determine the slant height for various three-dimensional shapes, facilitating your ability to tackle related problems in your GCSE Maths exams.
