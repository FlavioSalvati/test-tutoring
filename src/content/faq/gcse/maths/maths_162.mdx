In algebra, the letter $y$ typically represents a variable or an unknown value that can vary.

To elaborate, a variable is a symbol that denotes a numerical value in mathematical expressions and equations. The letter $y$ is frequently used alongside other variables such as $x$, $z$, and $t$. When you encounter $y$ in an equation, it signifies that $y$ can assume different values based on the context of the problem. For example, in the equation 

$$ 
y = 2x + 3, 
$$ 

$y$ is dependent on the value of $x$. As $x$ changes, the value of $y$ will also vary according to the relationship established by the equation.

Variables like $y$ are fundamental in algebra because they enable us to generalize mathematical relationships and solve problems involving unknown quantities. For instance, if you are given the equation 

$$ 
y = 2x + 3 
$$ 

and you know the value of $x$, you can substitute that value into the equation to determine the corresponding value of $y$. This process is known as solving for $y$.

In the realm of coordinate geometry, $y$ often signifies the vertical position of a point on a graph, while $x$ indicates the horizontal position. The pair $(x, y)$ is referred to as an ordered pair and is utilized to pinpoint locations on the Cartesian plane. For example, the point $(3, 5)$ indicates that $x$ is $3$ and $y$ is $5$.

Grasping the role of $y$ as a variable is crucial for analyzing and solving a wide array of mathematical problems, ranging from straightforward equations to more intricate functions and graphs.
