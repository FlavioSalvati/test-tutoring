The conditional probability $ P(A|B) $ is given as $ 0.5 $.

To compute $ P(A|B) $, which represents the probability of event $ A $ occurring given that event $ B $ has occurred, we utilize the formula for conditional probability:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

In this scenario, we have the following values: $ P(A \cap B) = 0.25 $ and $ P(B) = 0.5 $.

Substituting these values into the formula yields:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.5}
$$

When we perform the division $ 0.25 \div 0.5 $, we find that $ P(A|B) = 0.5 $. Thus, the probability of event $ A $ occurring, given that event $ B $ has occurred, is $ 0.5 $.

This indicates that if we know event $ B $ has taken place, there is a $ 50\% $ chance that event $ A $ will also occur. Understanding conditional probability is crucial because it allows us to analyze situations in which events are interdependent. For instance, if you are aware that it is raining (event $ B $), the likelihood of you carrying an umbrella (event $ A $) may increase compared to a scenario where you are unaware of the rain.
