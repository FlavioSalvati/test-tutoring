To determine the length of a leg in a right-angled triangle using Pythagoras' Theorem, you can rearrange the formula to solve for the unknown leg.

Pythagoras' Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed using the formula:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

where $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the triangle's legs.

If you need to find the length of one leg, say $a$, and you already know the length of the other leg $b$ and the hypotenuse $c$, you can rearrange the formula to isolate $a$. Start by subtracting $b^2$ from both sides:

$$
a^2 = c^2 - b^2
$$

Next, take the square root of both sides to solve for $a$:

$$
a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}
$$

For example, if the hypotenuse $c$ measures $10$ units and the other leg $b$ measures $6$ units, you would substitute these values into the rearranged equation:

$$
a = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8
$$

Thus, the length of the unknown leg $a$ is $8$ units.

Before applying Pythagoras' Theorem, always verify that the triangle is right-angled, as this theorem is specific to right-angled triangles. Additionally, ensure that your calculations, particularly those involving square roots, are performed accurately.
