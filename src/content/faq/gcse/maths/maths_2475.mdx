A polygon is a closed, two-dimensional shape characterized by straight sides.

Polygons are fundamental geometric figures that can possess any number of sides, provided that those sides are straight and the shape is closed. This closure means that the sides connect end-to-end, forming a complete loop. Common examples of polygons include triangles (which have $3$ sides), quadrilaterals (with $4$ sides), pentagons (featuring $5$ sides), and hexagons (which consist of $6$ sides).

Polygons can be classified according to the number of their sides. For example, a polygon with $8$ sides is referred to as an octagon, while a polygon with $10$ sides is known as a decagon. The sides of a polygon are called edges, and the points where two edges intersect are referred to as vertices.

Moreover, polygons can be categorized as regular or irregular. A regular polygon has all its sides and angles equal, such as an equilateral triangle or a square. In contrast, an irregular polygon has sides and angles of varying lengths and sizes.

Another significant aspect of polygons is their classification as either convex or concave. A convex polygon has all of its interior angles measuring less than $180$ degrees, ensuring that no sides are indented. Conversely, a concave polygon contains at least one interior angle greater than $180$ degrees, giving it a 'caved-in' appearance.

Understanding polygons is essential in the field of geometry, as they serve as the foundation for more complex shapes and have numerous real-world applications, ranging from architecture to computer graphics.
