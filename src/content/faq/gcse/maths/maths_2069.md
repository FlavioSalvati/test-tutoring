To substitute the value $4$ for the variable $z$ in the expression $6z - 5$, follow these steps to replace $z$ and simplify the expression.

When substituting a value into an algebraic expression, you replace the variable with the specified number. In this example, the expression is $6z - 5$, and we will substitute $z$ with $4$.

First, write down the original expression:

$$
6z - 5
$$

Next, replace the variable $z$ with the number $4$. This results in:

$$
6(4) - 5
$$

Now, perform the multiplication. Calculating $6$ times $4$ gives you $24$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

$$
24 - 5
$$

Finally, subtract $5$ from $24$, which yields $19$. Thus, when you substitute $4$ for $z$ in the expression $6z - 5$, the final result is:

$$
19
$$

This substitution process is a fundamental technique in algebra, allowing you to evaluate expressions for specific values of variables. It helps you understand how changes in variables impact the overall expression.
