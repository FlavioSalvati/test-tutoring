The cube of $10$ is $1,000$.

To calculate the cube of a number, you multiply the number by itself two additional times. In mathematical notation, this is expressed as $10^3$ or $10 \times 10 \times 10$. When you first multiply $10$ by itself, you obtain $100$. Next, multiplying $100$ by $10$ yields $1,000$. Thus, the cube of $10$ is indeed $1,000$.

Cubing a number represents a method of extending it into three dimensions. Consider a cube where each side measures $10$ units. The volume of this cube is determined by multiplying its length, width, and height, all of which are $10$ units. Therefore, the volume can be calculated as:

$$
10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1,000 \text{ cubic units}.
$$

Understanding the concept of cubes is crucial in many fields of mathematics and science. For instance, in geometry, it is essential to know how to compute the volume of a cube. In algebra, working with cubes enhances your comprehension of polynomial equations and functions.

Whenever you need to find the cube of a number, simply remember to multiply the number by itself twice. For $10$, this straightforward calculation results in $1,000$.
