To address an exponential growth problem, you can utilize the formula:

$$ P(t) = P_0 \times e^{rt} $$

Exponential growth scenarios often pertain to quantities that increase rapidly over time, such as populations, investments, or bacterial cultures. This formula enables us to calculate the quantity at any specific time $ t $. In this expression, $ P(t) $ represents the amount at time $ t $, $ P_0 $ denotes the initial amount, $ r $ signifies the growth rate, and $ e $ is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to $2.71828$.

To solve an exponential growth problem, follow these systematic steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount ($ P_0 $)**: This represents the starting value before any growth occurs.
2. **Determine the growth rate ($ r $)**: This is typically provided as a percentage. To convert it into a decimal, divide by $100$.
3. **Set the time period ($ t $)**: This indicates the duration over which the growth takes place.
4. **Substitute these values into the formula**: Insert $ P_0 $, $ r $, and $ t $ into the equation $ P(t) = P_0 \times e^{rt} $.
5. **Calculate the result**: Use a calculator to compute $ e^{rt} $ and then multiply this by $ P_0 $.

For instance, consider a scenario where you begin with $100$ bacteria ($ P_0 = 100 $), the growth rate is $5\%$ per hour ($ r = 0.05 $), and you wish to find the quantity after $3$ hours ($ t = 3 $). The calculation would proceed as follows:

$$ P(3) = 100 \times e^{0.05 \times 3} $$

Using a calculator, you find that $ e^{0.15} \approx 1.1618 $. Therefore, the calculation yields:

$$ P(3) = 100 \times 1.1618 = 116.18 $$

Consequently, after $3$ hours, the population would be approximately $116$ bacteria.
