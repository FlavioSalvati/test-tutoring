The $y$-coordinate of the point $(5, -2)$ is $-2$.

In coordinate geometry, points on a plane are represented by pairs of numbers enclosed in parentheses, such as $(x, y)$. The first number, known as the $x$-coordinate, indicates the position of the point along the horizontal $x$-axis, while the second number, the $y$-coordinate, specifies the position along the vertical $y$-axis.

For the point $(5, -2)$, the $x$-coordinate is $5$, which means that the point is located $5$ units to the right of the origin $(0, 0)$. The $y$-coordinate is $-2$, indicating that the point is situated $2$ units below the origin. The $y$-coordinate is essential for determining the vertical placement of the point on the graph.

To plot the point $(5, -2)$ on a graph, you would start at the origin. First, move $5$ units to the right along the $x$-axis, and then move $2$ units downward along the $y$-axis. This sequence of movements will position you at the point $(5, -2)$. The $y$-coordinate of $-2$ provides precise information about how far below the $x$-axis the point is located.

Mastering the concept of coordinates is fundamental in GCSE Maths, as it enables you to plot points, create graphs, and analyze geometric shapes. The $y$-coordinate, in particular, plays a crucial role in determining the vertical position of points and in solving problems related to lines and curves on a graph.
