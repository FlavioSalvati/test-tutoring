To determine the final price after applying a 25% discount to an original price of £40, we can follow two methods for verification.

First, we need to calculate the discount amount. A 25% discount means we are reducing the original price by 25%. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 25%, which can be expressed in decimal form as $0.25$. Thus, we perform the following calculation:

$$
40 \times 0.25 = 10
$$

This indicates that the discount amount is £10. To find the final price after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

$$
40 - 10 = 30
$$

Therefore, the final price, after applying a 25% discount to £40, is £30.

As an alternative approach, we can calculate what 75% of the original price is, since $100\% - 25\% = 75\%$. This can be done by multiplying the original price by $0.75$:

$$
40 \times 0.75 = 30
$$

This method also confirms that the final price is £30. Both methods are valid and yield the same result, allowing you to choose whichever approach you find more convenient.
