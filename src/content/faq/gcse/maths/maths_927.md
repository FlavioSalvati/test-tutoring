To graph the function $ y = \tan(x) $, it is essential to illustrate its periodic behavior, vertical asymptotes, and key points within a single period.

First, recognize that the tangent function, $ y = \tan(x) $, exhibits periodicity with a period of $ \pi $. This implies that the graph's pattern repeats every $ \pi $ units along the x-axis. The function is undefined at certain points, leading to vertical asymptotes located at 

$$
x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi 
$$ 

for any integer $ k $. These asymptotes are significant because they indicate where the graph approaches positive or negative infinity.

Next, identify the key points within one period, which typically spans from $ -\frac{\pi}{2} $ to $ \frac{\pi}{2} $. At the point $ x = 0 $, we find that

$$
y = \tan(0) = 0.
$$ 

As $ x $ approaches $ \frac{\pi}{2} $ from the left, $ y $ tends toward positive infinity, while as $ x $ approaches $ -\frac{\pi}{2} $ from the right, $ y $ trends towards negative infinity. This behavior contributes to the characteristic 'S' shape of the tangent graph situated between each pair of asymptotes.

To create the graph, begin by drawing the vertical asymptotes at 

$$
x = \pm\frac{\pi}{2}.
$$ 

Next, plot the key point at $ (0, 0) $. Sketch the curve so that it approaches the asymptotes appropriately: it should rise towards positive infinity as it nears $ \frac{\pi}{2} $ and fall towards negative infinity as it approaches $ -\frac{\pi}{2} $. If desired, this pattern can be extended to additional periods.

By following these guidelines, you will be able to accurately graph $ y = \tan(x) $ and appreciate its distinctive properties.
