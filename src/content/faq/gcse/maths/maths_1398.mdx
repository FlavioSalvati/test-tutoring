To determine the length of a diagonal within a three-dimensional space, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which can be extended to three dimensions.

Consider a rectangular cuboid, also known as a 3D box, with side lengths denoted as $a$, $b$, and $c$. The diagonal in question is the line that connects one corner of the cuboid to the diagonally opposite corner, traversing through the interior of the cuboid. To calculate this diagonal, we will build upon the Pythagorean theorem, which is commonly used for right triangles in two dimensions.

First, let's analyze the base of the cuboid. We can visualize a right-angled triangle formed at the base, where the sides measure $a$ and $b$. The diagonal of this base triangle, which we will call $d$, can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

Next, we need to account for the height $c$ of the cuboid. Here, we can form another right-angled triangle, where $d$ is one side and $c$ is the other side. In this case, the 3D diagonal, which we will denote as $D$, serves as the hypotenuse of this triangle. We can again apply the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
D = \sqrt{d^2 + c^2}
$$

Now, we can substitute the expression for $d$ from the previous calculation into this equation:

$$
D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 + c^2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
D = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
$$

Thus, the formula for calculating the length of the 3D diagonal $D$ of a rectangular cuboid is:

$$
D = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
$$

This equation allows you to find the length of the diagonal for any rectangular cuboid, provided you know the lengths of its three sides.
