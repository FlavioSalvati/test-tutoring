The fraction $\frac{7}{10}$ can be expressed as the decimal $0.7$.

To convert a fraction into a decimal, you divide the numerator (the top number) by the denominator (the bottom number). In this case, the numerator is $7$ and the denominator is $10$. Dividing $7$ by $10$ gives you $0.7$. This can also be understood as $7$ tenths.

Another way to grasp this conversion is by considering place value. The fraction $\frac{7}{10}$ indicates that there are $7$ parts out of a total of $10$. This directly translates to the decimal $0.7$, where the digit $7$ occupies the tenths place, corresponding to the denominator of $10$.

You can also utilize long division to convert the fraction to a decimal. When you divide $7$ by $10$ using long division, you can express $7$ as $7.0$. Then, you determine how many times $10$ can fit into $70$, which is $7$ times. This calculation confirms that the decimal representation is $0.7$.

Mastering the conversion of fractions to decimals is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it plays a significant role in various topics such as percentages, ratios, and algebra. Additionally, this knowledge is invaluable in everyday situations, such as managing finances or making measurements.
