The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by the equation $y = 3x + 2$ is $-\frac{1}{3}$.

To determine the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to another, it is essential to understand the relationship between their gradients. The gradient, also known as the slope, quantifies the steepness of a line. For the line represented by the equation $y = 3x + 2$, the gradient is $3$. This is derived from the standard form of a linear equation, $y = mx + c$, where $m$ denotes the gradient.

When two lines are perpendicular, their gradients are related in a specific way: the product of their gradients equals $-1$. This means that if you multiply the gradient of one line by the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to it, the outcome will be $-1$. Mathematically, if the gradient of the first line is $m$, then the gradient of the perpendicular line can be expressed as $-\frac{1}{m}$.

In this particular case, the gradient of the original line is $3$. To find the gradient of the perpendicular line, we take the negative reciprocal of $3$. The reciprocal of $3$ is $\frac{1}{3}$, and applying the negative sign yields $-\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to $y = 3x + 2$ is indeed $-\frac{1}{3}$.

Understanding this concept is fundamental in geometry, as it aids in solving various problems involving perpendicular lines. This includes finding the equations of lines, analyzing geometric shapes, and comprehending the properties of different types of angles.
