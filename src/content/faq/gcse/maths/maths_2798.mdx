To reflect a triangle across the line given by the equation $y = x$, you need to swap the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each vertex.

When reflecting a triangle over the line $y = x$, you transform each vertex of the triangle. Let's denote the vertices of the triangle by their coordinates: $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$. To perform the reflection, you simply exchange the $x$ and $y$ values of each vertex. Consequently, the new coordinates of the vertices will be $(y_1, x_1)$, $(y_2, x_2)$, and $(y_3, x_3)$.

For instance, consider a triangle with vertices at $(2, 3)$, $(4, 5)$, and $(6, 7)$. Reflecting this triangle over the line $y = x$ will yield new vertices at $(3, 2)$, $(5, 4)$, and $(7, 6)$. This transformation effectively mirrors the triangle across the line $y = x$, which is a diagonal line that runs from the bottom-left to the top-right of the coordinate plane.

This method is effective because the line $y = x$ serves as a line of symmetry. This means that for any point $(a, b)$ located on one side of the line, there exists a corresponding point $(b, a)$ on the opposite side. By swapping the coordinates, you ensure that each point is accurately mirrored across the line. This technique is particularly useful in various geometric problems and aids in visualizing transformations in coordinate geometry.
