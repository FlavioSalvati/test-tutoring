The probability of drawing two consecutive aces without replacement from a standard deck of cards is $\frac{1}{221}$.

To comprehend this probability, letâ€™s break it down step by step. A standard deck consists of 52 cards, among which there are 4 aces. When you draw the first card, the probability of it being an ace is given by the ratio of aces to the total number of cards, which is $\frac{4}{52}$. This fraction simplifies to $\frac{1}{13}$.

After successfully drawing the first ace, there will be 51 cards remaining in the deck, with only 3 aces left. Therefore, the probability of drawing a second ace now becomes $\frac{3}{51}$.

To determine the overall probability of both events occurring in succession, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event. Thus, the calculation is:

$$
\frac{1}{13} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{3}{663}.
$$

This result can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

$$
\frac{3}{663} = \frac{1}{221}.
$$

Consequently, the probability of drawing two consecutive aces without replacement is $\frac{1}{221}$. This implies that if you were to repeat this drawing process many times, you would expect to successfully draw two aces in a row approximately once in every 221 attempts.
