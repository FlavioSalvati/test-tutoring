To rationalize the denominator of the expression $ \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{3}} $, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $ \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2 - \sqrt{3}} $.

When dealing with a denominator that contains a surd (a square root), multiplying by the conjugate simplifies the expression. The conjugate of $ 2 + \sqrt{3} $ is $ 2 - \sqrt{3} $. This technique is effective because multiplying a binomial by its conjugate results in a difference of squares, effectively eliminating the surd.

Let's proceed with the multiplication:

$$ 
\frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{3}} \times \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{(2 + \sqrt{3})(2 - \sqrt{3})} 
$$

Next, we simplify the denominator using the difference of squares formula, which states that $ (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 $:

$$ 
(2 + \sqrt{3})(2 - \sqrt{3}) = 2^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1 
$$

Thus, our expression simplifies to:

$$ 
\frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{1} = 2 - \sqrt{3} 
$$

Consequently, the rationalized form of $ \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{3}} $ is $ 2 - \sqrt{3} $. This process effectively removes the surd from the denominator, making the expression easier to work with in subsequent calculations.
