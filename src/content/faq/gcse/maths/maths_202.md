The $n$th term of the sequence $6, 12, 18, 24$ can be expressed using the formula:

$$
a_n = 6n
$$

To determine the $n$th term of a sequence, it is essential to identify a consistent pattern or rule that governs the terms. In this case, each term in the sequence increases by $6$, indicating that it is an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is derived by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. 

The first term, when $n = 1$, is $6$. The second term, for $n = 2$, is $12$. Continuing this pattern, the third term (when $n = 3$) is $18$, and the fourth term (when $n = 4$) is $24$.

To derive the formula, we can observe the relationship between the term's position and its value. The first term can be expressed as $6 \times 1$, the second term as $6 \times 2$, the third term as $6 \times 3$, and the fourth term as $6 \times 4$. This consistent pattern reveals that the $n$th term is simply $6$ multiplied by $n$. Therefore, we can summarize the $n$th term of the sequence as:

$$
a_n = 6n
$$

Using this formula, it is possible to calculate any term in the sequence. For instance, to find the $5$th term, substitute $n = 5$ into the formula:

$$
a_5 = 6 \times 5 = 30
$$

Thus, the $5$th term of the sequence is $30$. This method is applicable for any positive integer value of $n$, making it a valuable tool for analyzing arithmetic sequences.
