To convert a percentage like $12.5\%$ into a decimal, you need to divide the percentage by $100$. This gives you a result of $0.125$.

Percentages represent numbers as fractions of a whole, specifically as parts per hundred. The term "percent" literally translates to "per hundred." Consequently, to convert any percentage into a decimal, you simply divide the percentage value by $100$.

For instance, when converting $12.5\%$, the calculation is as follows:
$$
12.5 \div 100 = 0.125
$$

This operation effectively shifts the decimal point two places to the left. Thus, $12.5$ becomes $0.125$. This conversion method is applicable to any percentage. For example, if you take $50\%$, dividing by $100$ yields $0.50$, and for $7\%$, the result is $0.07$.

Understanding how to convert between percentages and decimals is valuable in various fields of mathematics, including probability, statistics, and financial calculations. This skill facilitates easier transitions between these two formats, simplifying subsequent calculations and analyses.
