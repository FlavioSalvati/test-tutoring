To determine the median of a data set, you must first arrange the values in ascending order and then identify the middle value or the average of the two middle values, depending on whether the total number of values is odd or even.

The median is a key measure of central tendency that signifies the middle point in a data set. To calculate the median, start by sorting the data from the smallest to the largest value. 

1. **If the number of data points ($n$) is odd**, the median is located at the position given by the formula:

$$ 
\text{Median} = \text{Value at position} \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) 
$$ 

For example, consider the data set $\{3, 1, 4\}$. After sorting, it becomes $\{1, 3, 4\}$. Since there are three numbers (an odd count), the median is the second number, which is $3$.

2. **If the number of data points is even**, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values. For instance, take the data set $\{3, 1, 4, 2\}$. When sorted, it becomes $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. Here, there are four numbers (an even count), so the median is the average of the second and third values:

$$ 
\text{Median} = \frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5 
$$ 

Thus, the median for this data set is $2.5$.

The median is particularly valuable because it remains unaffected by extremely high or low values, known as outliers. This characteristic makes it a more robust measure of central tendency compared to the mean, especially in skewed distributions. By understanding how to find the median, you can enhance your ability to analyze and interpret various data sets, ranging from exam scores to household incomes.
