To calculate the area of a triangle when you know two sides and the included angle, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} ab \sin(C)
$$

In this context, let’s define the variables. Here, $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the two sides, while $C$ is the angle that lies between these two sides. This formula is based on fundamental principles of trigonometry and geometry. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the sides and angle**: Suppose you have two sides, $a$ and $b$, and the angle $C$ that is formed between them. This angle is referred to as the included angle.

2. **Understand the sine function**: The sine function, denoted as $\sin$, is a trigonometric function that relates an angle in a right triangle to the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In the context of this formula, $\sin(C)$ helps to determine the height of the triangle when one of the sides serves as the base.

3. **Apply the formula**: To find the area, substitute the known values of $a$, $b$, and $\sin(C)$ into the formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} ab \sin(C)
$$

This equation calculates half the product of the two sides multiplied by the sine of the included angle, yielding the area of the triangle.

**Example Calculation**: If side $a$ measures $5 \, \text{cm}$, side $b$ measures $7 \, \text{cm}$, and the included angle $C$ is $60^\circ$, you would first calculate $\sin(60^\circ)$, which equals $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Next, substitute these values into the area formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 7 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{35\sqrt{3}}{4} \, \text{cm}^2
$$

This method is particularly advantageous because it allows you to determine the area of the triangle without needing to know the height directly.
