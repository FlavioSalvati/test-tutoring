The complementary probability of obtaining tails in a coin flip corresponds to the probability of obtaining heads, which is $0.5$.

When flipping a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails. Since the coin is fair, each outcome is equally likely, which means that the probability of getting tails is $0.5$ (or $50\%$), and the probability of getting heads is also $0.5$ (or $50\%$).

In the realm of probability, the term "complementary probability" refers to the likelihood of the opposite event occurring. Therefore, if you are interested in the probability of obtaining tails, the complementary probability would be the probability of not obtaining tails, which is equivalent to obtaining heads. Since the total probability of all possible outcomes must sum to $1$ (or $100\%$), the complementary probability of obtaining tails is calculated as $1$ minus the probability of obtaining tails. Consequently, this gives us $1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.

Grasping the concept of complementary probabilities is beneficial in various fields of mathematics and in real-world scenarios. For instance, if you know the probability of a particular event occurring, you can easily determine the probability of that event not occurring by applying the idea of complementary probabilities. This approach is especially useful in situations where calculating the direct probability may be complicated, while determining the complementary probability is more straightforward.
