To calculate the surface area of a compound solid composed of a cone and a cylinder, we need to determine and sum the surface areas of both shapes.

First, we will decompose the compound solid into its two primary components: the cone and the cylinder. Each component has its own formula for calculating surface area. 

For the cylinder, the surface area consists of two parts: the curved surface area and the area of its two circular bases. The formula for the curved surface area of a cylinder is given by 

$$ 
\text{Curved Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi rh 
$$ 

where $ r $ represents the radius and $ h $ denotes the height. The area of one circular base is 

$$ 
\text{Base Area} = \pi r^2 
$$ 

Thus, the total area of both bases is 

$$ 
\text{Total Base Area} = 2\pi r^2. 
$$

Next, we turn to the cone. The surface area of the cone also includes two components: the curved surface area and the area of its base. The formula for the curved surface area of a cone is 

$$ 
\text{Curved Surface Area}_{\text{cone}} = \pi rl 
$$ 

where $ l $ is the slant height of the cone. The area of the cone's base, which is a circle, is given by 

$$ 
\text{Base Area}_{\text{cone}} = \pi r^2. 
$$

When we combine these two shapes, we must consider that the base of the cone overlaps with the top base of the cylinder. To avoid double-counting this overlapping area, we will not include the area of the cone's base in the total surface area calculation.

Therefore, the total surface area $ A $ of the compound solid is calculated as follows:

$$ 
A = \text{Curved Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} + \text{Curved Surface Area}_{\text{cone}} + \text{Base Area}_{\text{cylinder}}. 
$$ 

Substituting the respective formulas, we have:

$$ 
A = 2\pi rh + \pi rl + \pi r^2. 
$$ 

This formula accurately accounts for the curved surfaces of both the cylinder and the cone, along with the bottom base of the cylinder, ensuring that the overlapping area is not included twice.
