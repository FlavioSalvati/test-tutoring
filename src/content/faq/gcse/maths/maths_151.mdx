A function is said to exhibit exponential growth if it increases by a constant percentage or multiplicative factor over equal intervals.

To ascertain whether a function demonstrates exponential growth, it is essential to examine its general form. An exponential growth function can be expressed as 

$$ 
f(x) = a \cdot b^x 
$$ 

where $ a $ is a constant, $ b $ represents the base of the exponential (with the requirement that $ b > 1 $), and $ x $ is the exponent. A defining characteristic of exponential growth is that the function's value increases by a consistent percentage or factor over equal intervals of $ x $.

For instance, consider the function 

$$ 
f(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x. 
$$ 

In this case, $ a = 2 $ and $ b = 3 $. As $ x $ increases, the value of $ f(x) $ grows rapidly, owing to the fact that it is multiplied by $ 3 $ for each unit increment in $ x $. This consistent multiplication by a factor greater than $ 1 $ signifies exponential growth.

Another method to identify exponential growth is to analyze the rate of change. In cases of exponential growth, the rate of change itself accelerates over time. When you graph the function, an exponential growth function will manifest as a curve that becomes increasingly steep as $ x $ increases.

Additionally, you can compare the function's values at various points. If the ratio of the function's values at equally spaced intervals remains constant, then the function is likely exhibiting exponential growth. For example, if 

$$ 
f(1) = 6, \quad f(2) = 18, \quad \text{and} \quad f(3) = 54, 
$$ 

the ratios 

$$ 
\frac{f(2)}{f(1)} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{f(3)}{f(2)} = 3 
$$ 

confirm exponential growth with a base of $ 3 $.
