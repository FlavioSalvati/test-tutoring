To find 20% of 250, we start by understanding what a percentage represents. A percentage expresses a number as a fraction of 100. Therefore, 20% can be interpreted as $20$ out of $100$, which translates mathematically to the fraction $\frac{20}{100}$. To compute 20% of $250$, we multiply $250$ by $\frac{20}{100}$.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to the calculation:

1. Convert the percentage to a fraction: $20\%$ becomes $\frac{20}{100}$.
2. Simplify the fraction if possible. In this instance, $\frac{20}{100}$ simplifies to $\frac{1}{5}$.
3. Multiply the simplified fraction by the number from which you want to find the percentage, which is $250$.

The calculation can be performed as follows:
$$ 
250 \times \frac{20}{100} = 250 \times 0.2 = 50 
$$

Alternatively, you can approach it by recognizing that $20\%$ is equivalent to one-fifth. Thus, you can divide $250$ by $5$:
$$ 
250 \div 5 = 50 
$$

Both methods yield the same result of $50$. This technique is versatile and can be applied to any percentage calculation, making it a valuable skill for everyday situations, such as calculating discounts or determining interest rates.
