To calculate the decay constant, we can use the formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{\text{half-life}}
$$

where $\lambda$ represents the decay constant. The decay constant quantifies the rate at which a radioactive substance decays. It is intimately connected to the half-life of the substance, which is defined as the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay.

In this formula, $\ln(2)$ denotes the natural logarithm of 2, which is approximately equal to $0.693$. 

For instance, if the half-life of a radioactive substance is $10$ years, we can determine the decay constant by substituting the half-life into the formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{0.693}{10} = 0.0693 \text{ per year}
$$

This calculation indicates that approximately $6.93\%$ of the remaining radioactive atoms will decay each year.

A solid understanding of the decay constant is essential in fields such as physics and chemistry, as it enables predictions about how long a radioactive substance will remain active. Moreover, it is crucial in applications like carbon dating, where scientists estimate the age of ancient artifacts by analyzing the decay of carbon-14.
