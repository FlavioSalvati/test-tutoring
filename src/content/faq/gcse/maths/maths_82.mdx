The upper bound of $345$ rounded to the nearest ten is $350$.

When we discuss rounding numbers, it is essential to identify both upper and lower bounds. The upper bound represents the highest value that a number can take and still round to a specific place value without altering the rounded result. In this instance, we are rounding $345$ to the nearest ten.

To round $345$ to the nearest ten, we examine the digit in the units place, which is $5$. According to standard rounding rules, if this digit is $5$ or greater, we round up. Consequently, $345$ rounded to the nearest ten is $350$.

Next, to determine the upper bound, we must identify the highest possible value that would still round down to $350$. Any number just below $355$ fulfills this criterion, as $355$ itself would round up to $360$. Therefore, the upper bound can be expressed as $354.999...$ (continuing indefinitely with $9$s). However, for practical purposes, we often round this to the nearest whole number, making $355$ the smallest integer that still rounds to $350$ when rounded to the nearest ten.

Understanding upper and lower bounds is crucial in various real-world applications, such as measurements and estimations, where precision is vital. This knowledge ensures that calculations and results are as accurate as possible within specified constraints.
