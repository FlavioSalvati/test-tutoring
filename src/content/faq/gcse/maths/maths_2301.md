The domain of the function $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $ consists of all real numbers except for $ x = 0 $.

To elaborate, the domain of a function is defined as the set of all possible input values (or $ x $-values) that the function can accept. For the specific function $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $, we need to identify when the function becomes undefined. A fraction is considered undefined when its denominator equals zero, as division by zero is not permitted in mathematics. Consequently, $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $ is undefined at the point $ x = 0 $.

To determine the domain, we must exclude the value that causes the denominator to be zero. In this instance, the only number that does so is $ x = 0 $. Therefore, the domain of $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $ includes all real numbers except for zero. In interval notation, this is expressed as 

$$ 
(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty) 
$$ 

This notation indicates that the domain encompasses all numbers from negative infinity up to zero (excluding zero) and from zero to positive infinity (again, excluding zero).

Understanding the domain is essential because it delineates the range of $ x $-values for which the function yields valid outputs. For the function $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x} $, any real number except for zero can be substituted into the function to produce a valid result. This concept is fundamental in various areas of mathematics and is key to accurately analyzing and graphing functions.
