Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental principle used to determine the length of a side in a right-angled triangle. 

According to Pythagoras' Theorem, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Here, $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides.

### Example: Height of a Ladder

Consider a practical scenario where you need to determine the height of a ladder resting against a wall. If you know the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall and the length of the ladder itself, you can apply Pythagoras' Theorem effectively. 

Suppose the ladder has a length of $5$ meters and the base is $3$ meters away from the wall. You can establish the following equation based on the theorem:

$$
3^2 + b^2 = 5^2
$$

By solving this equation, you start with:

$$
9 + b^2 = 25
$$

Subtracting $9$ from both sides yields:

$$
b^2 = 16
$$

Taking the square root gives:

$$
b = 4 \text{ meters}
$$

Thus, the height of the ladder against the wall is $4$ meters.

### Example: Diagonal Distance Across a Park

Another practical application of Pythagoras' Theorem is in finding the shortest path across a rectangular park. If you need to walk diagonally and know the park's dimensions, you can compute the diagonal distance. 

For instance, if the park is $6$ meters wide and $8$ meters long, you can find the diagonal distance $d$ using the equation:

$$
6^2 + 8^2 = d^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
36 + 64 = d^2
$$

So, we have:

$$
d^2 = 100
$$

Taking the square root, we find:

$$
d = 10 \text{ meters}
$$

### Conclusion

Pythagoras' Theorem is a powerful mathematical tool applicable to a variety of practical problems involving right-angled triangles. Mastering this theorem is essential for students preparing for GCSE Maths, as it equips them with the skills to solve real-world problems effectively.
