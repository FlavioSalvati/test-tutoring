To graph the equation $ y = x + 3 $, you will need to plot specific points derived from the equation, draw a straight line through these points, and label the axes appropriately.

First, it's important to recognize that $ y = x + 3 $ represents a linear equation, which indicates that its graph will be a straight line. This equation is formatted in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ denotes the slope (or gradient) and $ c $ signifies the y-intercept. In this case, we have $ m = 1 $ and $ c = 3 $. Consequently, the line intersects the y-axis at the point $ (0, 3) $ and possesses a slope of 1, which means that for every 1 unit it moves to the right, it rises by 1 unit.

To begin, plot the y-intercept. Locate the point where $ x = 0 $ and $ y = 3 $ on the graph, and mark this point clearly. Next, use the slope to identify another point. Given that the slope is 1, starting from the point $ (0, 3) $, move 1 unit to the right to $ x = 1 $ and then 1 unit up to $ y = 4 $. Plot this point at $ (1, 4) $.

For greater accuracy, let's add a third point. From $ (1, 4) $, move 1 unit to the right to $ x = 2 $ and then 1 unit up to $ y = 5 $. Mark this point at $ (2, 5) $.

Now, take a ruler and draw a straight line that passes through all the plotted points. Extend this line across the graph to ensure it intersects all the points you have marked. Finally, don't forget to label the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical) and to indicate the scale. This labeling is crucial for anyone interpreting the graph, as it clearly conveys that the plotted line represents the equation $ y = x + 3 $.
