A histogram is a graphical representation that illustrates the frequency distribution of a dataset, indicating how often each range of values occurs.

To interpret a histogram, begin by examining the horizontal axis, which represents the various ranges or intervals of the data, known as bins. The vertical axis displays the frequency, which refers to the number of data points that fall within each bin. The height of each bar reflects the frequency of data within that specific bin.

Next, analyze the shape of the histogram. If the bars are approximately the same height, the data is uniformly distributed. Conversely, if the bars create a peak in the center and gradually decrease towards the edges, the data follows a normal distribution, resembling a bell curve. If one side has taller bars that gradually decline towards the other, the data is skewed. A right-skewed histogram features a longer tail on the right, while a left-skewed histogram has a longer tail on the left.

Additionally, pay attention to any gaps or outliers within the histogram. Gaps indicate ranges where no data points exist, while outliers are bars that stand apart from the majority, representing unusually high or low values.

Finally, consider the spread and central tendency of the data. The spread reveals how much the data varies, while the central tendency indicates where most data points are concentrated. Understanding these aspects can help you grasp the overall distribution and identify any patterns or trends within the dataset.
