The slope of the line represented by the equation 

$$ 
y = 5x - 2 
$$ 

is $ 5 $.

In this equation, the slope is indicated by the coefficient of $ x $. This equation is in the slope-intercept form, which is generally expressed as 

$$ 
y = mx + c 
$$ 

where $ m $ denotes the slope, and $ c $ represents the y-interceptâ€”the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

To clarify why the slope is $ 5 $, let's analyze it further. The slope $ m $ reflects the steepness and direction of the line. A positive slope signifies that the line rises as it moves from left to right, whereas a negative slope indicates a decline. In our case, a slope of $ 5 $ implies that for every $ 1 $ unit you move to the right along the x-axis, the line ascends by $ 5 $ units on the y-axis. This steepness indicates a notably steep incline.

The y-intercept, which is $ -2 $ in this equation, indicates that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, -2) $. While this information is valuable for graphing the line, it does not influence the slope itself. The slope remains constant, irrespective of the line's intersection with the y-axis.

Comprehending the concept of slope is essential for analyzing the behavior of lines on a graph. It aids in predicting how variations in $ x $ will impact $ y $, a fundamental notion in algebra and coordinate geometry.
