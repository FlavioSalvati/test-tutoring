To simplify the expression $(2^3) \times (2^2)$, we can apply the principle of adding exponents, which gives us:

$$
2^{3+2} = 2^5.
$$

When multiplying numbers with the same base, the exponents can be combined by adding them. In this scenario, the base is $2$. The expression $(2^3) \times (2^2)$ represents the multiplication of $2^3$ (which means $2$ raised to the power of $3$) and $2^2$ (meaning $2$ raised to the power of $2$).

According to the laws of indices, also known as the laws of exponents, when multiplying two powers that share the same base, you simply add their exponents. Thus, you take the exponent from $2^3$, which is $3$, and the exponent from $2^2$, which is $2$, and combine them:

$$
3 + 2 = 5.
$$

Consequently, the expression $(2^3) \times (2^2)$ simplifies down to:

$$
2^{3+2} = 2^5.
$$

If you wish to compute the numerical value of $2^5$, you would find that it equals $32$, since:

$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 32.
$$

This method of adding exponents is applicable only when the bases are identical. If the bases differ, a different approach must be taken. Keeping this rule in mind can greatly simplify your work with indices and enhance your efficiency in solving related problems.
