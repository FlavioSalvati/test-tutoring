The number $0.999$ when rounded to one decimal place becomes $1.0$.

When we round numbers, we pay attention to the digit immediately after the place to which we're rounding. In this case, since we're rounding to one decimal place, the digit in the hundredths place is our point of focus. The number $0.999$ consists of the digits $9$, $9$, and $9$. The first $9$ occupies the tenths place, the second $9$ sits in the hundredths place, and the last $9$ is in the thousandths place.

In order to round to the nearest tenth, we assess the digit in the hundredths place, which in this case is the second $9$. As per standard rounding rules, if this digit is $5$ or more, we increase the digit in the tenths place by one. Given that the hundredths digit is $9$, which is certainly greater than $5$, we consequently increase the number in the tenths place from $9$ to $10$. Nevertheless, since $10$ isn't a single digit, it results in a carry-over, thereby transforming the number into $1.0$.

This procedure guarantees that $0.999$, when rounded to a single decimal place, becomes $1.0$. This might appear unexpected initially, but it is in line with standard mathematical rounding rules. Understanding these rules is fundamental for accurately rounding numbers in a variety of mathematical applications.
