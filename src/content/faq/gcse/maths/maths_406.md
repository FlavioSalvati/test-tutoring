To calculate the volume of a pyramid, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
$$

To elaborate, the volume of a pyramid is computed by multiplying the area of its base by its height and then dividing the result by three. This formula is applicable to any pyramid, regardless of the shape of its base, provided that you know both the base area and the height.

In this particular example, the base area of the pyramid is given as $20 \, \text{cm}^2$, and the height is $9 \, \text{cm}$. By substituting these values into the formula, we derive:

$$
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times 20 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 9 \, \text{cm}
$$

First, we calculate the product of the base area and the height:

$$
20 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 9 \, \text{cm} = 180 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

Next, we divide this result by 3:

$$
180 \, \text{cm}^3 \div 3 = 60 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is $60 \, \text{cm}^3$. This method effectively accounts for the three-dimensional space within the pyramid, reflecting its tapering shape from the base to the apex.
