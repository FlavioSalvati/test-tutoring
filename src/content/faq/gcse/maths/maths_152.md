Exponential growth and logarithms are fundamentally inverse functions; in essence, logarithms reverse the effects of exponential growth.

Exponential growth occurs when a quantity increases by a constant percentage over equal intervals of time. For example, if you start with £100 and it grows at a rate of 10% per year, after one year, the total will be £110; after two years, it will reach £121, and so forth. This type of growth can be mathematically represented by the formula:

$$ y = a \cdot b^x $$

where:
- $ a $ is the initial amount,
- $ b $ is the growth factor, and
- $ x $ is the number of time intervals.

In contrast, logarithms are utilized to determine the exponent to which a base number must be raised to achieve a specific value. For instance, if you wish to calculate how many years it will take for your £100 to grow to £200 with a 10% annual growth rate, you would employ a logarithm. The logarithmic function can be expressed as:

$$ \log_b(y) = x $$

where:
- $ b $ is the base,
- $ y $ is the resultant value, and
- $ x $ is the exponent.

To put it simply, while exponential growth informs you of the amount of increase over time, logarithms enable you to work backwards to determine the time required to reach a particular amount. For example, if the equation $ y = 2^x $ describes exponential growth, then the corresponding logarithmic expression would be $ x = \log_2(y) $. 

This relationship is essential in various fields of mathematics and science, as it provides a means to solve problems related to growth and decay, including but not limited to population dynamics, radioactive decay, and financial interest calculations.
