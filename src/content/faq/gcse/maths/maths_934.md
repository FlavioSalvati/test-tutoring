The graph of the function $ y = \cos(x + \pi) $ can be understood as a leftward shift of the graph of $ y = \cos(x) $ by $ \pi $ units.

To grasp this concept, let's first revisit the fundamental shape of the cosine graph. The graph of $ y = \cos(x) $ is characterized by a wave that begins at its maximum value of 1 when $ x = 0 $, descends to -1, and then ascends back to 1, completing one full cycle every $ 2\pi $ units along the x-axis. This wave pattern continues to repeat indefinitely in both directions.

When we introduce $ \pi $ into the argument of the cosine function, it results in a horizontal shift. Specifically, the equation $ y = \cos(x + \pi) $ indicates that every point on the graph of $ y = \cos(x) $ is displaced $ \pi $ units to the left. This occurs because adding a positive value inside the function's argument (in this instance, $ \pi $) shifts the graph in the negative direction along the x-axis.

To visualize this transformation, imagine taking the entire graph of $ y = \cos(x) $ and sliding it leftward by $ \pi $ units. For instance, the peak that originally occurs at $ x = 0 $ will now be found at $ x = -\pi $. Likewise, the trough that once appeared at $ x = \pi $ will now be positioned at $ x = 0 $.

In conclusion, while the graph of $ y = \cos(x + \pi) $ maintains the same wave shape and amplitude as that of $ y = \cos(x) $, it is shifted to the left by $ \pi $ units. This horizontal shift does not alter the period or the height of the wave; it simply changes its location along the x-axis.
