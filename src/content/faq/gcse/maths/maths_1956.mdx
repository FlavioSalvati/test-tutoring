The percentage $150\%$ can be expressed as a decimal by converting it to $1.5$.

To convert a percentage to a decimal, you simply divide the percentage by $100$. This is because the term "percent" literally means "per hundred." Therefore, $150\%$ can be interpreted as $150$ per $100$. When you perform the division of $150$ by $100$, the result is $1.5$.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to the conversion:

1. Begin with the percentage: $150\%$.
2. Eliminate the percentage sign, leaving you with the number $150$.
3. Divide $150$ by $100$.
4. The calculation $150 \div 100$ yields $1.5$.

Thus, $150\%$ is equivalent to $1.5$ in decimal form. This conversion method is applicable to any percentage. For instance, $75\%$ converts to $0.75$ (since $75 \div 100$), and $200\%$ converts to $2.0$ (as $200 \div 100$).

Understanding how to convert percentages to decimals is valuable in various areas of mathematics, such as probability, statistics, and financial calculations. For example, a $150\%$ increase implies that a quantity has grown to $1.5$ times its original size. This knowledge is also essential when working with percentages in mathematical equations and when comparing different values.
