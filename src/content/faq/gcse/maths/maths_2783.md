To determine an angle using the sine rule, the first step is to rearrange the formula to isolate the sine of the desired angle.

The sine rule, also referred to as the law of sines, establishes that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle remains constant. The formula is expressed as:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
$$

In this equation, $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ represent the lengths of the triangle's sides, while $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ denote the angles opposite those respective sides.

To find an angle, for example $ A $, you will need the lengths of sides $ a $ and $ b $, as well as the measure of angle $ B $. You can rearrange the sine rule to express $\sin A$ as follows:

$$
\sin A = \frac{a \cdot \sin B}{b}
$$

After calculating $\sin A$, you can use the inverse sine function (also known as arcsine) to determine the angle $ A $:

$$
A = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{a \cdot \sin B}{b} \right)
$$

Ensure that your calculator is set to the appropriate mode (either degrees or radians) depending on the requirements of your problem. This approach enables you to find an unknown angle when you know two sides and an angle that is not included between them. It's important to note that the sine rule is especially beneficial for solving non-right-angled triangles, where alternative trigonometric methods such as Pythagoras' theorem do not apply.
