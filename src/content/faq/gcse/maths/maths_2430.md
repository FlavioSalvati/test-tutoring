The equation of a line that is parallel to $ y = 3x + 5 $ and passes through the point $ (1, 2) $ is given by $ y = 3x - 1 $.

To derive the equation of a line parallel to a specified line, it is important to note that parallel lines share the same slope (gradient). In this case, the line $ y = 3x + 5 $ has a slope of $ 3 $. Consequently, any line that is parallel to this line will also have a slope of $ 3 $.

We can employ the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is expressed as:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

In this formula, $ m $ represents the slope, and $ (x_1, y_1) $ is a specific point on the line. For our scenario, we have $ m = 3 $ and the point $ (1, 2) $.

By substituting these values into the point-slope form, we obtain:

$$
y - 2 = 3(x - 1)
$$

Next, we will simplify this equation to convert it into the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $:

1. Start with the equation:
   $$
   y - 2 = 3(x - 1)
   $$

2. Distributing the $ 3 $ on the right side:
   $$
   y - 2 = 3x - 3
   $$

3. Adding $ 2 $ to both sides:
   $$
   y = 3x - 3 + 2
   $$

4. Simplifying the right side:
   $$
   y = 3x - 1
   $$

Thus, the equation of the line parallel to $ y = 3x + 5 $ that passes through the point $ (1, 2) $ is $ y = 3x - 1 $.
