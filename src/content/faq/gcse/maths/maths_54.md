The mathematical expression $(3^2 \times 3^4)$ can be simplified by leveraging the laws of exponents. These laws stipulate that when you multiply numbers sharing the same base, you can simplify the expression by summing the exponents. 

In this particular instance, both terms have the base 3. The first term, $3^2$, signifies 3 raised to the power of 2, while the second term, $3^4$, stands for 3 raised to the power of 4.

Following the rule for multiplying powers sharing a common base, the exponents are added together. Hence, the exponent from $3^2$ (which is 2) and the exponent from $3^4$ (which is 4) are summed: $2 + 4 = 6$. This results in $3^6$.

To comprehend why this rule holds, consider what each term represents. $3^2$ translates to $3 \times 3$, and $3^4$ to $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$. When these are multiplied together, you get $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$, which equates to six 3s being multiplied together, or $3^6$.

Thus, $(3^2 \times 3^4)$ simplifies to $3^6$, a significantly more digestible form. If you require the numerical value, you can compute $3^6$ as $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 729$.
