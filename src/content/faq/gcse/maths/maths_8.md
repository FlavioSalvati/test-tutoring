A recurring decimal, also referred to as a repeating decimal, is a decimal number in which a digit or a group of digits repeats infinitely.

In mathematics, recurring decimals represent numbers that cannot be expressed as finite decimals. For example, the fraction $\frac{1}{3}$ corresponds to the decimal $0.333...$, where the digit '3' continues indefinitely. This is commonly denoted as $0.\overline{3}$ to indicate that the '3' is repeating. Similarly, the fraction $\frac{2}{7}$ is equivalent to the decimal $0.285714285714...$, where the sequence '285714' recurs infinitely. This can be expressed as $0.\overline{285714}$.

To identify recurring decimals, one can use long division. When dividing the numerator by the denominator, if a remainder begins to repeat, it signifies that the digits will also start to repeat. For instance, dividing $1$ by $7$ results in $0.142857142857...$, where '142857' is the repeating sequence.

It is crucial to distinguish between terminating and recurring decimals. A terminating decimal has a finite number of digits after the decimal point, such as $0.5$ or $0.75$. In contrast, a recurring decimal extends infinitely with a repeating pattern.

Understanding recurring decimals is essential for GCSE Maths, as it helps in recognizing patterns and converting between fractions and decimals. Furthermore, this knowledge lays the groundwork for more advanced mathematical concepts, such as sequences and series. It is important to note that any fraction whose denominator is not a factor of $10$ will yield either a terminating decimal or a recurring decimal.
