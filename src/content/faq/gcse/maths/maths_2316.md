The x-coordinate of the point $(-4, 5)$ is $-4$.

In a coordinate system, each point is represented by an ordered pair $(x, y)$. The first number in this pair, $x$, is known as the x-coordinate, while the second number, $y$, is referred to as the y-coordinate. The x-coordinate indicates how far to move left or right from the origin $(0, 0)$, whereas the y-coordinate indicates how far to move up or down.

For the specific point $(-4, 5)$, the x-coordinate is $-4$. This means you would move 4 units to the left of the origin. The negative sign signifies that the movement is to the left; conversely, a positive x-coordinate would indicate a movement to the right.

Understanding coordinates is essential for plotting points on a graph and analyzing their positions. The x-coordinate is always the first value in the pair, which makes it straightforward to identify. In this instance, the point $(-4, 5)$ is located in the second quadrant of the Cartesian plane, where x-values are negative and y-values are positive.
