The probability scale ranges from $0$ to $1$. Here, $0$ signifies that an event is impossible, while $1$ indicates that an event is certain.

In probability theory, we utilize this scale to quantify the likelihood of an event occurring. The scale begins at $0$ and extends to $1$. When an event has a probability of $0$, it implies that the event cannot happen under any circumstances. Conversely, if an event has a probability of $1$, it means the event will definitely occur.

For instance, consider a standard six-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than $6$ is $0$, as this outcome is impossible. In contrast, the probability of rolling a number between $1$ and $6$ is $1$, since any roll will certainly yield one of those numbers.

Probabilities that fall between $0$ and $1$ reflect varying degrees of likelihood. For example, a probability of $0.5$ suggests an equal chance of the event occurring or not occurring, similar to flipping a fair coin and landing heads. Probabilities that are closer to $0$ indicate that the event is unlikely, while those nearer to $1$ suggest a higher likelihood of occurrence.

Understanding this probability scale is crucial for analyzing and predicting outcomes in a wide range of scenarios, from simple games to complex real-world situations. It is a fundamental concept in GCSE Mathematics and is essential for tackling problems related to chance and uncertainty.
