-------------------------
To graph the function $ y = \sin(x) $, begin by plotting the sine values for $ x $ ranging from $ 0 $ to $ 2\pi $ and connecting these points smoothly.

First, it's important to note that the sine function, denoted as $ \sin(x) $, is periodic with a period of $ 2\pi $. This characteristic indicates that the graph will repeat itself every $ 2\pi $ units along the $ x $-axis. The basic shape of the sine curve resembles a smooth, wave-like pattern that oscillates above and below the $ x $-axis.

Begin by setting up a coordinate system with the $ x $-axis extending from $ 0 $ to $ 2\pi $ (approximately $ 6.28 $) and the $ y $-axis ranging from $ -1 $ to $ 1 $. This selection is crucial because the values of $ \sin(x) $ always fall within the interval $ [-1, 1] $.

Next, identify and plot key points where the sine function takes on specific values:
- At $ x = 0 $, we have $ \sin(0) = 0 $.
- At $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} $ (approximately $ 1.57 $), it holds that $ \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1 $.
- At $ x = \pi $ (approximately $ 3.14 $), we find $ \sin(\pi) = 0 $.
- At $ x = \frac{3\pi}{2} $ (approximately $ 4.71 $), it follows that $ \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -1 $.
- Finally, at $ x = 2\pi $, we have $ \sin(2\pi) = 0 $.

After plotting these critical points, connect them with a smooth curve. The curve should begin at the origin $(0,0)$, rise to the point $\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, 1\right)$, descend back to $(\pi, 0)$, continue down to $\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, -1\right)$, and ultimately return to $(2\pi, 0)$. This sequence represents one complete cycle of the sine wave.

For a more refined graph, consider plotting additional points between the key points, such as at $ x = \frac{\pi}{4} $ and $ x = \frac{3\pi}{4} $, and compute their corresponding sine values. This approach will enhance the accuracy of your curve. Remember,
