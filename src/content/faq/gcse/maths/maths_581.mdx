The interquartile range (IQR) is a statistical measure that quantifies the spread of the middle 50% of a dataset.

The IQR is a valuable statistic because it helps us understand the variability within a dataset by concentrating on the central portion, which is less susceptible to the influence of extreme values or outliers. To compute the IQR, we first need to determine the first quartile ($Q_1$) and the third quartile ($Q_3$). The first quartile is defined as the median of the lower half of the data, while the third quartile is the median of the upper half. The IQR itself is calculated by subtracting $Q_1$ from $Q_3$, as expressed by the formula:

$$
IQR = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

For instance, consider a dataset of exam scores: $55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100$. First, we find the median, which is $75$. The lower half of the data consists of $55, 60, 65, 70$, and the upper half is $80, 85, 90, 95, 100$. The median of the lower half, denoted as $Q_1$, is $65$, and the median of the upper half, denoted as $Q_3$, is $90$. Consequently, we calculate the IQR as follows:

$$
IQR = 90 - 65 = 25
$$

The IQR is particularly advantageous because it provides a measure of spread that is not influenced by outliers. This characteristic makes it a more reliable indicator of variability, especially for skewed distributions or datasets containing extreme values. By focusing on the middle 50% of the data, the IQR offers a clearer insight into where the majority of the data points lie and how dispersed they are.
