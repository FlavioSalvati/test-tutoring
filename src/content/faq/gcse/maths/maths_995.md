To determine the midpoint of a line segment, you simply need to calculate the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of its endpoints.

To elaborate, the midpoint is defined as the point that lies exactly halfway between the two endpoints of a line segment. If you have a line segment with endpoints at coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the midpoint can be found using the midpoint formula:

$$
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
$$

This formula indicates that you should add the x-coordinates of the two endpoints and then divide the sum by 2 to obtain the x-coordinate of the midpoint. Similarly, you add the y-coordinates of the endpoints and divide by 2 to find the y-coordinate of the midpoint.

For instance, if the endpoints of your line segment are $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 7)$, you would compute the midpoint as follows:

1. Calculate the average of the x-coordinates: 
   $$\frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3$$
   
2. Calculate the average of the y-coordinates: 
   $$\frac{3 + 7}{2} = 5$$

Therefore, the midpoint of the line segment is $(3, 5)$.

This method is effective because the midpoint represents the "center" point of the line segment, equally balancing the distances from each endpoint. It is a straightforward calculation that is applicable in various contexts, including geometry problems, graphing, and real-world scenarios such as determining the center point between two locations.
