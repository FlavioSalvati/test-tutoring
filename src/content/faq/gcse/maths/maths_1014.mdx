The equation of a line parallel to $ y = 3x + 4 $ through $ (0, 1) $ is $ y = 3x + 1 $.

To understand why, let's first recall that parallel lines have the same gradient (or slope). The given line $ y = 3x + 4 $ has a gradient of 3. This means any line parallel to it must also have a gradient of 3.

Next, we need to find the specific line that passes through the point $ (0, 1) $. The general form of a straight line equation is $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ is the gradient and $ c $ is the y-intercept. Since we know the gradient $ m $ is 3, our equation so far is $ y = 3x + c $.

To find $ c $, we use the point $ (0, 1) $. Substituting $ x = 0 $ and $ y = 1 $ into the equation $ y = 3x + c $, we get:
$$ 1 = 3(0) + c $$
$$ 1 = c $$

So, the y-intercept $ c $ is 1. Therefore, the equation of the line parallel to $ y = 3x + 4 $ that passes through $ (0, 1) $ is $ y = 3x + 1 $.

This method can be applied to find the equation of any line parallel to a given line, as long as you know a point through which the new line passes. Just remember to keep the gradient the same and solve for the y-intercept using the given point.
