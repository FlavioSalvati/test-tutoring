To convert $7000$ metres to kilometres, you simply divide the number of metres by $1000$. This calculation yields a result of $7$ kilometres.

To elaborate, the metric system is structured around units of ten, which simplifies the conversion process. The metre serves as the base unit of length within this system, while the kilometre represents a larger unit meant for measuring greater distances. The prefix 'kilo-' signifies a factor of one thousand, indicating that one kilometre is equivalent to one thousand metres.

The conversion from metres to kilometres involves dividing the number of metres by $1000$. Given that there are $1000$ metres in one kilometre, the conversion for $7000$ metres is performed as follows:

$$
7000 \, \text{metres} \div 1000 = 7 \, \text{kilometres}
$$

Thus, $7000$ metres is equal to $7$ kilometres. This conversion method is applicable to any quantity of metres you wish to convert to kilometresâ€”simply remember to divide by $1000$, and you will obtain your result in kilometres.
