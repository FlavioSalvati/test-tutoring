To determine the surface area of similar cylinders, you can utilize the ratio of their corresponding dimensions squared.

When examining similar cylinders, their corresponding dimensions, such as height and radius, maintain a proportional relationship. If you know the surface area of one cylinder along with the ratio of the dimensions between the two cylinders, you can calculate the surface area of the other cylinder.

Let's denote the ratio of the corresponding dimensions of the two similar cylinders as $ k $. This implies that if the radius of the first cylinder is $ r_1 $ and the radius of the second cylinder is $ r_2 $, then the relationship can be expressed as:

$$
r_2 = k \cdot r_1
$$

This same ratio applies to their heights as well.

The surface area $ A $ of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi r (r + h)
$$

where $ r $ represents the radius and $ h $ the height.

For two similar cylinders, if the surface area of the first cylinder is denoted as $ A_1 $ and that of the second cylinder as $ A_2 $, the relationship between their surface areas can be expressed as:

$$
A_2 = k^2 \cdot A_1
$$

This relationship holds true because surface area is a two-dimensional measure. When you scale the dimensions of a shape by a factor of $ k $, the surface area scales by $ k^2 $.

For instance, consider the case where the ratio of the dimensions between two similar cylinders is $ 3:1 $, and the surface area of the smaller cylinder is $ 50 \, \text{cm}^2 $. The surface area of the larger cylinder can be calculated as follows:

$$
A_2 = 3^2 \cdot 50 = 9 \cdot 50 = 450 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Thus, by understanding the ratio of the dimensions and applying the square of that ratio, you can efficiently compute the surface area of similar cylinders.
