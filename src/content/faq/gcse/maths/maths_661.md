To determine the square root of a decimal, you can either use a calculator or apply the long division method.

Calculating the square root of a decimal may initially appear daunting, but it can be easily accomplished with the right techniques. The most efficient approach is to use a scientific calculator. Simply input the decimal number and press the square root button (âˆš). This will provide you with the square root quickly and accurately.

If you don't have access to a calculator, you can utilize the long division method, which, while more manual, is also quite effective. Begin by placing the decimal number under a square root symbol. Pair the digits on either side of the decimal point, moving both left and right. For instance, with the decimal $0.36$, you would pair the digits as $36$.

Next, identify the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the first paired digits. Write this number above the square root symbol. Subtract its square from the first pair and then bring down the next pair of digits. Double the number you wrote above the square root symbol and write it down with a blank space next to it. Find a digit to fill in this blank that, when multiplied by the new number, yields a product that is less than or equal to the current remainder. Continue this process iteratively until you achieve the desired level of precision.

By mastering these techniques, you will be well-equipped to confidently calculate the square roots of decimal numbers, whether using a calculator or performing the calculations by hand.
