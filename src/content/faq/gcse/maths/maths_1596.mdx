When comparing data sets, a common approach is to examine their means, which are the average values of the data sets. This allows us to identify differences or similarities between them.

The mean, or average, serves as a useful measure of central tendency. It encapsulates the entire data set with a single value, facilitating easier comparisons across different sets. To compute the mean, you sum all the values in the data set and divide by the number of values. For instance, consider a data set of test scores: $70$, $80$, $90$, and $100$. The mean is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{70 + 80 + 90 + 100}{4} = 85.
$$

Once you have determined the means of the data sets you wish to compare, you can analyze these average values to assess differences. If one data set has a higher mean than another, it indicates that, on average, the values in that set are greater. Conversely, a lower mean suggests that the values are generally lower. For example, if the mean test score for Class A is $85$ and for Class B is $75$, you can conclude that Class A performed better on average.

However, it is crucial to remember that the mean alone does not provide a complete understanding of the data. It does not account for the spread or variability within the data sets. Two data sets may have the same mean yet exhibit significantly different ranges or standard deviations. Therefore, while the mean serves as a valuable starting point for comparison, it is essential to consider additional statistical measures to obtain a more comprehensive view of the data.
