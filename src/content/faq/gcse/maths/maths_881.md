To determine an angle using the sine rule, you will need to rearrange the formula based on the side lengths and angles that are provided.

The sine rule asserts that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle remains constant. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
$$

In this equation, $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle, while $A$, $B$, and $C$ denote the angles that are opposite those respective sides.

To find an unknown angle, you must know at least one side length and its corresponding opposite angle, in addition to another side length. For example, if you have the lengths of sides $a$ and $b$, along with the measure of angle $A$, you can calculate angle $B$ by rearranging the sine rule as follows:

$$
\sin B = \frac{b \cdot \sin A}{a}
$$

With this equation, you can compute $\sin B$. To find the measure of angle $B$, you will then apply the inverse sine function, commonly referred to as arcsine:

$$
B = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{b \cdot \sin A}{a} \right)
$$

Make sure that your calculator is set to the correct mode (either degrees or radians) according to the requirements of your specific problem. This method is particularly effective for determining unknown angles in non-right-angled triangles, making it a valuable tool in various geometric and trigonometric applications.
