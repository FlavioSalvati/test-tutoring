To substitute the value $5$ for the variable $t$ in the expression $9t - 4$, you will replace $t$ with $5$ and simplify the expression accordingly.

When you substitute a value into an algebraic expression, you essentially replace the variable with the specified number. In this instance, the expression is $9t - 4$, and you will substitute $t$ with $5$. Begin by rewriting the expression with $5$ in place of $t$: 

$$
9(5) - 4.
$$

Next, perform the multiplication: $9$ multiplied by $5$ equals $45$. Thus, the expression now becomes:

$$
45 - 4.
$$

Finally, subtract $4$ from $45$ to obtain the result:

$$
45 - 4 = 41.
$$

Therefore, when you substitute $5$ for $t$ in the expression $9t - 4$, the simplified result is $41$. This substitution process involves basic arithmetic operations—multiplication and subtraction—which are essential skills in GCSE Mathematics.
