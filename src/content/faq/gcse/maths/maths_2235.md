The graph of the function $ y = e^x $ is characterized by an upward-sloping curve that becomes increasingly steep as $ x $ increases.

The function $ y = e^x $ represents an exponential function, where $ e $ is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $2.71828$. This constant is known as Euler's number. Notably, the graph of $ y = e^x $ passes through the point $ (0, 1) $ since any number raised to the power of $0$ equals $1$. As $ x $ increases, the value of $ y $ grows rapidly, resulting in a steep ascent of the graph.

For negative values of $ x $, the graph approaches the x-axis but never intersects it. This behavior occurs because $ e $ raised to a negative exponent produces a fraction that decreases continuously, remaining positive but never reaching zero. Consequently, the graph has a horizontal asymptote at $ y = 0 $.

The graph remains entirely above the x-axis, indicating that $ y $ is always positive. This reinforces the fact that $ e^x $ is greater than zero for all real numbers $ x $. Additionally, the curve is smooth and continuous, exhibiting no breaks or gaps.

In summary, the graph of $ y = e^x $ begins just above the x-axis on the left side, passes through the point $ (0, 1) $, and then rises steeply as $ x $ increases. This graph is fundamental in mathematics, particularly in discussions related to growth and decay, and effectively illustrates the concept of exponential growth.
