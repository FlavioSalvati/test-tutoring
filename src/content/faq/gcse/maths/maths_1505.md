The probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of cards is $\frac{1}{2}$, or equivalently, $50\%$.

A standard deck contains $52$ cards, which are divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit consists of $13$ cards. Among these suits, hearts and diamonds are classified as red, while clubs and spades are classified as black. Consequently, there are $13$ hearts and $13$ diamonds, resulting in a total of $26$ red cards in the deck.

To calculate the probability of drawing a red card, you divide the number of red cards by the total number of cards in the deck. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$ 
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of red cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{26}{52} 
$$

When you simplify the fraction $\frac{26}{52}$, you arrive at $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, there is a $1$ in $2$ chance, or $50\%$, of selecting a red card from a standard deck.

In the realm of probability, this result can also be represented as a decimal or a percentage. Therefore, $\frac{1}{2}$ is equivalent to $0.5$ or $50\%$. This means that if you were to randomly select a card from the deck, you would have an equal likelihood of drawing a red card or a black card.
