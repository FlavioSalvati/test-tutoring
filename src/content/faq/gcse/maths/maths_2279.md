The range of the function $ f(x) = 2x - 1 $ encompasses all real numbers.

To grasp why the range of $ f(x) = 2x - 1 $ is indeed all real numbers, we need to analyze the function more thoroughly. This function is a linear equation, which implies that its graph is a straight line. The general form of a linear equation is given by $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. In this instance, we have $ m = 2 $ and $ c = -1 $.

A linear function such as this one places no restrictions on the values that $ x $ can assume. As $ x $ increases or decreases indefinitely, the value of $ f(x) $ (or $ y $) will similarly increase or decrease without any limit. This indicates that for any real number you select for $ y $, there exists a corresponding $ x $ value that satisfies the equation $ y = 2x - 1 $.

To illustrate this more clearly, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{y + 1}{2}.
$$

This formulation demonstrates that for any real number $ y $, you can find an $ x $ that makes the equation valid. Consequently, the function $ f(x) = 2x - 1 $ is capable of generating every possible real number as an output, confirming that its range is indeed all real numbers.

In conclusion, since the function is linear and unbounded, the range of $ f(x) = 2x - 1 $ includes every conceivable real number.
