The vector sum of two vectors, denoted as $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, is expressed as $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$.

To elaborate, vectors are mathematical entities that possess both magnitude (length) and direction. When you perform the addition of two vectors, you are effectively combining their magnitudes and directions to create a new vector. This operation is known as vector addition.

To add the vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, you begin by positioning the tail of vector $\mathbf{b}$ at the head of vector $\mathbf{a}$. The resulting vector, $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$, is then drawn from the tail of $\mathbf{a}$ to the head of $\mathbf{b}$. This technique is commonly referred to as the "tip-to-tail" method.

In terms of their components, if vector $\mathbf{a}$ is represented by the coordinates $(a_1, a_2)$ and vector $\mathbf{b}$ by the coordinates $(b_1, b_2)$, the resultant vector sum $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$ will have components given by $(a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2)$. This indicates that you simply add the corresponding components of the two vectors.

For instance, if $\mathbf{a} = (3, 4)$ and $\mathbf{b} = (1, 2)$, then the vector sum can be computed as follows:

$$
\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = (3 + 1, 4 + 2) = (4, 6).
$$

Grasping the concept of vector addition is essential in various fields of mathematics and physics, as it provides a clear and precise way to describe movements, forces, and other vector quantities.
