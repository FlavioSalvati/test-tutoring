The graph of the function $ y = \frac{1}{x^2} $ represents a curve that approaches both the x-axis and y-axis without ever intersecting them.

More specifically, the graph of $ y = \frac{1}{x^2} $ is classified as a hyperbola. It consists of two distinct branches: one located in the first quadrant and the other in the second quadrant of the Cartesian plane. As $ x $ approaches zero from either the positive or negative side, the value of $ y $ increases indefinitely, indicating that the graph ascends towards infinity. This behavior is referred to as a vertical asymptote at $ x = 0 $.

In contrast, as $ x $ moves away from zero—whether positively or negatively (i.e., as $ x $ becomes very large or very small)—the value of $ y $ approaches zero but never actually reaches it. This phenomenon is described as a horizontal asymptote at $ y = 0 $.

The graph remains entirely above the x-axis since $ y = \frac{1}{x^2} $ is positive for all values of $ x $, whether $ x $ is positive or negative. Consequently, there are no points at which the graph intersects either the x-axis or the y-axis.

In summary, the graph of $ y = \frac{1}{x^2} $ exhibits a distinctive shape with two symmetrical branches, each approaching but never touching the x-axis and y-axis. This illustrates fascinating behavior of functions in the vicinity of asymptotes and at infinity.
