To solve the equation $2x + 3 = 7$, we will first isolate the variable $x$ by performing a series of steps: subtracting $3$ from both sides and then dividing by $2$.

Let's break down the process step by step. We begin with the equation:

$$
2x + 3 = 7
$$

Our objective is to isolate $x$ on one side. The first step is to eliminate the constant term $+3$ from the left side. We can do this by subtracting $3$ from both sides of the equation:

$$
2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
2x = 4
$$

Next, we need to isolate $x$ by removing the coefficient $2$ that is multiplied by $x$. The inverse operation of multiplication is division. Therefore, we divide both sides of the equation by $2$:

$$
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{4}{2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = 2
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation $2x + 3 = 7$ is $x = 2$. To verify our solution, we can substitute $x$ with $2$ in the original equation. If both sides are equal, it confirms that our solution is correct. 

Substituting $x = 2$ into the original equation:

$$
2(2) + 3 = 7 \implies 4 + 3 = 7
$$

Since $7 = 7$, our solution $x = 2$ is indeed verified.
