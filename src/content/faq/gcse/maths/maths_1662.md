To assess the strength of correlation in a scatter diagram, you can observe how closely the data points cluster around a line.

A scatter diagram is a graphical representation that illustrates the relationship between two variables by plotting data points on a Cartesian plane. To analyze the strength of the correlation, you should examine how tightly the points are grouped around a straight line. If the points are closely aligned with the line, the correlation is considered strong. Conversely, if the points are dispersed widely and lack a clear linear pattern, the correlation is deemed weak.

There are three primary types of correlation you may encounter: positive correlation, negative correlation, and no correlation. 

- In a **positive correlation**, as one variable increases, the other variable also increases, resulting in points that slope upwards from left to right.
- In a **negative correlation**, as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, leading to points that slope downwards from left to right.
- If there is **no correlation**, the points are scattered randomly without any discernible pattern.

To quantify the strength of the correlation, you can visualize a line of best fit drawn through the data points. The closer the points are to this line, the stronger the correlation. In the case of a perfect correlation, all points would lie precisely on the line. 

In practice, a correlation coefficient can also be employed, which is a numerical measure that ranges from $-1$ (indicating a perfect negative correlation) to $+1$ (indicating a perfect positive correlation), with $0$ representing no correlation. However, for GCSE Maths, it is generally sufficient to focus on the visual proximity of the points to the line in the scatter diagram.
