To convert the decimal $0.6$ to a percentage, you multiply it by $100$, resulting in $60\%$.

When transforming a decimal into a percentage, the process is straightforward: simply multiply the decimal by $100$. This operation is rooted in the meaning of the term "percent," which translates to "per hundred." Essentially, you are determining how many parts out of $100$ the decimal represents. For instance, when you multiply $0.6$ by $100$, you arrive at $60$. Thus, we can conclude that $0.6$ expressed as a percentage is $60\%$.

To explain this further, consider $0.6$ as equivalent to $6$ tenths. When you multiply $6$ tenths by $10$, you obtain $60$ hundredths, which can be interpreted as $60$ out of $100$, or $60\%$. Another way to visualize this conversion is by shifting the decimal point two places to the right, which effectively achieves the same result as multiplying by $100$. Therefore, $0.6$ converts to $60.0$, or simply $60\%$.

This conversion method applies universally to any decimal number. For example, if you take $0.25$ and multiply it by $100$, you will get $25\%$. Similarly, multiplying $1.75$ by $100$ yields $175\%$. It is important to remember that converting decimals to percentages is a valuable skill applicable in various mathematical fields, including statistics, probability, and practical situations like calculating discounts and interest rates.
