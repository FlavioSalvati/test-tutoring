The graph of the function $y = \tan(x)$ exhibits distinct characteristics, including repeating vertical asymptotes and a wave-like pattern that passes through the origin.

One of the defining features of the graph of $y = \tan(x)$ is its vertical asymptotes, which occur at the points $x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi$, where $k$ is any integer. These lines represent values where the tangent function is undefined, and the graph approaches these lines but never touches them. Between each pair of asymptotes, the graph features a wave-like pattern that passes through the origin at the point $(0, 0)$ and repeats every $\pi$ units along the x-axis.

As the graph approaches each vertical asymptote from the left, it rises steeply from negative infinity to positive infinity. Conversely, as it approaches from the right, it falls steeply from positive infinity to negative infinity. This behavior creates a series of repeating 'S' shapes. The period of the tangent function is $\pi$, indicating that the wave-like pattern repeats every $\pi$ units.

Moreover, the graph of $y = \tan(x)$ is symmetric about the origin, which means it exhibits rotational symmetry of 180 degrees around the point $(0, 0)$. This symmetry arises because the tangent function is an odd function, satisfying the relation $\tan(-x) = -\tan(x)$.

By understanding these key characteristics, you will be able to easily identify the graph of $y = \tan(x)$ among other trigonometric functions.
