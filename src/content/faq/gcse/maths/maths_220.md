A peak on a cost-revenue graph signifies the point at which profit is maximized.

To clarify this concept, let's break it down further. A typical cost-revenue graph consists of two curves: one representing costs and the other representing revenue. The cost curve illustrates the total expenses associated with producing a specific quantity of goods or services, while the revenue curve indicates the income generated from selling those goods or services. The profit at any given point can be determined by calculating the difference between revenue and costs.

When a peak appears on this graph, it indicates that the gap between the revenue curve and the cost curve is at its maximum. This peak represents the point at which the business achieves its highest profit. Prior to reaching this peak, revenue increases at a faster rate than costs, resulting in rising profits. Conversely, after the peak, costs begin to catch up with or surpass revenue, leading to a decline in profits.

To identify this peak, one can examine the highest point on the profit curve, which is obtained by subtracting the cost curve from the revenue curve. This maximum point is essential for businesses, as it indicates the optimal production level for maximizing profit. Mathematically, this occurs where the derivative of the profit function equals zero, signifying a local maximum.

Grasping this concept enables businesses to make strategic decisions regarding production levels, pricing strategies, and resource allocation, thus ensuring they operate as profitably as possible.
