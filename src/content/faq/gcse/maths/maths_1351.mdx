The maximum value of the function $ y = \sin(x) $ is $ 1 $.

To comprehend why the highest value of $ y = \sin(x) $ is $ 1 $, it is essential to examine the characteristics of the sine function. The sine function is periodic, meaning it exhibits a repeating pattern at regular intervals. Specifically, it has a period of $ 360^\circ $ (or $ 2\pi $ radians), indicating that the function's values repeat every $ 360^\circ $.

The sine function oscillates between $ -1 $ and $ 1 $. Consequently, for any angle $ x $, the value of $ \sin(x) $ will always fall within this range. The maximum point on the sine curve is $ 1 $, which occurs at specific angles within each period. For instance, $ \sin(90^\circ) = 1 $ and $ \sin(450^\circ) = 1 $. In radian measure, this translates to $ \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1 $ and $ \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{2}\right) = 1 $.

To visualize this behavior, consider sketching the graph of $ y = \sin(x) $. The graph forms a smooth, wave-like curve, oscillating between $ 1 $ and $ -1 $. The points at which the curve reaches $ 1 $ correspond to the peaks of the wave. These peaks occur at regular intervals, specifically at:

$$
x = 90^\circ + 360^\circ k \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k,
$$

where $ k $ is any integer.

By understanding these properties, it becomes clear that the maximum value of the sine function is always $ 1 $, regardless of the angle $ x $. This characteristic is fundamental to the sine function and plays a crucial role in solving various trigonometric problems in GCSE Mathematics.
