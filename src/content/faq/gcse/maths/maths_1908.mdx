To solve the proportion $$\frac{7}{10} = \frac{14}{x}$$, we can use the technique of cross-multiplication.

In essence, solving a proportion means finding the value of an unknown variable that makes both ratios equivalent. In this case, we are given the proportion $$\frac{7}{10} = \frac{14}{x}$$. The method of cross-multiplication involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction and setting these two products equal to each other.

Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

1. **Cross-multiply the fractions**:
   $$
   7 \cdot x = 10 \cdot 14
   $$

   This simplifies to:
   $$
   7x = 140
   $$

2. **Isolate the variable** by solving for $x$. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by $7$:
   $$
   \frac{7x}{7} = \frac{140}{7}
   $$

   This simplifies to:
   $$
   x = 20
   $$

Thus, the value of $x$ that makes the proportion $$\frac{7}{10}$$ equal to $$\frac{14}{x}$$ is $20$. This approach guarantees that the two ratios remain balanced and equivalent throughout the calculation.
