To calculate 10% of a number, you can either multiply the number by $0.1$ or divide it by $10$.

Finding 10% of a number is equivalent to determining one-tenth of that number. This is because $10\%$ can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{10}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{10}$. Thus, you can use either method: multiply the number by $0.1$ (the decimal representation of $10\%$) or divide the number by $10$.

For instance, to find $10\%$ of $50$, you can multiply:

$$
50 \times 0.1 = 5
$$

Alternatively, you can divide:

$$
50 \div 10 = 5
$$

In both cases, you arrive at the same result: $5$.

This approach is applicable to any number. If you want to determine $10\%$ of $200$, you can either multiply:

$$
200 \times 0.1 = 20
$$

Or divide:

$$
200 \div 10 = 20
$$

Both methods yield the same result: $20$.

Understanding how to calculate $10\%$ is beneficial in various real-life scenarios, such as calculating discounts, tips, or any situation where you need to find a percentage of a given amount. Remember, whether you choose to multiply by $0.1$ or divide by $10$, both methods provide a quick and straightforward way to find $10\%$ of any number.
