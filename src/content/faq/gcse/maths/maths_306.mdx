To calculate the volume of a cube, you need to multiply the length of one of its sides by itself twice.

A cube is a three-dimensional geometric shape characterized by six equal square faces. To determine the volume of a cube, it is essential to know the length of one of its sides, commonly referred to as the edge length. We will denote this edge length as $s$. The formula for the volume $V$ of a cube can be expressed as:

$$
V = s \times s \times s
$$

This can be simplified to:

$$
V = s^3
$$

In this formula, you take the length of one side and multiply it by itself twice. For instance, if the edge length of a cube is $4 \, \text{cm}$, the volume can be calculated as follows:

$$
V = 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64 \, \text{cm}^3
$$

The resulting unit of volume is cubic units, which, in this example, is cubic centimeters (cmÂ³).

Understanding this formula is vital, as it illustrates how rapidly the volume of a cube increases with the edge length. For example, if you double the edge length, the volume increases by a factor of eight, since $2^3 = 8$. This exponential growth is a fundamental concept in geometry and aids in visualizing the nature of three-dimensional spaces.

It is important to remember that the volume of a cube is always expressed in cubic units, reflecting its three-dimensional characteristics. This straightforward yet powerful formula is a foundational element of GCSE Mathematics and has numerous applications in real-world scenarios, from packing boxes to constructing buildings.
