The gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by the equation $ y = 2x + 1 $ is $ -\frac{1}{2} $.

To find the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to another, it is essential to understand the relationship between their gradients. Specifically, for two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their gradients must equal $ -1 $. This fundamental property is crucial in the study of coordinate geometry.

In the equation $ y = 2x + 1 $, the gradient (or slope) of the line is represented by the coefficient of $ x $, which is $ 2 $. We can denote this gradient as $ m_1 $, thus we have:

$$
m_1 = 2
$$

Next, we will denote the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to this one as $ m_2 $. According to the condition for perpendicular lines, we have:

$$
m_1 \times m_2 = -1
$$

Substituting the value of $ m_1 $ into this equation gives us:

$$
2 \times m_2 = -1
$$

To solve for $ m_2 $, we rearrange the equation:

$$
m_2 = -\frac{1}{2}
$$

Therefore, the gradient of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = 2x + 1 $ is $ -\frac{1}{2} $. This negative reciprocal relationship guarantees that the two lines intersect at a right angle, which is the defining characteristic of perpendicular lines.
