The absolute value function in mathematics is commonly represented as "abs" or using the notation $|x|$.

In mathematical terms, the absolute value of a number quantifies its distance from zero on the number line, irrespective of direction. For instance, the absolute values of both $-3$ and $3$ are $3$. This concept is vital in numerous mathematical applications, including solving equations and analyzing functions.

On most scientific calculators, you can locate the absolute value function by searching for a button labeled "abs" or a symbol that resembles two vertical bars enclosing a number, such as $|x|$. To utilize this function, you typically input the number for which you want to find the absolute value and then press the "abs" button. For example, to determine the absolute value of $-5$, you would enter "-5" and subsequently press "abs", yielding a result of $5$.

Comprehending absolute values is essential, as they simplify complex problems, particularly those involving negative numbers. For example, when solving an equation like $|x - 2| = 5$, it is necessary to consider both positive and negative solutions. This leads to the equations $x - 2 = 5$ and $x - 2 = -5$, which result in $x = 7$ and $x = -3$.

In conclusion, the absolute value function on a calculator is an invaluable tool for quickly determining the non-negative equivalent of any number. It plays a significant role in the simplification and resolution of various mathematical problems.
