The composition of the functions $ f(x) $ and $ g(x) $ yields the following results: 

- The composition $ (f \circ g)(x) = 3x + 2 $, and 
- The composition $ (g \circ f)(x) = 3(x + 2) $.

To clarify these concepts, let's break down the process of function composition. Function composition involves applying one function to the output of another function. Given the definitions $ f(x) = x + 2 $ and $ g(x) = 3x $, we can compute two compositions: $ (f \circ g)(x) $ and $ (g \circ f)(x) $.

**Step 1: Finding $ (f \circ g)(x) $**

In this case, we apply $ g(x) $ first, followed by $ f $ to the result. Starting with $ g(x) = 3x $, we substitute this expression into $ f $:
$$
f(g(x)) = f(3x) = 3x + 2.
$$
Thus, we have:
$$
(f \circ g)(x) = 3x + 2.
$$

**Step 2: Finding $ (g \circ f)(x) $**

For this composition, we apply $ f(x) $ first and then apply $ g $ to the result. We begin with $ f(x) = x + 2 $ and substitute this into $ g $:
$$
g(f(x)) = g(x + 2) = 3(x + 2) = 3x + 6.
$$
Therefore, we find:
$$
(g \circ f)(x) = 3x + 6.
$$

**Summary**

In summary, the composition $ (f \circ g)(x) $ results in $ 3x + 2 $, while the composition $ (g \circ f)(x) $ simplifies to $ 3(x + 2) = 3x + 6 $. This illustrates how the order in which functions are applied significantly influences the final outcome.
