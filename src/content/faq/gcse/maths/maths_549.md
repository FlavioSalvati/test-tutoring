To calculate the probability of two independent events occurring together, you can simply multiply the probabilities of each event.

In probability theory, independent events are defined as events where the outcome of one does not influence the outcome of the other. For example, flipping a coin and rolling a die are independent events because the result of the coin flip does not affect the result of the die roll.

Consider two independent events, denoted as $A$ and $B$. The probability of event $A$ occurring is represented as $P(A)$, while the probability of event $B$ occurring is represented as $P(B)$. To find the probability of both events $A$ and $B$ occurring simultaneously, we use the formula:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B).
$$

For instance, if the probability of flipping a coin and landing on heads (event $A$) is $0.5$, and the probability of rolling a die and obtaining a $4$ (event $B$) is $\frac{1}{6}$, we can calculate the probability of both events occurring together as follows:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) = 0.5 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{0.5}{6} = \frac{1}{12} \approx 0.0833.
$$

This indicates that there is approximately an $8.33\%$ chance of both flipping heads and rolling a $4$. It is important to note that this multiplication method is applicable only for independent events. If the events are dependent, a different approach must be taken to calculate their combined probability.
