To graph the equation $ y = -2x + 4 $, follow these steps: plot the y-intercept, use the slope to find an additional point, and then draw the line.

First, let's determine the y-intercept of the equation $ y = -2x + 4 $. The y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. In this case, the y-intercept is $4$, indicating that the line intersects the y-axis at the point $(0, 4)$. Begin by plotting this point on your graph.

Next, we utilize the slope to identify another point on the line. The slope of the equation is $-2$. This means that for every $1$ unit you move to the right along the x-axis, you move $2$ units down along the y-axis. Starting from the y-intercept at $(0, 4)$, move $1$ unit to the right to reach the point $(1, 4)$. Then, move $2$ units down to arrive at the point $(1, 2)$. Plot this second point, $(1, 2)$, on your graph.

With these two points plotted, you can now draw the line. Use a ruler to connect the points $(0, 4)$ and $(1, 2)$ with a straight line. Extend the line in both directions and add arrows at each end to indicate that the line continues infinitely.

Finally, label the line with its equation $ y = -2x + 4 $ to complete your graph. This labeling helps anyone viewing the graph to easily identify which equation it represents.
