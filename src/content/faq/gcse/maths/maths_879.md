The area of the triangle is approximately $42.43$ square centimeters.

To determine the area of a triangle when the lengths of two sides and the included angle are known, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \times \sin(C)
$$

In this formula, $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the two sides, and $C$ is the included angle between those sides.

In our example, the lengths of the sides are $10$ cm and $12$ cm, with an included angle of $45^\circ$. By substituting these values into the formula, we obtain:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12 \times \sin(45^\circ)
$$

First, we need to calculate $\sin(45^\circ)$. The sine of $45^\circ$ is given by $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, which is approximately $0.7071$. We can now substitute this value back into the area formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12 \times 0.7071
$$

Next, we will perform the multiplication step-by-step:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 120 \times 0.7071
$$
$$
\text{Area} = 60 \times 0.7071
$$
$$
\text{Area} \approx 42.426
$$

Finally, rounding to two decimal places, we conclude that the area of the triangle is approximately $42.43$ square centimeters. This method is particularly useful in trigonometry for calculating the area of non-right-angled triangles.
