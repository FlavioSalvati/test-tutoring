A cumulative frequency curve illustrates how the total frequency accumulates as one progresses through a data set.

When examining a cumulative frequency curve, you are essentially observing the accumulation of data over time. The x-axis typically represents the data values, while the y-axis represents the cumulative frequency. As you move from left to right along the x-axis, the curve will either remain flat or ascend; it will never decline. This behavior occurs because cumulative frequency can only increase or remain constant; it cannot decrease.

A steep segment of the curve indicates that a significant number of data points are concentrated within a narrow range of values, signifying a high frequency of occurrences in that interval. In contrast, a flatter section of the curve suggests that fewer data points fall within that range, reflecting a lower frequency.

The shape of the curve provides insights into the distribution of the data. For instance, if the curve rises sharply at the beginning and then levels off, it implies that many data points are clustered at the lower end of the range. Conversely, if the curve rises slowly at first and then steepens towards the end, it indicates that many data points are concentrated at the higher end.

By analyzing the cumulative frequency curve, you can determine the median, lower quartile, and upper quartile. These metrics are crucial for understanding the spread and central tendency of the data. The median is located at the point where the curve reaches $50\%$ of the total frequency, while the lower quartile and upper quartile are found at $25\%$ and $75\%$, respectively.
