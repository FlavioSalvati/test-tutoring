The $n$th term of the sequence $5, 10, 20, 40$ can be expressed using the formula:

$$
5 \times 2^{(n-1)}.
$$

To derive this formula, let's first examine the sequence: $5, 10, 20, 40$. It is evident that each term is double the preceding term. This characteristic indicates that the sequence is geometric, where each term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor, which in this case is $2$.

In a geometric sequence, the $n$th term can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a \times r^{(n-1)},
$$

where $a$ represents the first term, and $r$ denotes the common ratio. For our specific sequence:
- The first term $a$ is $5$.
- The common ratio $r$ is $2$, as each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by $2$.

Substituting these values into the general formula yields:

$$
\text{nth term} = 5 \times 2^{(n-1)}.
$$

Let's verify this formula by calculating a few terms of the sequence:

- For $n = 1$: 
  $$
  5 \times 2^{(1-1)} = 5 \times 2^0 = 5 \times 1 = 5.
  $$

- For $n = 2$: 
  $$
  5 \times 2^{(2-1)} = 5 \times 2^1 = 5 \times 2 = 10.
  $$

- For $n = 3$: 
  $$
  5 \times 2^{(3-1)} = 5 \times 2^2 = 5 \times 4 = 20.
  $$

- For $n = 4$: 
  $$
  5 \times 2^{(4-1)} = 5 \times 2^3 = 5 \times 8 = 40.
  $$

As shown, the formula $5 \times 2^{(n-1)}$ accurately generates the terms of the sequence. This approach can be applied to any geometric sequence to determine its $n$th term.
