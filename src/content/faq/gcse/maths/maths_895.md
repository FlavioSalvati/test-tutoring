The $ n $th term of the sequence $ 4, 8, 12, 16 $ can be expressed using the formula $ 4n $.

To determine the $ n $th term of a sequence, it is essential to identify the underlying pattern or rule that governs the sequence. In this case, the sequence $ 4, 8, 12, 16 $ is classified as an arithmetic sequence, meaning that each term increases by a consistent amount. Specifically, each term in this sequence increases by $ 4 $.

To derive the formula for the $ n $th term, we start by recognizing that the first term $ a $ is $ 4 $. The common difference $ d $ between consecutive terms is also $ 4 $. The general formula for the $ n $th term of an arithmetic sequence is expressed as:

$$
a_n = a + (n - 1)d
$$

By substituting the values of $ a $ and $ d $ into this formula, we get:

$$
a_n = 4 + (n - 1) \times 4
$$

Next, we simplify the expression:

$$
a_n = 4 + 4n - 4
$$
$$
a_n = 4n
$$

Thus, the $ n $th term of the sequence is $ 4n $. For instance, if you wish to find the 5th term, you can substitute $ n $ with $ 5 $:

$$
a_5 = 4 \times 5 = 20
$$

This formula provides a quick and efficient method for calculating any term in the sequence.
