The slope of the linear equation $ y = -4x + 9 $ is $ -4 $.

To find the slope of the equation $ y = -4x + 9 $, we need to focus on the coefficient of $ x $. In the standard form of a linear equation, $ y = mx + c $, the variable $ m $ denotes the slope, while $ c $ represents the y-intercept. The given equation is already expressed in slope-intercept form, where $ m $ is the coefficient multiplying $ x $.

In the equation $ y = -4x + 9 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ -4 $. Therefore, the slope $ m $ is $ -4 $. The slope provides insight into the steepness and direction of the line; a negative slope indicates that the line descends as it moves from left to right. Specifically, for every $ 1 $ unit you advance to the right along the x-axis, the value of $ y $ decreases by $ 4 $ units.

Grasping the concept of slope is essential for accurately graphing the line and analyzing its characteristics. In this instance, the line intersects the y-axis at $ 9 $ (the y-intercept), and it slopes downward at a rate of $ 4 $ units for each $ 1 $ unit traversed horizontally. This negative slope signifies a strong negative correlation between $ x $ and $ y $.
