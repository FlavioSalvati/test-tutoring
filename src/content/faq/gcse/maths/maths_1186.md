To convert $1.2$ tonnes to kilograms, you simply multiply $1.2$ by $1,000$. This calculation yields $1,200$ kilograms.

More specifically, the relationship between tonnes and kilograms is grounded in the metric system, where $1$ tonne is defined as being equivalent to $1,000$ kilograms. This conversion is straightforward due to the simplicity and consistency inherent in the metric system.

To carry out the conversion, take the number of tonnes you possess and multiply it by $1,000$. In this instance, you have $1.2$ tonnes, so the calculation is $1.2 \times 1,000$. When you perform this multiplication, you arrive at $1,200$. Thus, $1.2$ tonnes is equivalent to $1,200$ kilograms.

This conversion method applies to any quantity of tonnes you wish to convert to kilograms. For example, if you had $2.5$ tonnes, you would multiply $2.5$ by $1,000$, resulting in $2,500$ kilograms. It is important to remember that the prefix 'kilo-' in kilograms signifies a factor of $1,000$. Therefore, when converting from tonnes to kilograms, you are essentially scaling up by $1,000$.

Understanding this conversion is beneficial in various real-world applications, such as managing large quantities of materials in fields like science, engineering, and everyday life. Accurate and consistent measurements are essential for effective communication and problem-solving in these contexts.
