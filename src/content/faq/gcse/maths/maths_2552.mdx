The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is $5$.

To clarify this concept, let's first define what we mean by rotational symmetry. A shape exhibits rotational symmetry if it can be rotated (through an angle less than a full circle) about its center and still appear exactly as it did prior to the rotation. The order of rotational symmetry refers to the number of times the shape aligns with itself during a complete $360^\circ$ rotation.

A regular pentagon is characterized by five equal sides and five equal angles. When you rotate a regular pentagon around its center, it retains its appearance at specific angles. In particular, if you rotate it by $72^\circ$ (calculated as $\frac{360^\circ}{5}$), the pentagon will appear identical to its original position. This occurs because each of the five sides can occupy the position of the next side in the sequence.

Since dividing $360^\circ$ by $72^\circ$ gives us $5$, the pentagon aligns with itself $5$ times throughout a full $360^\circ$ rotation. Consequently, the order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is $5$. This indicates that there are $5$ distinct positions in which the pentagon appears exactly the same as its starting orientation when rotated around its center.
