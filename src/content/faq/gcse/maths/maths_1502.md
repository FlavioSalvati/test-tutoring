The probability of an event that is certain is expressed as $1$ or $100\%$.

In probability theory, an event that is guaranteed to occur is assigned a probability of $1$. This indicates absolute certainty that the event will take place. For example, if you have a bag filled exclusively with red balls and you select one ball from the bag, the probability of drawing a red ball is $1$, since it is guaranteed that you will pick a red ball.

Probability serves as a metric to quantify the likelihood of an event occurring. It is typically represented as a number ranging from $0$ to $1$, where $0$ signifies that the event will not happen at all, and $1$ implies that the event will definitely occur. Probabilities can also be expressed in percentage terms, with $0\%$ indicating no chance and $100\%$ denoting complete certainty.

Mathematically, when an event is certain, the number of favorable outcomes matches the total number of possible outcomes. For example, when rolling a standard six-sided die, the probability of rolling a number between $1$ and $6$ is $1$, because all possible outcomes (which are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$) are considered favorable.

Grasping the concept of a certain event is essential for analyzing and solving various probability problems, making it a fundamental aspect of GCSE Mathematics.
