The graph of the function $y = -\sqrt{x}$ is characterized by a downward curve that begins at the origin in the first quadrant.

To gain a clearer understanding, let's analyze this function step by step. The expression $y = -\sqrt{x}$ consists of two operations: first, we take the square root of $x$, and then we apply a negative sign to that result. It is important to note that the square root function, denoted as $\sqrt{x}$, is only defined for $x \geq 0$ because the square root of a negative number is not defined within the realm of real numbers. Consequently, the graph of $y = -\sqrt{x}$ will be restricted to non-negative values of $x$.

The basic shape of the function $\sqrt{x}$ is a curve that begins at the origin $(0, 0)$ and gradually ascends as $x$ increases. However, when we introduce the negative sign, the curve is flipped upside down. As a result, instead of rising, the curve descends as we move to the right. This transformation creates a downward-sloping curve that starts at the origin and extends into the first quadrant.

In terms of coordinates, for any positive value of $x$, the corresponding value of $y$ will be negative. For instance, if $x = 1$, then $y = -\sqrt{1} = -1$. Similarly, if $x = 4$, then $y = -\sqrt{4} = -2$. This pattern illustrates that as $x$ increases, $y$ becomes increasingly negative. However, the rate of decrease diminishes because the square root function grows at a slower pace as $x$ becomes larger.

Thus, when you graph $y = -\sqrt{x}$, you will observe a curve that starts at the origin and gently slopes downward to the right, remaining entirely within the first quadrant of the coordinate plane.
