The equation representing the difference between $ y $ and 7 is given by $ y - 7 $.

In mathematics, the term "difference" signifies the result obtained from subtracting one number from another. When we refer to the difference between $ y $ and $ 7 $, we are essentially determining how much $ y $ exceeds or falls short of $ 7 $. We express this relationship mathematically using the subtraction operation, leading us to write the difference as $ y - 7 $.

Letâ€™s explore this concept in more detail. If $ y $ is a variable that stands for a number, and we wish to ascertain how much greater or lesser $ y $ is when compared to $ 7 $, we perform the subtraction of $ 7 $ from $ y $. For instance, if $ y $ is $ 10 $, then the difference between $ 10 $ and $ 7 $ is calculated as follows:

$$
10 - 7 = 3
$$

On the other hand, if $ y $ is $ 5 $, the difference would be:

$$
5 - 7 = -2
$$

This negative result indicates that $ y $ is $ 2 $ units less than $ 7 $.

Grasping this concept is fundamental in algebra, as it underpins the processes of solving equations and inequalities. By manipulating expressions of this nature, you can isolate variables and determine their values. It is crucial to remember that the order of subtraction is significant: $ y - 7 $ is not equivalent to $ 7 - y $. The former expression calculates the difference from $ y $ to $ 7 $, while the latter computes the difference from $ 7 $ to $ y $.
