To calculate the relative frequency, you need to divide the number of successful trials by the total number of trials conducted.

Relative frequency serves as an estimate of the probability of an event based on experimental data. In this scenario, we are interested in finding the relative frequency of drawing a king, given that it occurred 4 times out of 52 trials. First, we need to identify the number of successful trials, which is $4$ (the number of times a king was drawn). Next, the total number of trials is $52$ (the total number of times a card was drawn).

The formula for calculating relative frequency is:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Trials}}{\text{Total Number of Trials}} 
$$

Substituting the given values into the formula, we have:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{4}{52} 
$$

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $4$:

$$ 
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{4 \div 4}{52 \div 4} = \frac{1}{13} 
$$

Therefore, the relative frequency of drawing a king 4 times out of 52 trials is $ \frac{1}{13} $. This result indicates that, based on your experimental data, you can expect to draw a king approximately once in every $13$ trials. This method provides valuable insight into how frequently an event occurs in practice, which can be beneficial for making predictions in similar future experiments.
