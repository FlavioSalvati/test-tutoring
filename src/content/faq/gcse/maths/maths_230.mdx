The graph of the equation $y = -x^2$ depicts a downward-facing parabola, with its vertex located at the origin, specifically the point $(0, 0)$.

To elaborate, the equation $y = -x^2$ is a specific example of a quadratic function. The general form of a quadratic function is given by 

$$
y = ax^2 + bx + c,
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. For our function, we have $a = -1$, $b = 0$, and $c = 0$. The negative coefficient of $x^2$, which is $-1$, indicates that the parabola opens downwards, in contrast to the function $y = x^2$, which opens upwards.

The vertex of the parabola represents its maximum point, and for the equation $y = -x^2$, this vertex is indeed at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are no additional terms in the equation that would cause the graph to shift either horizontally or vertically.

The axis of symmetry for this parabola is the y-axis, represented by the line $x = 0$. This implies that the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, meaning that points on one side of the axis have corresponding points on the other side.

As you move away from the vertex along the x-axis, the value of $y$ decreases. This occurs because the square of any real number is non-negative, and when multiplied by $-1$, it becomes non-positive. For instance, when $x = 1$, we find that $y = -1$; when $x = 2$, $y = -4$; and this pattern continues. The symmetry of the parabola ensures that for negative values of $x$, the graph exhibits the same behavior.

Finally, the graph of $y = -x^2$ extends infinitely downward, widening as it moves away from the vertex. This characteristic shape is typical of any quadratic function that features a negative leading coefficient.
