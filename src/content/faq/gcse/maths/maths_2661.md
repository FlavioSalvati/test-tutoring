The area of a sector of a circle with a radius of $8 \, \text{cm}$ and a central angle of $90^\circ$ is calculated to be $16\pi \, \text{cm}^2$.

To determine the area of a sector, you need to know two key pieces of information: the radius of the circle, denoted as $r$, and the angle of the sector, denoted as $\theta$. The formula for the area of a sector is given by:

$$
\text{Sector Area} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
$$

In this scenario, the radius $r$ is $8 \, \text{cm}$ and the angle $\theta$ is $90^\circ$. Substituting these values into the formula, we have:

$$
\text{Sector Area} = \frac{90}{360} \times \pi \times 8^2
$$

First, we simplify the fraction:

$$
\frac{90}{360} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

Next, we calculate $8^2$:

$$
8^2 = 64
$$

Now, we can combine these results:

$$
\text{Sector Area} = \frac{1}{4} \times \pi \times 64
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\text{Sector Area} = 16\pi
$$

Thus, the area of the sector is $16\pi \, \text{cm}^2$. If you wish to express this in numerical terms, you can approximate $\pi$ as $3.14$:

$$
16\pi \approx 16 \times 3.14 = 50.24 \, \text{cm}^2
$$

Consequently, the area of the sector is approximately $50.24 \, \text{cm}^2$. However, for precision, it is often preferable to leave the area in terms of $\pi$, which gives us $16\pi \, \text{cm}^2$.
