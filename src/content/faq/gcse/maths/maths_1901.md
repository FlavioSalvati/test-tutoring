The number $0.034$, when expressed to two significant figures, remains $0.034$.

To round numbers to a specific number of significant figures, it is crucial to understand the concept of significant figures. Significant figures are the digits in a number that provide meaningful information about its precision. These include all non-zero digits, any zeros situated between significant digits, and any trailing zeros that appear in the decimal portion.

In the case of the number $0.034$, the first significant figure is the digit '3', and the second significant figure is the digit '4'. To round this number to two significant figures, we would typically examine the third digit to determine whether to round up or down. However, in this instance, there is no third digit present, which means the number remains unchanged.

It's important to note that leading zeros (the zeros that appear before the first non-zero digit) do not count as significant figures. Therefore, in $0.034$, the zeros preceding the '3' are not considered significant. This indicates that the number already has two significant figures, so no rounding is necessary.

Mastering the identification and rounding of significant figures is an essential skill in GCSE Maths, as it aids in accurately and consistently presenting data. Practicing with various numbers will enhance your confidence in recognizing and working with significant figures.
