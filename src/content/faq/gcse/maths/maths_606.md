To create a cumulative frequency table, follow these steps: list your data intervals, tally the frequencies, and then compute the cumulative frequencies.

First, organize your data into intervals or classes if it is not already structured this way. For instance, if you have test scores ranging from $0$ to $100$, you could create intervals such as $0-10$, $11-20$, $21-30$, and so forth. Next, count how many data points fall into each interval; this count represents the frequency for that interval.

To calculate the cumulative frequency, begin with the first interval. The cumulative frequency for this interval is simply its frequency. For the subsequent intervals, add each interval's frequency to the cumulative frequency of the previous interval. This process continues for all intervals. In essence, each cumulative frequency is the total of all previous frequencies up to that point.

For example, consider the following intervals and their corresponding frequencies:
- Interval $0-10$: frequency $3$
- Interval $11-20$: frequency $5$
- Interval $21-30$: frequency $7$

The cumulative frequencies would then be calculated as follows:
- For the interval $0-10$: cumulative frequency is $3$ (the frequency of the first interval)
- For the interval $11-20$: cumulative frequency is $3 + 5 = 8$
- For the interval $21-30$: cumulative frequency is $8 + 7 = 15$

Thus, the cumulative frequency table would look like this:

| Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| $0-10$   | $3$       | $3$                  |
| $11-20$  | $5$       | $8$                  |
| $21-30$  | $7$       | $15$                 |

This table effectively illustrates how the data accumulates across different intervals, facilitating the analysis of trends and patterns in the dataset.
