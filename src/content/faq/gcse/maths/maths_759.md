The simplified ratio of $30$ to $10$ is expressed as $3:1$.

To simplify a ratio, you need to divide both values by their greatest common divisor (GCD). In this case, the numbers are $30$ and $10$. The GCD of $30$ and $10$ is $10$, as it is the largest number that can divide both without leaving a remainder.

To simplify the ratio, you divide each term by $10$:
$$ 
\frac{30}{10} = 3 
$$
$$ 
\frac{10}{10} = 1 
$$

This results in the simplified ratio of $3:1$. Simplifying ratios is akin to simplifying fractions; it involves reducing the numbers to their smallest whole numbers while preserving their proportional relationship. This skill is valuable in various mathematical contexts and real-life scenarios, such as adjusting recipes, constructing models, or analyzing data.

By mastering the process of simplifying ratios, you will find it easier to compare quantities, making complex problems more manageable. Always remember to identify the GCD to simplify ratios effectively.
