To calculate 20% off £45, we first need to determine what 20% of £45 is. Percentages represent a portion of a whole, expressed as a fraction of 100. Thus, 20% corresponds to $20/100$ or $0.20$.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Convert the percentage to a decimal**: 
   $$
   20\% = 0.20
   $$
   
2. **Multiply the original amount by this decimal**: 
   $$
   £45 \times 0.20 = £9
   $$

This tells us that 20% of £45 is £9, which represents the discount amount. 

To find the final price after applying the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price:
$$
£45 - £9 = £36
$$

Therefore, when you apply a 20% discount to £45, the final price is £36. This method can be used for calculating any percentage discount on any amount, making it a valuable skill for shopping, budgeting, and various real-life financial situations.
