To construct a $60^\circ$ angle, you can utilize a compass and straightedge to create an equilateral triangle.

Begin by drawing a straight line segment, which will serve as one side of the equilateral triangle. Label the endpoints of this segment as points $A$ and $B$. Place the compass point on point $A$ and draw an arc above the line segment. Without altering the compass width, position the compass point on point $B$ and draw a second arc that intersects the first arc. Label the intersection point of the arcs as point $C$.

Next, use the straightedge to draw line segments $AC$ and $BC$. Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, each angle in the triangle measures $60^\circ$. Thus, the angle $\angle CAB$ is $60^\circ$.

This method is effective because an equilateral triangle is characterized by having three equal sides and three equal angles, each measuring $60^\circ$. By constructing such a triangle, you ensure that the angle you create is exactly $60^\circ$. This technique is fundamental in geometry and serves as a foundational building block for more complex constructions.
