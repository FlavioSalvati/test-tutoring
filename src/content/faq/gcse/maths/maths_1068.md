To create a scale drawing of a rectangle, you will need to multiply the original dimensions by a chosen scale factor.

First, determine the scale factor you wish to use. The scale factor represents the ratio that compares the dimensions of the scale drawing to those of the original rectangle. For instance, if the original rectangle measures $10 \, \text{cm}$ by $5 \, \text{cm}$ and you select a scale factor of $1:2$, then each dimension in the scale drawing will be half the size of the original.

Next, multiply the length and width of the original rectangle by the scale factor. For example, if your original rectangle has a length of $10 \, \text{cm}$ and a width of $5 \, \text{cm}$, and your scale factor is $1:2$, you would calculate the new dimensions as follows:
$$
\text{New Length} = 10 \, \text{cm} \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \, \text{cm}
$$
$$
\text{New Width} = 5 \, \text{cm} \times \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}
$$
Thus, the dimensions of the scale drawing would be $5 \, \text{cm}$ by $2.5 \, \text{cm}$.

Afterward, use a ruler to draw the new rectangle with the scaled dimensions on graph paper or plain paper. Be sure to label the dimensions clearly so that anyone viewing the drawing can easily understand the scale used.

Finally, double-check your measurements to ensure accuracy. It is crucial that the scale drawing is precise, as even minor errors can lead to misunderstandings regarding the size and proportions of the original rectangle. By following these steps, you can create an accurate and effective scale drawing of a rectangle.
