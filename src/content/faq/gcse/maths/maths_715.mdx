To convert the number $6.4 \times 10^{-3}$ into standard decimal form, we obtain $0.0064$.

When you encounter a number in scientific notation, such as $6.4 \times 10^{-3}$, it indicates that you need to adjust the position of the decimal point. The exponent of the base $10$ specifies how many places to shift the decimal. A negative exponent indicates that the decimal point should be moved to the left.

In this instance, the exponent is $-3$, which means you should move the decimal point three places to the left. Starting with the number $6.4$, shifting the decimal one place to the left results in $0.64$. Moving it a second place gives you $0.064$, and finally, moving it a third place yields $0.0064$.

Thus, $6.4 \times 10^{-3}$ is represented as $0.0064$ in standard decimal notation. This conversion illustrates the small magnitude of the number, as moving the decimal to the left reduces its value.
