The volume of a sphere that is similar to another sphere with a scale factor of $2$ is $8$ times the volume of the original sphere.

When we examine similar shapes, the scale factor influences their dimensions in a particular manner. For spheres, a scale factor of $2$ indicates that each linear dimension (such as the radius) of the new sphere is twice that of the original sphere. However, because volume is a three-dimensional measurement, the effect of the scale factor is cubed.

To illustrate this, let's recall the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is given by 

$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3. $$ 

If the radius $r$ of the original sphere is scaled by a factor of $2$, then the new radius becomes $2r$. By substituting $2r$ into the volume formula, we get:

$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (2r)^3. $$ 

Simplifying this expression yields:

$$ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (8r^3) = 8 \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3. $$ 

Thus, the volume of the new sphere is $8$ times the volume of the original sphere.

This principle applies universally to any scale factor. For instance, if the scale factor were $3$, the volume of the new sphere would be $3^3 = 27$ times the volume of the original sphere, and this pattern continues for other scale factors as well. 

Understanding this relationship is essential for solving problems related to similar shapes and their properties in GCSE Maths.
