The magnitude of the vector $(28, 45)$ is $53$.

To calculate the magnitude of a vector, we apply the Pythagorean theorem. We can visualize the vector $(28, 45)$ as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the two perpendicular sides are $28$ and $45$.

The formula for determining the magnitude of a vector $(a, b)$ is given by:

$$
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

For our specific vector $(28, 45)$, we substitute $a = 28$ and $b = 45$ into the formula:

$$
\sqrt{28^2 + 45^2}
$$

Next, we calculate the squares of $28$ and $45$:

- $28^2 = 784$
- $45^2 = 2025$

Adding these values together, we find:

$$
784 + 2025 = 2809
$$

Finally, we compute the square root of $2809$:

$$
\sqrt{2809} = 53
$$

Therefore, the magnitude of the vector $(28, 45)$ is indeed $53$. This method of calculating magnitude can be applied to any vector, making it a valuable tool in various fields of mathematics and physics.
