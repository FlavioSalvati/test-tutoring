When a point is reflected over the y-axis, its x-coordinate is negated, while the y-coordinate remains unchanged.

Reflecting a point over the y-axis effectively flips it to the opposite side of the y-axis. For instance, consider a point with coordinates $(x, y)$. After reflection over the y-axis, the new coordinates will be $(-x, y)$. This transformation means that if the original point was located to the right of the y-axis, the reflected point will now be found to the left, and vice versa. The y-coordinate remains the same because the reflection does not alter the vertical position of the point.

For example, if you start with a point at $(3, 4)$, reflecting it over the y-axis results in the new coordinates $(-3, 4)$. Similarly, a point at $(-5, -2)$ will be reflected to $(5, -2)$. This transformation is particularly useful in various mathematical contexts and graphical representations, as it aids in understanding symmetry and changes in coordinates.

In summary, the process of reflecting a point over the y-axis is straightforward: simply negate the x-coordinate while retaining the y-coordinate. This concept is fundamental in coordinate geometry, as it helps visualize how shapes and points behave under different transformations.
