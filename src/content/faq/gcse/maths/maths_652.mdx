The square of $5$ is $25$.

To square a number means to multiply that number by itself. In this instance, squaring $5$ involves calculating $5 \times 5$. When you perform this multiplication, the result is $25$. This concept is fundamental in mathematics and is often one of the first topics introduced when studying powers and exponents.

In mathematical notation, squaring a number is expressed by raising it to the power of $2$. Thus, $5^2$ is an alternative way to denote $5 \times 5$. This operation falls under the broader subject of indices (or exponents), which is a crucial area covered in GCSE Maths. Mastering squares and other powers is essential for effectively solving a variety of problems, ranging from algebra to geometry.

Squares have particular significance in geometry, where they are instrumental in calculating areas. For instance, if you have a square with sides measuring $5$ units, the area of that square is calculated by squaring the side length, resulting in $5^2 = 25$$ \text{ square units}$. This concept also extends to other mathematical fields, such as quadratic equations, where recognizing and manipulating squares can greatly simplify the process of solving these equations.

Therefore, remembering that the square of $5$ is $25$ can be beneficial in numerous mathematical contexts, making it a valuable piece of knowledge to retain.
