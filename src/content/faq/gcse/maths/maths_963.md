The point $(-6, 2)$ is located in the second quadrant of the Cartesian plane.

To identify the quadrant of a specific point on the Cartesian coordinate system, one must examine the signs of its $x$ and $y$ coordinates. The Cartesian plane is divided into four quadrants, defined as follows:

1. **First Quadrant**: Both $x$ and $y$ coordinates are positive ($x > 0$, $y > 0$).
2. **Second Quadrant**: The $x$ coordinate is negative, and the $y$ coordinate is positive ($x < 0$, $y > 0$).
3. **Third Quadrant**: Both $x$ and $y$ coordinates are negative ($x < 0$, $y < 0$).
4. **Fourth Quadrant**: The $x$ coordinate is positive, and the $y$ coordinate is negative ($x > 0$, $y < 0$).

For the point $(-6, 2)$, the $x$ coordinate is $-6$, which is negative, while the $y$ coordinate is $2$, which is positive. According to the definitions provided, a point with a negative $x$ coordinate and a positive $y$ coordinate resides in the second quadrant.

Visualizing the Cartesian plane can further enhance understanding. Picture the plane divided by the $x$-axis (horizontal line) and the $y$-axis (vertical line). The second quadrant occupies the top-left section, where $x$ values are negative and $y$ values are positive. This is precisely where the point $(-6, 2)$ would be plotted.

Grasping the concept of quadrants is crucial for graphing points, solving equations, and analyzing functions in mathematics. It enables one to quickly ascertain the location of points and comprehend their relationships within the coordinate system.
