Rounding the number $0.045$ to two decimal places results in $0.05$.

When rounding to a specific number of decimal places, it is important to examine the digit immediately following the place you are rounding to. In this instance, we are rounding to two decimal places, so we will focus on the third decimal place. The number $0.045$ has the digits $0$, $4$, and $5$ in the first, second, and third decimal places, respectively.

The rounding rule is straightforward: if the digit you are examining (the third decimal place in this scenario) is $5$ or greater, you round up the last digit you are retaining (the second decimal place). Conversely, if it is less than $5$, you keep the last digit unchanged. Since the digit in the third decimal place is $5$, we round up the second decimal place from $4$ to $5$.

Consequently, $0.045$ rounded to two decimal places becomes $0.05$. This rounding process is crucial in many fields of mathematics and science, where precision is key, but simplification of numbers is also necessary for practical use. Mastering the technique of rounding numbers accurately will enhance your calculations and ensure that your results are both precise and manageable.
