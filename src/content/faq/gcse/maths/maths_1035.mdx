To calculate the perimeter of a regular polygon, you simply multiply the number of sides by the length of one side.

A regular polygon is defined as a geometric shape in which all sides and angles are equal. To determine its perimeter, you need two key pieces of information: the number of sides, denoted as $n$, and the length of one side, represented as $s$. The formula for the perimeter $P$ of a regular polygon is given by:

$$
P = n \times s
$$

This formula indicates that you multiply the number of sides by the length of a single side.

For instance, consider a regular hexagon, which has $6$ sides, with each side measuring $4 \text{ cm}$. To find the perimeter, you would perform the following calculation: 

$$
P = 6 \times 4 \text{ cm} = 24 \text{ cm}
$$

This approach is applicable to any regular polygon, whether it be a triangle, square, pentagon, or any other shape that maintains equal sides and angles. Remember, the crucial aspect here is that the polygon must be regular; all sides and angles must be congruent. If the sides or angles vary, you would need to employ a different method to determine the perimeter.
