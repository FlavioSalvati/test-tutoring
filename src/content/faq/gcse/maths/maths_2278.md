The domain of the function $ f(x) = \sqrt{x} $ is defined as $ x \geq 0 $.

To elaborate, the domain of a function refers to the complete set of permissible input values (or x-values) that the function can accept without encountering any mathematical inconsistencies. For the specific case of $ f(x) = \sqrt{x} $, we must determine the conditions under which the square root is defined. The square root function is defined only for non-negative numbers, as the square root of a negative number does not yield a real number; instead, it results in an imaginary number, which lies outside the scope of GCSE Maths.

Consequently, for $ f(x) = \sqrt{x} $ to be valid, the input $ x $ must be greater than or equal to 0. This means that any value of $ x $ that is either 0 or positive is acceptable as an input for the function. For instance, both $ f(0) = \sqrt{0} = 0 $ and $ f(4) = \sqrt{4} = 2 $ are valid computations. However, $ f(-1) $ is not valid since the square root of $-1$ is not a real number.

In interval notation, the domain can be expressed as $[0, \infty)$, which signifies all real numbers starting from 0 and extending to infinity, inclusive of 0. This notation ensures that the function $ f(x) = \sqrt{x} $ will consistently produce a real number output for any input within this specified range.
