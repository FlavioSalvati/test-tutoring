The square of $12$ is $144$.

To calculate the square of a number, you multiply the number by itself. In this case, squaring $12$ involves computing $12 \times 12$. Performing this multiplication yields $144$, as $12$ multiplied by $12$ equals $144$.

Understanding squares is crucial in mathematics, particularly in subjects such as algebra and geometry. A square number is defined as the result of multiplying an integer by itself. For example, the square of $3$ is calculated as $3 \times 3 = 9$, and the square of $5$ is $5 \times 5 = 25$. These results are referred to as perfect squares.

In practical applications, squaring a number can be used to determine the area of a square when the length of one side is known. For instance, if each side of a square measures $12$ units, the area can be calculated as $12 \times 12 = 144$$ \text{ square units}$$.

Mastering the process of squaring numbers is also beneficial for solving quadratic equations and grasping more complex mathematical concepts. It is a foundational skill that will prove useful throughout your study of mathematics. Therefore, remember that the square of $12$ is $144$, and this simple operation paves the way for many advanced topics in math.
