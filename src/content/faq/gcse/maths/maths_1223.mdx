The formula for calculating the circumference of a circle can be expressed as either:

$$
C = 2\pi r
$$ 

or 

$$
C = \pi d.
$$ 

The circumference, denoted as $ C $, represents the total distance around the edge of the circle. You can determine the circumference using either the radius $ r $ or the diameter $ d $. 

The radius is defined as the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its boundary. In contrast, the diameter is the straight-line distance that passes through the center of the circle, extending from one edge to the opposite edge. Notably, the diameter is always twice the length of the radius, which is mathematically represented as $ d = 2r $.

The first formula, $ C = 2\pi r $, utilizes the radius. In this expression, $ \pi $ (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to $3.14159$. Therefore, to find the circumference when you know the radius, you simply multiply the radius by $2$ and then by $ \pi $.

On the other hand, the second formula, $ C = \pi d $, relies on the diameter. Since the diameter is double the radius, this formula is essentially equivalent to the first one, but it simplifies the process by omitting the step of doubling the radius. You can directly multiply the diameter by $ \pi $ to obtain the circumference.

These formulas are foundational in geometry and prove to be extremely useful in various real-life scenarios, such as calculating the length of a circular track or determining the perimeter of a round table. Mastering these formulas will significantly aid you in solving numerous problems related to circles in your GCSE Maths examinations.
