The number $1,200,000$ can be expressed in standard form as $1.2 \times 10^6$.

Standard form, also referred to as scientific notation, provides a concise and manageable way to represent very large or very small numbers. To convert a number into standard form, you must express it as a coefficient that lies between 1 and 10, multiplied by a power of 10.

For the number $1,200,000$, the first step is to identify the significant figures, which in this case are $1.2$. Next, you need to determine how many places the decimal point has shifted from its original position—located at the end of the number—to its new position immediately following the first significant figure. In this example, the decimal point moves $6$ places to the left. Thus, $1,200,000$ can be succinctly written as $1.2 \times 10^6$.

This notation is particularly beneficial in fields such as science and engineering, where calculations frequently involve extremely large or small values. Standard form not only simplifies calculations but also enhances readability and facilitates comparison of different values. For instance, instead of writing out $1,200,000$, you can simply denote it as $1.2 \times 10^6$, which is significantly more compact and easier to comprehend at a glance.
