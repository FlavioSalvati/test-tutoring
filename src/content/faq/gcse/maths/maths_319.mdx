To bisect a line segment accurately, you can utilize a compass and straightedge to locate and mark its midpoint.

Begin by drawing the line segment that you wish to bisect, labeling its endpoints as $A$ and $B$. Position the compass point on endpoint $A$ and adjust its width to be greater than half the length of the line segment. With this setup, draw arcs both above and below the line segment. Without altering the compass width, place the compass point on endpoint $B$ and draw another set of arcs that will intersect with the first set.

Next, take a straightedge and draw a line through the points where the arcs intersect. This line will intersect the original line segment at its midpoint, effectively bisecting it. Label this midpoint as $M$. As a result, the lengths of segments $AM$ and $MB$ will be equal, confirming that the line segment $AB$ has been successfully bisected.

This method guarantees precision and is a fundamental technique in geometry, proving useful for a variety of constructions and proofs.
