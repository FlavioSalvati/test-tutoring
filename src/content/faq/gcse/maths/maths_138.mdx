The new price after applying a £5 discount to an original price of £30 is £25.

To determine the new price after a discount, you simply subtract the discount amount from the original price. Here, the original price is £30, and the discount is £5. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

$$
30 - 5 = 25
$$

This means the new price is £25.

Understanding discounts is a valuable skill in everyday life, especially when shopping. A discount represents a reduction in the original price of an item. To calculate the new price after a discount, you need to know both the original price and the discount amount. By subtracting the discount from the original price, you can easily find the new price.

For instance, if you are purchasing a pair of shoes that originally costs £30 and there is a £5 discount, you would perform the following calculation:

$$
30 - 5 = 25
$$

This result indicates that you will pay £25 after the discount is applied.

This method can be applied to any discount amount. Always remember to subtract the discount from the original price. If you find yourself uncertain about your calculation, you can verify your work by adding the discount back to the new price to check if it equals the original price. In this example:

$$
25 + 5 = 30
$$

This confirms that the calculation is accurate.
