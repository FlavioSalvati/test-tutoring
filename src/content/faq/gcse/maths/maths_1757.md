To simplify the expression $\frac{3^4}{3^2}$, we will apply the rule of exponents that allows us to subtract the exponents when dividing powers with the same base. Specifically, this rule, known as the quotient of powers property, states that when you divide two exponential expressions with the same base, you can subtract the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator.

In our example, both the numerator and the denominator share the base of 3. Hereâ€™s how to simplify it step-by-step:

1. Start with the expression: 
   $$\frac{3^4}{3^2}$$

2. According to the quotient of powers property, you subtract the exponent in the denominator (which is $2$) from the exponent in the numerator (which is $4$). Thus, we perform the subtraction:
   $$4 - 2 = 2$$

3. This gives us:
   $$3^{4-2} = 3^2$$

To gain further insight into this simplification, let's consider what the powers represent:

- The expression $3^4$ means multiplying 3 by itself four times:
  $$3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$$

- The expression $3^2$ means multiplying 3 by itself twice:
  $$3^2 = 3 \times 3 = 9$$

Now, when we divide $81$ by $9$, we indeed get:
$$\frac{81}{9} = 9$$

This confirms that our simplification to $3^2$ is correct, as $3^2$ equals $9$.

In conclusion, the expression $\frac{3^4}{3^2}$ simplifies to $3^2$, which evaluates to $9$. This method of simplifying expressions using the quotient of powers property can be applied to any similar problems involving exponents with the same base.
