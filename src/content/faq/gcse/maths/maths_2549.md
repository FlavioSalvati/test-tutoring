To create a scale drawing of a park, follow these steps: measure the parkâ€™s dimensions, select an appropriate scale, and accurately depict the features on your drawing.

First, begin by measuring the actual dimensions of the park. This involves determining the length and width, as well as the positions and sizes of various features such as playgrounds, ponds, and pathways. Tools like a measuring tape or a trundle wheel can be helpful for this task. Be sure to document all measurements meticulously.

Next, choose a suitable scale for your drawing. A scale is a ratio that illustrates the relationship between the measurements on your drawing and the actual measurements of the park. For instance, a scale of $1:100$ means that $1$ centimeter on the drawing corresponds to $100$ centimeters in real life. The scale you select will depend on both the size of the park and the dimensions of the paper you are using.

Now, start by sketching the outline of the park on your paper using the selected scale. Utilize a ruler to ensure straight lines and accurate proportions. If the park is rectangular, draw a rectangle representing the scaled-down dimensions. For parks with irregular shapes, consider employing a grid method to accurately transfer the shape.

After outlining the park, incorporate its features. Convert the real-life measurements of these features into your chosen scale and position them correctly on your drawing. For example, if a pond has a width of $200$ cm in reality and you are using a scale of $1:100$, then the pond should appear as $2$ cm wide on your drawing.

Finally, label all the features and include any additional details, such as trees, benches, or flower beds. Ensure that everything is clearly marked and easily comprehensible. This clarity will assist anyone viewing your drawing in visualizing the actual park more accurately.
