The graph of the function $ y = |x| $ has a distinctive V shape, with its vertex located at the origin $(0,0)$.

To elaborate, the graph of $ y = |x| $ illustrates the behavior of the absolute value function. The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line, irrespective of the direction. Consequently, for any input $ x $, the output $ y $ is guaranteed to be non-negative.

For non-negative values of $ x $ (i.e., when $ x \geq 0 $), the function simplifies to $ y = |x| = x $. As a result, in this domain, the graph is a straight line with a slope of $ 1 $, extending through the origin. This segment of the graph occupies the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane.

Conversely, for negative values of $ x $ (i.e., when $ x < 0 $), the function becomes $ y = |x| = -x $. In this case, the graph is again a straight line, but with a slope of $ -1 $, also passing through the origin. This portion of the graph is situated in the second quadrant of the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these two lines occurs at the vertex, which for the function $ y = |x| $ is at the origin $(0,0)$. The V shape of the graph displays symmetry about the y-axis, indicating that it appears identical on both sides of this axis.

This V-shaped graph serves as a fundamental illustration of the properties of absolute value functions and finds applications in various mathematical contexts, including the resolution of equations and inequalities that involve absolute values.
