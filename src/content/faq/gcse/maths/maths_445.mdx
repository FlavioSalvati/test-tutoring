The exact value of $\tan 30^\circ$ is given by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ or equivalently $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

To grasp why this is true, let's explore some basic trigonometry concepts. The tangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the adjacent side. For the angle $30^\circ$, we can utilize a special type of right-angled triangle known as the 30-60-90 triangle.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the lengths of the sides adhere to a specific ratio: the length of the side opposite the $30^\circ$ angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, while the length of the side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle is $\sqrt{3}$ times that of the shorter side. If we assume the hypotenuse measures $2$ units, then the side opposite the $30^\circ$ angle (the shorter leg) will measure $1$ unit, and the side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle (the longer leg) will measure $\sqrt{3}$ units.

Using the definition of tangent, we can express this as follows:

$$ 
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} 
$$

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:

$$ 
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} 
$$

Thus, we conclude that $\tan 30^\circ$ can be expressed as either $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ or $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, both of which represent the same exact value. This knowledge is essential for solving a variety of trigonometric problems and forms a fundamental part of the GCSE Maths curriculum.
