The length of the space diagonal in a cuboid with dimensions $6 \, \text{cm}$, $8 \, \text{cm}$, and $10 \, \text{cm}$ is approximately $14 \, \text{cm}$.

To calculate the length of the space diagonal in a cuboid, we utilize a formula derived from the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. The formula is expressed as:

$$ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} $$

In this equation, $d$ represents the space diagonal, while $l$, $w$, and $h$ denote the length, width, and height of the cuboid, respectively. For our specific cuboid, the dimensions are as follows: $l = 6 \, \text{cm}$ (length), $w = 8 \, \text{cm}$ (width), and $h = 10 \, \text{cm}$ (height).

We begin by squaring each of the dimensions:

$$ 6^2 = 36 $$
$$ 8^2 = 64 $$
$$ 10^2 = 100 $$

Next, we sum these squared values:

$$ 36 + 64 + 100 = 200 $$

Now, we proceed to find the space diagonal by taking the square root of the total:

$$ d = \sqrt{200} $$

To simplify $\sqrt{200}$, we can factor it as follows:

$$ \sqrt{200} = \sqrt{4 \times 50} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{50} = 2 \times \sqrt{50} $$

Knowing that $\sqrt{50}$ is approximately $7.07$, we can calculate:

$$ d \approx 2 \times 7.07 = 14.14 $$

When rounding to the nearest whole number, we find that the length of the space diagonal is approximately $14 \, \text{cm}$. This calculation illustrates how to apply the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions to determine the space diagonal in any cuboid.
