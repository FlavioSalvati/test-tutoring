The decimal $0.2$ can be expressed as a percentage, which is $20\%$.

To convert a decimal into a percentage, the process is straightforward: multiply the decimal by $100$. This conversion is based on the definition of "percent," which means "per hundred." Essentially, you are determining how many parts out of $100$ the decimal represents. For instance, multiplying $0.2$ by $100$ yields $20$. Consequently, we conclude that $0.2$ is equivalent to $20\%$.

Another perspective for understanding this conversion is to view the decimal as a fraction. The decimal $0.2$ can be represented as the fraction $\frac{2}{10}$. To convert this fraction into a percentage, you can simplify it to $\frac{1}{5}$. Next, you multiply by $100$ to find the percentage: 

$$
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\%.
$$

Visualizing this concept can also enhance your understanding. Imagine a pie chart divided into $100$ equal sections. If you shade $20$ of those sections, you have shaded $20\%$ of the pie chart. This is equivalent to stating that you have shaded $0.2$ of the entire pie chart.

Mastering the conversion between decimals and percentages is a valuable skill applicable in various fields of mathematics, including statistics and probability, as well as in everyday situations such as calculating discounts or interest rates.
