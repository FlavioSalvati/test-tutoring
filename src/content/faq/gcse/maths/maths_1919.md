The speed of traveling 60 miles in 2 hours can be expressed as 30 miles per hour.

To determine the speed, you need to divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken. In this scenario, you have covered a distance of 60 miles over a duration of 2 hours. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

This indicates that for every hour of travel, you cover a distance of 30 miles.

Understanding how to calculate speed is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths. Speed measures how quickly an object moves from one location to another. The formula for calculating speed is:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
$$

In this example, the distance is $60$ miles and the time is $2$ hours. By substituting these values into the formula, we arrive at:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

This calculation is applicable in numerous real-life situations, such as planning a journey or estimating how long it will take to travel a specific distance. Moreover, it is a key concept in physics and other scientific fields, where grasping the relationship between distance, time, and speed is essential.

It is important to remember that the units of measurement you use are significant. In this case, we utilized miles and hours, which results in a speed measured in miles per hour. If you were to use kilometers and minutes, the units would differ, but the method for calculating speed remains consistent.
