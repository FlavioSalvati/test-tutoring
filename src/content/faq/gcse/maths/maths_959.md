A point located on the y-axis can be represented by the coordinates $(0, y)$, where $y$ can take any real value.

When we refer to the y-axis in a coordinate system, we are discussing the vertical line that extends upward and downward through the origin, represented by the point $(0, 0)$. Any point that lies on this y-axis will have an x-coordinate of $0$, indicating that it does not deviate to the left or right of the origin. Conversely, the y-coordinate can be any real number, allowing the point to be positioned anywhere along the vertical line.

For instance, consider the point $(0, 5)$; this point is located 5 units above the origin on the y-axis. Similarly, the point $(0, -3)$ is positioned 3 units below the origin. It is essential to note that the x-coordinate is always $0$ for any point on the y-axis. This is because the x-coordinate indicates the horizontal distance from the origin, and on the y-axis, we are exactly on the vertical line, neither to the left nor to the right.

Grasping this concept is vital for plotting points and analyzing graphs in coordinate geometry. It facilitates the identification and manipulation of points that are specifically situated on the y-axis, which is useful in a variety of mathematical problems and real-world applications.
