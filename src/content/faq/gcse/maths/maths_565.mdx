Qualitative data refers to descriptions of qualities or characteristics, whereas quantitative data pertains to numbers and measurements.

Qualitative data focuses on attributes and features that cannot be quantified with numerical values. For instance, when examining various types of fruit, qualitative data includes aspects such as color, texture, and taste. This type of data is typically gathered through observations, interviews, or surveys, where individuals articulate their experiences or opinions. Examples of qualitative descriptors include "soft," "sweet," and "red." Such data is particularly valuable for gaining insights into the inherent qualities of a subject, providing a deeper understanding of the topic under investigation.

In contrast, quantitative data is centered around numerical values and measurable attributes. This data can be counted, measured, and expressed in numerical formats. For example, when studying the same varieties of fruit, quantitative data might encompass the weight, seed count, or price of each fruit. This information is often collected using instruments such as scales, rulers, or questionnaires that yield numerical responses. Illustrative examples of quantitative data include "$10$ grams," "$15$ seeds," or "Â£1.50." This type of data is essential for performing calculations, constructing graphs, and analyzing trends.

In summary, qualitative data provides descriptive insights, while quantitative data offers numerical information. Both forms of data are crucial in their own right and can often be integrated to create a more comprehensive understanding of the subject being studied.
