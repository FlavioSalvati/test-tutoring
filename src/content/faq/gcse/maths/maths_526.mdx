The relative frequency of rolling an even number $30$ times out of $60$ rolls is $0.5$, or $50\%$.

Relative frequency quantifies how often a specific event occurs in relation to the total number of trials conducted. In this scenario, you rolled an even number $30$ times out of a total of $60$ rolls. To calculate the relative frequency, you divide the number of successful outcomes (the times you rolled an even number) by the total number of trials (the total number of rolls). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Trials}} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5.
$$

To convert the relative frequency into a percentage, you multiply it by $100$. Thus, $0.5 \times 100$ results in $50\%$. This indicates that, based on your experiment, an even number was rolled $50\%$ of the time.

Understanding relative frequency is essential for analyzing the likelihood of various outcomes in both experimental and real-world scenarios. In this example, a fair six-sided die features three even numbers (specifically, $2$, $4$, and $6$) out of a total of six possible outcomes. The theoretical probability of rolling an even number can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Theoretical Probability} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \text{ (or } 50\% \text{)}.
$$

Your experimental result aligns perfectly with this theoretical probability, which suggests that your die is fair and that the experiment was conducted properly.
