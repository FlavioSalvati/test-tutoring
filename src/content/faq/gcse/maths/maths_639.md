To convert a fraction into a percentage, you can follow a straightforward process: simply multiply the fraction by $100$ and then append the percentage symbol (%) at the end.

A fraction represents a portion of a whole, and to express this portion as a percentage, you need to determine how many parts it corresponds to out of $100$. This is achieved by multiplying the fraction by $100$. For instance, if you have the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, you would multiply it by $100$.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to the conversion process:

1. **Select the fraction you wish to convert**. For this example, we will use $\frac{3}{4}$.
2. **Multiply the numerator (the top number) by $100$**. In this case, $3$ multiplied by $100$ equals $300$.
3. **Divide the result by the denominator (the bottom number)**. Thus, $300$ divided by $4$ gives you $75$.
4. **Add the percentage symbol (%) to the result**. Therefore, $\frac{3}{4}$ expressed as a percentage is $75\%$.

This conversion method is applicable to any fraction. For example, consider the fraction $\frac{1}{5}$. You would first multiply $1$ by $100$, resulting in $100$, and then divide this by $5$, yielding $20$. Hence, $\frac{1}{5}$ corresponds to $20\%$.

It’s important to note that multiplying by $100$ effectively shifts the decimal point two places to the right, transforming the fraction into a percentage. This technique is particularly useful for handling fractions and percentages in your GCSE Maths exams.
