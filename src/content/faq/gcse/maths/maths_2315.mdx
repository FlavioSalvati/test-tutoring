The coordinates of the origin are given by $(0, 0)$.

In a Cartesian coordinate system, the origin is the point where the $x$-axis and $y$-axis intersect. This point is fundamental in both geometry and algebra because it serves as a reference for all other points in the plane. The coordinates $(0, 0)$ indicate that the origin is located at zero units along the $x$-axis and zero units along the $y$-axis.

When plotting points on a graph, the origin acts as the starting point. For instance, if you want to plot a point with coordinates $(3, 4)$, you begin at the origin, move $3$ units to the right along the $x$-axis, and then $4$ units up along the $y$-axis. The origin is also vital when working with equations of lines and curves, as it frequently serves as a point of symmetry or a central reference.

Understanding the origin is essential for solving a variety of mathematical problems, including those involving distance, midpoints, and transformations. For example, when you reflect a point across the $y$-axis, the $x$-coordinate changes sign while the $y$-coordinate remains unchanged. Familiarity with the position of the origin aids in visualizing and accurately executing these transformations.

In summary, the origin, represented by the coordinates $(0, 0)$, is a crucial concept in the Cartesian coordinate system. It serves as the reference point for plotting and analyzing points, lines, and shapes on a graph.
