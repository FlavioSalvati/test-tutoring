A sphere possesses an infinite number of lines of symmetry that pass through its center.

To elaborate, a line of symmetry in a geometric shape is defined as a line that divides the shape into two identical halves, where one half is a mirror image of the other. In the case of a sphere, any line that intersects its center will create two identical hemispheres. This implies that there are countless lines of symmetry for a sphere, as one can draw such a line in any direction through the center.

To visualize this concept, consider the Earth modeled as a sphere. You can draw a line from the North Pole to the South Pole, which serves as a line of symmetry. Additionally, you can draw a line from any point on the equator through the center to the corresponding point directly opposite on the equator, and this too qualifies as a line of symmetry. Since there are no limitations on the direction of these lines, it follows that a sphere has an infinite number of lines of symmetry.

This characteristic is unique to spheres among three-dimensional shapes. For instance, a cube only has a finite number of lines of symmetry, specifically those that run through the centers of its faces and along its diagonals. The sphere's infinite lines of symmetry render it a particularly special and highly symmetrical shape in the realm of geometry.
