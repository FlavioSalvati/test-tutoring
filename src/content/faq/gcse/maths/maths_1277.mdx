To determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which is expressed as:

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

In a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides. Specifically, it states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship can be mathematically represented as:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

Here, $ c $ represents the length of the hypotenuse, while $ a $ and $ b $ correspond to the lengths of the triangle's legs.

For instance, consider a right-angled triangle with legs measuring $6 \, \text{cm}$ and $8 \, \text{cm}$. To find the hypotenuse, substitute these values into the formula. First, calculate the squares of the lengths of the legs:

$$
6^2 = 36
$$

and

$$
8^2 = 64.
$$

Next, sum these squared values:

$$
36 + 64 = 100.
$$

Finally, to find the length of the hypotenuse, take the square root of this total:

$$
\sqrt{100} = 10.
$$

Thus, the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs measuring $6 \, \text{cm}$ and $8 \, \text{cm}$ is $10 \, \text{cm}$. This method can be applied to any right-angled triangle, provided that you know the lengths of the other two sides.
