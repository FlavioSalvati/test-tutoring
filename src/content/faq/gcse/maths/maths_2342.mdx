The x-intercept of the line given by the equation $y = -x + 2$ is $2$.

To determine the x-intercept of a line, we need to identify the point where the line intersects the x-axis. At this intersection, the value of $y$ is zero. Therefore, we start by setting $y$ to $0$ in the equation:

$$
0 = -x + 2
$$

Next, we solve for $x$. We can do this by adding $x$ to both sides of the equation:

$$
x = 2
$$

Consequently, the x-intercept occurs at the point $(2, 0)$. This indicates that when $y$ is zero, $x$ equals $2$, and thus the line crosses the x-axis at this location.

Understanding x-intercepts is essential, as they help us visualize where a line or curve meets the x-axis on a graph. In this particular case, the line $y = -x + 2$ has a negative slope, indicating that it descends from left to right. The x-intercept at the point $(2, 0)$ provides us with a significant reference point on the graph, enhancing our understanding of the line's behavior.
