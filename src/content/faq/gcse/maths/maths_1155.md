The angle formed by two chords intersecting within a circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

When two chords intersect inside a circle, they create an angle at the point of intersection. To determine this angle, we examine the arcs that the chords intercept on the circumference of the circle. Let’s denote the angle created by the intersecting chords as ∠AOB, where $ O $ is the point of intersection, and the intercepted arcs are represented as arc $ AC $ and arc $ BD $.

The measure of ∠AOB can be calculated by taking the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs (arc $ AC $ and arc $ BD $) and dividing that sum by 2. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\angle AOB = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{measure of arc } AC + \text{measure of arc } BD \right)
$$

This principle is significant because the angle formed by the intersecting chords effectively represents the average of the angles subtended by the intercepted arcs at the center of the circle. This is a fundamental concept in circle theorems and is essential for solving various problems related to angles and arcs in circles.

For instance, if arc $ AC $ measures $80^\circ$ and arc $ BD $ measures $100^\circ$, the angle ∠AOB formed by the intersecting chords can be calculated as follows:

$$
\angle AOB = \frac{1}{2} \left( 80^\circ + 100^\circ \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 180^\circ \right) = 90^\circ
$$

Grasping this concept is crucial for solving problems involving circles, as it enables you to find unknown angles and arc measures, which are common tasks in GCSE Mathematics.
