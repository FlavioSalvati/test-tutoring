The formula for calculating the expected frequency is given by:

$$
\text{Expected Frequency} = \frac{\text{Row Total} \times \text{Column Total}}{\text{Grand Total}}
$$

Expected frequency is a key concept in statistics, particularly relevant to chi-squared tests. It allows us to estimate how often we would anticipate a specific outcome to occur within a contingency table, under the assumption that there is no association between the variables involved.

To compute the expected frequency for a particular cell in a contingency table, you need three essential pieces of information: the total for the row of the cell, the total for the column of the cell, and the grand total of all observations in the table.

For instance, consider a table that displays the preferences of students for different subjects—Math, English, and Science—across two schools. If you wish to determine the expected frequency of students who prefer Maths in School A, you would multiply the total number of students in School A by the total number of students who prefer Maths, and then divide that product by the grand total of all students surveyed.

This calculation is crucial as it allows you to compare the expected frequencies with the actual observed frequencies. Such comparisons help to assess whether there is a significant difference, which is fundamental to performing the chi-squared test. A solid understanding of expected frequency is vital for analyzing categorical data and drawing informed conclusions in statistical research.
