The hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides measuring $9 \, \text{cm}$ and $12 \, \text{cm}$ is $15 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known, you can apply Pythagoras' Theorem. This theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

where $c$ represents the hypotenuse, while $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides.

In this instance, the sides of the triangle are $9 \, \text{cm}$ and $12 \, \text{cm}$. We can substitute these values into the formula:

$$
9^2 + 12^2 = c^2
$$

First, let's calculate the squares of $9$ and $12$:

$$
9^2 = 81
$$

$$
12^2 = 144
$$

Next, we sum these squared values:

$$
81 + 144 = 225
$$

To find the hypotenuse, we take the square root of $225$:

$$
\sqrt{225} = 15
$$

Thus, the hypotenuse of the triangle measures $15 \, \text{cm}$. This method is highly effective for solving problems related to right-angled triangles and is a fundamental principle in GCSE Maths. Remember to verify that the triangle is indeed right-angled before using Pythagoras' Theorem.
