To solve the inequality $ 7x - 3 \leq 18 $, we will isolate the variable $ x $ by first eliminating the constant term and then dividing by the coefficient of $ x $.

We start with the inequality:

$$ 7x - 3 \leq 18 $$

To eliminate the $-3$ from the left side, we add $ 3 $ to both sides of the inequality:

$$ 7x - 3 + 3 \leq 18 + 3 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ 7x \leq 21 $$

Next, we need to isolate $ x $ by removing the coefficient $ 7 $. We achieve this by dividing both sides of the inequality by $ 7 $:

$$ \frac{7x}{7} \leq \frac{21}{7} $$

This simplifies further to:

$$ x \leq 3 $$

Therefore, the solution to the inequality $ 7x - 3 \leq 18 $ is $ x \leq 3 $. This indicates that any value of $ x $ that is less than or equal to $ 3 $ will satisfy the inequality.

To verify our solution, we can substitute values back into the original inequality to check their validity. For instance, if we choose $ x = 2 $:

$$ 7(2) - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 $$

Since $ 11 $ is indeed less than or equal to $ 18 $, our solution holds true.
