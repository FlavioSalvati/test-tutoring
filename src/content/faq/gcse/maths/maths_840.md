The product of two numbers, denoted as $a$ and $b$, can be represented mathematically in several ways: as $a \times b$, $a \cdot b$, or simply as $ab$.

In mathematical terms, the "product" refers to the result obtained when two or more numbers are multiplied together. When you multiply $a$ and $b$, you are calculating their product. Regardless of the notation used—whether it's $a \times b$, $a \cdot b$, or $ab$—all these expressions convey the same operation: multiplying $a$ by $b$.

For instance, if we set $a = 3$ and $b = 4$, the product can be calculated as follows: 

$$
3 \times 4 = 12.
$$

This illustrates that multiplying $3$ by $4$ yields $12$.

In algebra, expressing the product of variables is a common practice. For example, if we have variables $x$ and $y$, their product is succinctly represented as $xy$. This notation serves as a shorthand for $x \times y$. It is important to note that when variables are placed adjacent to each other without any intervening symbol, it inherently signifies multiplication.

Mastering the expression and calculation of the product of both numbers and variables is a fundamental skill in GCSE Mathematics. This knowledge is applicable across various topics, including solving equations, manipulating polynomials, and analyzing functions. Therefore, becoming proficient in this concept will greatly benefit you in multiple areas of your mathematics studies.
