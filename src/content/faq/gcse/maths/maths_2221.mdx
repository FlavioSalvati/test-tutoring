The y-intercept of the graph represented by the equation $ y = x^2 - 4 $ is given by the value $-4$.

To determine the y-intercept of a graph, you must find the value of $ y $ when $ x $ is equal to $0$. The y-intercept is the point at which the graph intersects the y-axis, and at this intersection, the value of $ x $ is always $0$.

For the equation $ y = x^2 - 4 $, we substitute $ x = 0 $ into the equation:

$$
y = 0^2 - 4
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
y = -4
$$

Thus, when $ x = 0 $, we find that $ y = -4 $. This indicates that the graph crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, -4) $. Therefore, we can conclude that the y-intercept is $-4$.

Understanding the y-intercept is essential, as it provides a crucial starting point for graphing the equation. In this instance, the graph is a parabola that opens upwards, since the coefficient of $ x^2 $ is positive. Knowing the y-intercept allows for a more accurate plotting of the graph and enhances your comprehension of its behavior. For GCSE Maths, the ability to identify and interpret the y-intercept is a fundamental skill that will significantly assist you in solving and graphing quadratic equations.
