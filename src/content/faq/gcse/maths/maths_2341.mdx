To draw a straight line based on the equation $ y = 2x + 3 $, you will need to plot several points derived from the equation and then connect them.

First, it's important to recognize that the equation $ y = 2x + 3 $ is in the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the gradient (or slope) and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. In this case, the gradient $ m $ is $2$, indicating that for every $1$ unit the line moves to the right, it rises $2$ units. The y-intercept $ c $ is $3$, which indicates the point where the line intersects the y-axis.

Begin by plotting the y-intercept. On your graph, locate the point $ (0, 3) $ and mark it. This will be your first point. Next, use the gradient to determine another point. From $ (0, 3) $, move $1$ unit to the right along the x-axis and $2$ units up along the y-axis to reach the point $ (1, 5) $. Plot this second point on the graph.

To ensure accuracy, let's plot a third point. Starting from $ (1, 5) $, move another $1$ unit to the right and $2$ units up to arrive at $ (2, 7) $. Mark this point as well. Now, you have three points to work with: $ (0, 3) $, $ (1, 5) $, and $ (2, 7) $.

Finally, take a ruler and draw a straight line through these points. Extend the line in both directions, and add arrows at each end to indicate that it continues infinitely. Don't forget to label the line with its equation $ y = 2x + 3 $. This method will ensure that your line is accurate and clearly represents the equation provided.
