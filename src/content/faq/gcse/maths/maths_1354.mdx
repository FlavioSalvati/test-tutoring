The minimum value of the function $ y = -\sin(x) $ is $ -1 $, occurring precisely when $ \sin(x) = 1 $.

To understand why this is true, let's first review the properties of the sine function. The sine function, $ \sin(x) $, oscillates between $ -1 $ and $ 1 $ for all real values of $ x $. Thus, the maximum value of $ \sin(x) $ is $ 1 $, and the minimum value is $ -1 $.

Next, consider the function $ y = -\sin(x) $. This function is simply the sine function reflected about the horizontal axis. When we multiply $ \sin(x) $ by $ -1 $, we invert its values. Consequently, the maximum value of $ \sin(x) $ becomes the minimum value of $ -\sin(x) $, and vice versa.

Since the maximum value of $ \sin(x) $ is $ 1 $, the minimum value of $ -\sin(x) $ will be $ -1 $. This is because multiplying $ 1 $ by $ -1 $ results in $ -1 $. Therefore, we conclude that the minimum value of $ y = -\sin(x) $ is indeed $ -1 $.

To determine when this minimum value occurs, we need to identify the points where $ \sin(x) = 1 $. The sine function equals $ 1 $ at specific angles, notably at $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi $, where $ k $ is any integer. At these values of $ x $, the function $ y = -\sin(x) $ reaches its minimum of $ -1 $.

In summary, the minimum value of $ y = -\sin(x) $ is $ -1 $, and this occurs whenever $ \sin(x) = 1 $, specifically at $ x = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi $ for any integer $ k $.
