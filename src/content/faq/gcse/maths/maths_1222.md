The circumference of a circle with a diameter of $10 \, \text{cm}$ is $31.4 \, \text{cm}$.

To determine the circumference of a circle, you can utilize the formula 

$$ C = \pi \times d $$ 

where $ C $ represents the circumference and $ d $ is the diameter. In this case, the diameter $ d $ is given as $10 \, \text{cm}$. By substituting this value into the formula, we have 

$$ C = \pi \times 10. $$ 

The mathematical constant $ \pi $ (pi) is approximately $3.14$. Thus, we can calculate the circumference as follows:

$$ C = 3.14 \times 10 = 31.4 \, \text{cm}. $$

Alternatively, you can apply the formula 

$$ C = 2 \times \pi \times r $$ 

where $ r $ denotes the radius of the circle. Since the radius is half of the diameter, for a diameter of $10 \, \text{cm}$, the radius $ r $ is 

$$ r = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{cm}. $$ 

Substituting this value into the formula gives us 

$$ C = 2 \times \pi \times 5 = 10 \times \pi. $$ 

Again, using $ \pi \approx 3.14 $, we can find the circumference:

$$ C = 10 \times 3.14 = 31.4 \, \text{cm}. $$

Understanding these formulas is fundamental for solving problems involving circles. The circumference represents the distance around the edge of the circle, and knowing how to compute it is useful in various real-life applications, such as calculating the amount of material needed to encircle a circular object. Remember, the essential step is to know either the diameter or the radius and to use the value of $ \pi $ to accurately determine the circumference.
