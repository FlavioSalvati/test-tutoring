The vector representation of a displacement of $4$ units to the right and $3$ units up is given by the vector $(4, 3)$.

In mathematics, particularly in geometry and physics, a vector is defined as a quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction. When we refer to displacement, we are specifically discussing a change in position. In this scenario, moving $4$ units to the right and $3$ units up can be effectively represented as a vector in a two-dimensional coordinate system.

The vector $(4, 3)$ is composed of two components: the first component, $4$, indicates the horizontal displacement, while the second component, $3$, indicates the vertical displacement. The horizontal component specifies the distance to move along the x-axis, and the vertical component specifies the distance to move along the y-axis.

To visualize this process, consider starting at the origin point $(0, 0)$ on a graph. Moving $4$ units to the right means transitioning from $(0, 0)$ to $(4, 0)$. Next, moving $3$ units up takes you from $(4, 0)$ to $(4, 3)$. Thus, the final position $(4, 3)$ represents your location after the entire displacement.

Vectors are invaluable in various fields of mathematics and science because they allow for a clear and concise description of movements and forces. By utilizing vectors, we can easily perform operations such as addition and subtraction, as well as analyze different displacements and forces, thereby simplifying the resolution of complex problems.
