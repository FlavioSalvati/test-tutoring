To convert the number $3.2 \times 10^5$ into standard numerical form, the result is $320,000$.

When you encounter a number expressed in scientific notation—such as $3.2 \times 10^5$—it indicates that you need to multiply the base number ($3.2$) by $10$ raised to the power of $5$. The exponent (in this case, $5$) specifies how many places you should move the decimal point to the right.

Starting with the number $3.2$, you will move the decimal point $5$ places to the right. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. Begin with $3.2$.
2. Move the decimal one place to the right: $32$.
3. Move it another place to the right: $320$.
4. Move it again: $3200$.
5. Move it once more: $32000$.
6. Finally, move it one last time: $320000$.

Thus, $3.2 \times 10^5$ is equivalent to $320,000$. This method allows you to efficiently convert scientific notation into standard numerical form, facilitating easier comprehension and application in everyday calculations.
