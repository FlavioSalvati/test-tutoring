To determine the decay factor, you must divide the final amount by the initial amount, followed by taking the $ n $-th root of the result.

In more detail, the decay factor quantifies the extent to which a quantity diminishes over a specified time period. To calculate it, you need to know two key values: the initial amount (the quantity you start with) and the final amount (the quantity you end up with) after a designated number of time periods. The formula for calculating the decay factor is as follows:

$$ 
\text{Decay Factor} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Amount}}{\text{Initial Amount}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} 
$$

In this formula, $ n $ denotes the number of time periods during which the decay takes place. For instance, let's say you start with an initial amount of $100$ units, which decreases to $25$ units over a span of $4$ years. You would input these values into the formula as shown below:

$$ 
\text{Decay Factor} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} 
$$

First, compute the ratio of the final amount to the initial amount:

$$ 
\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 
$$

Next, take the fourth root of $0.25$ (since the decay occurs over $4$ years):

$$ 
0.25^{\frac{1}{4}} \approx 0.707 
$$

Thus, the decay factor is approximately $0.707$. This indicates that each year, the quantity is multiplied by $0.707$, signifying a reduction. Understanding the decay factor is crucial for analyzing the rate at which something diminishes over time. This concept is widely applicable in various fields, including radioactive decay, asset depreciation, and population decline.
