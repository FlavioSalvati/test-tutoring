The probability of selecting a heart followed by a spade, without replacement, is given as $\frac{1}{17}$.

To determine this probability, we must consider the total number of cards in a standard deck and how the probabilities shift after the first card is drawn. A standard deck contains 52 cards, which include 13 hearts and 13 spades.

First, we calculate the probability of drawing a heart. Since there are 13 hearts out of 52 total cards, the probability of drawing a heart is 

$$
\frac{13}{52}
$$ 

which simplifies to 

$$
\frac{1}{4}.
$$ 

Once a heart is drawn, it is not replaced, leaving us with 51 cards remaining in the deck. Next, we need to calculate the probability of drawing a spade from these 51 cards. There are still 13 spades available, so the probability of drawing a spade at this point is 

$$
\frac{13}{51}.
$$ 

To find the combined probability of both events occurring in sequence (drawing a heart first, followed by a spade), we multiply the probabilities of each individual event. Therefore, we calculate:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{13}{51} = \frac{13}{204}.
$$ 

Finally, we simplify the fraction $\frac{13}{204}$. Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by 13, resulting in:

$$
\frac{13 \div 13}{204 \div 13} = \frac{1}{17}.
$$ 

In conclusion, the probability of selecting a heart and then a spade without replacement is $\frac{1}{17}$.
