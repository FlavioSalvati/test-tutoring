Pythagoras' Theorem asserts that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

More specifically, Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry, particularly when studying right-angled triangles. The hypotenuse, denoted as $c$, is the longest side of the triangle and is located opposite the right angle. If we label the lengths of the other two sides as $a$ and $b$, the theorem can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

This equation indicates that by squaring the lengths of the two shorter sides and adding the results, one will obtain the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

For instance, consider a right-angled triangle where one side measures $3$ units and the other side measures $4$ units. We can apply Pythagoras' Theorem to determine the length of the hypotenuse. According to the theorem, we have:

$$
3^2 + 4^2 = c^2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
9 + 16 = 25
$$

Thus, we find that $c^2 = 25$. By taking the square root of both sides, we conclude that:

$$
c = 5
$$

Consequently, the length of the hypotenuse is $5$ units.

Pythagoras' Theorem is not only instrumental in solving problems related to right-angled triangles but also finds applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science. It is essential for calculating distances, designing structures, and even developing navigation systems. A solid understanding of this theorem lays the groundwork for further exploration in mathematics and its practical applications in the real world.
