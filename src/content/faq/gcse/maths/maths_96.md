Density is determined by dividing an object's mass by its volume.

To calculate density, you need two essential pieces of information: the mass of the object and its volume. Mass represents the amount of matter present in an object, typically measured in grams ($g$) or kilograms ($kg$). Volume denotes the amount of space that the object occupies, usually measured in cubic centimeters ($\text{cm}^3$) or cubic meters ($\text{m}^3$).

The formula for calculating density is given by:

$$ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} $$

For instance, consider a block of wood with a mass of $200$ grams and a volume of $100$ cubic centimeters. The density can be calculated as follows:

$$ \text{Density} = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{100 \text{ cm}^3} = 2 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$

This result indicates that the density of the wood is $2$ grams per cubic centimeter.

It is crucial to maintain consistent units when calculating density. If the mass is measured in kilograms and the volume in cubic meters, the resulting density will be expressed in kilograms per cubic meter ($\text{kg/m}^3$). If the units are inconsistent, conversions must be performed to ensure uniformity before carrying out the calculation.

Understanding density has practical implications in various real-world scenarios, such as determining whether an object will float or sink in water. Objects with a density greater than that of water ($1 \text{ g/cm}^3$) will sink, whereas those with a lower density will float.
