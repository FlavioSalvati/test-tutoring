3. **Select the Multiplication Operation**: Next, indicate that you want to multiply by pressing the multiplication sign. This symbol is typically represented as 'Ã—' or, on some calculators, as an asterisk '*'.

4. **Input the Second Number**: Now, enter the second number, $8.2$, by pressing the keys '8', '.', and '2' in that order.

5. **Calculate the Result**: Finally, press the equals sign '=' to obtain the result. The calculator will display the outcome of the multiplication.

In this particular case, multiplying $0.75$ by $8.2$ yields a result of $6.15$. Therefore, when you multiply $0.75$ by $8.2$, the product is $6.15$. This straightforward method can be applied to multiply any two numbers, making it a valuable skill for solving a wide range of mathematical problems.
