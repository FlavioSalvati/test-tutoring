To sketch the graph of the function $ y = \frac{1}{x} $, we will identify key points and draw the hyperbola while considering its asymptotic behavior.

First, it is important to recognize that $ y = \frac{1}{x} $ represents a hyperbola with two distinct branches. The graph features vertical and horizontal asymptotes at $ x = 0 $ and $ y = 0 $, respectively. This means that while the curve approaches these lines, it never actually intersects them.

We begin by plotting essential points that will help define the shape of the graph. For positive values of $ x $, we can select $ x = 1 $ and $ x = 2 $:

- When $ x = 1 $, we find $ y = 1 $.
- When $ x = 2 $, we calculate $ y = \frac{1}{2} $.

For negative values of $ x $, we can choose $ x = -1 $ and $ x = -2 $:

- When $ x = -1 $, we find $ y = -1 $.
- When $ x = -2 $, we calculate $ y = -\frac{1}{2} $.

These selected points are crucial in shaping the graph.

Next, we will draw the hyperbola. For $ x > 0 $, the curve resides in the first quadrant, approaching both the $ x $-axis and $ y $-axis without ever touching them. Conversely, for $ x < 0 $, the curve is located in the third quadrant, again approaching the axes but never intersecting them. Notably, the graph exhibits symmetry about the origin, meaning that a 180-degree rotation around the origin yields an identical graph.

It is also essential to remember that the graph never crosses the $ x $-axis or the $ y $-axis. As $ x $ approaches $ 0 $ from the positive side, $ y $ tends toward positive infinity. Conversely, as $ x $ approaches $ 0 $ from the negative side, $ y $ tends toward negative infinity. This behavior is critical for accurately sketching the graph, ensuring we reflect the true nature of the function.
