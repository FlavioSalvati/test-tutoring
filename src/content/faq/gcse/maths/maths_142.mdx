To calculate the total amount after applying a 12% tax on £150, follow these steps:

First, determine the tax amount by calculating 12% of £150. To find a percentage of a number, convert the percentage into a decimal and then multiply it by the number.

In this case, 12% can be expressed as the decimal $0.12$. Now, multiply £150 by $0.12$:

$$ 
150 \times 0.12 = 18 
$$

This calculation shows that the tax amount is £18.

Next, add the tax amount to the original price to find the total amount:

$$ 
150 + 18 = 168 
$$

Thus, the total amount after including a 12% tax on £150 comes to £168.

This method can be applied to any percentage and any original amount. Remember to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by $100$, multiply by the original amount to calculate the tax, and then add the tax to the original amount to obtain the total.
