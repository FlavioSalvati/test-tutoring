To estimate the product of $34$ and $19$, we can round each number to the nearest ten and then multiply the rounded values.

When estimating the product of two numbers, rounding them to the nearest ten simplifies the calculation significantly. For the number $34$, the nearest ten is $30$, and for $19$, the nearest ten is $20$. By rounding these numbers, we can quickly arrive at an estimate for the product.

Next, we multiply the rounded numbers: 

$$
30 \times 20.
$$ 

To perform this multiplication, we start by multiplying the non-zero digits: 

$$
3 \times 2 = 6.
$$ 

After that, we need to account for the two zeros in the original rounded numbers, which gives us:

$$
600.
$$ 

Thus, the estimated product of $34$ and $19$ is approximately $600$.

This estimation method is particularly useful because it streamlines the multiplication process, making it easier to calculate mentally or with minimal written work. While the estimate may not be exact, it provides a reasonable approximation that can be beneficial in various practical situations.
