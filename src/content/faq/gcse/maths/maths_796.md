To manage your time effectively during a 2-hour exam, it is important to allocate time for each section and adhere to this schedule.

Begin by skimming through the entire exam quickly to gain an overview of the questions and their respective marks. This initial review will help you identify which questions carry more weight and may require additional time. For instance, if the exam is worth a total of $100$ marks and consists of $10$ questions, each question is approximately worth $10$ marks. However, be aware that some questions may be worth more, so adjust your time allocation accordingly.

Next, divide your $120$ minutes (the total duration of the exam) based on the marks assigned to each question. For example, if a question is valued at $10$ marks, you might allocate roughly $12$ minutes to answer it. For questions with higher mark values, allocate more time, but be cautious not to spend excessive time on any single question.

Start with the questions you find easiest. This approach will help build your confidence and ensure you secure those marks early on. If you encounter a particularly challenging question, move on and return to it later. This strategy prevents you from wasting valuable time and allows you to attempt all questions.

Keep a close watch on the clock. It may be beneficial to bring a watch or utilize the exam room clock to keep track of your time. Set mini-deadlines for each section and strive to meet them. For example, if you have $10$ questions, aim to complete $5$ questions within the first hour.

Finally, reserve the last $10$ to $15$ minutes for reviewing your answers. This final check will provide you with an opportunity to correct any mistakes and ensure that you havenâ€™t overlooked any questions. By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your time and maximize your performance on the exam.
