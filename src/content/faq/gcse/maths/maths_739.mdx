To estimate the quotient of $567$ by $12$, we can simplify the numbers through rounding before performing the division. 

First, we round $567$ to the nearest ten. Although $567$ would round up to $570$, for easier calculation, we can round it down to $560$. Next, we round $12$ to the nearest ten, which gives us $10$.

Now we can divide the rounded numbers: 

$$
\frac{560}{10}.
$$

This calculation is straightforward, as dividing by $10$ involves shifting the decimal point one place to the left. Therefore, 

$$
\frac{560}{10} = 56.
$$

This estimation method allows for a quick and efficient way to gauge the quotient without resorting to a calculator or performing long division. While the exact quotient of $567$ divided by $12$ is approximately $47.25$, our estimation of $56$ provides a sufficiently close approximation for many practical situations, helping to convey the scale of the numbers involved.
