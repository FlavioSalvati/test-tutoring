A function in mathematics is defined as a relationship in which each input corresponds to exactly one output.

To elaborate further, a function is a specific type of relation that connects each element from a set of inputs, known as the domain, to precisely one element from a set of potential outputs, referred to as the range. You can think of a function as a machine: you feed it an input, and it produces an output. For instance, if we have a function that adds $2$ to any number you input, then entering $3$ would yield an output of $5$.

Functions are commonly expressed using the notation $ f(x) $, where $ f $ represents the name of the function and $ x $ denotes the input value. For example, if we define the function as $ f(x) = x + 2 $, then calculating $ f(3) $ results in $ 3 + 2 = 5 $. This notation allows us to clearly see how the function operates on any given input.

An important characteristic of functions is that each input must be paired with exactly one output. This implies that if you input the same value more than once, you will consistently receive the same result. For example, if we consider the function $ g(x) = x^2 $, then $ g(2) $ will always equal $4$, regardless of how many times you perform the calculation.

Functions can be represented in various formats, including equations, graphs, tables, or even descriptive text. Understanding functions is essential, as they are utilized to model real-world scenarios in fields such as science, engineering, economics, and many others. By studying functions, you equip yourself with a powerful tool for analyzing and solving complex problems.
