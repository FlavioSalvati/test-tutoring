The inequality that expresses "r is more than or equal to 2" is written as 

$$ 
r \geq 2 
$$

In mathematics, inequalities are employed to illustrate the relationship between two values when they are not necessarily equal. The symbol $ \geq $ indicates "greater than or equal to." Therefore, when we state that "r is more than or equal to 2," we mean that the value of $ r $ can either be $ 2 $ or any number larger than $ 2 $. This is succinctly expressed as 

$$ 
r \geq 2 
$$

To clarify, the inequality $ r \geq 2 $ encompasses all numbers that are either equal to $ 2 $ or greater than $ 2 $. For instance, the numbers $ 2 $, $ 3 $, $ 4 $, $ 5 $, and so on, are all solutions that fulfill this inequality. Additionally, fractional values such as $ 2.1 $, $ 3.5 $, and even large numbers like $ 1000 $ are included, as they are all greater than $ 2 $.

When graphing this inequality on a number line, you would place a solid dot at $ 2 $ to signify that $ 2 $ is part of the solution set. Subsequently, you would shade the region to the right of $ 2 $ to represent all numbers exceeding $ 2 $. This visual representation effectively demonstrates all the possible values that $ r $ can assume.

Grasping the concept of inequalities is vital in tackling numerous mathematical problems, as they enable us to convey a range of potential solutions instead of a singular value. This principle is extensively utilized across various disciplines, including science, engineering, and economics, making it an essential component of your GCSE Maths curriculum.
