To multiply surds, such as $\sqrt{6}$ and $\sqrt{2}$, you can follow a straightforward approach. The process involves multiplying the values inside the square roots:

$$
\sqrt{6} \times \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{12}.
$$

When multiplying surds, you can apply the property that states:

$$
\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \times b}.
$$

In this scenario, you have $\sqrt{6}$ and $\sqrt{2}$. By utilizing the property, you multiply the numbers within the square roots:

$$
6 \times 2 = 12.
$$

Thus, you arrive at:

$$
\sqrt{6} \times \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{12}.
$$

Next, you may want to simplify $\sqrt{12}$, if possible. To do this, identify any square numbers that are factors of $12$. The number $12$ can be factored into $4 \times 3$, where $4$ is a perfect square (since $4 = 2^2$). Therefore, we can express $\sqrt{12}$ as:

$$
\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \times 3} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{3}.
$$

Since $\sqrt{4} = 2$, we find:

$$
\sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}.
$$

Consequently, the simplified form of the product $\sqrt{6} \times \sqrt{2}$ is:

$$
2\sqrt{3}.
$$

This method of multiplying and then simplifying surds is a fundamental technique in GCSE Maths and is useful for tackling more complex problems that involve surds.
