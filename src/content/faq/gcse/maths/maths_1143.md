To determine the measures of angles formed by parallel lines intersected by a transversal, we can apply the rules regarding corresponding, alternate, and co-interior angles.

When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, it creates several types of angles. Corresponding angles, which are located in matching corners where the transversal crosses the parallel lines, are equal. For instance, if one of these angles measures $50^\circ$, the corresponding angle on the other parallel line will also measure $50^\circ$.

Alternate angles, often referred to as Z-angles, are also equal. These angles are situated on opposite sides of the transversal but within the space between the parallel lines. For example, if one alternate angle measures $60^\circ$, the other alternate angle will likewise measure $60^\circ$.

Co-interior angles, also known as C-angles, are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to $180^\circ$. These angles are found on the same side of the transversal and between the parallel lines. For example, if one co-interior angle measures $70^\circ$, the other co-interior angle must measure $110^\circ$, since $70^\circ + 110^\circ = 180^\circ$.

By recognizing these relationships, you can easily compute unknown angles. For instance, if you know the measure of one angle, you can use these rules to find its corresponding, alternate, or co-interior angle. Mastering these concepts is vital for solving a variety of problems in geometry, particularly those that involve parallel lines and transversals.
