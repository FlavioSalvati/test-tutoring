To reflect a shape over the x-axis, you need to invert the y-coordinates of all its points while keeping the x-coordinates unchanged.

When reflecting a shape over the x-axis, you essentially create a mirror image of that shape across the x-axis. This means that for each point on the original shape, there exists a corresponding point on the reflected shape that is directly opposite it on the other side of the x-axis. To perform this reflection, take each point of the shape, represented as $(x, y)$, and transform it into $(x, -y)$. The x-coordinate remains unchanged because the reflection does not affect the horizontal position of the points, while the y-coordinate changes sign, effectively flipping the point to the opposite side of the x-axis.

For instance, consider a triangle with vertices at $(2, 3)$, $(4, 5)$, and $(6, 1)$. Reflecting this triangle over the x-axis results in new vertices at $(2, -3)$, $(4, -5)$, and $(6, -1)$. Notice that only the y-coordinates have been altered, becoming their negative values, while the x-coordinates remain the same.

This method is applicable to any shape, whether it is a simple triangle, a complex polygon, or even a curve. By consistently applying the transformation from $(x, y)$ to $(x, -y)$ to all points of the shape, you can effectively reflect it over the x-axis. This concept is fundamental in coordinate geometry, aiding in the understanding of symmetry and transformations within a coordinate plane.
