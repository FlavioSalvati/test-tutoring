The equation of a line that is parallel to $y = 5x + 2$ and passes through the point $(4, 1)$ is given by $y = 5x - 19$.

To understand this, we first need to recall that parallel lines share the same slope. The slope (or gradient) of the line $y = 5x + 2$ is $5$. As such, any line that is parallel to it will also have a slope of $5$.

Next, we will determine the equation of the line that specifically passes through the point $(4, 1)$. To do this, we utilize the point-slope form of a line, which is expressed as:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

In this formula, $m$ represents the slope, and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. For our scenario, we have $m = 5$, $x_1 = 4$, and $y_1 = 1$.

By substituting these values into the point-slope equation, we arrive at:

$$
y - 1 = 5(x - 4)
$$

Next, we simplify this equation step-by-step:

1. Distributing the $5$ on the right side gives us:

$$
y - 1 = 5x - 20
$$

2. Adding $1$ to both sides results in:

$$
y = 5x - 19
$$

Thus, the equation of the line that is parallel to $y = 5x + 2$ and passes through the point $(4, 1)$ is indeed $y = 5x - 19$. This approach guarantees that the new line maintains the same slope as the original line, ensuring they are parallel, while also ensuring it passes through the specified point.
