The equation of the line is given by 

$$
y = 4x - 1.
$$

To gain a clearer understanding of this equation, let's break it down. The standard form of a straight line is 

$$
y = mx + c,
$$

where $ m $ denotes the slope (or gradient) of the line, and $ c $ represents the y-intercept. The slope indicates the steepness of the line, while the y-intercept is the point at which the line intersects the y-axis.

In our case, the slope $ m $ is 4. This means that for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by 4 units. The y-intercept $ c $ is -1, indicating that the line crosses the y-axis at the point $ (0, -1) $.

When we substitute the specified values of $ m $ and $ c $ into the equation $ y = mx + c $, we arrive at:

$$
y = 4x - 1.
$$

This equation encapsulates all the necessary information about the line. For instance, if you wish to determine the value of $ y $ when $ x = 2 $, you would replace $ x $ with 2 in the equation:

$$
y = 4(2) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7.
$$

Thus, when $ x $ equals 2, $ y $ equals 7. This approach can be employed to find the coordinates of any point on the line. Mastering the formation and application of the equation of a line is a crucial skill in GCSE Maths, enabling you to effectively analyze and graph linear relationships.
