To find the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to the line given by the equation $ y = -2x + 4 $, we need to calculate the negative reciprocal of its gradient.

The gradient (or slope) of a line indicates its steepness. For the line $ y = -2x + 4 $, the gradient is $ -2 $. To determine the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to this one, we utilize the concept of negative reciprocals.

To find a negative reciprocal, we first express the gradient $ -2 $ as a fraction: 

$$
-\frac{2}{1}.
$$

Next, we take the reciprocal of this fraction, resulting in:

$$
-\frac{1}{2}.
$$

Finally, we change the sign, yielding:

$$
\frac{1}{2}.
$$

Thus, the gradient of a line that is perpendicular to $ y = -2x + 4 $ is $ \frac{1}{2} $.

This relationship is significant because the gradients of two perpendicular lines multiply to give $ -1 $. For verification, if we multiply the gradient of the original line, $ -2 $, by the gradient of the perpendicular line, $ \frac{1}{2} $, we have:

$$
-2 \times \frac{1}{2} = -1,
$$

which confirms that the lines are indeed perpendicular.

Understanding this principle is essential for solving problems related to perpendicular lines in coordinate geometry. It is particularly useful for tasks such as deriving equations of lines, analyzing geometric shapes, and addressing real-world problems involving angles and slopes.
