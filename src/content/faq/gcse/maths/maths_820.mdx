To determine the final amount in situations involving exponential growth, you can use the following formula:

$$ A = P \times (1 + r)^t $$

In this expression:
- $ A $ represents the final amount,
- $ P $ denotes the initial amount (or principal),
- $ r $ is the growth rate (expressed as a decimal), and
- $ t $ is the duration over which the growth occurs.

Exponential growth is characterized by a quantity increasing at a rate that is proportional to its current value. This results in growth that accelerates over time.

As an example, consider starting with an initial amount of £100 that grows at an annual rate of 5%. First, convert the percentage growth rate into decimal form: $ 5\% $ becomes $ 0.05 $. If you want to calculate the amount you will have after $ 3 $ years, you can substitute these values into the formula:

$$ A = 100 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 $$

First, calculate the growth factor:

$$ 1 + 0.05 = 1.05 $$

Next, raise this growth factor to the power of the time period:

$$ 1.05^3 \approx 1.157625 $$

Finally, multiply this result by the initial amount:

$$ A = 100 \times 1.157625 \approx 115.76 $$

Therefore, after $ 3 $ years, you would have approximately £115.76. 

This method can be applied to any context involving exponential growth, such as population increases, investment returns, or the spread of diseases. Just remember to convert the growth rate to a decimal and ensure you use the correct time period in your calculations.
