The sum of the vectors $(2, 5)$ and $(3, -5)$ yields the resultant vector $(5, 0)$.

When adding vectors, the process involves summing their corresponding components. Vectors are typically expressed in the format $(x, y)$, where $x$ represents the horizontal component and $y$ signifies the vertical component. In this instance, we are working with two vectors: $(2, 5)$ and $(3, -5)$.

To perform the addition of these vectors, we start by adding the $x$-components together and then the $y$-components. For the $x$-components, we have $2$ from the first vector and $3$ from the second vector. Thus, we compute:

$$
2 + 3 = 5.
$$

Next, we turn our attention to the $y$-components. The first vector has a $y$-component of $5$, while the second vector has a $y$-component of $-5$. Adding these components together gives us:

$$
5 + (-5) = 0.
$$

Therefore, the result of adding the vectors $(2, 5)$ and $(3, -5)$ is the vector $(5, 0)$. This indicates that the combined effect of these two vectors results in a movement of $5$ units to the right, with no vertical movement. This example illustrates the concept of vector addition, which is a fundamental principle in both mathematics and physics.
