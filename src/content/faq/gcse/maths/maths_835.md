The surd form of $\sqrt{48}$ can be expressed as $4\sqrt{3}$.

To simplify $\sqrt{48}$ into its simplest surd form, we begin by factorizing the number $48$ into its prime factors:

$$
48 = 2 \times 24 \\
= 2 \times 2 \times 12 \\
= 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 6 \\
= 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3
$$

Next, we can group these factors into pairs of the same number:

$$
48 = (2 \times 2) \times (2 \times 2) \times 3 \\
= 4 \times 4 \times 3
$$

Using the property that the square root of a product equals the product of the square roots, we can simplify further:

$$
\sqrt{48} = \sqrt{(4 \times 4 \times 3)} \\
= \sqrt{(4 \times 4)} \times \sqrt{3} \\
= 4\sqrt{3}
$$

Therefore, the surd form of $\sqrt{48}$ is $4\sqrt{3}$. This indicates that $\sqrt{48}$ can be simplified to $4$ times the square root of $3$. This surd form is advantageous because it is simpler and more manageable for subsequent calculations.
