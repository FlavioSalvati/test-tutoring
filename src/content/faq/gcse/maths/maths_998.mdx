The coordinates of the midpoint between the points $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$ are $(2, 4)$.

To determine the midpoint between two points, we utilize the midpoint formula, which is given by 

$$
\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right),
$$ 

where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ represent the coordinates of the two points. In our example, the points are $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$.

First, we calculate the sum of the x-coordinates of the two points:

$$
1 + 3 = 4.
$$ 

Next, we divide this sum by $2$ to find the x-coordinate of the midpoint:

$$
\frac{4}{2} = 2.
$$ 

Now, we proceed to calculate the sum of the y-coordinates:

$$
2 + 6 = 8.
$$ 

We then divide this sum by $2$ to find the y-coordinate of the midpoint:

$$
\frac{8}{2} = 4.
$$ 

Thus, the coordinates of the midpoint are $(2, 4)$. This indicates that the point $(2, 4)$ is located exactly halfway between $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 6)$ along a straight line. This midpoint calculation method can be applied to any pair of points, making it an invaluable tool in geometry.
