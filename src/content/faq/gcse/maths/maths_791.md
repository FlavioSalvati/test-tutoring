To calculate the cube of $4$ using a calculator, you need to enter the number $4$ and then utilize the exponentiation function to raise it to the power of $3$.

Most scientific calculators feature a dedicated button for exponentiation, typically labeled as "^", "x^y", or "y^x". Below is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

1. **Power On the Calculator**: Make sure your calculator is turned on and ready for use.
2. **Input the Base Number**: Enter the number $4$ by pressing the corresponding button on your calculator.
3. **Access the Exponentiation Function**: Locate the exponentiation button on your calculator. This button may vary by model but is commonly labeled as "^", "x^y", or "y^x".
4. **Enter the Exponent**: After selecting the exponentiation function, input the number $3$. This indicates that you wish to raise $4$ to the power of $3$.
5. **Calculate the Result**: Finally, press the "=" or "Enter" button to execute the calculation.

For instance, on a standard scientific calculator, you would press the following sequence: '4', '^', '3', '='. The display should then show the result, which is $64$.

If your calculator lacks an exponentiation function, you can manually compute the cube by multiplying the number by itself three times. For example, you would press: '4', 'x', '4', '=' to get $16$, then take that result and multiply by $4$ again by pressing 'x', '4', '='. This will also yield $64$.

Mastering these functions on your calculator can significantly enhance your efficiency and minimize errors in calculations, especially during exams or when tackling complex mathematical problems.
