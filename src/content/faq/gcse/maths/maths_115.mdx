To calculate the factorial of $5$ using a calculator, you need to multiply $5$ by each positive integer that is less than it.

The factorial, denoted as $n!$, is defined as the product of all positive integers up to $n$. Specifically, for $5!$, you multiply $5$ by $4$, then by $3$, then by $2$, and finally by $1$. Thus, we have:

$$
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
$$

If you are using a basic calculator, follow these steps to compute $5!$:

1. Enter $5$.
2. Press the multiplication button ($\times$).
3. Enter $4$, then press the equals button ($=$).
4. Take the result and press the multiplication button ($\times$) again.
5. Enter $3$ and press the equals button ($=$).
6. Continue this process for $2$ and $1$.

Alternatively, many scientific calculators feature a factorial button, typically labeled as $n!$. If your calculator includes this function, you can calculate the factorial more efficiently by following these steps:

1. Enter $5$.
2. Press the $n!$ button.

The result for $5!$ is $120$. Understanding this factorial calculation process is essential, especially for tackling more complex problems in GCSE Maths.
