To simplify the expression $\frac{x^5}{x^3}$, you can apply the rule of exponents by subtracting the exponents. Specifically, this gives you:

$$
\frac{x^5}{x^3} = x^{5-3} = x^2.
$$

When simplifying expressions that involve exponents, it is crucial to remember the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that when you divide two powers with the same base, you subtract the exponent of the denominator from the exponent of the numerator. In this instance, both the numerator and the denominator share the base $x$.

For the expression $\frac{x^5}{x^3}$, you take the exponent of $x$ in the numerator, which is $5$, and subtract the exponent of $x$ in the denominator, which is $3$. Thus, you compute:

$$
x^{5-3}.
$$

Simplifying $5-3$ yields $2$, resulting in:

$$
x^2.
$$

This method is effective due to the properties of exponents. When you divide like bases, you effectively cancel out the common factors. For instance, $x^5$ can be expressed as $x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x$, while $x^3$ can be expressed as $x \cdot x \cdot x$. When you divide these, three $x$ terms in the numerator cancel with the three $x$ terms in the denominator, leaving you with:

$$
x \cdot x,
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
x^2.
$$

Mastering these rules is essential for simplifying more complex algebraic expressions and is a fundamental skill in GCSE Maths.
