To determine the surface area of a rectangular prism, you need to calculate the total area of all six faces.

A rectangular prism consists of six rectangular faces. In this case, the dimensions of the prism are given as $4 \, \text{cm}$, $5 \, \text{cm}$, and $6 \, \text{cm}$. To find the surface area, we will compute the area of each pair of opposite faces and then sum these areas.

First, let's identify the three pairs of opposite faces:
1. The pair of faces with dimensions $4 \, \text{cm}$ by $5 \, \text{cm}$.
2. The pair of faces with dimensions $4 \, \text{cm}$ by $6 \, \text{cm}$.
3. The pair of faces with dimensions $5 \, \text{cm}$ by $6 \, \text{cm}$.

Next, we will calculate the area of each pair of faces:

1. For the faces measuring $4 \, \text{cm}$ by $5 \, \text{cm}$, the area of one face is:
   $$ 
   4 \times 5 = 20 \, \text{cm}^2 
   $$
   Since there are two such faces, their combined area is:
   $$ 
   2 \times 20 = 40 \, \text{cm}^2 
   $$

2. For the faces measuring $4 \, \text{cm}$ by $6 \, \text{cm}$, the area of one face is:
   $$ 
   4 \times 6 = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 
   $$
   Thus, the total area for the two faces is:
   $$ 
   2 \times 24 = 48 \, \text{cm}^2 
   $$

3. For the faces measuring $5 \, \text{cm}$ by $6 \, \text{cm}$, the area of one face is:
   $$ 
   5 \times 6 = 30 \, \text{cm}^2 
   $$
   Consequently, the total area for the two faces is:
   $$ 
   2 \times 30 = 60 \, \text{cm}^2 
   $$

Finally, we add the areas of all the faces together to obtain the total surface area:
$$ 
40 + 48 + 60 = 148 \, \text{cm}^2 
$$

Therefore, the surface area of the rectangular prism is $148 \, \text{cm}^2$.
