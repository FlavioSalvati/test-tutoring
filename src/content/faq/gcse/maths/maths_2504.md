To construct a triangle given two angles and a side, you can use the ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) method.

**Step 1: Draw the Base**

Begin by drawing the given side to the correct length using a ruler. This side will serve as the base of your triangle. Label the endpoints of this side as points $A$ and $B$.

**Step 2: Construct the First Angle**

Next, use a protractor to measure one of the given angles at point $A$. Position the center of the protractor at point $A$ and align it with the base $AB$. Mark the angle's measure on the paper, then draw a ray from point $A$ through this mark. This ray will represent one side of the triangle.

**Step 3: Construct the Second Angle**

Now, repeat the process for the second angle at point $B$. Place the center of the protractor at point $B$, align it with the base $AB$, and mark the measure of the angle. Draw a ray from point $B$ through this mark. This ray will form the other side of the triangle.

**Step 4: Identify the Third Vertex**

The intersection point of the two rays is point $C$, which will be the third vertex of the triangle. Connect points $A$ and $C$, as well as points $B$ and $C$, to complete the triangle.

**Step 5: Verify Your Construction**

Finally, verify your work by ensuring that the sum of the three angles in the triangle is $180^\circ$, a fundamental property of all triangles. This method guarantees that the triangle is accurately constructed based on the specified angles and side.
