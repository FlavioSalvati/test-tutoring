You can compare data sets using the interquartile range (IQR), which measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

The interquartile range (IQR) is a key indicator of statistical dispersion, representing how spread out the values in a data set are. To calculate the IQR, you first need to determine the first quartile ($Q_1$) and the third quartile ($Q_3$) of the data set. The first quartile ($Q_1$) is defined as the median of the lower half of the data, while the third quartile ($Q_3$) is the median of the upper half. The IQR is then derived by subtracting $Q_1$ from $Q_3$:

$$ \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 $$

When comparing two or more data sets, the IQR provides valuable insights into the variability within each set. A larger IQR indicates that the data is more spread out, whereas a smaller IQR suggests that the data is more concentrated around the median. For instance, if Data Set A has an IQR of $10$ and Data Set B has an IQR of $5$, this indicates that Data Set A exhibits greater variability in its middle 50% of values relative to Data Set B.

The IQR is particularly advantageous because it remains unaffected by outliers or extreme values, which can distort other measures of spread, such as the range. This characteristic makes the IQR a robust tool for comparing the consistency and reliability of different data sets. By analyzing the IQR, you can gain deeper insights into the distribution and spread of the data, enabling you to make more informed decisions based on the inherent characteristics of the data.
