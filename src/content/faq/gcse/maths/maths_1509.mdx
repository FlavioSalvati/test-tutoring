The probability scale for a likely event ranges between $0.5$ and $1$, with values tending closer to $1$.

In probability theory, we utilize a scale from $0$ to $1$ to quantify the likelihood of an event occurring. A probability of $0$ signifies that the event is impossible, while a probability of $1$ indicates that the event is certain. When we refer to an event as "likely," we imply that there is a substantial chance of it happening, though it is not guaranteed. Thus, the probability for a likely event is nearer to $1$ than to $0.5$, but it does not reach $1$.

For instance, consider a bag containing $8$ red balls and $2$ blue balls. The probability of selecting a red ball can be calculated as follows:

$$
P(\text{red}) = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8.
$$

This probability of $0.8$ classifies the event as likely, as it is significantly closer to $1$ than to $0.5$. Conversely, if you were to select a blue ball, the probability would be:

$$
P(\text{blue}) = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2,
$$

which is considered unlikely since it is much closer to $0$.

By understanding where an event falls on the probability scale, you can better predict outcomes and make informed decisions. In everyday language, we often use terms such as "likely," "unlikely," "certain," and "impossible" to express probabilities. However, in mathematical contexts, we prefer to use numerical values for greater precision. Therefore, when you hear that an event is likely, you can interpret its probability as lying between $0.5$ and $1$, with a strong inclination towards $1$.
