The derivative of the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is given by 

$$
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
$$

To understand how we arrive at this result, let's break it down systematically. The function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ can be expressed in exponent form as $ y = x^{1/2} $. When differentiating functions of the form $ y = x^n $, where $ n $ is a constant, we apply the power rule. The power rule states that the derivative of $ x^n $ is 

$$
nx^{n-1}.
$$

Now, applying the power rule to our function $ y = x^{1/2} $, we have:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2} x^{(1/2) - 1}.
$$

Next, we simplify the exponent:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2}.
$$

The term $ x^{-1/2} $ can be rewritten as $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} $. Thus, substituting this back into our expression, we obtain:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
$$

Consequently, the derivative of $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is 

$$
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
$$

This derivative informs us about the rate at which the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ changes with respect to $ x $. For instance, if we wish to determine the rate of change of $ y $ at the point where $ x = 4 $, we can substitute $ x = 4 $ into the derivative:

$$
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{4}} = \frac{1}{4}.
$$

This result indicates that at $ x = 4 $, the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is increasing at a rate of $ \frac{1}{4} $.
