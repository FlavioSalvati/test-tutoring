The gradient of the line that passes through the points $(0, 0)$ and $(4, 8)$ is $2$.

To calculate the gradient of a line, you need to determine the change in the $y$-coordinates divided by the change in the $x$-coordinates between two points on the line. This relationship is commonly known as "rise over run." The formula for the gradient $m$ is given by:

$$
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

For our specific points, we will label $(0, 0)$ as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(4, 8)$ as $(x_2, y_2)$. Thus, we have:

- $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$
- $(x_2, y_2) = (4, 8)$

Next, we calculate the changes in the coordinates, starting with the change in $y$ ($\Delta y$) and the change in $x$ ($\Delta x$):

$$
\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 8 - 0 = 8
$$

$$
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 0 = 4
$$

Now, we can substitute these values into the gradient formula:

$$
m = \frac{8}{4} = 2
$$

Consequently, the gradient of the line connecting the points $(0, 0)$ and $(4, 8)$ is $2$. This indicates that for every unit increase in the $x$-coordinate, the $y$-coordinate increases by $2$ units. Understanding this concept is essential for grasping the steepness of a line on a graph.
