To compute the expression $(7^{-2}) \times (7^3)$, we will utilize the property of exponents that states when multiplying two powers with the same base, we can simplify the expression by adding the exponents. In this case, the base is $7$, with exponents $-2$ and $3$.

According to the laws of indices, we can express the multiplication as follows:

$$
7^{-2} \times 7^3 = 7^{-2 + 3}
$$

Now, let's perform the addition of the exponents:

$$
-2 + 3 = 1
$$

This simplifies our expression to:

$$
7^1
$$

Since any number raised to the power of $1$ is the number itself, we find that:

$$
7^1 = 7
$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$(7^{-2}) \times (7^3) = 7$$

This method is effective due to the properties of exponents, which simplify calculations involving powers. Remember, this rule is applicable only when the bases are the same. If the bases differ, a different approach would be necessary.
