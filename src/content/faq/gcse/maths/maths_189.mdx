To solve the equation 

$$ 
\frac{4x}{2} = 8, 
$$ 

we will simplify the expression and isolate the variable $x$ using inverse operations.

First, let's simplify the left-hand side. The expression 

$$ 
\frac{4x}{2} 
$$ 

can be reduced by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $2$. This results in 

$$ 
2x. 
$$ 

Thus, we can rewrite the equation as 

$$ 
2x = 8. 
$$ 

Next, to isolate $x$, we need to eliminate the coefficient $2$ that is multiplying $x$. To do this, we will perform the inverse operation, which in this case is division. We divide both sides of the equation by $2$:

$$ 
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}. 
$$ 

This simplifies to 

$$ 
x = 4. 
$$ 

Therefore, the solution to the equation 

$$ 
\frac{4x}{2} = 8 
$$ 

is 

$$ 
x = 4. 
$$ 

To verify our solution, we can substitute $x = 4$ back into the original equation:

$$ 
\frac{4 \times 4}{2} = 8. 
$$ 

This simplifies to 

$$ 
\frac{16}{2} = 8. 
$$ 

Indeed, we find that 

$$ 
8 = 8, 
$$ 

which confirms that our solution $x = 4$ is correct.
