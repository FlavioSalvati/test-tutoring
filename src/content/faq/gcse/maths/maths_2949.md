The probability of drawing two black cards consecutively without replacement is given as $\frac{25}{102}$.

Let’s break this down step by step for clarity. A standard deck of cards contains a total of $52$ cards, which are divided into $26$ black cards (comprising $13$ spades and $13$ clubs) and $26$ red cards (including $13$ hearts and $13$ diamonds). 

When you draw the first card, the probability that it is black is calculated as follows:

$$
P(\text{First black card}) = \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{(or } 50\%\text{)}
$$

After drawing the first black card, there are now $51$ cards remaining in the deck, of which $25$ are black. Therefore, the probability of drawing a second black card is:

$$
P(\text{Second black card} \mid \text{First black card}) = \frac{25}{51}
$$

To find the overall probability of both events occurring—drawing a black card first and then another black card—we multiply the probabilities of each individual event:

$$
P(\text{Two black cards}) = P(\text{First black card}) \times P(\text{Second black card} \mid \text{First black card}) = \frac{26}{52} \times \frac{25}{51}
$$

Now, let's perform the calculation:

$$
\frac{26}{52} \times \frac{25}{51} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{25}{51} = \frac{25}{102}
$$

Thus, the probability of drawing two black cards in succession without replacement is $\frac{25}{102}$, which is approximately $0.245$ or $24.5\%$. This indicates that if you were to repeat this process many times, you could expect to draw two black cards in a row about $24.5\%$ of the time.
