To determine 60% of 90, we can start by defining what a percentage is. A percentage represents a number as a fraction of 100. Therefore, 60% can be interpreted as 60 out of 100. 

To calculate 60% of 90, we can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Percentage} \times \text{Whole Number} = \text{Result}
$$

In this scenario, the percentage is $60\%$ and the whole number is $90$. The first step is to convert the percentage into a decimal by dividing by $100$:

$$
60\% = \frac{60}{100} = 0.60
$$

Next, we multiply the decimal by the whole number:

$$
0.60 \times 90 = 54
$$

Thus, we conclude that $60\%$ of $90$ is $54$. 

This method is applicable for calculating any percentage of any whole number. Just remember to convert the percentage into a decimal by dividing by $100$, and then multiply it by the whole number. Mastering this technique is beneficial in various fields of mathematics, including statistics, finance, and everyday calculations.
