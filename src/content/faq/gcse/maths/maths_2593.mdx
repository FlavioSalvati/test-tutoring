The angle formed between two tangents drawn from a common external point to a circle is twice the angle subtended by the radii at the center of the circle.

When you draw two tangents from a shared external point, they touch the circle at two distinct points, which we will label as points $A$ and $B$, with the common external point denoted as $P$. The radii of the circle that extend to these points of tangency, $OA$ and $OB$, are perpendicular to the tangents at those points. Consequently, the angles $\angle OAP$ and $\angle OBP$ are both right angles.

Now, letâ€™s examine triangles $OAP$ and $OBP$. Since $OA$ and $OB$ are radii of the same circle, they are equal in length. Additionally, the lengths of the tangents drawn from a common external point to the circle are also equal, meaning that $PA = PB$. Hence, triangles $OAP$ and $OBP$ are congruent by the RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side) congruence criterion.

The angle between the two tangents, $\angle APB$, can be determined by considering the angle subtended by the radii at the center of the circle, denoted as $\angle AOB$. Since the tangents are symmetrical about the line $OP$, the angle $\angle APB$ is twice the angle $\angle AOB$. This relationship arises because the angle at the center $\angle AOB$ is subtended by the arc $AB$, while the angle between the tangents $\angle APB$ serves as an external angle to triangle $OAP$ (or $OBP$), which is equal to twice the angle at the center.

Therefore, if you know the angle subtended by the radii at the center of the circle, you can easily calculate the angle between the tangents by simply doubling it. This relationship is a fundamental concept in circle theorems and plays a significant role in solving various geometric problems involving circles and tangents.
