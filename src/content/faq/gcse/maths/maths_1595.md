Exam scores are classified as quantitative data, specifically as continuous data, since they represent measurable quantities.

Quantitative data encompasses information that can be measured and expressed numerically. Exam scores fit this definition because they are numerical values that indicate a student's performance on an exam. For instance, if you achieve a score of $75$ out of $100$ on a mathematics test, that score quantifies your performance.

Within the realm of quantitative data, there are two subcategories: discrete and continuous data. Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values, typically whole numbers, such as the number of students in a class. In contrast, continuous data can take any value within a specified range and can be measured to any degree of precision. Exam scores are classified as continuous data because they can assume any value in a range, such as from $0$ to $100$, and may include decimal points, for example, a score of $85.5$.

Understanding the type of data is crucial for selecting appropriate methods for analysis and interpretation. For example, you can calculate the mean (average) score, the median (the middle value), and the mode (the most frequently occurring score) to gain insights into the overall performance of a class. Additionally, you can create visual representations, such as histograms or box plots, to illustrate the distribution of scores.

In summary, exam scores are quantitative, continuous data, which allows for a broad spectrum of statistical analyses to enhance our understanding of and improve academic performance.
