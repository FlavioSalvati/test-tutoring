To calculate the total price after applying a 20% discount on £120, we start by determining the amount of the discount. A 20% discount means that we are reducing the original price by 20%. 

To find 20% of £120, we multiply £120 by 0.20, since $20\%$ can be expressed as the fraction $\frac{20}{100}$ or as the decimal $0.20$. 

Thus, we have:

$$
£120 \times 0.20 = £24
$$

This means the discount amount is £24.

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price. Therefore, we calculate:

$$
£120 - £24 = £96
$$

Consequently, after applying a 20% discount to £120, the total amount you would pay is £96. This approach can be applied to any percentage discount and any original price, making it a valuable skill for everyday shopping and budgeting.
