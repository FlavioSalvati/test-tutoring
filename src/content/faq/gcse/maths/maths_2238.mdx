To create the graph of the function $ y = x^4 $, we will plot key points and examine its symmetry and overall shape.

First, it's essential to recognize that $ y = x^4 $ is a polynomial function of even degree. Consequently, its graph exhibits symmetry about the y-axis. This means that for every point $ (x, y) $ on the graph, there exists a corresponding point $ (-x, y) $.

Next, let's identify some key points on the graph. We begin with the origin $ (0, 0) $ since $ y = 0^4 = 0 $. Next, we can evaluate a few positive and negative values for $ x $ to observe how $ y $ varies. For instance, when $ x = 1 $, we find that $ y = 1^4 = 1 $; similarly, when $ x = -1 $, $ y = (-1)^4 = 1 $. Continuing this process, when $ x = 2 $, we have $ y = 2^4 = 16 $, and for $ x = -2 $, $ y = (-2)^4 = 16 $. These calculations demonstrate that the graph rises sharply as $ x $ moves away from zero.

Understanding the graph's shape is also crucial. The function $ x^4 $ increases more rapidly than $ x^2 $ but more slowly than $ x^6 $. Therefore, while the graph will be flatter near the origin compared to $ y = x^2 $, it will rise more steeply as $ x $ increases or decreases. The overall appearance of the graph resembles a "U" shape, featuring a flatter bottom and steeper sides compared to a typical parabola.

Finally, to sketch the graph, plot the identified key points and connect them with a smooth curve. Ensure that the resulting graph is symmetric about the y-axis and reflects the described characteristics of the function.
