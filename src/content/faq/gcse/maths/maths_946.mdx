To determine the inverse of the function $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $, we can express it as $ f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2} $.

Finding the inverse of a function involves switching the roles of $ x $ and $ y $ and then solving for $ y $. Let's begin with the given function $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $. We first replace $ f(x) $ with $ y $, yielding the equation:

$$
y = 2x + 3.
$$

Next, we swap $ x $ and $ y $, resulting in:

$$
x = 2y + 3.
$$

To isolate $ y $, we start by subtracting 3 from both sides:

$$
x - 3 = 2y.
$$

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

$$
y = \frac{x - 3}{2}.
$$

Thus, we find that the inverse function is 

$$
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}.
$$ 

This indicates that for any given value of $ x $ in the original function $ f(x) $, we can apply the inverse function to retrieve the original input value. For instance, if $ f(x) = 7 $, we can use the inverse function:

$$
f^{-1}(7) = \frac{7 - 3}{2} = 2,
$$ 

which reveals that the original input was $ 2 $.

Mastering the process of finding a function's inverse is an invaluable skill in mathematics, as it enables you to reverse the function's operations and retrieve the original input from the output.
