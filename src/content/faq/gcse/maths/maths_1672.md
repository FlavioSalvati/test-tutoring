To determine the correlation in a scatter plot, you should observe the direction and pattern of the plotted points carefully.

Begin your analysis by examining the overall direction of the points. If the points tend to rise from left to right, this indicates a positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. Conversely, if the points decline from left to right, this suggests a negative correlation, where one variable increases while the other decreases.

Next, assess the strength of the correlation. A strong correlation is indicated by points that are closely clustered around a straight line. In contrast, if the points are more dispersed but still exhibit a general trend, the correlation is considered weak. If the points appear to be scattered randomly without any discernible pattern, this indicates that there is no correlation.

You may also draw a line of best fit, which is a straight line that best represents the data points on the scatter plot. The closer the points are to this line, the stronger the correlation. An upward slope of the line confirms a positive correlation, while a downward slope indicates a negative correlation.

It is important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. Just because two variables show a correlation in a scatter plot does not mean that one variable causes the other to change. Always take into account other factors and the broader context when interpreting correlations.
