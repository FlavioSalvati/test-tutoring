To determine the perimeter of a compound shape with irregular sides, you need to sum the lengths of all its individual sides.

When analyzing compound shapes, especially those with irregular boundaries, the essential step in calculating the perimeter is to accurately measure and add the lengths of each side. Begin by identifying all the distinct sides of the shape. This may require decomposing the compound shape into simpler geometric components, such as rectangles, triangles, or other polygons, and then measuring each side of these components.

Once you have obtained all the necessary measurements, the next step is to add them together. For instance, if a shape has sides measuring $5 \, \text{cm}$, $7 \, \text{cm}$, $3 \, \text{cm}$, and $4 \, \text{cm}$, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 5 + 7 + 3 + 4 = 19 \, \text{cm}.
$$

It is crucial to account for every side, including any internal sides that may be part of the compound shape.

In situations where the lengths of the sides are not provided, you may need to use a ruler or measuring tape to obtain the measurements. If the shape features curves or arcs, you might need to employ more advanced techniques, such as calculating the arc length using the radius and the angle of the arc.

Keep in mind that the perimeter represents the total distance around the shape. As long as you measure and sum all the sides accurately, you will arrive at the correct perimeter. This method is applicable to any compound shape, regardless of its irregularity.
