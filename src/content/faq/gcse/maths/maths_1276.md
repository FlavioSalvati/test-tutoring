To determine the missing side of a right-angled triangle, we can employ Pythagoras' Theorem, which states:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

This theorem is a cornerstone of geometry, specifically applicable to right-angled triangles. In this equation, $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the two shorter sides, also known as the legs, while $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle and is the longest side of the triangle.

If you need to find the length of the hypotenuse ($c$), you can rearrange the equation as follows:

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

For example, if one leg measures $3$ units and the other leg measures $4$ units, you would calculate the hypotenuse like this:

$$
c = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Conversely, if you need to find the length of one of the legs ($a$ or $b$) and you know the length of the hypotenuse along with the other leg, you can rearrange the theorem to isolate the missing side. For instance, if the hypotenuse is $5$ units and one leg is $3$ units, you can find the length of the other leg ($b$) using the following equation:

$$
b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2} = \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{25 - 9} = \sqrt{16} = 4
$$

It is crucial to ensure that the triangle is indeed right-angled before applying Pythagoras' Theorem, as this theorem is specifically designed for right-angled triangles. This method serves as a powerful tool for addressing various problems in geometry and trigonometry, making it an essential component of your GCSE Maths studies.
