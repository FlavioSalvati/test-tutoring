The equation of a line that is parallel to $ y = -2x + 5 $ can be expressed as $ y = -2x + c $.

To understand this, let's first examine the equation $ y = -2x + 5 $. This equation is in the slope-intercept form, which is given by $ y = mx + c $, where $ m $ represents the slope and $ c $ denotes the y-intercept. In our case, the slope $ m $ is equal to $-2$.

When two lines are parallel, they share the same slope. Therefore, any line that is parallel to $ y = -2x + 5 $ must also have a slope of $-2$. The general equation for a line with this slope is $ y = -2x + c $, where $ c $ can be any real number. The constant $ c $ determines the y-intercept of the line, indicating where it intersects the y-axis.

For instance, if we set $ c = 3 $, the equation of the parallel line would be $ y = -2x + 3 $. Conversely, if $ c = -1 $, the equation becomes $ y = -2x - 1 $. Both of these lines are parallel to the original line $ y = -2x + 5 $ since they maintain the same slope of $-2$.

In conclusion, to derive the equation of a line that is parallel to a given line, you keep the slope constant and modify the y-intercept. This leads to the equation $ y = -2x + c $, where $ c $ can be any constant.
