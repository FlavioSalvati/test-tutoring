To calculate the length of the diagonal in a cuboid with dimensions $3 \, \text{cm}$, $4 \, \text{cm}$, and $5 \, \text{cm}$, we can apply the formula for the space diagonal, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The formula is expressed as:

$$
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
$$

In this equation, $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent the lengths of the cuboid's sides. For our specific cuboid, we have the following dimensions:

- $a = 3 \, \text{cm}$
- $b = 4 \, \text{cm}$
- $c = 5 \, \text{cm}$

Substituting these values into the formula, we find:

$$
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2}
$$

Now, let's calculate the squares of each dimension:

$$
3^2 = 9
$$

$$
4^2 = 16
$$

$$
5^2 = 25
$$

Next, we sum these squared values:

$$
9 + 16 + 25 = 50
$$

Finally, we calculate the square root of the total:

$$
d = \sqrt{50}
$$

Therefore, the length of the diagonal is $\sqrt{50} \, \text{cm}$. If you would like a decimal approximation, $\sqrt{50}$ is roughly $7.07 \, \text{cm}$. This method provides a reliable way to determine the diagonal length of any cuboid by considering all three dimensions.
