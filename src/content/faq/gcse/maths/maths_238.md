To determine the gradient of the function $ y = x^3 $ at the point where $ x = 2 $, we first need to differentiate the function and then substitute $ x = 2 $ into the resulting expression.

Differentiation is a fundamental process in calculus that allows us to find the gradient, or slope, of a curve at any specific point. The gradient function, also known as the derivative, indicates how steep the curve is at each point along its path. For the function $ y = x^3 $, we apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if $ y = x^n $, then the derivative is given by 

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = nx^{n-1}. 
$$

Using the power rule on $ y = x^3 $, we calculate the derivative as follows:

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2. 
$$

This expression, $ 3x^2 $, represents the gradient function for $ y = x^3 $, indicating the slope of the curve at any point $ x $.

Next, we will evaluate the gradient specifically at $ x = 2 $. To do this, we substitute $ x = 2 $ into our gradient function:

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} \bigg|_{x=2} = 3(2)^2. 
$$

Now, we perform the calculation:

$$ 
3(2)^2 = 3 \times 4 = 12. 
$$

Thus, the gradient of the curve $ y = x^3 $ at the point where $ x = 2 $ is $ 12 $. This indicates that at $ x = 2 $, the curve rises steeply with a slope of $ 12 $.
