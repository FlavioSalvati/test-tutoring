The slope of the equation $ y = 2x + 3 $ is $ 2 $.

To determine the slope of a linear equation in the standard form $ y = mx + c $, it is essential to identify the coefficient of $ x $. In the given equation $ y = 2x + 3 $, the coefficient of $ x $ is $ 2 $. This coefficient, denoted by $ m $, represents the slope of the line. The slope indicates both the steepness of the line and its direction: a positive slope signifies that the line rises as it moves from left to right, while a negative slope indicates that it falls.

In this particular case, the slope $ m $ is $ 2 $. This means that for every unit increase in $ x $, the value of $ y $ increases by $ 2 $ units. This relationship provides a clear understanding of how the line behaves on a graph. If you were to plot this equation, you would begin at the y-intercept, which is $ 3 $ (the constant term), and then move up $ 2 $ units for each $ 1 $ unit you move to the right. This consistent "rise over run" is what defines the slope.

Grasping the concept of slope is vital for analyzing linear relationships in various contexts, such as calculating speed in physics, examining cost functions in economics, or determining gradients in everyday situations. By mastering this fundamental concept, you will be well-equipped to interpret and predict the behavior of linear equations effectively.
