The number $843$ rounded to the nearest ten is $840$.

When rounding a number to the nearest ten, you should focus on the digit in the units place, which is the last digit of the number. For the number $843$, the digit in the units place is $3$. According to rounding rules, if this digit is $5$ or greater, you round up the digit in the tens place. Conversely, if the digit is less than $5$, you round down.

In this case, since the units digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, we round down the digit in the tens place. The digit in the tens place is $4$, and because we are rounding down, it remains $4$. Consequently, the units place becomes $0$. Therefore, $843$ rounded to the nearest ten is $840$.

Rounding numbers is a valuable skill applicable in various areas of mathematics and everyday life. It simplifies numbers, making them easier to handle, especially when you require an approximate value rather than an exact one. For instance, if you are estimating the total cost of items on a shopping list, rounding each price to the nearest ten can significantly simplify mental calculations.
