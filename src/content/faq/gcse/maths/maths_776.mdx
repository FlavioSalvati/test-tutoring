To calculate the percentage increase, follow these steps: subtract the original value from the new value, divide that result by the original value, and then multiply by $100$.

Letâ€™s break this process down step-by-step. Suppose you have an original value and a new value, and you wish to determine the percentage increase.

1. **Find the Difference**: Begin by subtracting the original value from the new value. This calculation provides you with the amount of the increase. For instance, if the original value is $50$ and the new value is $70$, the difference is calculated as follows:
   $$ 70 - 50 = 20 $$

2. **Divide by the Original Value**: Next, take the difference you calculated and divide it by the original value. Continuing with our example, you would divide $20$ by $50$, resulting in:
   $$ \frac{20}{50} = 0.4 $$

3. **Convert to a Percentage**: Finally, to convert this decimal into a percentage, multiply it by $100$. Therefore, $0.4$ multiplied by $100$ yields:
   $$ 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% $$ 
   Thus, the percentage increase from $50$ to $70$ is $40\%$.

In formulaic terms, the percentage increase can be represented as:
$$ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \times 100 $$

To summarize, the essential steps are: find the difference, divide by the original value, and then multiply by $100$. This method is applicable to any pair of values for which you need to calculate the percentage increase. Happy calculating!
