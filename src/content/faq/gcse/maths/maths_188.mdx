To change the subject of the formula given by the equation $ y = 3x + 2 $ to isolate $ x $, we can rearrange it to obtain $ x = \frac{y - 2}{3} $.

Let's begin the process by isolating the term that contains $ x $. The original equation is:

$$
y = 3x + 2
$$

To isolate $ 3x $, we need to eliminate the constant term on the right-hand side. We can achieve this by subtracting $ 2 $ from both sides of the equation. This gives us:

$$
y - 2 = 3x
$$

At this point, we have $ 3x $ on one side of the equation and the remainder on the other side. The next step is to isolate $ x $ itself. Since $ x $ is currently multiplied by $ 3 $, we will perform the opposite operation—division—on both sides of the equation. Thus, we divide both sides by $ 3 $:

$$
\frac{y - 2}{3} = x
$$

To present it in a more conventional format, we can rewrite this as:

$$
x = \frac{y - 2}{3}
$$

And there you have it! We have successfully changed the subject of the formula from $ y $ to $ x $. This process involves fundamental algebraic operations: subtraction and division. By following these steps, you can rearrange many similar equations to solve for different variables effectively.
