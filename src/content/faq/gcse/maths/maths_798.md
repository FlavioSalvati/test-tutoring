To express 150 minutes in terms of hours and minutes, we start by noting that 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes. 

To convert minutes into hours and minutes, follow these steps:

1. **Divide the total minutes by 60**: 
   $$ 150 \div 60 = 2 \text{ with a remainder} $$ 
   Here, the quotient, which is $2$, indicates the number of full hours.

2. **Calculate the remaining minutes**: 
   To find the leftover minutes, multiply the number of full hours ($2$) by $60$:
   $$ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} $$
   Now, subtract this from the original total of $150$ minutes:
   $$ 150 - 120 = 30 \text{ minutes} $$
   This means that the remainder is $30$ minutes.

In conclusion, $150$ minutes can be expressed as $2$ hours and $30$ minutes. 

This method is applicable for converting any number of minutes into hours and minutes, making it a valuable skill for effective time management. Whether you're organizing your study schedule or estimating travel times, knowing how to convert minutes into hours can help you plan more efficiently.
