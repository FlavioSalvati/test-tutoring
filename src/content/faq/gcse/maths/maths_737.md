To round the number $654.321$ to the nearest ten, we focus on the units digit, which is the digit in the ones place. In this case, for the number $654.321$, the units digit is $4$. 

According to standard rounding rules, if the units digit is $5$ or greater, we round up. Conversely, if it is $4$ or lower, we round down. Since $4$ is less than $5$, we round down.

When rounding down, we replace the units digit and all digits to its right with zeros. Therefore, the number $654$ becomes $650$. The decimal portion ($.321$) is disregarded in this rounding process, as our focus is solely on the whole number part when rounding to the nearest ten.

This rounding method simplifies numbers, making them easier to handle in calculations and estimations. Mastering this skill is fundamental in GCSE Maths, as it applies across various topics, from basic arithmetic to more complex problem-solving scenarios.
