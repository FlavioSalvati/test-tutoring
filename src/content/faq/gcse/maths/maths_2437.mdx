To determine the equation of a line that is perpendicular to $ y = 5x + 3 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 4) $, we need to use the concept of the negative reciprocal of the slope.

First, we identify the slope (or gradient) of the given line $ y = 5x + 3 $. The slope here is $ 5 $. For a line to be perpendicular to this line, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of $ 5 $. The negative reciprocal of $ 5 $ is given by 

$$
-\frac{1}{5}.
$$ 

Thus, the slope of the perpendicular line is 

$$
-\frac{1}{5}.
$$ 

Next, we will utilize the point-slope form of the line equation, which is expressed as 

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),
$$ 

where $ m $ represents the slope and $ (x_1, y_1) $ is a point on the line. In our case, we have $ m = -\frac{1}{5} $ and the point $ (x_1, y_1) = (2, 4) $.

We can substitute these values into the point-slope form:

$$
y - 4 = -\frac{1}{5}(x - 2).
$$ 

Now, letâ€™s simplify this equation to convert it into the slope-intercept form $ y = mx + c $:

1. Start by distributing the slope on the right side:

$$
y - 4 = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{2}{5}.
$$ 

2. Next, isolate $ y $ by adding $ 4 $ to both sides:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{2}{5} + 4.
$$ 

3. To combine the constants, we express $ 4 $ as a fraction with a denominator of $ 5 $:

$$
4 = \frac{20}{5}.
$$ 

4. Now we can add the fractions:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{20}{5} = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{22}{5}.
$$ 

Therefore, the equation of the line that is perpendicular to $ y = 5x + 3 $ and passes through the point $ (2, 4) $ is 

$$
y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{22}{5}.
$$
