Significant figures are the digits in a number that convey meaningful information regarding its precision.

When we refer to significant figures, we are talking about the digits that contribute to the accuracy of a number. This includes all non-zero digits, any zeros that are situated between significant digits, and any trailing zeros in a decimal number. For instance, in the number $123.45$, all five digits are significant. In contrast, in the number $0.00456$, only the digits $4$, $5$, and $6$ are significant, while the leading zeros do not contribute to precision.

Understanding significant figures is essential in scientific and mathematical calculations, as they help communicate the precision of a measurement. For example, if you measure an object to be $12.3 \, \text{cm}$, the digit $3$ indicates that the measurement is precise to the nearest tenth of a centimeter. If you specify it as $12.30 \, \text{cm}$, it signifies even greater precision, accurate to the nearest hundredth.

When conducting calculations, the number of significant figures in your result should reflect the precision of the original numbers. For example, if you multiply $2.5$ (which has two significant figures) by $3.42$ (which has three significant figures), your answer should be rounded to two significant figures, resulting in $8.6$.

It is also crucial to understand the rules for rounding significant figures. If the digit that is to be dropped is less than $5$, you round down. If it is $5$ or greater, you round up. For instance, rounding $3.456$ to three significant figures yields $3.46$.

By applying the rules of significant figures correctly, you ensure that your calculations and measurements are as accurate and reliable as possible.
