The union of two sets is defined as a new set that contains all unique elements from both sets.

In mathematics, a set is a collection of distinct objects, treated as a single entity. For instance, the set of vowels in the English alphabet can be represented as $\{a, e, i, o, u\}$. When we refer to the union of two sets, we are merging all the elements from both sets into one new set, ensuring that each element appears only once, even if it is present in both original sets.

Consider two sets, $A$ and $B$. Let set $A$ be defined as $\{1, 2, 3\}$ and set $B$ as $\{3, 4, 5\}$. The union of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A \cup B$, would yield $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. Notice that the number $3$, which appears in both sets, is only included once in the union.

The concept of union is extremely valuable in various fields of mathematics as well as in everyday situations. For example, if you have one list of friends who play football and another list of friends who play basketball, the union of these two lists would provide a comprehensive list of all your friends who participate in either sport, without any duplicates.

In set notation, the union is symbolized by the operator $\cup$. Thus, if $A = \{a, b, c\}$ and $B = \{b, c, d\}$, then the union $A \cup B$ would be $\{a, b, c, d\}$. This operation is instrumental in combining data and analyzing relationships among different groups of items. Mastering the concept of union is a fundamental skill in set theory, which serves as a foundational element of mathematics.
