The expression $5^0$ is equal to $1$.

In mathematics, any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is always equal to $1$. While this concept may initially seem puzzling, it becomes clearer when we consider the rules of exponents. Specifically, when you multiply numbers that share the same base, you add their exponents. For instance, we have:

$$
5^2 \times 5^3 = 5^{(2+3)} = 5^5.
$$

To understand why $5^0$ equals $1$, let's reverse the process. We know that:

$$
5^1 = 5.
$$

If we divide $5^1$ by $5$, we obtain $5^0$. This can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{5^1}{5} = 5^0.
$$

When we simplify the left-hand side, we get:

$$
\frac{5}{5} = 1.
$$

Thus, we conclude that $5^0$ must be $1$. This principle is applicable to any non-zero number, not just $5$.

Grasping this concept is crucial, as it lays the groundwork for solving more complex problems involving exponents. Furthermore, it ensures consistency in mathematical operations and equations. Therefore, whenever you encounter a number raised to the power of zero, you can confidently assert that it equals $1$.
