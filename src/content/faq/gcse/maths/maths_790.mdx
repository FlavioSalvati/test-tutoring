To calculate the cosine of $45^\circ$, you can use a scientific calculator by following these steps:

1. **Set the Calculator to Degree Mode**: Before beginning, ensure that your calculator is set to degree mode. This is essential, as calculators can also operate in radians or gradians. Using the incorrect mode may lead to inaccurate results. Check for a 'DEG' indicator on the display or navigate to the mode settings in the calculator's menu.

2. **Input the Angle**: Enter the number $45$ on the calculator. This represents the angle in degrees for which you wish to find the cosine.

3. **Press the Cosine Button**: After entering $45$, press the 'cos' button, which is typically labeled as 'cos' and is usually located alongside other trigonometric functions such as 'sin' and 'tan'.

4. **Read the Result**: The calculator will display the result, which is approximately $0.7071$. This value corresponds to the cosine of $45^\circ$. In fact, the cosine of this angle is positive and can be expressed as $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, which is approximately $0.7071$.

Understanding how to use your calculator for trigonometric functions is vital for solving various problems in GCSE Maths, including those related to right-angled triangles and wave functions. Practicing these steps will enhance your confidence in effectively using your calculator for mathematical calculations.
