To construct a tree diagram for combined probability events, follow a step-by-step approach to list all potential outcomes along with their corresponding probabilities.

A tree diagram serves as a visual tool that illustrates all possible outcomes of combined events and their associated probabilities. Begin by drawing a branch for each potential outcome of the first event. For instance, when flipping a coin, you would create two branches: one representing heads and the other representing tails.

From each of these initial branches, extend further branches to depict the possible outcomes of the second event. If the second event involves rolling a die, you will draw six branches originating from each coin flip outcome, representing each face of the die (1 through 6).

Next, label each branch with its respective outcome and probability. For example, the probability of landing heads is $\frac{1}{2}$, while the probability of rolling a 3 is $\frac{1}{6}$. To find the combined probability of each path, multiply the probabilities along the branches. For instance, the probability of flipping heads and then rolling a 3 can be calculated as:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{12}.
$$

Continue this process for any additional events, ensuring that each branch accurately represents all possible outcomes and their probabilities. This systematic approach allows you to analyze complex probability scenarios by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable components.
