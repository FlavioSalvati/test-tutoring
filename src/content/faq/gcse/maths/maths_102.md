To express $75\%$ as a decimal, we can represent it as $0.75$.

To convert a percentage to a decimal, simply divide the percentage by $100$. This is based on the fact that "percent" means "per hundred." For example, to convert $75\%$, you divide $75$ by $100$, resulting in $0.75$. This method is straightforward and applies to any percentage you wish to convert.

Alternatively, you can think of this conversion as moving the decimal point two places to the left. Starting with $75.0\%$, shifting the decimal point two positions left transforms it into $0.75$. This technique is quick and convenient, especially when you don't have access to a calculator.

Mastering the conversion of percentages to decimals is beneficial in various mathematical fields, including probability, statistics, and financial calculations. For instance, if you know that a $75\%$ discount equates to multiplying the original price by $0.75$, you can easily calculate the sale price of an item. Similarly, in probability, if an event has a $75\%$ likelihood of occurring, you can express this as $0.75$, facilitating further calculations.

In summary, converting percentages to decimals is as simple as dividing by $100$ or moving the decimal point two places to the left. This skill will prove invaluable in numerous mathematical contexts, streamlining your calculations and enhancing efficiency.
