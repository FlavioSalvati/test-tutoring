To calculate the area of a compound shape, you need to determine the area of each individual polygon that composes the shape and then sum these areas together.

First, identify the various polygons that constitute the compound shape. These polygons may include rectangles, triangles, circles, or other basic geometric figures. Decompose the compound shape into these simpler components. For instance, if the shape resembles the letter "L", you can divide it into two rectangles.

Next, apply the appropriate formulas for each polygon to calculate their respective areas. For a rectangle, the area is given by multiplying its length by its width:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
$$

For a triangle, the area is computed as half the base multiplied by the height:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
$$

For a circle, the area is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{circle}} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2
$$

Ensure that you have all the necessary measurements for each polygon before proceeding with the calculations.

Once you have found the area of each individual polygon, add these areas together to obtain the total area of the compound shape. If any portions of the shape overlap or are removed (such as a hole in the middle), be sure to subtract the area of these sections from the overall total.

For example, consider a compound shape formed by a rectangle and a triangle. If the rectangle has an area of $20$ square units and the triangle has an area of $10$ square units, the total area of the compound shape would be:

$$
\text{Total Area} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ square units}
$$

If there is a circular hole with an area of $5$ square units, you would subtract this from the total area:

$$
\text{Final Total Area} = 30 - 5 = 25 \text{ square units}
$$

Thus, the total area of the compound shape, accounting for the hole, is $25$ square units.
