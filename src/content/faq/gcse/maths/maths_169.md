To substitute $8$ for the variable $w$ in the expression $2w + 5$, you start by replacing $w$ with $8$ and then simplify the resulting expression.

When you're asked to substitute a value into an algebraic expression, you simply replace the specified variable with the provided number. In this instance, the expression is $2w + 5$, and you need to substitute $8$ for $w$.

Begin by writing down the expression: 

$$
2w + 5.
$$ 

Next, replace the variable $w$ with the number $8$. This yields:

$$
2(8) + 5.
$$ 

Now, perform the multiplication:

$$
2 \times 8 = 16.
$$ 

Thus, the expression now becomes:

$$
16 + 5.
$$ 

Finally, add $16$ and $5$ together:

$$
16 + 5 = 21.
$$ 

Therefore, when you substitute $8$ for $w$ in the expression $2w + 5$, the simplified result is $21$. This substitution process is valuable in various areas of mathematics, such as solving equations and evaluating functions. Remember that the essential steps are to replace the variable with the given number, carry out the necessary arithmetic operations, and simplify the expression to arrive at your final answer.
