To calculate exponential decay, we utilize the formula 

$$
N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}.
$$

Exponential decay describes the process of reducing a quantity by a constant percentage rate over a specified period of time. The formula $N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}$ allows us to determine the remaining quantity $N(t)$ after a time $t$. In this equation, $N_0$ represents the initial amount, $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately $2.71828$), $k$ is the decay constant, and $t$ is the elapsed time.

To effectively use this formula, it is essential to first identify the initial amount $N_0$ and the decay constant $k$. The decay constant $k$ can typically be found in the problem statement or calculated if the half-life of the substance is known. The half-life, denoted as $T_{1/2}$, is the time required for the quantity to decrease to half of its initial value. The relationship between the half-life $T_{1/2}$ and the decay constant $k$ is expressed as 

$$
k = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}},
$$ 

where $\ln$ represents the natural logarithm.

Once you have determined $N_0$ and $k$, you can substitute these values into the formula along with the time $t$ to find the remaining quantity $N(t)$. For instance, if you begin with $100$ grams of a substance that has a decay constant of $0.1$ per year, and you wish to determine how much remains after $5$ years, the calculation would be 

$$
N(5) = 100 e^{-0.1 \times 5}.
$$

Understanding exponential decay is valuable in a variety of real-world scenarios, including radioactive decay, population decline, and the cooling of objects.
