The formula for calculating the arc length of a circle is given by:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = \theta \times r
$$

To better understand this formula, let's break it down. The symbol $ \theta $ represents the angle in radians that the arc subtends at the center of the circle, while $ r $ denotes the radius of the circle. When you multiply these two quantities together, you obtain the length of the arc.

If the angle is specified in degrees, it is essential to convert it to radians before using the formula. This is necessary because the formula $ \text{Arc Length} = \theta \times r $ is valid only when $ \theta $ is expressed in radians. To convert degrees to radians, you can use the conversion factor $ \frac{\pi}{180} $. Therefore, if you have an angle $ \alpha $ measured in degrees, you can find its equivalent in radians by calculating:

$$
\theta = \alpha \times \frac{\pi}{180}
$$

For instance, if you have a circle with a radius of 5 cm and you wish to calculate the arc length for an angle of 60 degrees, you would first convert 60 degrees to radians as follows:

$$
60 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{3}
$$

Next, you can apply the arc length formula:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\pi}{3} \times 5 = \frac{5\pi}{3} \text{ cm}
$$

This formula is particularly useful in various applications, such as calculating the distance traveled along a circular path or determining the length of a segment of a circular track. Mastering this concept will greatly enhance your ability to solve problems related to circles in your GCSE Maths studies.
