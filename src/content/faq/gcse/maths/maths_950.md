To find the y-intercept of a point, you need to examine the y-coordinate when the x-coordinate is equal to zero.

More specifically, the y-intercept is the point at which a line or curve intersects the y-axis on a graph. This intersection occurs when the x-coordinate is zero, as the y-axis represents the vertical line where $x$ is always zero. For instance, consider the point $(0, 5)$; here, the y-intercept is $5$ because this is the value of $y$ when $x$ is zero.

If you have the equation of a line, such as 

$$
y = 2x + 3,
$$ 

you can determine the y-intercept by substituting $x = 0$ and solving for $y$. In this case, we have:

$$
y = 2(0) + 3,
$$ 

which simplifies to 

$$
y = 3.
$$ 

Thus, the y-intercept is $3$.

For more complex functions or curves, the same principle applies: set $x$ to zero and solve for $y$. This method is universally applicable, whether dealing with linear, quadratic, or other types of functions. Keep in mind that the y-intercept is always a single point on the graph, and it plays a vital role in understanding the behavior of the function.
