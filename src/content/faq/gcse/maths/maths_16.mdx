Venn diagrams are a powerful tool for representing sets and their relationships. In a Venn diagram, each set is symbolized by a circle, and the elements within each set are positioned inside their respective circles.

When two sets share common elements, their corresponding circles overlap. The shared elements are located within this overlapping region. For instance, consider two sets, Set $A$ and Set $B$. If Set $A$ includes $\{1, 2, 3\}$ and Set $B$ encapsulates $\{3, 4, 5\}$, the value $3$ will be positioned within the intersecting area of the circles denoting Set $A$ and Set $B$.

The region where the circles overlap is termed the intersection of the sets. This intersection illustrates the elements common to both sets. In the given example, the intersection of Set $A$ and Set $B$ is $\{3\}$. If there are elements that belong exclusively to one set, they are placed in the non-overlapping regions of the circles. Therefore, $1$ and $2$ will reside in the non-overlapping portion of Set $A$'s circle, while $4$ and $5$ will be located in the non-overlapping section of Set $B$'s circle.

In scenarios involving more than two sets, additional circles can be incorporated into the Venn diagram. The intersecting regions will then display the common elements among all the sets. For instance, a Venn diagram for three sets will feature seven distinct regions: one for each set individually, three for each pair of sets, and one for the intersection of all three sets. This graphical representation aids in visually analyzing relationships and shared elements across multiple sets.
