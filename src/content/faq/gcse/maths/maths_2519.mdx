To interpret a scale drawing with a ratio of 1:25, you need to multiply the measurements shown in the drawing by $25$ to obtain the actual dimensions.

In a drawing that uses a $1:25$ scale, each unit of measurement on the drawing corresponds to $25$ units in reality. For instance, if a length indicated on the drawing is $2 \, \text{cm}$, the actual length would be calculated as follows: 

$$
2 \, \text{cm} \times 25 = 50 \, \text{cm}.
$$ 

This scale is frequently employed in architectural and engineering drawings, allowing large objects to be represented on smaller, more manageable sheets of paper.

To accurately interpret the drawing, first determine the units of measurement used (for example, centimeters or millimeters). Measure the length, width, or height of the object depicted in the drawing using a ruler. After obtaining the measurement, multiply it by $25$ to convert it to the actual size. For instance, if a wall in the drawing measures $3 \, \text{cm}$, the real-life dimension of that wall would be:

$$
3 \, \text{cm} \times 25 = 75 \, \text{cm}.
$$

It is also essential to remember that this scale applies uniformly to all dimensions represented in the drawing. Therefore, if you are assessing an area or volume, you must apply the scale factor to each dimension before calculating the area or volume. For example, if a room's floor plan measures $4 \, \text{cm}$ by $5 \, \text{cm}$ in the drawing, the corresponding real-life dimensions would be:

$$
4 \, \text{cm} \times 25 = 100 \, \text{cm} \quad \text{and} \quad 5 \, \text{cm} \times 25 = 125 \, \text{cm}.
$$

Mastering the interpretation of scale drawings is a valuable skill across various fields, including architecture, engineering, and design. It ensures that real-life constructions align accurately with the planned designs.
