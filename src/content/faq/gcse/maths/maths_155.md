To rationalize the denominator of the fraction $ \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}} $, we will multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $ \sqrt{2} $.

In a fraction such as $ \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}} $, the denominator contains a surd, which is a square root that cannot be simplified to a whole number. To rationalize the denominator, our goal is to eliminate this surd. We achieve this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the same surd, in this case, $ \sqrt{2} $.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. Begin with the original fraction: 
   $$ \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}} $$
   
2. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $ \sqrt{2} $:
   $$ \frac{5 \times \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}} $$
   
3. Simplify the denominator. Recall that multiplying a square root by itself yields the radicand:
   $$ \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2} = 2 $$
   
4. This leads to the expression:
   $$ \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} $$

Thus, the original fraction $ \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}} $ is rationalized to $ \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} $. By performing this operation, we have successfully removed the surd from the denominator, resulting in a fraction that is simpler and more convenient for further calculations.
