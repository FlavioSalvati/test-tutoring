The ratio of surface areas in similar shapes is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths.

When examining similar shapes, it is essential to recognize that all corresponding angles are congruent, and all corresponding side lengths are proportional. This proportionality extends beyond side lengths to include other measurements, such as surface area and volume. If two shapes are similar and the ratio of their corresponding side lengths is denoted as $k$, then the ratio of their surface areas will be given by $k^2$.

For instance, consider two similar cubes. If the side length of the smaller cube is $2 \, \text{cm}$ and the side length of the larger cube is $4 \, \text{cm}$, the ratio of their side lengths is calculated as:

$$
\frac{4}{2} = 2.
$$

To determine the ratio of their surface areas, we simply square this ratio:

$$
2^2 = 4.
$$

This indicates that the surface area of the larger cube is four times that of the smaller cube.

This principle is not limited to cubes; it applies to all similar shapes. Whether you are working with spheres, cylinders, or any other three-dimensional shapes, the ratio of their surface areas will consistently equal the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths. This fundamental concept in geometry is vital for solving various problems related to scaling and resizing objects. By understanding this relationship, you can predict how changes in size will affect other properties of the shape, which is especially beneficial in real-world applications such as engineering and architecture.
