To determine the probability of event $B$ given that event $A$ has occurred, we utilize the concept of conditional probability. This is mathematically represented as $P(B|A)$, which can be calculated using the formula:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)}
$$

This formula illustrates how likely event $B$ is to occur, assuming that event $A$ has already taken place.

In this scenario, we have the following values: $P(A) = 0.5$ and $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.3$. By substituting these values into the formula, we can find $P(B|A)$:

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(A)} = \frac{0.3}{0.5} = 0.6
$$

Thus, the probability of event $B$ occurring given that event $A$ has happened is $0.6$, or equivalently, $60\%$.

This interpretation indicates that if event $A$ is confirmed to have occurred, there is a $60\%$ likelihood that event $B$ will also occur. Grasping the concept of conditional probability is crucial, as it allows us to analyze scenarios where events are interdependent, meaning the occurrence of one event influences the probability of another.
