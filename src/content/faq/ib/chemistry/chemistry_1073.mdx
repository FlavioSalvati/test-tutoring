The maximum number of electrons that can occupy a single orbital is determined by the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

The Pauli Exclusion Principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, named after the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who formulated it. This principle states that no two electrons in an atom can possess the same set of four quantum numbers. Quantum numbers serve as unique 'addresses' for electrons, providing information about their energy level, the shape of the orbital, the orientation in space, and their spin.

The first three quantum numbers—principal, azimuthal, and magnetic—define the specific orbital in which an electron is found. The fourth quantum number, known as the spin quantum number, describes the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron. The spin quantum number can take on one of two values: $+\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\frac{1}{2}$, commonly referred to as 'up' and 'down' spins, respectively. Consequently, only two electrons can occupy a single orbital: one with an 'up' spin and the other with a 'down' spin.

Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can reside in an orbital is two. This rule is fundamental to the structure of atoms and is essential for understanding how electrons are arranged within atoms, a concept referred to as electron configuration. It also elucidates the organization of the periodic table, where each row corresponds to a new energy level and each block represents a different type of orbital.

In summary, the Pauli Exclusion Principle—a cornerstone of quantum mechanics—establishes that an orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons, which must have opposite spins as indicated by their spin quantum numbers. This principle is crucial for our understanding of atomic structure and the layout of the periodic table.
