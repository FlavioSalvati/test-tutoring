The $d$ and $f$ orbitals exhibit distinct characteristics compared to the $s$ and $p$ orbitals, particularly in their shape, energy levels, and electron capacity.

In atomic structure, electrons occupy regions known as orbitals, which are classified into four types: $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$. Each type of orbital varies in shape, energy levels, and the number of electrons it can hold.

The $s$ orbitals are spherical and can accommodate a maximum of two electrons. They represent the simplest form of orbitals and are present in all energy levels. In contrast, $p$ orbitals are shaped like dumbbells and can hold up to six electrons. These orbitals begin at the second energy level.

The $d$ orbitals have a more intricate structure, primarily exhibiting a cloverleaf shape, although one of the five $d$ orbitals features an additional circular plane. Each $d$ orbital can hold two electrons, allowing a total of ten electrons across the five $d$ orbitals. The $d$ orbitals commence from the third energy level.

The $f$ orbitals possess the most complex shapes and are particularly challenging to visualize. There are seven $f$ orbitals, each capable of holding two electrons, resulting in a total capacity of fourteen electrons across the entire set. The $f$ orbitals begin at the fourth energy level.

The energy levels of these orbitals also differ significantly. In general, within a single atom, $s$ orbitals are typically the lowest in energy, followed by $p$, $d$, and finally $f$ orbitals. However, these energy levels may vary based on the specific electron configuration of the atom.

To summarize their electron capacities:
- $s$ orbitals can hold a maximum of $2$ electrons.
- $p$ orbitals can hold up to $6$ electrons.
- $d$ orbitals can accommodate a total of $10$ electrons.
- $f$ orbitals have the highest capacity, holding up to $14$ electrons.

Grasping the differences between these types of orbitals is essential for understanding atomic structure and electron configuration, which are foundational concepts in the field of chemistry.
