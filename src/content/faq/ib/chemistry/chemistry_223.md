Dissolution typically results in an increase in the entropy of a system, as it leads to greater disorder and randomness.

When a solute dissolves in a solvent, its particles become dispersed throughout the solvent. This dispersion enhances the randomness or disorder of the system, which is fundamentally what entropy quantifies. Entropy is a thermodynamic measure that indicates the degree of disorder or randomness within a system; thus, a greater level of disorder corresponds to a higher entropy value.

In the case of a solid solute, its particles are initially arranged in a highly ordered, regular structure. Upon dissolution, these particles break free from their organized arrangement and spread out randomly within the solvent. This increase in randomness directly correlates to an increase in entropy.

The dissolution process can be conceptualized as a sequence of steps. Initially, the intermolecular forces that bind the solute particles together must be overcome. This step requires energy and contributes to an increase in entropy as the particles are liberated from their fixed positions. Subsequently, the solvent particles must move apart to create space for the solute particles, further enhancing the entropy. Finally, the solute particles become surrounded by solvent molecules in a process known as solvation, resulting in a highly disordered arrangement of particles that further elevates the system's entropy.

It is crucial to recognize that not all dissolution processes lead to an increase in entropy. For instance, when a gas dissolves in a liquid, the gas particles can become more ordered as they are confined to the liquid phase, which may result in a decrease in entropy. However, in most scenarios—particularly when solids or liquids dissolve in liquids—the process of dissolution generally leads to an increase in entropy.

In summary, the impact of dissolution on the entropy of a system varies depending on the states of matter involved. Nevertheless, dissolution typically increases the entropy of a system due to the heightened disorder and randomness it introduces.
