The stoichiometric air-fuel ratio represents the ideal proportion of air to fuel necessary for complete combustion without any surplus.

In detail, the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio is a fundamental concept in combustion reactions, especially in engines and industrial processes. It defines the precise ratio of air (or oxygen) to fuel required to achieve complete combustion, ensuring that all the fuel is consumed and that no excess fuel or oxygen remains. This ratio is determined by the chemical composition of the fuel and is typically expressed in terms of weight or volume.

For instance, in the case of petrol (gasoline), which is primarily composed of octane ($\text{C}_8\text{H}_{18}$), the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio is approximately $14.7:1$ by weight. This indicates that for every kilogram of petrol, $14.7$ kilograms of air are needed for complete combustion. This specific ratio guarantees that all carbon in the fuel is converted to carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), all hydrogen is transformed into water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and that no unburnt fuel or excess oxygen remains.

However, achieving the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio in practical applications can be quite challenging. Factors such as temperature, pressure, and turbulence can influence the combustion process. As a result, engines often operate with a slightly richer or leaner mixture. A richer mixture contains more fuel than the stoichiometric ratio, which can enhance power output but may also lead to increased pollutant emissions. Conversely, a leaner mixture has less fuel, which can reduce emissions but may decrease power and potentially cause engine damage.

Understanding and managing the air-fuel ratio is essential for optimizing the efficiency and emissions of combustion processes. It is a critical concept in various fields, including automotive engineering, energy production, and environmental science.
