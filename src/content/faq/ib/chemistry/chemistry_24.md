Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy is a valuable analytical technique that distinguishes molecules based on their specific absorption of light within the ultraviolet and visible wavelength ranges.

This technique investigates how molecules interact with radiation from the UV-Vis spectrum. Each molecule has a distinct light absorption pattern, which is influenced by its molecular structure. Consequently, every molecule exhibits a unique absorption spectrum—a characteristic profile akin to a fingerprint—that can be utilized for molecular identification.

The fundamental principle of UV-Vis spectroscopy involves the absorption of light by a molecule. When light is directed at a molecule, it can absorb energy that promotes electrons from lower energy states to higher energy states. The wavelength of light absorbed by a molecule correlates directly with the energy difference between these electron states. As a result, different molecules, possessing varying electron configurations, absorb light at different wavelengths.

In a typical UV-Vis spectroscopy setup, a beam of light is divided into two equal components. One component is directed through a sample solution, while the other is passed through a reference solution. The intensities of light in both beams are measured after passing through their respective solutions. The difference in intensity between the two beams indicates the amount of light absorbed by the sample, which is then plotted against the wavelength of the light to produce an absorption spectrum.

The absorption spectrum serves as a unique identifier for a molecule. For instance, if you have an unknown sample, you can utilize UV-Vis spectroscopy to generate its absorption spectrum. By comparing this spectrum with established absorption spectra of known molecules, you can identify the constituent molecule present in the sample.

Moreover, UV-Vis spectroscopy is also instrumental in determining the concentration of a specific molecule within a solution. The amount of light absorbed is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species in the solution. Thus, by measuring the light absorption, one can accurately ascertain the concentration of the molecule in question.
