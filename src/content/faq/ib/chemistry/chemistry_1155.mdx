During the isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the entropy of the system increases due to a rise in the disorder of the gas molecules.

In an isothermal expansion, the temperature of the gas remains constant. This constancy is maintained by adding heat to the system, which compensates for the work done by the gas as it expands. According to the ideal gas law, the relationship between pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), the number of moles ($n$), the gas constant ($R$), and temperature ($T$) is given by the equation:

$$
PV = nRT
$$

In an isothermal process, since the temperature is held constant, an increase in volume must result in a corresponding decrease in pressure.

Entropy is a quantitative measure of the disorder or randomness within a system. For an ideal gas, the entropy is directly proportional to the natural logarithm of the volume. Consequently, as the volume of the gas increases during the expansion, the entropy also increases. This occurs because the gas molecules have more space to move around, resulting in a larger number of possible microstates, which are different ways in which the gas molecules can be arranged.

The change in entropy ($\Delta S$) can be computed using the formula:

$$
\Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right)
$$

In this equation, $\Delta S$ represents the change in entropy, $n$ is the number of moles of gas, $R$ is the gas constant, $V_f$ is the final volume, and $V_i$ is the initial volume. This formula indicates that the change in entropy is positive when the final volume ($V_f$) exceeds the initial volume ($V_i$), which is characteristic of an expansion process.

In summary, the entropy of an ideal gas increases during an isothermal expansion because the gas molecules are afforded greater space to move, leading to a higher number of possible microstates. This increase in entropy reflects the enhanced disorder or randomness of the gas system.
