Certain elements readily form pi bonds due to their ability to hybridize and the presence of unpaired p-orbitals.

A pi bond is created when parallel orbitals overlap and share electrons. This type of bonding is most commonly observed in double and triple bonds, such as those found in alkenes and alkynes. The capacity of an atom to form pi bonds is largely influenced by its electronic configuration, particularly the availability of unpaired p-orbitals.

Elements in the second period of the periodic table, including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are particularly proficient at forming pi bonds. This proficiency arises from their small atomic sizes, which allow their p-orbitals to overlap effectively. For example, carbon has four valence electrons and can hybridize in several ways: $sp^3$, $sp^2$, and $sp$. In the $sp^2$ hybridization state, carbon forms one pi bond and two sigma bonds, resulting in a double bond, as seen in alkenes. In the $sp$ hybridization state, carbon forms two pi bonds and one sigma bond, leading to a triple bond, as observed in alkynes.

Moreover, elements that possess unpaired electrons in their p-orbitals are capable of forming pi bonds as well. For instance, nitrogen, which has five valence electrons, forms one pi bond along with two sigma bonds in its $sp^2$ hybridization state, resulting in a double bond as found in imines. Similarly, oxygen, with six valence electrons, can also form one pi bond and two sigma bonds in its $sp^2$ hybridization state, leading to a double bond, as seen in carbonyl compounds.

In summary, the ability of an element to easily form pi bonds is determined by its capacity to hybridize and the availability of unpaired p-orbitals. Elements in the second period of the periodic table, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, excel in forming these bonds due to their small sizes and the effective overlap of their p-orbitals.
