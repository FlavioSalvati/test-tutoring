As you progress down Group 17 of the periodic table, the halogens exhibit several distinct trends: they become less reactive, have larger atomic radii, lower electronegativities, and higher melting and boiling points.

Group 17 consists of the halogen elements: fluorine ($F$), chlorine ($Cl$), bromine ($Br$), iodine ($I$), and astatine ($At$). Observing these elements, we can identify several key trends in their properties as we descend the group.

Firstly, the reactivity of the halogens diminishes moving down the group. This decrease in reactivity is primarily attributed to the increasing atomic radius. As the atomic radius expands, the outer electrons are positioned further from the nucleus, resulting in a weaker attraction to the nucleus. Consequently, it becomes more challenging for these atoms to gain an additional electron to achieve a stable electron configuration. Thus, while fluorine ($F$), located at the top of the group, is the most reactive halogen, astatine ($At$), at the bottom, is the least reactive.

Secondly, the atomic radius of the halogens increases as you move down the group. This trend occurs because each subsequent element possesses an additional electron shell compared to the one above it. The presence of more electron shells causes the atomic radius to expand, as the electrons are located further from the nucleus.

Thirdly, there is a decrease in electronegativity among the halogens as you descend the group. Electronegativity quantifies an atom's ability to attract a bonding pair of electrons. As the atomic radius increases, the outer electrons experience a weaker attraction to the nucleus, leading to a decline in electronegativity.

Lastly, the melting and boiling points of the halogens rise as you move down the group. This increase can be attributed to the growing number of electrons in each atom, which enhances the strength of London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals force) between the atoms. These stronger intermolecular forces necessitate more energy to overcome, resulting in higher melting and boiling points.

In summary, as one moves down Group 17, the halogens demonstrate a decrease in reactivity and electronegativity, alongside an increase in atomic radius, melting point, and boiling point. These trends are primarily driven by the increasing number of electron shells and the corresponding enlargement of the atomic radius.
