A polarimeter is an instrument utilized in laboratories to detect chiral substances by measuring the rotation of plane-polarized light as it traverses a sample.

Chiral substances are molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror images, a characteristic that allows them to exhibit optical activity. This optical activity manifests as the ability to rotate the plane of polarization of light, a phenomenon referred to as optical rotation.

The operation of a polarimeter involves several key components: a light source, a polarizer, a sample tube, and an analyzer. Initially, light from the source is directed through the polarizer, which generates plane-polarized lightâ€”light that vibrates in a single plane. This polarized light then proceeds into the sample tube, which contains the substance under examination. If the substance is chiral, it will rotate the plane of polarization of the light as it passes through. The rotated light then enters the analyzer, which measures the angle of rotation.

The extent of this rotation is influenced by several factors, including the concentration of the chiral substance, the length of the sample tube, and the wavelength of the light employed. By accounting for these variables, it is possible to calculate the specific rotation of the substance, a distinctive property unique to each chiral compound. This allows scientists to identify unknown chiral substances by comparing their specific rotations to established values.

In summary, a polarimeter serves to detect chiral substances by measuring the rotation of plane-polarized light as it passes through a sample. This rotation is a fundamental property of chiral substances and can be effectively used for their identification.
