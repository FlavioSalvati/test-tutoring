Gibbs free energy is classified as a state function because its value is determined solely by the current state of a system, independent of its historical path.

To elaborate, a state function is a property that relies exclusively on the system's present equilibrium state, rather than the specific route taken to reach that state. This indicates that the value of a state function is influenced by current conditions—including temperature, pressure, and composition—but not by the processes or steps that led to those conditions.

Gibbs free energy, denoted as $G$, is a thermodynamic potential that quantifies the maximum reversible work a system can perform under constant temperature and pressure. It is mathematically defined by the equation:

$$
G = H - TS
$$

where $H$ represents the enthalpy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $S$ is the entropy of the system. Notably, both enthalpy and entropy are state functions, and their difference—Gibbs free energy—is also categorized as a state function.

This characteristic arises from the fact that the change in Gibbs free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$, during a process is given by:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

Here, $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ represent the changes in enthalpy and entropy, respectively, both of which are state functions. Consequently, $\Delta G$, the difference between these two changes, is also a state function. This means that the value of $\Delta G$ depends solely on the initial and final states of the system, irrespective of the specific path taken to transition between these states.

Practically speaking, this implies that if the initial and final states of a system are known, one can easily calculate the change in Gibbs free energy for the process—regardless of the exact steps or pathways involved. This property is particularly valuable in chemistry, as it enables the calculation of energy changes associated with chemical reactions, phase transitions, and other processes based purely on the initial and final states of the system.
