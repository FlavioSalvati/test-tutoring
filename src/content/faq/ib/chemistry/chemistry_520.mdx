One mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number of particles, which is approximately $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles.

To elaborate, the mole is a fundamental concept in chemistry, especially in the field of stoichiometry. Stoichiometry examines the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. A mole is formally defined as the quantity of a substance that contains as many particles (such as atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) as there are atoms in exactly $12$ grams of carbon-12. This specific number of particles is referred to as Avogadro's number, named in honor of the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro, and is approximately $6.022 \times 10^{23}$.

Avogadro's number serves as a constant that enables chemists to determine the number of particles in a given amount of a substance. It acts as a conversion factor between the atomic or molecular scale and the macroscopic scale. For instance, if you possess one mole of water (H$_2$O), you have approximately $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ water molecules. Likewise, one mole of sodium (Na) contains roughly $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ sodium atoms.

The relationship between moles and Avogadro's number is crucial in chemistry, as it facilitates the conversion between the mass of a substance and the number of particles it comprises. This is particularly significant in the context of chemical reactions, which occur on a particle-to-particle basis rather than a mass-to-mass basis. Consequently, grasping the connection between moles and Avogadro's number is essential for accurately predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions and for understanding the fundamental principles of chemistry.
