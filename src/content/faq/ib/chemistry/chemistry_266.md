The half-life in first-order reactions is defined as the time required for half of the reactants to be consumed.

In the context of first-order reactions, the half-life is an essential concept that sheds light on the rate at which a reaction occurs. Specifically, it represents the time needed for the concentration of a reactant to decrease to half of its initial value. A key characteristic of first-order reactions is that the half-life is a constant, meaning it remains unchanged regardless of the initial concentration of the reactant. This distinguishes first-order reactions from zero-order and second-order reactions, where the half-life is dependent on the initial concentration.

The concept of half-life is particularly beneficial for predicting the progression of a reaction over time. By knowing the half-life, one can estimate how long it will take for a specific percentage of the reactant to be consumed. For instance, after one half-life, $50\%$ of the reactant remains; after two half-lives, $25\%$ remains; after three half-lives, $12.5\%$ remains, and so forth. This information is especially useful in practical applications, such as calculating the duration required for a drug to be eliminated from the body or the time it takes for a radioactive substance to decay.

The mathematical expression for the half-life of a first-order reaction is given by:

$$
t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k}
$$

where $k$ is the rate constant of the reaction. This equation highlights the independence of the half-life from the initial concentration in first-order reactions, as the rate constant $k$ is a fixed value for a specific reaction at a given temperature.

In summary, the half-life in first-order reactions is a significant concept that facilitates the prediction of a reaction's progress over time. Its constancy, regardless of the initial concentration of the reactant, makes it a unique and valuable tool in the study of reaction kinetics.
