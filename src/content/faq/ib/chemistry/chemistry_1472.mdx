An atom is the fundamental unit of a chemical element, consisting of three types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The nucleus, located at the center of the atom, houses the protons and neutrons. This nucleus is the heaviest part of the atom, as protons and neutrons have significantly greater mass compared to electrons. The number of protons in the nucleus defines the atomic number, which uniquely identifies the element.

Surrounding the nucleus are the electrons, which occupy specific energy levels, often referred to as shells or orbitals. These energy levels can be visualized as concentric circles around the nucleus, with each level having a defined maximum capacity for electrons. For instance, the first energy level can accommodate up to $2$ electrons, while the second can hold up to $8$, and this pattern continues for higher levels.

The arrangement of electrons within these energy levels is crucial, as it influences the chemical behavior of the atom. Particularly important are the electrons in the outermost energy level, known as valence electrons. These electrons play a key role in chemical reactions. Atoms tend to seek a complete outer energy level, commonly achieved by having $8$ electrons, a principle known as the octet rule. This rule is fundamental in understanding chemical bonding.

In a neutral atom, the number of protons (which carry a positive charge) is equal to the number of electrons (which carry a negative charge), resulting in an overall charge of zero. However, atoms can lose or gain electrons, transforming into ions that carry either a positive or negative charge.

The atomic mass of an atom is calculated as the sum of the protons and neutrons within the nucleus. It is important to note that the mass of an electron is so negligible that it does not significantly affect the overall atomic mass.

In summary, the structure of an atom comprises a central nucleus filled with protons and neutrons, encompassed by electrons arranged in energy levels. The distribution of these particles determines the atom's properties and behaviors.
