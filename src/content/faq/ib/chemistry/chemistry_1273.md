Diastereomers are a specific category of stereoisomers that do not serve as mirror images of one another, in contrast to enantiomers, which are indeed mirror images.

To elaborate, both diastereomers and enantiomers fall under the broader classification of stereoisomers. Stereoisomers are molecules that share the same molecular formula and the same sequence of bonded atoms, yet differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space. This variation in spatial orientation typically results from the presence of chiral centers or double bonds within the molecule.

Diastereomers are stereoisomers that lack the mirror-image relationship. They arise when two or more stereoisomers of a compound exhibit different configurations at one or more (but not all) of their equivalent stereocenters. For instance, consider molecules featuring two chiral centers; such molecules can yield up to four possible stereoisomers. Among these, two will be mirror images of each other and are classified as enantiomers, while the other two are considered diastereomers. Notably, diastereomers can exhibit distinct physical properties, such as boiling point, melting point, and solubility, and they may also demonstrate varying chemical reactivities.

Conversely, enantiomers represent a type of stereoisomer where the molecules are mirror images of one another, akin to the relationship between left and right hands. Enantiomers occur when all stereocenters in a molecule possess opposite configurations. Although enantiomers share identical physical properties, they differ in their ability to rotate polarized light and in their interactions with other optical isomers. This phenomenon is known as optical activity.

In summary, while both diastereomers and enantiomers are types of stereoisomers, they exhibit distinct differences in their spatial arrangement and their associated physical and chemical properties. Diastereomers are not mirror images and may possess varying physical properties and chemical reactivities, whereas enantiomers are mirror images that primarily differ in their optical activity.
