The limiting reactant in a chemical reaction is determined by calculating the potential amount of product each reactant can yield.

In any chemical reaction, the limiting reactant (or limiting reagent) is the substance that is entirely consumed when the reaction reaches completion. This reactant dictates the maximum quantity of product that can be formed from the available reactants. To identify the limiting reactant, it is essential to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction, as well as the initial amounts of each reactant present.

First, write down the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. This equation provides the stoichiometric ratiosâ€”the proportions in which reactants combine to produce products. For example, in the reaction 

$$ 
2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} 
$$ 

two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to yield two molecules of water.

Next, calculate the number of moles of each reactant. This can be accomplished by dividing the mass of each reactant by its molar mass. The molar mass represents the mass of one mole of a substance and can be determined by summing the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule of that substance.

Once you have determined the number of moles of each reactant, you can calculate the potential amount of product that each reactant could produce if it were completely consumed. This is achieved by multiplying the number of moles of the reactant by the stoichiometric ratio obtained from the balanced chemical equation.

The reactant that yields the least amount of product is identified as the limiting reactant. This is because it will be fully consumed before the other reactants, thereby halting the reaction. The maximum amount of product that this reactant can produce is referred to as the theoretical yield of the reaction.

It is important to note that the limiting reactant is not necessarily the one present in the smallest quantity; rather, it is the reactant that generates the least amount of product. Understanding this concept is crucial in chemistry, as it enables us to predict the outcomes of reactions and to design them for optimal efficiency.
