Empirical formulas represent the simplest ratio of atoms in a compound, while molecular formulas indicate the actual number of each type of atom present.

An empirical formula conveys the most reduced whole-number ratio of atoms within a compound. For instance, the empirical formula for glucose is $CH_2O$. This indicates that for every one carbon atom, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Although it does not specify the total number of atoms in a molecule, it effectively illustrates the simplest proportion of elements in the compound. This formula is particularly valuable in chemistry for identifying patterns and relationships among various compounds.

Conversely, a molecular formula reveals the precise number of each type of atom in a molecule of the compound. Continuing with the example of glucose, its molecular formula is $C_6H_{12}O_6$. This signifies that a molecule of glucose comprises six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. The molecular formula provides more detailed information about the compound, including its molecular weight.

It is important to highlight that while the molecular formula of a compound can coincide with its empirical formula, this is not always the case. For example, hydrogen peroxide has an empirical formula of $HO$ but a molecular formula of $H_2O_2$. This distinction arises because the molecular formula specifies the actual number of atoms, while the empirical formula articulates the simplest ratio of those atoms.

In summary, both empirical and molecular formulas deliver essential information about a compound. The empirical formula presents the simplest ratio of atoms, which can aid in recognizing patterns and correlations among compounds. In contrast, the molecular formula offers a more comprehensive perspective, detailing the actual number of each type of atom in a molecule. Both formulas are invaluable tools in the field of chemistry.
