A molecule is said to exhibit resonance when it contains delocalized electrons within a conjugated system characterized by alternating single and double bonds.

Resonance is a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes the delocalization of electrons across certain molecules. This phenomenon occurs in molecules where no single Lewis structure can fully capture the actual electronic arrangement. Instead, these molecules exist as a hybrid of multiple structures, referred to as resonance structures.

To determine whether a molecule exhibits resonance, one must identify a conjugated system. A conjugated system is defined as a structure in which at least one electron occupies a p orbital and is adjacent to a double bond. This arrangement facilitates the delocalization of electrons, which is a hallmark of resonance.

A classic example of resonance is found in benzene. Benzene consists of a six-membered carbon ring featuring alternating single and double bonds. The positions of the double bonds can be shifted around the ring, leading to the formation of various resonance structures. However, the true structure of benzene is a hybrid of these resonance forms, with electrons delocalized throughout the ring.

Another method for identifying resonance is to examine molecules that possess a charge distributed across two or more atoms. For instance, the nitrate ion ($\text{NO}_3^-$) displays a negative charge that is spread across its three oxygen atoms, providing further evidence of resonance.

In summary, to ascertain whether a molecule exhibits resonance, look for a conjugated system characterized by alternating single and double bonds, or identify a charge that is distributed across two or more atoms. These features indicate the delocalization of electrons, which is a central aspect of resonance.
