The general formula for alkanes is given by:

$$ C_nH_{2n+2} $$

Alkanes are a specific category of hydrocarbons, meaning they consist entirely of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The formula $C_nH_{2n+2}$ illustrates this composition, where the variable $n$ denotes the number of carbon atoms present in the molecule. According to this formula, the number of hydrogen atoms is always twice the number of carbon atoms, plus two additional hydrogen atoms.

For instance, if we consider an alkane with 3 carbon atoms ($n=3$), we can calculate the number of hydrogen atoms as follows:

$$ 2(3) + 2 = 8 $$ 

This gives us the alkane propane, which has the molecular formula $C_3H_8$. Likewise, if an alkane contains 5 carbon atoms ($n=5$), the number of hydrogen atoms can be determined as:

$$ 2(5) + 2 = 12 $$ 

This corresponds to the alkane pentane, which has the molecular formula $C_5H_{12}$.

This formula provides a clear and concise way to understand the structure of alkanes. Alkanes are characterized by single bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms, resulting in a saturated hydrocarbon. The term 'saturated' indicates that the carbon atoms are bonded to the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms.

Moreover, the general formula for alkanes can also shed light on their physical properties. For example, as the number of carbon atoms ($n$) increases, the boiling point of the alkane tends to rise as well. This trend is attributed to the growing number of electrons, which enhances the strength of London dispersion forces—an important type of intermolecular force—between alkane molecules.

In summary, the general formula for alkanes, $C_nH_{2n+2}$, is a fundamental concept in organic chemistry. It offers a straightforward method for determining the molecular formula of alkanes based on the count of carbon atoms, while also providing insights into the structure and properties of these essential hydrocarbons.
