The Wittig reaction is a stereospecific chemical transformation that synthesizes alkenes from aldehydes or ketones using phosphonium ylides. The stereochemistry of the resulting alkene is directly influenced by the stereochemistry of the ylide and the specific details of the reaction mechanism.

This reaction proceeds through a concerted, pericyclic mechanism, which means that all bond formation and bond cleavage occur simultaneously in a single step, without the formation of any intermediates. In this process, the ylide and the carbonyl compound combine to create a four-membered ring transition state. In this transition state, the atoms involved—the phosphorus atom from the ylide, the carbon atom of the ylide, the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen atom—are all arranged in a coplanar fashion. It is within this transition state that the stereochemistry of the final product is established.

The configuration of the ylide plays a critical role in determining the stereochemistry of the product. Specifically, if the ylide is in the Z configuration, the reaction will yield a cis-alkene, whereas an E-configured ylide will produce a trans-alkene. This is due to the orientation in which the ylide and the carbonyl compound interact, where the bulky substituents on each compound are positioned on opposite sides of the forming double bond, thus minimizing steric hindrance.

In conclusion, the Wittig reaction demonstrates stereospecificity due to its concerted, pericyclic mechanism and the stereochemical characteristics of the ylide. The reaction occurs in a single step, where all bond-making and bond-breaking processes take place simultaneously. Consequently, the configuration of the ylide directly dictates the configuration of the product, reinforcing the stereospecific nature of this reaction.
