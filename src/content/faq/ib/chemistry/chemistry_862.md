The formation of alloys is primarily attributed to the variable oxidation states and the capacity to form metallic bonds characteristic of transition metals.

Transition metals possess unique properties that facilitate the formation of alloys. One significant property is their ability to exhibit variable oxidation states. These metals can lose different numbers of electrons from their $d$-orbital and $s$-orbital, resulting in multiple oxidation states. This variability enables them to bond with a diverse array of elements, including other transition metals, thereby forming alloys. For instance, steel is an alloy composed of iron, a transition metal that can exist in oxidation states of either $+2$ or $+3$. This versatility allows iron to effectively bond with carbon.

Another crucial property that aids transition metals in alloy formation is their ability to establish metallic bonds. Metallic bonding occurs due to the electrostatic attraction between positively charged metal ions and delocalized electrons. In an alloy, transition metal atoms can be replaced by different elemental atoms, which may be other transition metals or non-metals. These substituting atoms can either occupy the interstitial spaces between the metal atoms, creating an interstitial alloy, or replace some of the metal atoms entirely, forming a substitutional alloy. This capability to create various types of bonds allows transition metals to integrate with other elements and form alloys.

For example, in stainless steel—an alloy of iron, chromium, and nickel—the chromium and nickel atoms substitute for some of the iron atoms in the metallic lattice. This substitution enhances the strength and corrosion resistance of the material compared to pure iron. Similarly, in bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin, the tin atoms occupy the interstitial spaces between the copper atoms, resulting in a harder and more durable material than pure copper.

In summary, the ability of transition metals to form alloys can be largely explained by their variable oxidation states and their capacity to form metallic bonds. These properties enable them to bond with a wide range of elements, leading to the creation of alloys that exhibit enhanced properties compared to their pure metal counterparts.
