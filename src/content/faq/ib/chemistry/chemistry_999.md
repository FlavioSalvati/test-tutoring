Polymers are created from alkenes through a chemical process known as polymerization, specifically a type called addition polymerization.

To elaborate, polymerization is a chemical reaction in which small molecules, referred to as monomers, combine to form a larger molecule known as a polymer. Alkenes, which are hydrocarbons characterized by a carbon-carbon double bond, are capable of undergoing addition polymerization. During this process, the double bond in the alkene breaks, allowing the carbon atoms to form new bonds with other monomers, ultimately producing a long-chain molecule—the polymer.

The polymerization process initiates with an initiation step, where a catalyst or initiator triggers the reaction by generating a reactive intermediate. In the case of alkenes, this intermediate is usually a free radical—a molecule that contains an unpaired electron. This free radical attacks the double bond of the alkene, breaking it and bonding to one of the carbon atoms. As a result, the other carbon atom becomes a new free radical, which can subsequently react with another alkene molecule. This phase of the process is known as propagation.

During the propagation step, the reaction can occur repeatedly, with each newly formed free radical attacking an additional alkene molecule. This action breaks the double bond of the alkene and adds it to the growing polymer chain. This sequence can persist until thousands or even millions of monomers have been incorporated into the chain.

The process concludes with the termination step, which occurs when two free radicals combine to form a stable molecule, thereby halting the growth of the polymer chain. The outcome is a long-chain polymer, with each repeating unit in the chain derived from an alkene monomer.

The characteristics of the resulting polymer are influenced by the choice of alkene monomer and the specific conditions under which the polymerization takes place. For instance, polyethylene, one of the most widely used plastics, is produced through the polymerization of ethene, while polypropylene is synthesized from propene. Additionally, the degree of polymerization, which indicates the number of monomer units within the polymer chain, can significantly affect the polymer’s properties, such as its strength, flexibility, and melting point.
