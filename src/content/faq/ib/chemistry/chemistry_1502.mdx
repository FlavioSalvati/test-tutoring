The atomic radius is defined as the measure of an atom's size, specifically the distance from the nucleus to the outer boundary of its electron cloud. This measurement is typically expressed in picometers (pm) or angstroms (Å), with the conversion factor that $1 \, \text{Å} = 100 \, \text{pm}$. It is important to note that the atomic radius is not a constant value for a given element; rather, it can vary significantly depending on the atom's chemical environment and the types of chemical bonds it forms.

To calculate the atomic radius, scientists commonly employ the technique of measuring the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms that are bonded together. This distance is referred to as the bond length. By taking half of this bond length, an estimate of the atomic radius is obtained. This approach is particularly effective for elements that engage in covalent bonding, where the bond length represents the separation between the two atomic nuclei.

However, it is essential to recognize that this method may not always yield precise results. The electron cloud surrounding an atom does not have a sharply defined boundary, and the perceived size of an atom can fluctuate based on its physical state and the nature of its interactions with other atoms. For instance, in a covalent bond, the electron cloud is shared between two atoms, which can lead to a reduction in the apparent atomic radius.

For elements that do not participate in covalent bonding, alternative methods are utilized to estimate the atomic radius. One such method is the determination of the metallic radius, which involves measuring the distance between the nuclei of two adjacent atoms in a metallic crystal and subsequently halving that distance.

In summary, the atomic radius is determined by measuring the distance between the nuclei of two identical bonded atoms and dividing this value by two. However, this measurement is subject to variation based on the atom's chemical environment and the nature of its bonds.
