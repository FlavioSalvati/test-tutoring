Aldehydes react with Tollens' reagent to produce a characteristic silver mirror and a carboxylic acid.

Tollens' reagent, commonly referred to as the silver mirror test, is a chemical reagent utilized to detect the presence of aldehydes. This reagent consists of a solution of silver nitrate ($\text{AgNO}_3$) and ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$). When an aldehyde is introduced to this solution, it undergoes an oxidation reaction, which is facilitated by the Tollens' reagent acting as an oxidizing agent.

During this reaction, the aldehyde is oxidized to form a carboxylic acid, while the silver ions ($\text{Ag}^+$) in the Tollens' reagent are reduced to metallic silver ($\text{Ag}$). This reduction of silver ions to silver metal results in the formation of the characteristic 'silver mirror' on the inner surface of the test tube, providing a clear visual indication of the presence of an aldehyde. The overall reaction can be summarized as follows:

$$
\text{RCHO} + 2[\text{Ag}(\text{NH}_3)_2]^+ + 3\text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{RCOO}^- + 2\text{Ag} + 4\text{NH}_3 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In this equation, $\text{RCHO}$ represents the aldehyde, and $\text{RCOO}^-$ represents the resulting carboxylic acid. Understanding the structure and behavior of these compounds can provide deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of this reaction.

It is important to highlight that this reaction is specific to aldehydes; ketones, another class of carbonyl compounds, do not react with Tollens' reagent. This lack of reactivity is due to the fact that ketones are not readily oxidized. Consequently, the Tollens' reagent test serves as a useful method to differentiate between aldehydes and ketones.

In practical terms, the test is relatively simple to perform. A small amount of the aldehyde is added to the Tollens' reagent in a test tube, which is then gently heated in a water bath. If an aldehyde is present, a silver mirror will develop on the interior of the test tube within a few minutes. This reaction exemplifies a significant change that is central to many chemical processes.

In summary, Tollens' reagent effectively detects aldehydes by forming a silver mirror upon reaction. This occurs as the aldehyde is converted into a carboxylic acid, with the silver ions in the reagent being reduced to metallic silver on the test tube. Since this test does not yield a reaction with ketones, it serves as an effective means of distinguishing between aldehydes and ketones.
