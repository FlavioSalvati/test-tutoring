The derivation of the rate expression for a chemical reaction relies on several key assumptions: collision theory, the steady-state approximation, and the elementary reaction assumption.

The first assumption is rooted in collision theory, which posits that for a reaction to occur, reactant particles must collide. Importantly, these collisions must not only be frequent but also possess sufficient energy—exceeding the activation energy—and have the correct orientation. This principle is critical in understanding how variations in reactant concentration or temperature can accelerate the reaction rate.

The second assumption involves the steady-state approximation, particularly relevant for complex reactions that produce intermediates. This approximation asserts that the concentration of these intermediates remains relatively constant throughout the reaction. This constancy arises because the rate of formation of the intermediates equals their rate of consumption. By applying this assumption, we can simplify the rate equations, making them easier to analyze.

The third assumption is the elementary reaction assumption, which suggests that the reaction proceeds in a single step with a unique transition state. This assumption allows us to derive the rate law directly from the stoichiometry of the reaction. However, it is important to note that many reactions occur in multiple steps, each characterized by its own transition state. In such cases, the rate law must be derived from the rate-determining step, which is the slowest step in the overall reaction mechanism.

Furthermore, it is commonly assumed that external factors, such as pressure and the presence of catalysts, do not influence the reaction. While these factors can significantly alter the rate of reaction and, consequently, the rate expression, they are often held constant to streamline the derivation process.

In summary, these assumptions are essential for deriving the rate expression of a reaction. They help to simplify the intricate nature of chemical reactions and enable us to predict reaction rates under various conditions. However, these assumptions are approximations and may not always be valid, particularly in complex reactions. Therefore, it is crucial to validate the derived rate expression with experimental data.
