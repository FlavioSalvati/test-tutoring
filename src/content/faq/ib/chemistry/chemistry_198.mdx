Standard enthalpies are determined at constant pressure since the majority of chemical reactions take place under conditions of constant atmospheric pressure.

More specifically, the standard enthalpy change of a reaction is defined as the heat energy exchanged during the reaction when conducted at constant pressure. This approach is particularly relevant because most chemical reactions, especially those carried out in laboratories or industrial settings, occur at atmospheric pressure. Consequently, measuring enthalpy changes under these conditions is both practical and significant.

The term "standard" in standard enthalpy refers to the standard state, which is defined as the most stable form of a substance at a pressure of $1 \, \text{bar}$ and a specified temperature, typically $298 \, \text{K}$. The standard state serves as a reference point for calculating the enthalpy changes of all substances involved in a chemical reaction.

When a reaction occurs at constant pressure, the heat change is directly equivalent to the change in enthalpy. This relationship is supported by the first law of thermodynamics, which asserts that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. As a result, any heat energy absorbed or released by the system during a reaction corresponds to the change in the system's internal energy, which is the essence of enthalpy.

In contrast, if a reaction were to take place at constant volume, the heat change would correspond to the change in internal energy rather than the change in enthalpy. This distinction arises because, at constant volume, no work is performed by or on the system, meaning the only energy change observed is in the internal energy. However, in practical scenarios, reactions seldom occur at constant volume, making constant pressure the more relevant condition for measuring enthalpy changes.

In summary, standard enthalpies are measured at constant pressure, as this accurately reflects the conditions under which most chemical reactions occur. This practice facilitates a practical and relevant assessment of the heat energy changes associated with these reactions.
