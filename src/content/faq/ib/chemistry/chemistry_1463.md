Stoichiometric defects are imperfections within a crystal lattice that alter the stoichiometric ratio of its constituent elements.

In solid-state chemistry, the term 'stoichiometric defects' refers to deviations from the ideal arrangement of atoms or ions in a crystal lattice. These defects disrupt the perfect stoichiometric ratio, which is the proportion of the number of atoms of each element in a compound that should ideally be present in the crystal. These imperfections are often referred to as 'point defects' because they typically occur at or near a single point in the crystal lattice.

There are several types of stoichiometric defects, including vacancies, interstitial defects, Frenkel defects, and Schottky defects. A vacancy defect arises when an atom or ion is absent from its designated lattice site. Conversely, an interstitial defect occurs when an additional atom or ion is inserted into the lattice at a position where it would not normally reside.

Frenkel defects represent a combination of vacancy and interstitial defects, where an atom or ion vacates its regular site, creating a vacancy, and then occupies an interstitial site. Schottky defects consist of pairs of vacancies that maintain the overall charge balance within the crystal lattice.

These defects can significantly impact the properties of a material, including its electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and chemical reactivity. For example, materials with a high concentration of vacancy defects may display lower density and altered electrical characteristics.

It is important to emphasize that stoichiometric defects are intrinsic to the material and arise from the conditions present during the crystal's formation. They are typically present even at absolute zero temperature. Understanding these defects is essential in materials science and solid-state chemistry, as it enables scientists to manipulate material properties for diverse applications.
