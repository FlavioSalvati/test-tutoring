Carboxylic acids are typically not very reactive in their original form due to the resonance stabilization of their carboxylate ions. This stabilization decreases their likelihood of participating in chemical reactions. However, carboxylic acids can be activated—made more reactive—by transforming them into more reactive derivatives such as acyl chlorides or anhydrides. These derivatives exhibit increased reactivity because they are less stable than the original carboxylic acid, making them more inclined to engage in chemical reactions.

The activation process usually involves a reagent that reacts with the carboxylic acid to produce the desired derivative. For instance, to synthesize an acyl chloride, a carboxylic acid can be treated with thionyl chloride ($\text{SOCl}_2$). This reaction substitutes the hydroxyl group ($\text{-OH}$) of the carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom ($\text{-Cl}$), resulting in the formation of the acyl chloride. This derivative is significantly more reactive than the original carboxylic acid, making it more suitable for subsequent reactions.

In a similar fashion, carboxylic acids can be converted into anhydrides by reacting with acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride in the presence of a base. This reaction eliminates a molecule of water from two carboxylic acid molecules, yielding an anhydride. Anhydrides also demonstrate greater reactivity compared to the original carboxylic acids, which makes them advantageous for reactions that necessitate a more reactive species.

In summary, carboxylic acids can be activated for reactions by converting them into more reactive derivatives such as acyl chlorides or anhydrides. This transformation is accomplished through reactions with specific reagents that replace the $\text{-OH}$ group of the carboxylic acid with a more reactive group, thereby enhancing the molecule's reactivity. This process is essential in organic chemistry, as it expands the range of reactions in which carboxylic acids can be utilized.
