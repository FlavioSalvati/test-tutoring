An aldehyde features a carbonyl group ($\text{C}= \text{O}$) located at the end of its carbon chain, whereas a ketone has the carbonyl group situated within the chain.

To elaborate, both aldehydes and ketones are classified as carbonyl compounds, characterized by the presence of a carbon-oxygen double bond ($\text{C} = \text{O}$). This carbonyl group is the key structural element that defines these two types of compounds. The critical distinction lies in the positioning of the carbonyl group within the molecular structure.

In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is invariably located at the terminal end of the carbon chain. Consequently, the carbon atom of the carbonyl group is always bonded to at least one hydrogen atom. The general formula for an aldehyde is given by:

$$
\text{RCHO}
$$

Here, $\text{R}$ denotes any alkyl group, while $\text{CHO}$ represents the carbonyl group along with the hydrogen atom. A common example of an aldehyde is ethanal ($\text{CH}_3\text{CHO}$), where the carbonyl group is positioned at the end of the molecule.

Conversely, in ketones, the carbonyl group is found in the interior of the carbon chain, which means it is bonded to two carbon atoms. The general formula for a ketone can be expressed as:

$$
\text{RCOR'}
$$

In this case, $\text{R}$ and $\text{R'}$ represent any alkyl groups, while $\text{CO}$ denotes the carbonyl group. A notable example of a ketone is propanone ($\text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_3$), where the carbonyl group is situated in the middle of the molecule.

Regarding physical properties, both aldehydes and ketones are typically colorless and emit strong, often pleasant, odors. Due to the presence of the carbonyl group, they exhibit polarity, resulting in higher boiling points compared to similar-sized hydrocarbons or ethers.

When it comes to chemical reactivity, aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones. This increased reactivity can be attributed to the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes being more accessible for nucleophilic attack, as it is bonded to a hydrogen atom, which is a weaker electron donor compared to another carbon atom. As a result, aldehydes are more prone to oxidation reactions, whereas ketones tend to resist such oxidation.
