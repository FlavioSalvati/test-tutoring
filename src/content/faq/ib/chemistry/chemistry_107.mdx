A transition metal is defined by its location in the periodic table, specifically within groups 3 to 12, as well as by its distinctive chemical properties.

Transition metals, located in groups 3 through 12 of the periodic table, possess the remarkable ability to form compounds with variable oxidation states. They can create a wide array of coordination compounds and are often characterized by their vibrant colors. Additionally, these metals exhibit high melting and boiling points, significant density, and strong metallic bonding.

The key feature of transition metals is their electronic configuration. These elements have partially filled $d$ orbitals, either in their ground state or in one or more of their oxidation states. This characteristic enables them to adopt multiple oxidation states. For instance, iron (Fe) can exist in either the +2 or +3 oxidation state. This flexibility arises from the relatively small energy difference between the $3d$ and $4d$ orbitals, which allows electrons to be readily added or removed.

Furthermore, transition metals are capable of forming a diverse range of coordination compounds. These compounds consist of a central metal atom or ion surrounded by neutral molecules or anions, collectively known as ligands. The formation of these compounds is facilitated by the availability of vacant $d$ orbitals, which can accept electron pairs from the ligands.

Another notable characteristic of transition metals is the formation of colored compounds. This phenomenon is attributed to the presence of partially filled $d$ orbitals. When light is absorbed, an electron can be excited from a lower energy $d$ orbital to a higher energy $d$ orbital, resulting in the compound exhibiting a specific color.

Finally, transition metals are recognized for their high melting and boiling points, considerable density, and robust metallic bonding. These attributes are due to the presence of delocalized electrons in the $d$ orbitals, which can move freely, creating a "sea of electrons." This leads to strong metallic bonds, contributing to their elevated melting and boiling points as well as their high density.

In conclusion, an element is classified as a transition metal based on its position in the periodic table, its unique electronic configuration, and its distinct chemical properties.
