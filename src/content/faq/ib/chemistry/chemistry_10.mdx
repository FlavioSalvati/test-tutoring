Alkanes can be synthesized from alkenes through a chemical process known as hydrogenation.

Hydrogenation is a reaction that entails the addition of hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) to a compound. Specifically, when converting alkenes to alkanes, hydrogenation involves the incorporation of hydrogen into an alkene, facilitated by a catalyst. This reaction transforms the double bonds present in the alkene into single bonds, thereby yielding an alkane.

The general reaction can be expressed as follows:

$$
\text{RCH}=\text{CH}_2 + \text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{RCH}_2\text{-CH}_3
$$

In this equation, $\text{RCH}=\text{CH}_2$ denotes an alkene, while $\text{RCH}_2\text{-CH}_3$ signifies the corresponding alkane. The reaction is typically conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, utilizing a metal catalyst such as nickel, platinum, or palladium.

Hydrogenation of alkenes exemplifies an addition reaction, a category of reactions where atoms or groups of atoms are introduced into a molecule. In this case, hydrogen atoms are added to the carbon atoms of the alkene, effectively breaking the double bond and forming a new single bond, thus resulting in the formation of an alkane.

This process is extensively employed in the industrial production of alkanes, particularly within the petroleum sector, where it serves to convert unsaturated hydrocarbons (such as alkenes) into saturated hydrocarbons (like alkanes). The significance of this transformation lies in the fact that saturated hydrocarbons are generally more stable and less reactive than their unsaturated counterparts, making them safer and more manageable for storage and handling.

Beyond its industrial relevance, the hydrogenation of alkenes is also a fundamental concept in organic chemistry. Grasping this process enhances our understanding of the properties and behaviors of various hydrocarbons and how these compounds can be manipulated through chemical reactions.
