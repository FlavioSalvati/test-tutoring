The percent yield of a chemical reaction is calculated by taking the actual yield, dividing it by the theoretical yield, and then multiplying the result by $100$.

In essence, percent yield serves as a measure of a reaction's efficiency. It assesses the amount of product that is actually produced (referred to as the actual yield) in comparison to the maximum amount that could have been produced under ideal conditions (known as the theoretical yield). The formula for calculating percent yield is expressed as:

$$
\text{Percent Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100
$$

The actual yield is the quantity of product obtained from the chemical reaction, typically determined through experimental methods or direct measurement. Conversely, the theoretical yield is derived from the stoichiometry of the reaction; it represents the maximum quantity of product that could be generated from the given reactants.

To calculate the theoretical yield, one must first know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. This equation allows for the determination of the mole ratio between reactants and products. By applying this ratio, you can ascertain the potential amount of product that could form if all reactants were completely converted.

Once both the actual and theoretical yields are known, you can compute the percent yield. This percentage provides insight into the efficiency of the reaction: a percent yield of $100\%$ indicates that the reaction was perfectly efficient, with all reactants transformed into products. In contrast, a lower percent yield suggests that some reactants were not fully converted.

In real-world applications, the percent yield is often less than $100\%$ due to several factors, including side reactions, incomplete reactions, or losses incurred during the purification process. Therefore, calculating the percent yield is crucial for assessing the success and efficiency of a chemical reaction.
