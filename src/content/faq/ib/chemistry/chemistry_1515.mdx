Alkali metals are stored under oil to prevent their reaction with oxygen and moisture in the air, which is crucial due to their high reactivity.

Alkali metals, including lithium ($\text{Li}$), sodium ($\text{Na}$), potassium ($\text{K}$), rubidium ($\text{Rb}$), cesium ($\text{Cs}$), and francium ($\text{Fr}$), possess a single electron in their outermost shell. This electron configuration makes them highly reactive, as they readily participate in chemical reactions, especially with oxygen and water vapor present in the atmosphere. If exposed to air, alkali metals can react violently, potentially resulting in combustion or even explosions.

To mitigate these hazards, alkali metals are stored under oil. This oil acts as a physical barrier, effectively isolating the metals from air and cutting off the supply of oxygen and moisture. This straightforward yet effective method helps prevent unwanted and dangerous reactions.

The type of oil used for storage may vary, but it is typically a hydrocarbon, such as paraffin oil. It is important to note that the oil itself does not react with alkali metals; instead, it serves solely as a protective layer, keeping the metals away from reactive substances in the air.

In laboratory settings, careful handling of alkali metals is essential. Even when stored under oil, they should be manipulated with non-metallic tools to avoid generating sparks that could ignite the metal. If an alkali metal ignites, it is critical not to extinguish the fire with water, as water can react violently with these metals. Instead, a Class D fire extinguisher, specifically designed for metal fires, should be employed.

In summary, storing alkali metals under oil is a vital safety measure due to their high reactivity. This practice effectively prevents contact with oxygen and moisture, thereby avoiding violent chemical reactions.
