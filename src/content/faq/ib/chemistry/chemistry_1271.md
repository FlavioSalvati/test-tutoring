The absolute configuration of a molecule, designated as either R or S, is fundamentally influenced by the spatial arrangement of atoms around a chiral center.

To determine the absolute configuration, we employ the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. These rules facilitate the assignment of a unique descriptor (R or S) to a chiral center, which is typically a carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups. The designation R, derived from the Latin word *rectus* meaning "right," and S, from *sinister* meaning "left," indicate the direction in which the plane of polarized light is rotated by the molecule.

The CIP rules specify that priorities are assigned to the atoms directly attached to the chiral center based on their atomic numbers. The atom with the highest atomic number is assigned the highest priority (1), while the atom with the lowest atomic number receives the lowest priority (4). In cases where two atoms share the same atomic number, priority is determined by examining the next atoms in the chain.

After establishing the priorities, the molecule is oriented so that the group with the lowest priority (4) is positioned away from the observer. If the remaining three groups arrange themselves in a clockwise order of decreasing priority, the configuration is designated as R. Conversely, if they decrease in priority in an anticlockwise direction, the configuration is designated as S.

It is crucial to understand that the absolute configuration (R or S) of a molecule is not directly indicative of its optical activity, which describes whether the molecule rotates plane-polarized light to the right (dextrorotatory, +) or to the left (levorotatory, -). A molecule with an R configuration can exhibit either dextrorotatory or levorotatory properties, and the same is true for a molecule with an S configuration. The relationship between the absolute configuration and the direction of rotation of plane-polarized light must be determined experimentally for each specific molecule.

In summary, the absolute configuration (R or S) of a molecule is defined by the spatial arrangement of atoms around a chiral center, as dictated by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. This configuration is a fundamental characteristic of the molecule and plays a critical role in its chemical behavior and biological activity.
