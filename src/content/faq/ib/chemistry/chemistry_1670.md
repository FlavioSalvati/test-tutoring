Metals are described as a lattice of positive ions in a sea of electrons due to their unique atomic structure.

In more detail, metals are composed of closely packed positive ions arranged in a regular pattern, forming a lattice structure. This is due to the fact that metals have few electrons in their outermost energy level, which they readily lose to become positively charged ions. These ions are then held together by the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between them, creating a rigid lattice structure.

The 'sea of electrons' refers to the delocalised electrons that are free to move throughout the entire structure. When a metal atom loses its outermost electrons, these electrons do not simply disappear. Instead, they become delocalised, meaning they are not associated with any one particular ion but are free to move throughout the entire metal structure. This sea of delocalised electrons is also known as the 'electron cloud'.

This unique structure of metals gives rise to their characteristic properties. The delocalised electrons allow metals to conduct electricity and heat, as these electrons can move and carry energy throughout the structure. The strong lattice of positive ions gives metals their strength and high melting and boiling points. The ability of the ions to slide over each other, while still being surrounded by the sea of electrons, gives metals their malleability and ductility, meaning they can be bent and stretched without breaking.

In summary, the description of metals as a lattice of positive ions in a sea of electrons is a way of explaining their atomic structure and the resulting physical properties. This model helps us understand why metals behave the way they do and why they are so useful in many areas of our lives.
