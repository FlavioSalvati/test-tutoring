The electron-sea model of metallic bonding offers a clear visualization of metal atoms as a lattice of positive ions enveloped by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons.

Also referred to as the free-electron model, this concept is essential for understanding the distinctive properties of metals. In this framework, metal atoms are depicted as closely packed, organized lattices of positive ions. These ions are created when metal atoms lose their valence electrons. Importantly, these lost electrons do not remain attached to any specific atom; rather, they become delocalised, allowing them to move freely throughout the entire metallic structure. This creates a 'sea' of electrons that surrounds and interacts with the positive ions.

This model effectively explains several characteristic properties of metals. For example, the presence of delocalised electrons enables metals to conduct electricity. When a voltage is applied, these free electrons can flow, facilitating the movement of electric charge. Similarly, metals are excellent conductors of heat because these delocalised electrons are also capable of transferring thermal energy.

Furthermore, the electron-sea model clarifies the malleability and ductility of metals. When external forces are applied, the layers of positive ions can shift relative to one another. The 'sea' of electrons that exists between these layers sustains the metallic bond, preventing the ions from repelling each other. This characteristic allows metals to deform without fracturing.

Additionally, the model accounts for the characteristic shiny appearance of metals. When light strikes the surface of a metal, the delocalised electrons absorb and re-emit the light, resulting in the metal's luster.

In conclusion, the electron-sea model provides a thorough explanation for the unique properties of metals. It conceptualizes metals as a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons, which are responsible for their conductivity, malleability, ductility, and lustrous appearance.
