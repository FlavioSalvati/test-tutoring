Bond length is influenced by the presence of multiple bonds, as these bonds are generally shorter and stronger than single bonds.

To elaborate, multiple bonding involves the sharing of more than one pair of electrons between two atoms. This sharing can take the form of double bonds, which involve two pairs of electrons, or triple bonds, which involve three pairs. The bond length, defined as the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms, is significantly affected by the nature of these bonds.

In a single bond, only one pair of electrons is shared between the atoms. In contrast, a double bond shares two pairs, and a triple bond shares three pairs. This increased sharing enhances the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nuclei of the atoms and the negatively charged electrons. As a result, this stronger attraction pulls the nuclei closer together, leading to a shorter bond length.

For example, consider the carbon-carbon bonds in ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$), ethene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$), and ethyne ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_2$). Ethane features a single bond, ethene has a double bond, and ethyne contains a triple bond. The bond length decreases from ethane to ethyne, with the bond in ethyne being the shortest. This trend occurs because the triple bond in ethyne involves more shared electron pairs, resulting in a stronger bond and consequently a reduced bond length.

Additionally, the types of atomic orbitals involved in bond formation contribute to the bond characteristics. In multiple bonds, both sigma ($\sigma$) and pi ($\pi$) bonds are present. A sigma bond is formed through the end-to-end overlap of atomic orbitals, while a pi bond results from side-to-side overlap. Sigma bonds are generally stronger and shorter than pi bonds. Nonetheless, the combination of a pi bond with a sigma bond in multiple bonds creates an overall stronger and shorter bond compared to a single bond.

In conclusion, multiple bonding affects bond length by enhancing the electrostatic attractions between the bonded atoms, resulting in bonds that are both shorter and stronger. This effect is driven by the number of shared electron pairs and the types of atomic orbitals involved in the bonding process.
