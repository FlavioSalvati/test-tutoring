Ionization energy generally increases across a period in the periodic table due to a rise in nuclear charge, accompanied by only a minimal increase in electron shielding.

To elaborate, ionization energy is defined as the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. As one moves from left to right across a period, the number of protons in the nucleus—referred to as the nuclear charge—increases. This growing positive charge results in a stronger attraction between the nucleus and the negatively charged electrons, making it more challenging to remove an electron. Consequently, this leads to an increase in ionization energy.

Simultaneously, although the number of electrons also increases, this addition is balanced by the increase in protons, ensuring the overall electrical neutrality of the atom. However, these extra electrons occupy the same energy level or shell, meaning that there is not a significant increase in shielding. Shielding refers to the ability of inner electrons to mitigate the attractive force exerted by the nucleus on the outer electrons.

The combined effect of increased nuclear charge and minimal enhancement in shielding creates a stronger attraction between the nucleus and the outer electrons. This enhanced attraction necessitates more energy to remove an electron, resulting in an increase in ionization energy across a period.

It is important to note, however, that there are exceptions to this general trend. For instance, ionization energy decreases slightly from beryllium ($\text{Be}$) to boron ($\text{B}$) and from nitrogen ($\text{N}$) to oxygen ($\text{O}$). This reduction can be attributed to the fact that in these specific cases, the added electron occupies a higher energy sub-level or pairs with another electron in an orbital, which slightly lowers the ionization energy. Nevertheless, the overarching trend across a period remains an increase in ionization energy.
