Entropy change is closely tied to phase transitions, with entropy generally increasing during these transitions.

To elaborate, entropy serves as a quantitative measure of the disorder or randomness within a system. During phase transitions—such as the transformation from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas—the system tends to exhibit greater disorder, which results in an increase in entropy. This phenomenon occurs because the particles in a gas or liquid have a more random arrangement compared to those in a solid, leading to a larger number of possible microstates (different ways the particles can be organized) in the liquid and gas phases.

For instance, consider the transition of water from ice (solid) to liquid water. In its solid state, the water molecules are arranged in a highly ordered lattice structure. However, when ice melts into water, the molecules gain the freedom to move, breaking free from their fixed positions. This increase in disorder signifies a rise in entropy.

The same principle applies to the transition from liquid to gas. In the gaseous phase, the particles are arranged even more randomly than in the liquid phase, resulting in an even higher entropy. This is why processes such as evaporation or boiling—where a liquid transforms into a gas—are associated with an increase in entropy.

It's also important to recognize that these phase transitions typically involve a change in heat, which can also influence the entropy of a system. When heat is supplied to a system, it elevates the kinetic energy of the particles, prompting them to move more vigorously and thereby increasing the system's disorder. This explains why phase transitions often require an input of heat (an endothermic process), as seen when ice melts or when water boils.

In summary, there is a strong connection between entropy change and phase transitions. During a phase transition, the system becomes more disordered, and this increase in disorder correlates with an increase in entropy. This concept is fundamental in thermodynamics and is essential for understanding a wide range of chemical reactions and processes.
