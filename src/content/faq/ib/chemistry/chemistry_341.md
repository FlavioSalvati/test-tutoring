Amines are categorized into primary, secondary, and tertiary amines based on the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or aryl groups.

Amines are organic compounds characterized by the presence of nitrogen atoms that possess a lone pair of electrons. They are derived from ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$) by substituting one or more of its hydrogen atoms with alkyl or aryl groups. The classification of amines—into primary, secondary, and tertiary—depends on how many hydrogen atoms from the ammonia molecule have been replaced by these groups.

**Primary Amines**  
Primary amines are compounds in which only one hydrogen atom has been replaced by an alkyl or aryl group. The general formula for primary amines is given by:

$$
\text{RNH}_2
$$

Here, $\text{R}$ represents the alkyl or aryl group. An example of a primary amine is methylamine ($\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2$), where a methyl group ($\text{CH}_3$) replaces one hydrogen atom in the ammonia molecule.

**Secondary Amines**  
In secondary amines, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. The general formula for secondary amines is:

$$
\text{R}_2\text{NH}
$$

In this case, each $\text{R}$ can denote an alkyl or aryl group, which may be identical or different. An example of a secondary amine is dimethylamine ($(\text{CH}_3)_2\text{NH}$), where two methyl groups have replaced two hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule.

**Tertiary Amines**  
Tertiary amines are characterized by the replacement of all three hydrogen atoms with alkyl or aryl groups. Their general formula is expressed as:

$$
\text{R}_3\text{N}
$$

Again, each $\text{R}$ can represent either an alkyl or aryl group, which can be the same or distinct. A notable example of a tertiary amine is trimethylamine ($(\text{CH}_3)_3\text{N}$), where three methyl groups have substituted all three hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule.

In summary, the classification of amines hinges on the number of hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule that are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. This classification is significant as it influences the physical and chemical properties of the amines, including their reactivity, boiling points, and solubility.
