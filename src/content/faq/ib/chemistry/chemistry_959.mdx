The overall order of a chemical reaction is calculated by summing the orders of all the reactants involved.

In a chemical reaction, the rate at which the reaction proceeds can be influenced by the concentrations of the reactants. This relationship is expressed in the rate equation, typically formulated as:

$$
\text{rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n
$$

In this equation, $A$ and $B$ represent the reactants, $m$ and $n$ denote the orders of reaction with respect to $A$ and $B$, respectively, and $k$ is the rate constant. The overall order of the reaction is given by the sum of $m$ and $n$.

The order of reaction for a specific reactant indicates how the reaction rate varies with changes in that reactant's concentration. For instance, if the order of reaction with respect to $A$ is $1$, then doubling the concentration of $A$ will result in a doubling of the reaction rate. If the order is $2$, then doubling the concentration of $A$ will quadruple the reaction rate. Conversely, if the order is $0$, the reaction rate remains constant regardless of changes in the concentration of $A$.

It is important to note that the orders of reaction do not necessarily correlate with the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. Instead, they must be determined experimentally by observing how the reaction rate changes as the concentrations of reactants are varied.

To find the overall order of a reaction, one adds together the individual orders of reaction for each reactant. For instance, if a reaction is first-order with respect to $A$ and second-order with respect to $B$, the overall order of the reaction is:

$$
1 + 2 = 3
$$

This indicates that if we double the concentrations of both $A$ and $B$, the reaction rate will increase by a factor of:

$$
2^3 = 8
$$

Understanding the order of a reaction is crucial as it enables us to predict how the reaction rate will change under varying conditions. This knowledge has significant implications across a range of practical applications, from industrial chemical processes to environmental chemistry.
