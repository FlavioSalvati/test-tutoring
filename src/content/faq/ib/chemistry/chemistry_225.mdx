Entropy changes in a chemical reaction can be determined by calculating the difference between the standard molar entropies of the products and the reactants.

To elaborate, the standard molar entropy, denoted as $S^\circ$, quantifies the randomness or disorder of a substance at a defined standard state, which is typically set at $25$ degrees Celsius and $1$ atmosphere of pressure. The units of standard molar entropy are joules per mole per kelvin (J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$). Generally, a higher standard molar entropy value indicates a greater degree of disorder within the substance.

To compute the entropy change ($\Delta S^\circ$) for a given chemical reaction, you must first obtain the standard molar entropies of all reactants and products involved. The entropy change can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta S^\circ = \Sigma S^\circ (\text{products}) - \Sigma S^\circ (\text{reactants}),
$$

where $\Sigma S^\circ (\text{products})$ is the total of the standard molar entropies of the products, and $\Sigma S^\circ (\text{reactants})$ is the total of the standard molar entropies of the reactants.

For instance, letâ€™s examine the reaction between hydrogen gas and iodine gas to produce hydrogen iodide gas:

$$
\text{H}_2(g) + \text{I}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{HI}(g).
$$

The standard molar entropies for $\text{H}_2$, $\text{I}_2$, and $\text{HI}$ are $130.7$, $116.1$, and $206.4$ J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, respectively. To find the entropy change for this reaction, we perform the following calculation:

$$
\Delta S^\circ = [2(206.4)] - [(130.7) + (116.1)] = 165.9 \text{ J mol}^{-1} \text{ K}^{-1}.
$$

It is crucial to understand the implications of the calculated entropy change. A positive $\Delta S^\circ$ value signifies an increase in disorder throughout the reaction, commonly observed in reactions where gaseous products are formed. In contrast, a negative $\Delta S^\circ$ value indicates a decrease in disorder, which typically occurs in reactions where gaseous reactants are consumed.

In summary, determining entropy changes based on standard molar entropies involves subtracting the total standard molar entropies of the reactants from those of the products. This calculation provides insight into the change in disorder that occurs during the chemical reaction.
