Fractional distillation is a process that separates the various components of crude oil based on their distinct boiling points.

Crude oil is a complex mixture primarily composed of hydrocarbons, each possessing its own unique boiling point. Fractional distillation takes advantage of this characteristic to effectively separate these components. The process begins by heating crude oil to approximately $350^\circ \text{C}$, which converts it into a vapor. This vapor is then introduced into a distillation column, commonly referred to as a fractionating column.

The fractionating column is a tall, cylindrical structure equipped with trays or plates. The temperature is higher at the bottom of the column and gradually decreases as one moves upwards. As the vapor ascends through the column, it cools down. When the temperature falls below the boiling point of a specific component, that component condenses back into a liquid and is collected on one of the trays; this liquid is referred to as a 'fraction'.

The fractions that are collected lower in the column, where the temperature is higher, consist of hydrocarbons with lower boiling points. These typically include gases such as methane, ethane, propane, and butane. In contrast, the fractions collected higher up in the column, where the temperature is lower, contain hydrocarbons with higher boiling points. These are usually liquids such as petrol (gasoline), kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil. At the very top of the column, where the temperature is at its lowest, the fractions consist of hydrocarbons with the highest boiling points, often resulting in solids such as bitumen, which is commonly used for road surfacing and roofing.

The crucial aspect of fractional distillation is the temperature gradient present within the column. This gradient enables each component to condense at its own specific position within the column, effectively segregating the crude oil into its individual constituents. The process is continuous, with fresh crude oil being introduced and the separated fractions being extracted in a steady manner.

In summary, fractional distillation separates the components of crude oil by heating the oil until it vaporizes, allowing the vapor to condense at varying temperatures within a fractionating column. The outcome is a series of fractions, each containing distinct types of hydrocarbons.
