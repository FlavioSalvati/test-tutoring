Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used to differentiate molecules based on their distinctive light absorption properties in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

This technique studies how molecules interact with radiation from the UV and visible light spectrum. Each molecule has a unique absorption profile that depends on its structural characteristics. This unique absorption spectrum acts like a molecular fingerprint, allowing for the identification of the substance.

The fundamental principle of UV-Vis spectroscopy is that when light is directed onto a molecule, the molecule can absorb energy from the light. This absorbed energy can promote electrons from a lower energy level to a higher energy level. The specific wavelength of light that a molecule absorbs is directly correlated with the energy required to excite an electron to a higher state. Consequently, different molecules, each with their own electron configurations, will absorb light at different wavelengths.

In a typical UV-Vis spectroscopy setup, a beam of light is divided into two equal paths. One path passes through the sample solution, while the other passes through a reference solution. The intensity of light in both beams is subsequently measured. The difference in intensity between the two beams quantifies the amount of light absorbed by the sample, which is then plotted against the wavelength of light to create an absorption spectrum.

The resulting absorption spectrum is unique to each molecule and serves as a valuable tool for identification. For instance, if you encounter an unknown sample, you can use UV-Vis spectroscopy to generate its absorption spectrum. By comparing this spectrum to established absorption spectra of known molecules, you can identify the unknown substance.

Moreover, UV-Vis spectroscopy is also instrumental in determining the concentration of a molecule within a solution. The amount of light absorbed by the solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species present. Therefore, by measuring the intensity of light absorbed, you can accurately ascertain the concentration of the molecule in the solution.
