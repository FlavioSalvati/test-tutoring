Esters undergo hydrolysis when they react with water, resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.

Esters are organic compounds derived from carboxylic acids. They are characterized by a carbonyl group ($\text{C}= \text{O}$) adjacent to an ether group ($\text{R}-\text{O}-\text{R}'$). Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction in which a molecule is cleaved into two parts by the addition of a water molecule. Specifically, when esters undergo hydrolysis, they yield a carboxylic acid and an alcohol as products.

The hydrolysis of esters can occur in two different environments: acidic and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is reversible. Here, the ester interacts with water in the presence of an acid catalyst, typically a strong acid such as sulfuric acid. The acid protonates the carbonyl carbon of the ester, enhancing its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack by a water molecule. This interaction forms a tetrahedral intermediate, which subsequently loses a proton, reverting to the carbonyl form and releasing an alcohol.

In contrast, under basic conditions, the hydrolysis of esters is an irreversible process known as saponification. In this scenario, the ester reacts with a hydroxide ion ($\text{OH}^-$) instead of a water molecule. The hydroxide ion functions as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the ester and forming a tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate then loses a proton to produce a carboxylate ion and an alcohol. The carboxylate ion can further react with a proton to yield a carboxylic acid.

Several factors influence the rate of ester hydrolysis, including the structure of the ester, temperature, and the pH of the solution. Generally, the reaction rate increases with rising temperature and pH. Additionally, the presence of a catalyst can significantly enhance the reaction rate.

In summary, esters undergo hydrolysis through reactions with water or hydroxide ions to produce a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. This process can take place under either acidic or basic conditions and is affected by various factors such as temperature, pH, and catalyst presence.
