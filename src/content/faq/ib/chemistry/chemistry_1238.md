The units of the rate constant for a zero-order reaction are expressed as concentration per time, commonly represented as $\text{mol/L路s}$ or $\text{M/s}$.

In a zero-order reaction, the rate remains constant and is independent of the concentrations of the reactants. This implies that the reaction proceeds at a uniform rate throughout its duration. The rate law for a zero-order reaction can be defined by the equation:

$$
\text{Rate} = k
$$

where $\text{Rate}$ denotes the reaction rate and $k$ signifies the rate constant.

The units of the rate constant $k$ are influenced by the order of the reaction. For zero-order reactions, the rate constant is measured in units of concentration per time. This is because the reaction rate is equivalent to the rate constant, and the rate is generally quantified by the change in concentration of the reactants or products over a unit of time. Thus, for a zero-order reaction, the rate constant is typically expressed as $\text{mol/L路s}$ or $\text{M/s}$, where $\text{mol/L}$ indicates moles per liter (a unit of concentration) and $\text{s}$ denotes seconds (a unit of time).

It is essential to recognize that the units of the rate constant vary depending on the order of the reaction. For first-order reactions, the units are expressed as $s^{-1}$ (per second), while for second-order reactions, the units are $\text{L/mol路s}$ or $\text{M}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$. This variation occurs because the rates of these reactions depend on the concentrations of the reactants raised to the power corresponding to the reaction's order. Conversely, in zero-order reactions, the rate is unaffected by reactant concentrations, leading to the straightforward units of concentration per time for the rate constant.

Grasping the units of the rate constant is vital for understanding the kinetics of a reaction and how the reaction rate varies with changes in reactant concentrations. This concept is fundamental in the study of chemical kinetics, which is an integral part of the IB Chemistry curriculum.
