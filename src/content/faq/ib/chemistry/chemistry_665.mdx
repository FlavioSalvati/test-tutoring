The standard enthalpy of formation for oxygen gas, denoted as $\Delta H_f^\circ$, is defined as zero. This value is established because oxygen, in its gaseous form ($\text{O}_2$), serves as the reference state for elements in their standard states.

The enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_f^\circ$, quantifies the energy change that occurs when one mole of a substance in its standard state is formed from its pure elements, also in their standard states. The standard state of a substance is defined as its most stable physical form at a pressure of $1$ bar and a specified temperature, typically $298.15$ K. For oxygen, this standard state is $\text{O}_2$ gas.

By convention, the standard enthalpy of formation for any element in its standard state is set to zero. This convention arises from the fact that no energy change is associated with the formation of an element that is already in its standard state, as there is no transformation required. This standardization allows for the comparison of the enthalpies of formation of various substances.

In the case of oxygen, this implies that the standard enthalpy of formation for $\text{O}_2$ gas is zero. It is important to clarify that this does not indicate that oxygen gas lacks energy; rather, it signifies that the energy of oxygen gas serves as our reference point. When we refer to the standard enthalpy of formation of another substance, we are indicating the energy change relative to the energy of the pure elements in their standard states.

To elaborate, the standard enthalpy of formation serves as a comparative tool for assessing the stabilities of different substances. A substance with a negative $\Delta H_f^\circ$ is considered more stable than the pure elements from which it is formed, as energy is released during its formation. Conversely, a substance with a positive $\Delta H_f^\circ$ is deemed less stable than its constituent pure elements, indicating that energy is absorbed during its formation.

In summary, the standard enthalpy of formation of oxygen gas is zero because $\text{O}_2$ is the baseline reference for elements in their standard states. This allows us to evaluate the enthalpy changes of other substances in relation to the stability of pure oxygen gas.
