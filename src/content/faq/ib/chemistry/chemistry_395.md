Iron plays a crucial role in hemoglobin molecules due to its ability to bind with oxygen, which facilitates the transport of oxygen throughout the body.

Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells and is essential for oxygen transport. Its structure is intricate, consisting of four protein chains, each containing a heme group. The heme group is the component that houses an iron atom, which is responsible for binding with oxygen.

The choice of iron in hemoglobin is attributed to its unique chemical properties. As a transition metal, iron can exist in various oxidation states. In hemoglobin, iron is primarily in the $Fe^{2+}$ state, which allows it to form a coordinate bond with oxygen. This interaction effectively 'grabs' the oxygen molecule and holds it in place. Importantly, this binding is reversible; when red blood cells reach areas in the body that require oxygen, the iron can release the oxygen molecule, making it available for cellular use.

Moreover, the iron atom in the heme group is coordinated to a nitrogen atom in a histidine residue of the protein chain. This histidine residue is vital for the binding and release of oxygen. When oxygen binds to the iron atom, it induces a slight conformational change in the hemoglobin molecule. This alteration is transmitted to the histidine residue, which subsequently triggers the release of oxygen.

In summary, the incorporation of iron in hemoglobin is fundamental for oxygen transport in the body. Its ability to form coordinate bonds with oxygen, along with its interaction with the histidine residue, enables hemoglobin to efficiently capture oxygen in the lungs and deliver it to the cells that require it. Without iron, this critical physiological process would not occur.
