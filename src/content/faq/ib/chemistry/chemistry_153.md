Certain compounds are classified as hypervalent because they contain atoms that form more bonds than what is typically predicted by the octet rule.

The term "hypervalent" refers to molecules and ions that consist of main group elements forming more bonds than the conventional number allowed by the octet rule. The octet rule posits that atoms achieve maximum stability when their outermost electron shell is filled, usually with eight electrons. Hypervalency is frequently observed in compounds containing elements such as silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine, among others.

The concept of hypervalency was first introduced in the early 20th century to explain the structures of certain compounds that appeared to contradict the octet rule. For instance, phosphorus pentachloride, denoted as $PCl_5$, is considered a hypervalent molecule because the phosphorus atom forms five bonds, leading to a total of ten valence electrons. According to the octet rule, phosphorus should only form three bonds, as it has five valence electrons and requires three additional electrons to achieve a complete octet.

Hypervalency is feasible due to the existence of empty $d$ orbitals in the third period and beyond of the periodic table. These $d$ orbitals can participate in bonding, enabling atoms to expand their valence shell and form more than four bonds. This phenomenon is often referred to as the "expanded octet" or "hypervalent" rule.

However, the notion of hypervalency has sparked debate among chemists. Some experts contend that invoking $d$ orbital participation is unnecessary for explaining the structures of hypervalent compounds. They propose that these structures can be adequately described through a combination of resonance and ionic structures, without needing to consider $d$ orbitals. Despite the ongoing controversy, the term "hypervalent" remains widely accepted in the field of chemistry to characterize compounds that form more bonds than would typically be anticipated according to the octet rule.
