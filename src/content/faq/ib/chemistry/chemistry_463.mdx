Catalysts influence the rate expression by modifying the rate constant without altering the order of the reaction.

A catalyst is a substance that accelerates a chemical reaction by offering an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. Importantly, catalysts are not consumed during the reaction, allowing them to be reused multiple times. The rate expression for a reaction is typically represented as:

$$
\text{rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n
$$

where $k$ is the rate constant, $[A]$ and $[B]$ are the concentrations of the reactants, and $m$ and $n$ are the orders of reaction with respect to those reactants. In this context, catalysts primarily influence the value of $k$.

The rate constant $k$ is indicative of the reaction speed and is dependent on temperature; it generally increases as temperature rises. This is because higher temperatures provide more molecules with the kinetic energy necessary to surpass the activation energy barrier of the reaction. When a catalyst is introduced, it reduces the activation energy, enabling more molecules to react at a given temperature. As a result, the value of $k$ increases, leading to an accelerated reaction rate. For more detailed information on how temperature and various factors affect reaction rates, additional resources are available.

It is crucial to understand that while catalysts alter the rate constant, they do not change the order of reaction. The order with respect to a specific reactant is determined by the reaction mechanism, particularly the number of molecules of that reactant involved in the rate-determining step. This aspect remains unaffected by the presence of a catalyst. Consequently, while the rate expression for a catalyzed reaction may exhibit a different value for $k$, its structure will remain consistent with that of the uncatalyzed reaction. For further exploration of how the rate constant and reaction mechanisms are quantitatively analyzed, additional discussions can be referred to.

In summary, catalysts enhance reaction rates by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, which increases the rate constant in the rate expression. However, they do not modify the order of reaction. Understanding how catalysts impact the rate expression is essential for predicting how changes in conditions will influence reaction rates. More information on how activation energy is modified can be explored in related resources, and the effect of activation energy on reaction rates is further detailed in dedicated sections.
