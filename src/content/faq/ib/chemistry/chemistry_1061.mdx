In mass spectrometry, isotopes are distinguished by their unique mass-to-charge ratios.

Mass spectrometry is a highly effective analytical technique used to determine the composition and quantity of chemicals in a sample by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio and abundance of gas-phase ions. This method is particularly valuable for differentiating isotopesâ€”atoms of the same element that possess different numbers of neutrons, resulting in varying atomic masses.

The process begins with the ionization of the sample. During this phase, the sample is bombarded with a stream of electrons, which knock off one or more electrons, thereby generating positive ions. These ions are then accelerated through an electric field, where they acquire the same kinetic energy. Subsequently, the ions enter a magnetic field, where they are deflected along a curved path. The degree of deflection is contingent upon the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions; lighter ions and those with higher charges experience greater deflection compared to heavier ions or those with lower charges.

This is where the differentiation of isotopes becomes significant. Isotopes of the same element will possess the same charge after ionization, as they have an identical number of protons. However, their masses differ due to the varying numbers of neutrons. Consequently, they will be deflected to different extents by the magnetic field, allowing for their separation and individual detection.

Upon reaching the detector, the ions generate an electric current. The strength of this current is directly proportional to the abundance of the ions, enabling the determination of the relative abundance of different isotopes. The results are displayed as a mass spectrum, which is a graph plotting intensity (relative abundance) against mass-to-charge ratio. Each peak in the spectrum represents an isotope, with the position of the peak indicating the mass-to-charge ratio (and thus the mass) of the isotope, while the height of the peak reflects its relative abundance.

In summary, mass spectrometry allows for the differentiation of isotopes based on their distinct mass-to-charge ratios, facilitating the identification and quantification of various isotopes within a sample.
