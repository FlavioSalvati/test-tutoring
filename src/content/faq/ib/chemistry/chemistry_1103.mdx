The +2 oxidation state is frequently observed in transition metals, primarily due to their ability to easily lose two $4s$ electrons.

Transition metals are located in groups 3 to 12 of the periodic table. These elements are distinguished by their capacity to form stable ions with a variety of oxidation states. The oxidation state of an atom represents the degree of oxidation, defined as the hypothetical charge an atom would possess if all bonds to atoms of different elements were considered to be 100% ionic.

Among transition metals, the most prevalent oxidation state is +2. This is largely attributed to the presence of two $4s$ electrons that can be readily removed. When electrons are added to transition metal atoms, the $4s$ orbital fills before the $3d$ orbital. However, during the ionization process, the $4s$ electrons are lost prior to the $3d$ electrons. This occurs because the $4s$ electrons are located at a greater distance from the nucleus and are, therefore, held less tightly. Consequently, it is energetically favorable for transition metals to lose these two $4s$ electrons, resulting in the formation of a +2 ion.

Moreover, the removal of two electrons to achieve a +2 oxidation state leads to a stable electron configuration. For many transition metals, this +2 state corresponds to a completely filled or half-filled $d$ subshell, configurations that are particularly stable due to favorable electron-electron interactions. This added stability further promotes the formation of +2 ions.

Additionally, the +2 oxidation state enables transition metals to create a wide range of complex ions and coordination compounds. These compounds often exhibit unique properties and play crucial roles in various fields of chemistry, including catalysis and biochemistry. The versatility associated with the +2 oxidation state significantly contributes to its common occurrence among transition metals.

In summary, the +2 oxidation state is prevalent among transition metals due to the ease of losing two $4s$ electrons, the stability of the resulting electron configuration, and the ability to form a diverse array of complex ions and coordination compounds.
