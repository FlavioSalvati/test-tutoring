Mass spectrometry is a sophisticated analytical technique used to determine the molecular weight of organic compounds by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of their ionized fragments.

This technique serves several purposes: it quantifies known materials, identifies unknown compounds within a sample, and elucidates the structures and chemical properties of various molecules. The overall process involves converting the sample into gaseous ions, which may or may not fragment, and characterizing these ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios (denoted as $m/z$) and relative abundances.

The first step in mass spectrometry is the ionization of the organic compound molecules. This process is accomplished by bombarding the sample with a beam of high-energy electrons. These electrons remove an electron from the sample molecules, resulting in the formation of positive ions. Often, these ions are unstable and can further fragment into smaller pieces, a phenomenon known as fragmentation.

Once ionized, the ions are accelerated by an electric field, which imparts kinetic energy that is proportional to their mass-to-charge ratio. Following this acceleration, the ions pass through a magnetic field that causes them to deflect. The degree of deflection is influenced by the ions' mass-to-charge ratios: lighter ions and those with a higher charge experience greater deflection than heavier ions or those with a lower charge.

After deflection, the ions reach a detector that measures the quantity of ions corresponding to each mass-to-charge ratio. This measurement produces a mass spectrum, which is a graph plotting intensity (the number of ions) against the mass-to-charge ratio. The molecular ion peak, which corresponds to the ion with the highest $m/z$ ratio, represents the molecular weight of the organic compound.

In summary, mass spectrometry determines the molecular weight of organic compounds through a series of steps: ionizing the molecules, accelerating the ions, deflecting them in a magnetic field, and detecting the ions. The resulting mass-to-charge ratios, as determined by their deflection and subsequent detection, provide the molecular weight of the compound.
