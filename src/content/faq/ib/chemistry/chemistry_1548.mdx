Transition metals are often characterized by their vibrant colors, which arise from their ability to absorb and re-emit light. In contrast, group 1 metals, also known as alkali metals, do not possess this capability.

The distinctive colors of transition metals can be attributed to their unique electronic configurations. These metals feature partially filled d-orbitals, which enable them to absorb specific wavelengths of light and subsequently re-emit it. When light interacts with a transition metal ion in a compound, the d-orbitals split into different energy levels. Electrons in the lower energy d-orbitals can absorb energy from incoming light, causing them to transition to higher energy levels. The energy difference between these levels corresponds to the energy of the absorbed light. The remaining light is then transmitted or reflected, resulting in the color that we perceive.

In contrast, group 1 metals do not exhibit this property. Their electronic configuration consists of a filled s-orbital and an empty p-orbital, with no partially filled d-orbitals. As a result, they are unable to absorb and re-emit light in the same manner as transition metals. Instead, they reflect all wavelengths of light, giving them a typical silvery-white or gray appearance.

Moreover, the color of transition metals can vary depending on their oxidation state, which affects the energy gap between the d-orbitals. For instance, vanadium can appear in different colors such as yellow, green, blue, or purple, depending on its oxidation state. This variability in color further distinguishes transition metals from group 1 metals, which typically exist in a single oxidation state, namely +1, under standard conditions.

In conclusion, the color of transition metals is a consequence of their unique electronic configurations, particularly the presence of partially filled d-orbitals that allow for the absorption and re-emission of light. In contrast, group 1 metals lack this ability due to their different electronic configurations, resulting in their characteristic silvery-white or gray appearance.
