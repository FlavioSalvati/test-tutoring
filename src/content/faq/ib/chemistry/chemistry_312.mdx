The Lucas test is a chemical procedure employed to differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols.

Named after Howard Lucas, who introduced the test in 1930, this method is both simple and effective for distinguishing among the three types of alcohols. The test relies on the reaction of alcohols with Lucas reagent, which consists of anhydrous zinc chloride dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid.

In the Lucas test, the alcohol is mixed with the Lucas reagent. The nature of the reaction varies depending on the type of alcohol present. Tertiary alcohols react almost instantaneously with the Lucas reagent, resulting in the formation of a cloudy solution or a distinct layer, which indicates the production of an alkyl chloride. Secondary alcohols, on the other hand, react more slowly, typically requiring heat to achieve a similar outcome. In contrast, primary alcohols do not react under standard conditions; they only undergo a reaction when heated.
