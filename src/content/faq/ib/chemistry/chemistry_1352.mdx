Combined spectroscopic data is instrumental in elucidating the structure of a compound by analyzing its infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry data.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is utilized to identify functional groups within a molecule. This technique operates by measuring the vibrations of various chemical bonds in response to infrared radiation. Each bond type absorbs infrared radiation at a specific frequency, resulting in distinct peaks on the IR spectrum. By comparing these observed peaks to known reference values, one can identify the functional groups present in the molecule.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides valuable insights into the carbon and hydrogen atoms within a molecule. In proton NMR ($^1H$ NMR), the spectrum reveals the different environments of hydrogen atoms. Each unique environment corresponds to a specific peak in the spectrum, while the area under each peak indicates the relative number of hydrogen atoms in that environment. Similarly, Carbon-13 NMR ($^{13}C$ NMR) functions to analyze carbon atoms. By carefully examining the NMR spectra, one can deduce the arrangement of atoms in the molecule.

Mass spectrometry (MS) offers information regarding the molecular weight of the compound and its fragmentation pattern. The molecular ion peak (denoted as $M^+$ peak) reflects the molecular weight of the compound. Additional peaks in the spectrum correspond to fragments of the molecule, which can provide critical clues about its structure. For instance, a peak at $m/z = 15$ suggests the presence of a methyl group ($CH_3$) in the compound.

By integrating the data obtained from these three spectroscopic techniques, one can reconstruct the structure of the compound. The IR spectrum is used to identify functional groups, the NMR spectra illustrate the arrangement of atoms, and the MS data reveals the molecular weight along with potential fragments. This analysis requires meticulous interpretation of the spectroscopic data; however, with practice, it becomes a powerful methodology for determining the structures of unknown compounds.
