Potential energy diagrams, also known as reaction progress diagrams, are essential tools for visualizing activation energies by graphically depicting the energy changes that occur during a chemical reaction. 

In these diagrams, the horizontal axis represents the progress of the reaction, while the vertical axis represents potential energy. The reactants and products of the reaction are indicated by specific points on the diagram. The difference in energy levels between these points reveals whether the reaction is exothermic, which releases energy, or endothermic, which absorbs energy.

The activation energy, denoted by the highest point on the diagram, corresponds to the peak of the energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to proceed. This peak is often referred to as the transition state or activated complex. The height of this peak, relative to the energy level of the reactants, clearly illustrates the amount of energy required to initiate the reaction.

Moreover, potential energy diagrams can also demonstrate the influence of catalysts on activation energy. Catalysts facilitate reactions by providing an alternative pathway with a lower energy barrier. In the diagram, this is represented by a lower peak, indicating that less energy is necessary for the reaction to occur.

In summary, potential energy diagrams offer a clear and intuitive means of understanding the concept of activation energy. By visualizing the energy changes throughout a reaction, these diagrams help students grasp the fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics more effectively.
