Enthalpy is a thermodynamic quantity that represents the total heat content of a system.

Symbolized as $ H $, enthalpy is a key concept in thermodynamics, the branch of physical science that explores the relationships between heat and various forms of energy. It is defined as the total heat content or the total energy of a system. As a state function, enthalpy's value depends solely on the current state of the system, rather than on the path taken to reach that state.

In the International System of Units (SI), enthalpy is typically measured in Joules (J). However, it can also be expressed in other units such as calories (cal), British thermal units (BTU), or kilowatt-hours (kWh). It is important to note that while the absolute value of a system's enthalpy cannot be directly measured, we can evaluate changes in enthalpy ($ \Delta H $) that occur during various processes, such as chemical reactions.

The change in enthalpy is a crucial concept in chemistry, especially when studying energy changes in chemical reactions. It helps to determine the heat absorbed or released during a reaction, which is essential for predicting whether a reaction is endothermic (absorbing heat) or exothermic (releasing heat).

In an exothermic reaction, the enthalpy of the products is lower than that of the reactants, resulting in a negative $ \Delta H $ and the release of heat. Conversely, in an endothermic reaction, the enthalpy of the products exceeds that of the reactants, leading to a positive $ \Delta H $ and the absorption of heat.

Understanding enthalpy and its changes is fundamental to studying energy transformations in chemical reactions. This knowledge is critical across various fields, including physical chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science.
