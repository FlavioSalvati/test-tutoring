Halogenoalkanes, commonly referred to as alkyl halides, are a class of organic compounds characterized by the replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms in an alkane with halogen atoms, which may include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The reactivity of halogenoalkanes can be attributed to the polar nature of the carbon-halogen bond, a result of the differing electronegativities between carbon and the halogen.

In halogenoalkanes, the carbon-halogen bond exhibits polarity because the halogen atom, being more electronegative than carbon, attracts the shared pair of electrons more strongly. This leads to a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$) on the halogen and a corresponding partial positive charge ($\delta^+$) on the carbon atom. The presence of this partial positive charge renders the carbon atom susceptible to attack by nucleophiles.

A nucleophile is a chemical species that is attracted to positively charged centers and has the ability to donate a pair of electrons, thereby forming a new covalent bond. In the context of halogenoalkanes, a nucleophile attacks the electron-deficient carbon, resulting in the displacement of the halogen atom in a reaction known as nucleophilic substitution. This type of reaction is the primary pathway through which halogenoalkanes react.

The reactivity of halogenoalkanes is also influenced by the specific halogen attached to the carbon atom. For instance, the carbon-fluorine bond is the strongest among halogen bonds due to the small atomic size and high electronegativity of fluorine, which makes fluoroalkanes the least reactive. Conversely, the carbon-iodine bond is the weakest, rendering iodoalkanes the most reactive. This trend in reactivity is often referred to as the "bond strength effect."

In addition to nucleophilic substitution, halogenoalkanes can undergo elimination reactions. In these reactions, both a halogen atom and a hydrogen atom are removed, resulting in the formation of an alkene. Such eliminations typically occur under conditions of elevated heat or in the presence of a strong base. The versatility of halogenoalkanes to participate in various types of reactions makes them invaluable tools in organic synthesis.
