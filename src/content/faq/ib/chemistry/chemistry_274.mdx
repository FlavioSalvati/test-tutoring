The molecularity of a reaction refers to the number of molecules or ions that participate in a single elementary reaction step.

In physical chemistry, the term 'molecularity' is specifically used to describe the count of molecules or ions that come together to react in one step of a reaction mechanism. This concept differs from the order of a reaction, which is determined experimentally and describes how the reaction rate depends on the concentrations of the reactants.

Molecularity can only take values of $1$, $2$, or $3$. 

- A reaction with a molecularity of $1$ is termed a **unimolecular reaction**. In this case, a single molecule or ion is involved. For instance, the isomerization of but-1-ene to but-2-ene exemplifies a unimolecular reaction.

- A reaction with a molecularity of $2$ is known as a **bimolecular reaction**. This type involves two molecules or ions. An example of a bimolecular reaction is the interaction between hydrogen and iodine, producing hydrogen iodide.

- A reaction with a molecularity of $3$ is referred to as a **termolecular reaction**. This reaction involves three molecules or ions. However, termolecular reactions are quite rare, as it is statistically unlikely for three particles to collide simultaneously with the correct orientation and sufficient energy. An example of a termolecular reaction is the combination of two molecules of nitric oxide with one molecule of oxygen to produce two molecules of nitrogen dioxide.

It is essential to understand that the molecularity of a reaction is derived from the reaction mechanism rather than from the overall balanced equation. As a theoretical concept, molecularity is always expressed as a whole number.
