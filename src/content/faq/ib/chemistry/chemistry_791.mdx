Precision in measurements is defined by the consistency or reproducibility of results obtained when the same measurement is repeated under identical conditions.

More specifically, precision refers to how closely two or more measurements align with each other, regardless of their accuracy. It serves as an indicator of the repeatability or reproducibility of an experimental or measurement process. In simpler terms, if you conduct the same experiment or measurement multiple times under the same conditions, high precision indicates that your results will be very similar or even identical on each occasion.

To assess the precision of a measurement, you typically perform the measurement several times and then calculate the standard deviation of your results. A smaller standard deviation signifies higher precision, as it indicates that the measurements are closely clustered around the mean value, demonstrating a high level of consistency.

Another method to evaluate precision is by calculating the percentage error of your measurements. This is achieved by subtracting the accepted value from the experimental value, dividing the difference by the accepted value, and then multiplying the result by $100$ to express it as a percentage. A smaller percentage error corresponds to greater precision, indicating that your measurements are closer to the accepted value.
