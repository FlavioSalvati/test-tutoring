The yield of a product in a chemical reaction can be quantified by comparing the actual amount produced to the theoretical amount predicted.

Specifically, the yield refers to the quantity of product that is actually generated when the reaction is performed. This amount is frequently less than the theoretical yield, which represents the maximum possible quantity of product that could be formed from a specified amount of reactants, based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. Yield is typically expressed as a percentage, with the actual yield serving as a percentage of the theoretical yield.

To calculate the yield, you begin by determining the theoretical yield. This involves utilizing the balanced chemical equation for the reaction, which specifies the ratio in which the reactants combine to produce the products. From this information, you can compute the expected amount of each product that should theoretically form from a given quantity of reactants.

Next, you conduct the reaction and measure the actual amount of product produced. The method of measurement will depend on the nature of the product. For instance, if the product is a solid, you can filter it from the reaction mixture and weigh it. If the product is a gas, you can collect it over water and measure its volume.

Finally, you compare the actual yield to the theoretical yield to determine the percentage yield. This calculation is performed by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and then multiplying by $100$. The resulting percentage yield provides insight into the efficiency of the reaction. A yield of less than $100\%$ indicates that some reactants did not convert into products, or that some of the product was lost during the isolation process.

In summary, determining the yield of a product involves three key steps: calculating the theoretical yield from the balanced chemical equation, measuring the actual yield, and comparing the two values.
