The molecularity of a reaction refers to the number of molecules or ions that participate in a single elementary reaction step.

To elaborate, the term 'molecularity' is used in physical chemistry to specify how many molecules or ions collide and react in one step of a reaction mechanism. This concept differs from the order of a reaction, which is determined experimentally and reflects how the reaction rate depends on the concentrations of the reactants.

Molecularity can only take on values of $1$, $2$, or $3$. 

- A reaction with a molecularity of $1$ is termed a **unimolecular reaction**. In this scenario, a single molecule or ion is involved. For instance, the isomerization of but-1-ene to but-2-ene is an example of a unimolecular reaction.

- A reaction with a molecularity of $2$ is classified as a **bimolecular reaction**. This type involves two molecules or ions. A classic example of a bimolecular reaction is the interaction between hydrogen and iodine to produce hydrogen iodide.

- A reaction with a molecularity of $3$ is referred to as a **termolecular reaction**. In this case, three molecules or ions participate in the reaction. Termolecular reactions are relatively uncommon because it is statistically unlikely for three particles to collide simultaneously with the appropriate orientation and sufficient energy. An example of a termolecular reaction is when two molecules of nitric oxide and one molecule of oxygen react to form two molecules of nitrogen dioxide.

It is essential to understand that the molecularity of a reaction is derived from its mechanism and not from the overall balanced equation. As a theoretical concept, molecularity is always represented as a whole number.
