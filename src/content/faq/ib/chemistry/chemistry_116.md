Coloured ions in transition metals arise from the absorption of light energy, leading to electron transitions within the metal's d-orbitals.

Transition metals are distinctive due to their partially filled d-orbitals, which house the electrons of the metal. When white light—comprising all the colours of the visible spectrum—shines on a transition metal ion, the ion absorbs certain wavelengths of this light energy. This absorbed energy facilitates the promotion of an electron from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher energy d-orbital. This phenomenon is referred to as an electron transition.

The colour we perceive is the complementary colour to the one absorbed by the ion. For instance, if a transition metal ion absorbs light in the blue region of the spectrum, it will appear orange to our eyes, as orange is the complementary colour to blue. This mechanism explains why transition metal ions can exhibit a wide range of colours.

The specific colour observed is influenced by the energy difference between the d-orbitals. This energy gap varies among different transition metals and is also affected by factors such as the oxidation state of the metal and the nature of the surrounding ligands. For example, copper(II) ions typically appear blue or green, while iron(III) ions are usually brown or orange.

It is important to note that not all transition metal ions exhibit colour. For an ion to display colour, it must have partially filled d-orbitals after the electron transition occurs. If the d-orbitals are either completely filled or completely empty, the ion will not absorb light, resulting in a colourless appearance.

In summary, the formation of coloured ions in transition metals is a result of electron transitions within the d-orbitals of the metal ions. The specific colour observed is determined by the energy differences between these orbitals, which can be influenced by factors such as the type of metal and its oxidation state.
