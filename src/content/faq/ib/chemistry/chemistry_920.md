Gibbs free energy is fundamentally influenced by the interactions between enthalpy and entropy changes within a system.

The change in Gibbs free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$, serves as an indicator of the maximum reversible work that a system can undertake at constant temperature and pressure. It is calculated using the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S,
$$

where $\Delta H$ represents the change in enthalpy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy.

Enthalpy ($H$) quantifies the total energy contained within a system. This includes both the internal energy (the energy necessary to form the system) and the energy required to make space for the system by displacing its surroundings. A negative change in enthalpy ($\Delta H < 0$) signifies an exothermic reaction, where heat is released, while a positive change in enthalpy ($\Delta H > 0$) indicates an endothermic reaction, where heat is absorbed.

Conversely, entropy ($S$) measures the degree of disorder or randomness within a system. A positive change in entropy ($\Delta S > 0$) signifies an increase in disorder, whereas a negative change in entropy ($\Delta S < 0$) indicates a decrease in disorder.

The relationship between these two factors—enthalpy and entropy—determines the Gibbs free energy change and, consequently, the spontaneity of a reaction. If $\Delta G$ is negative, the reaction is considered spontaneous; if $\Delta G$ is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous; and if $\Delta G$ equals zero, the system is in a state of equilibrium.

For instance, in an exothermic reaction characterized by a negative $\Delta H$ that also results in an increase in disorder (positive $\Delta S$), the Gibbs free energy change will be negative, indicating that the reaction is spontaneous. Conversely, if the reaction is endothermic (positive $\Delta H$) and leads to a decrease in disorder (negative $\Delta S$), the Gibbs free energy change will be positive, suggesting that the reaction is non-spontaneous.

In summary, the interplay between changes in enthalpy and entropy is essential for determining the Gibbs free energy change and thus the spontaneity of a reaction. A comprehensive understanding of this relationship is crucial for predicting the behavior of chemical systems.
