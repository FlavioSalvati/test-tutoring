Elements possess multiple ionisation energies due to the presence of several electrons, each requiring varying amounts of energy for removal.

Ionisation energy is defined as the energy necessary to detach an electron from an atom or ion. Each element features a distinct electron configuration, with electrons distributed across different energy levels or shells. The first ionisation energy is the energy required to remove the outermost electron, which is typically the easiest to remove since it is located furthest from the nucleus and experiences the least attraction from nuclear charge.

Once the first electron is removed, the atom transitions into a positive ion. This change in charge results in the remaining electrons being held more tightly by the nucleus, as they now experience a stronger positive charge. Consequently, the second ionisation energy—the energy required to remove the next electron—is always greater than the first. This pattern continues for subsequent electrons, with each successive ionisation energy being higher than the previous one.

The trend in increasing ionisation energy also correlates with the atom's electron configuration. For instance, electrons residing in the same shell tend to have similar ionisation energies because they are approximately equidistant from the nucleus. However, when an electron is extracted from a shell that is closer to the nucleus, there is a marked rise in ionisation energy due to the intensified nuclear attraction.

Moreover, ionisation energies can offer insights into an element's placement in the periodic table. Elements within the same group (a vertical column) share similar electron configurations, leading to comparable patterns in their ionisation energies. In contrast, as one moves across a period (a horizontal row), ionisation energies generally increase. This increase is attributed to the growing nuclear charge without a corresponding enhancement in the shielding effect from inner electrons.

In summary, elements exhibit multiple ionisation energies because they contain multiple electrons, each situated in different energy levels and subjected to varying degrees of nuclear attraction. These ionisation energies are significant as they reveal essential information about the element's electron configuration and its position within the periodic table.
