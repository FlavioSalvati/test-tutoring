Ionic compounds typically form between metals and non-metals as a result of the transfer of electrons from the metals to the non-metals.

To elaborate, the formation of ionic compounds is primarily based on the principle of achieving a stable electronic configuration. Metals, which are found on the left side of the periodic table, possess only a few electrons in their outermost shell. These outer electrons are held relatively loosely by the nucleus due to their greater distance from it. Consequently, metals tend to lose these outer electrons to attain a stable electronic configuration, similar to that of the closest noble gas. This process results in the formation of positively charged ions, known as cations.

Conversely, non-metals, located on the right side of the periodic table, have more electrons in their outermost shell, which is nearly filled. These elements tend to gain electrons to achieve a stable electronic configuration, akin to that of the nearest noble gas. This gain of electrons leads to the formation of negatively charged ions, referred to as anions.

When a metal reacts with a non-metal, the metal typically loses electrons while the non-metal gains these electrons. This transfer of electrons facilitates the formation of ions. The resulting cations and anions are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction, which leads to the creation of an ionic compound. This interaction is referred to as ionic bonding.

For instance, consider the formation of sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$). In this case, sodium (a metal) loses one electron to become a sodium ion ($\text{Na}^+$), while chlorine (a non-metal) gains that electron to become a chloride ion ($\text{Cl}^-$). The sodium and chloride ions are then held together by the strong electrostatic forces of attraction, resulting in the formation of the ionic compound sodium chloride.

In summary, the tendency of metals to lose electrons and non-metals to gain electrons—driven by the goal of achieving a stable electronic configuration—leads to the formation of ionic compounds between these elements.
