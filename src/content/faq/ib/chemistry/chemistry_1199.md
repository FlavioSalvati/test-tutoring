The rate expression for a chemical reaction is derived from experimental data by plotting the concentration of reactants against time and determining the order of the reaction.

More specifically, the rate expression describes how the reaction rate is influenced by the concentrations of the reactants. It typically takes the form:

$$
\text{rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n
$$

In this expression, $k$ represents the rate constant, while $[A]$ and $[B]$ denote the concentrations of the reactants. The parameters $m$ and $n$ correspond to the order of the reaction with respect to reactants $A$ and $B$, respectively.

To derive the rate expression from experimental data, you should conduct a series of experiments where you systematically vary the concentrations of the reactants and measure the corresponding reaction rates. By plotting the concentration of a reactant against time, you can analyze the resulting graph. If the graph is a straight line, it indicates that the reaction is first order with respect to that reactant. Conversely, if the graph exhibits a curved shape that can be linearized by taking the logarithm of the concentration, the reaction is second order with respect to that reactant. If there is no change in the reaction rate when the concentration of the reactant is altered, the reaction is classified as zero order with respect to that reactant.

Once the order of the reaction has been established for each reactant, you can formulate the rate expression. For instance, if the reaction is first order with respect to $A$ and second order with respect to $B$, the rate expression would be:

$$
\text{rate} = k[A][B]^2
$$

To determine the value of the rate constant $k$, you can substitute the measured concentrations and the reaction rate into the rate expression. This process should be repeated using several sets of experimental data to enhance accuracy. The average value of $k$ obtained from these calculations can then be incorporated into the final rate expression.

Understanding how to derive the rate expression from experimental data is a crucial skill in chemistry, as it serves as a valuable tool for predicting how the reaction rate will vary under different conditions.
