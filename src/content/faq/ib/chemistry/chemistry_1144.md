Some elements have the capacity to form multiple bonds due to their ability to share more than one pair of electrons in their outer electron shell.

The capability of an element to create multiple bonds is primarily influenced by its electron configuration, particularly the number of valence electrons it possesses. Valence electrons are those located in the outermost shell of an atom and play a crucial role in bonding with other atoms. Elements that have more than one valence electron can share multiple pairs of electrons, thereby enabling the formation of multiple bonds.

For example, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are notable elements that can form multiple bonds. Carbon, which has four valence electrons, is capable of forming four covalent bonds with other atoms. Nitrogen, with five valence electrons, can form three covalent bonds, while oxygen, with six valence electrons, can form two covalent bonds. These multiple bonds can occur either with the same atom, resulting in double or triple bonds, or with different atoms.

The formation of multiple bonds is further influenced by the concept of hybridization. In the case of carbon, for instance, the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals hybridize to produce four $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals, each capable of forming a single bond. However, under specific conditions, carbon can also undergo $sp^2$ or $sp$ hybridization, leading to the creation of double or triple bonds, respectively.

Moreover, the ability to form multiple bonds is not restricted to elements in the second period of the periodic table. Transition metals, for example, can also form multiple bonds thanks to the presence of $d$-orbitals. These $d$-orbitals can accommodate additional electrons, enabling transition metals to establish multiple bonds with other atoms.

In summary, the propensity of an element to form multiple bonds is primarily dictated by its electron configuration and the number of valence electrons it contains. Additionally, the concept of hybridization and the existence of $d$-orbitals in transition metals significantly contribute to the formation of multiple bonds.
