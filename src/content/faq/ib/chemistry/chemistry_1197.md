Enzymes play a vital role in biological systems by altering reaction mechanisms, primarily by lowering the activation energy and increasing the reaction rate.

Enzymes are biological catalysts that significantly influence the speed of chemical reactions within living organisms. They achieve this by providing an alternative pathway for the reaction that requires less energy to proceed. The activation energy, denoted as $E_a$, is the minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur. By decreasing this energy barrier, enzymes enable substrates— the reactants in enzymatic reactions— to more easily reach the transition state, leading to the formation of products and thereby accelerating the reaction rate.

This process, known as catalysis, occurs when enzymes bind to substrate molecules at a specialized region called the active site. The active site is uniquely structured to accommodate specific substrates, adhering to either the 'lock and key' model or the 'induced fit' model. In the lock and key model, the substrate fits precisely into the enzyme's active site, while in the induced fit model, the enzyme undergoes a slight conformational change to better fit the substrate.

Upon binding, the enzyme facilitates the breaking and forming of chemical bonds, resulting in the production of the final product. This facilitation often involves changes in the local environment surrounding the substrate, such as variations in pH or temperature, as well as the enzyme's direct involvement in the reaction.

Furthermore, enzymes can influence the reaction mechanism by determining the sequence in which reactants are added or products are released. This control is particularly crucial in multi-step reactions, where enzymes can dictate the order of reaction steps, ensuring that the overall process is executed efficiently and effectively.

In summary, enzymes modify reaction mechanisms in biological systems by lowering the activation energy, offering alternative reaction pathways, facilitating bond changes, and controlling the sequence of reaction steps. This enables biological systems to perform complex chemical reactions rapidly and efficiently, even at relatively low temperatures.
