Water is classified as a bent molecule due to the repulsive interactions between its two lone pairs of electrons and the bonding pairs that connect it to the hydrogen atoms. This repulsion results in a distinct bent shape.

The chemical formula for water is $H_2O$, indicating that it consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The oxygen atom is situated at the center, surrounded by the two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electrons. This configuration creates four regions of electron density around the oxygen atom. However, the molecular shape is influenced not only by the atoms involved but also by the arrangement of these electron pairs.

In the case of water, the two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom exert a repelling force on the bonding pairs of electrons that form the covalent bonds with the hydrogen atoms. Since electrons are negatively charged, they repel one another. Notably, the repulsion between lone pairs and bonding pairs is stronger than that between two bonding pairs. This difference arises because lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs; lone pairs are attracted to a single nucleus (the oxygen atom), whereas bonding pairs are attracted to two nuclei (the oxygen and the hydrogen atoms).

Consequently, the stronger repulsive forces from the lone pairs push the bonding pairs away, resulting in a bent or V-shaped molecular structure. This specific arrangement is referred to as 'bent' molecular geometry in the field of chemistry. The bond angle between the two hydrogen atoms in a water molecule is approximately $104.5$ degrees, which is notably less than the $109.5$ degrees that would be expected for a tetrahedral geometry. This deviation further supports the notion of repulsion caused by the lone pairs of electrons.

In summary, despite having four regions of electron density, water is classified as a bent molecule because the two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom repel the bonding pairs, leading to a characteristic bent shape. This concept is fundamental in the study of molecular geometry within chemistry.
