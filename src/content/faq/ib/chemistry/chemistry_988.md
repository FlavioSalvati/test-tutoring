The rate of a first-order reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant.

In a first-order reaction, the reaction rate depends solely on the concentration of a single reactant. This means that if the concentration of the reactant is doubled, the reaction rate will also double. The relationship is mathematically expressed by the rate equation:

$$
\text{rate} = k[A]
$$

In this equation, $\text{rate}$ represents the rate of the reaction, $k$ is the rate constant, and $[A]$ denotes the concentration of the reactant.

The rate constant $k$ is a proportionality constant that is specific to a given reaction at a particular temperature. It is important to understand that while the rate constant remains unchanged with varying concentrations of the reactant, it is influenced by temperature variations. Thus, in a first-order reaction, the reaction rate can be manipulated by adjusting either the concentration of the reactant or the temperature.

The direct proportionality between the reaction rate and the concentration of the reactant can be visualized graphically. When you plot the concentration of the reactant against time, you will observe a downward-sloping curve, indicating that the concentration of the reactant decreases over time. Conversely, if you plot the natural logarithm of the reactant's concentration against time, the resulting graph will be a straight line. This linear relationship further illustrates that the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant.

In summary, the concentration of the reactant is a critical factor in determining the rate of a first-order reaction. By adjusting the concentration of the reactant, one can effectively control the reaction rate. This principle is widely applied in the chemical industry to manage the rates of various chemical reactions.
