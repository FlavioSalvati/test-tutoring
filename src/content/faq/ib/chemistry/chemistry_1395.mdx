### Understanding Actual Yield vs. Theoretical Yield

In the context of chemical reactions, **actual yield** refers to the amount of product that is actually obtained, while **theoretical yield** represents the maximum possible amount of product predicted based on stoichiometric calculations.

**Actual Yield**  
The actual yield is the quantity of product collected at the end of a chemical reaction. This value is often less than the theoretical yield due to several factors, such as incomplete reactions, the loss of product during purification, or the occurrence of side reactions. Typically, the actual yield is determined through experimental procedures and is expressed in units of grams or moles.

**Theoretical Yield**  
Conversely, the theoretical yield is defined as the maximum amount of product that can be generated from a specific amount of reactants, as predicted by the balanced chemical equation. This yield is calculated using stoichiometry, which examines the quantitative relationships between the reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction. The theoretical yield is considered an ideal figure, assuming that all reactants are fully converted into products without any losses or side reactions.

**Percent Yield**  
The difference between actual yield and theoretical yield can be expressed as a percentage, known as the **percent yield**. This is calculated using the formula:

$$ 
\text{Percent Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100 
$$

Percent yield serves as a measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction; a higher percent yield indicates a more efficient reaction process.

### Summary
In conclusion, the actual yield signifies the quantity of product that is produced during a chemical reaction, whereas the theoretical yield indicates the maximum potential product based on stoichiometric calculations. The discrepancy between these two figures provides important insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the chemical reaction being studied.
