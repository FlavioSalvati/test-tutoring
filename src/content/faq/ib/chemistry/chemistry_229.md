During the isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the entropy of the system increases due to a rise in the disorder of the gas.

In an isothermal process, the temperature of the gas remains constant. This constant temperature is maintained by adding heat to the system, which compensates for the work done by the gas as it expands. According to the ideal gas law, the relationship among pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), number of moles of gas ($n$), the gas constant ($R$), and temperature ($T$) is given by the equation:

$$
PV = nRT.
$$

Since the temperature is constant during an isothermal expansion, any increase in volume ($V$) must be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in pressure ($P$).

Entropy is a quantitative measure of the disorder or randomness within a system. For an ideal gas, the entropy ($S$) is proportional to the natural logarithm of the volume. Thus, as the volume of the gas increases during expansion, the entropy also increases. This happens because the gas molecules have more space to move around, resulting in a larger number of possible microstates, which are different ways the gas molecules can be arranged.

The change in entropy ($\Delta S$) during an isothermal expansion can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta S = nR \ln \left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right),
$$

where $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy, $n$ is the number of moles of gas, $R$ is the gas constant, $V_f$ is the final volume, and $V_i$ is the initial volume. This equation indicates that the change in entropy is positive when the final volume ($V_f$) exceeds the initial volume ($V_i$), which is characteristic of an expansion process.

In conclusion, the entropy of an ideal gas increases during an isothermal expansion. This increase occurs because the gas molecules gain more space for movement, leading to a higher number of possible microstates. Consequently, this rise in entropy reflects a greater degree of disorder or randomness within the gas.
