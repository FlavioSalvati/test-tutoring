Gibbs free energy is classified as a state function, which means that its value is determined solely by the current state of a system, rather than its history.

To elaborate, a state function is a property of a system that is dependent only on its present equilibrium state, not on the sequence of events that led to that state. Consequently, the value of a state function is influenced only by current conditions such as temperature, pressure, and composition, rather than the specific process or pathway that the system followed to achieve those conditions.

Gibbs free energy, denoted as $G$, is a thermodynamic potential that quantifies the maximum reversible work a system can perform while maintaining constant temperature and pressure. It is defined by the equation:

$$
G = H - TS
$$

where $H$ represents the enthalpy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $S$ is the entropy of the system. Both enthalpy and entropy are state functions, and their difference, Gibbs free energy, is also a state function.

The change in Gibbs free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$, for a given process can be expressed as:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

In this equation, $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ are the changes in enthalpy and entropy, respectively, both of which are state functions. This relationship implies that the value of $\Delta G$ depends only on the initial and final states of the system, rather than the specific pathway taken to transition between these states.

In practical terms, this property allows us to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy for a process if we know the initial and final states of the system, independent of the specific steps involved. This characteristic is particularly valuable in chemistry, as it enables us to determine the energy changes associated with chemical reactions, phase transitions, and other processes solely based on the initial and final states of the system.
