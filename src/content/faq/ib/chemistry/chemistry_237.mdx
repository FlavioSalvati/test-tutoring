The Gibbs free energy change, denoted as $\Delta G$, is zero at equilibrium since there is no net change occurring within the system.

To elaborate, the Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) is a thermodynamic potential that quantifies the maximum reversible work a system can perform while maintaining constant temperature and pressure. It serves as a key indicator for determining the spontaneity of a reaction: if $\Delta G$ is negative, the reaction is spontaneous; if positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous; and if zero, the system is at equilibrium.

At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, resulting in no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products. This condition explains why $\Delta G$ is zero at equilibrium, indicating the system is at maximum stability and cannot perform additional work. This principle is fundamental in thermodynamics.

The relationship between Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy is encapsulated in the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

where $\Delta H$ represents the change in enthalpy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\Delta S$ denotes the change in entropy. At equilibrium, since $\Delta G$ equals zero, it follows that:

$$
\Delta H = T \Delta S
$$

This relationship implies that the available energy for work (enthalpy) is being utilized to increase the disorder (entropy) of the system.

In the realm of chemical reactions, the Gibbs free energy change offers crucial insights into the feasibility and direction of a reaction. A reaction will proceed in the direction that minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the system. At equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy is at its lowest point, indicating that the reaction does not favor either the forward or reverse direction.

In summary, the Gibbs free energy change is zero at equilibrium because the system achieves a state of maximum stability with no net changes occurring. This concept is vital in thermodynamics and essential for understanding the behavior of chemical reactions.
