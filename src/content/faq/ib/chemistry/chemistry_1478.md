Hund's Rule is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that describes how electrons populate orbitals within an atom. This rule asserts that electrons will occupy separate orbitals of equal energy before they begin to pair up in the same orbital.

Named after the German physicist Friedrich Hund, who formulated the principle in 1927, Hund's Rule is closely related to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in an atom can possess the same set of quantum numbers, meaning each electron must have a unique set of characteristics defined by its energy level, orbital shape, orbital orientation, and spin direction.

According to Hund's Rule, when electrons are added to a set of degenerate (equal energy) orbitals, they will first fill these orbitals singly, with their spins oriented in the same direction (parallel spins), before any pairing occurs. This behavior is due to the repulsive forces between negatively charged electrons. By occupying separate orbitals, the electrons can minimize their mutual repulsion, thereby lowering the overall energy of the atom. Only after all degenerate orbitals are half-filled will electrons begin to pair up, and when they do, the paired electrons in the same orbital must have opposite spins, in accordance with the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

Hund's Rule is especially valuable for predicting the electron configuration of atoms, which is essential for understanding their chemical behavior. For instance, in a carbon atom, which contains six electrons, the first two electrons fill the $1s$ orbital, the next two occupy the $2s$ orbital, and the remaining two electrons each occupy one of the three $2p$ orbitals. This arrangement leads to a half-filled $2p$ subshell, enabling carbon to form multiple covalent bonds.

In summary, Hund's Rule is a key concept in atomic theory that elucidates the distribution of electrons across an atom's orbitals. It serves as a foundational principle for understanding the electron configurations of atoms and their corresponding chemical properties.
