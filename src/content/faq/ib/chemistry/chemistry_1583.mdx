Acidic oxides react with water to produce acids, while basic oxides react with water to form bases.

**Acidic Oxides:**  
Acidic oxides, often referred to as acid anhydrides, are primarily non-metal oxides. When these oxides react with water, they generate their corresponding acids. For example, sulfur trioxide ($\text{SO}_3$) is classified as an acidic oxide. The reaction of sulfur trioxide with water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) results in the formation of sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$). This can be illustrated by the following chemical equation:

$$
\text{SO}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4
$$

This reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. The acids produced from these reactions are typically strong acids, characterized by their ability to fully ionize in water.

**Basic Oxides:**  
Conversely, basic oxides, known as base anhydrides, are generally metal oxides. When these oxides interact with water, they yield their corresponding bases. For instance, sodium oxide ($\text{Na}_2\text{O}$) is a basic oxide that reacts with water to produce sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$). This reaction can be represented by the following equation:

$$
\text{Na}_2\text{O} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2\text{NaOH}
$$

Similar to acidic oxides, this reaction is also exothermic, and the resulting bases are typically strong bases that fully ionize in water.

**Amphoteric Oxides:**  
It is important to recognize that not all oxides react with water. Some oxides, such as aluminum oxide ($\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$) and zinc oxide ($\text{ZnO}$), exhibit amphoteric properties, meaning they can act as either acidic or basic oxides. These amphoteric oxides can react with both acids and bases to produce salts and water. For example, aluminum oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid (a strong acid) to form aluminum chloride (a salt) and water. Similarly, it can react with sodium hydroxide (a strong base) to yield sodium aluminate (a salt) and water.

**Conclusion:**  
In summary, the reactions of oxides with water are fundamental concepts in chemistry that enhance our understanding of the behaviors of various substances in aqueous solutions, as well as the characteristics of acids and bases.
