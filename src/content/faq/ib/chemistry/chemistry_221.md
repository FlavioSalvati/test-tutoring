The entropy of gases is typically greater than that of solids or liquids, primarily due to the increased randomness and disordered motion of gas particles.

Entropy is defined as a measure of the disorder or randomness within a system. In thermodynamics, it is often linked to the number of possible arrangements of particles in that system. The greater the number of arrangements, the higher the entropy value.

In solids, particles are closely packed in a regular, ordered structure. They vibrate around fixed positions but are unable to move freely. As a result, there are relatively few ways for these particles to be arranged, leading to a low entropy level.

In liquids, although the particles remain in close proximity, they can move more freely, allowing them to slide past one another. This increased mobility results in a greater number of possible arrangements compared to solids, which means the entropy of liquids is higher than that of solids, yet still lower than that of gases.

In contrast, in gases, particles are spaced far apart and can move freely in all directions. This significant freedom of movement creates a vast number of potential arrangements for the particles, resulting in the highest entropy among the three states of matter.

Additionally, gases possess more energy than solids or liquids at the same temperature. The particles in a gas move more quickly and in a greater range of directions, which enhances the randomness and disorder within the system.

Moreover, gases are more compressible than solids or liquids. When a gas is compressed, the particles are forced closer together, which reduces the number of possible arrangements and, consequently, lowers the entropy. However, under typical conditions, gas particles remain widely spaced, contributing to a high degree of randomness and disorder.

Finally, the entropy of a system is also influenced by the number of particles present. For a given amount of substance, a gas will generally have a greater number of particles compared to a solid or liquid, owing to the lower density of gases. This increased number of particles further enhances the potential arrangements and, in turn, increases the entropy.

In summary, the entropy of gases is greater than that of solids or liquids due to their higher levels of randomness and disorder, increased energy, higher compressibility, and larger particle count.
