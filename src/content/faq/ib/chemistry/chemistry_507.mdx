A thioester can be synthesized from an ester by reacting it with a thiol in the presence of a base.

In more detail, the synthesis of a thioester from an ester involves a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. This type of organic reaction features a nucleophile (in this case, a thiol) that displaces a leaving group (here, an alkoxide) on the acyl carbon. The reaction is facilitated by a base, which deprotonates the thiol, enhancing its nucleophilicity.

The initial step of the reaction is the deprotonation of the thiol by the base, resulting in the formation of a thiolate ion. This thiolate ion is a significantly stronger nucleophile than the original thiol. Subsequently, the thiolate ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate then collapses, expelling the alkoxide ion as a leaving group and yielding the thioester.

The reaction can be summarized with the following equation:

$$
R\text{-}COO\text{-}R' + HS\text{-}R'' \rightarrow R\text{-}COS\text{-}R'' + ROH
$$

where $R$, $R'$, and $R''$ represent alkyl or aryl groups. The base utilized in this reaction can vary, with common options including sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$) or potassium hydroxide ($\text{KOH}$).

It is crucial to control the reaction conditions meticulously. The reaction should be conducted in an aprotic solvent to prevent the protonation of the thiolate ion, which would inhibit the reaction. Additionally, it is essential to carry out the reaction under anhydrous conditions to avoid hydrolysis of the ester.

In summary, the preparation of a thioester from an ester entails a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, where a thiol replaces an alkoxide on an acyl carbon. A base facilitates this process by deprotonating the thiol, thereby increasing its nucleophilicity. Careful control of the reaction conditions is necessary to ensure the desired outcome of the reaction.
