The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution illustrates the proportion of particles that possess sufficient energy to surpass the activation energy required for a chemical reaction.

This distribution serves as a statistical representation of the energies of a large number of particles in a gas at a specific temperature. It indicates the likelihood of a particle having a particular energy level. The shape of the distribution curve is right-skewed, which signifies that while most particles have moderate energies, there are fewer particles with high energies, and an even smaller number with extremely high energies.

The area under the curve corresponds to the total number of particles in the system. Specifically, the area to the right of the activation energy ($E_a$) line indicates the fraction of particles that possess enough energy to participate in a reaction. This concept is vital for understanding reaction rates, as only those particles with energy equal to or greater than the activation energy can react upon collision.

As the temperature increases, the peak of the distribution shifts to the right and the curve flattens. This change signifies that a larger proportion of particles now have energy levels that meet or exceed the activation energy. As a result, the rate of reaction increases because more collisions lead to successful reactions.

In summary, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a visual framework for understanding the energy distribution of particles within a system. It elucidates the reason why raising the temperature enhances the reaction rate: it increases the fraction of particles with adequate energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. This principle is fundamental to the field of chemical kinetics, which focuses on the study of reaction rates.
