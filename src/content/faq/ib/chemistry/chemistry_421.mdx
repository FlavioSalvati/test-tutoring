The formal charge of an atom within a molecule is calculated by taking the total number of valence electrons, subtracting the number of non-bonding electrons, and then subtracting half the number of bonding electrons. 

To elaborate on this process, the formal charge can be understood as a hypothetical charge that an atom would possess if all electrons in the molecule were shared equally among the atoms. The formal charge is determined using the following formula:

$$
\text{Formal Charge} = \text{Valence Electrons} - \text{Non-Bonding Electrons} - \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Bonding Electrons}
$$

**Definitions:**

- **Valence Electrons**: These are the electrons located in the outermost shell of an atom that participate in chemical bonding.
- **Non-Bonding Electrons**: Also referred to as lone pairs, these are electrons that do not participate in bonding.
- **Bonding Electrons**: These electrons are involved in the formation of bonds between atoms. In the context of bonds, we have:
  - A single bond contains $2$ bonding electrons.
  - A double bond contains $4$ bonding electrons.
  - A triple bond contains $6$ bonding electrons.
  
However, since bonding electrons are shared between two atoms, each atom only counts half of these electrons when calculating its formal charge.

**Calculation Steps:**

1. **Identify Valence Electrons**: Determine the number of valence electrons for the atom in question, which can be found on the periodic table. For instance, carbon, located in group $14$, has $4$ valence electrons.

2. **Count Non-Bonding Electrons**: Count the non-bonding electrons, which are typically represented as dots in Lewis structures.

3. **Count Bonding Electrons**: Assess the bonding electrons by counting the total involved in bonds with other atoms, remembering to take only half for the formal charge calculation.

4. **Calculate Formal Charge**: Use the formula to subtract the non-bonding electrons and half the bonding electrons from the total number of valence electrons.

It is important to note that the sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule or ion must equal the overall charge of that molecule or ion. This relationship serves as a useful check for ensuring the accuracy of your calculations.

Understanding formal charge is essential for predicting the structure and reactivity of molecules, making it a fundamental concept in the field of chemistry.
