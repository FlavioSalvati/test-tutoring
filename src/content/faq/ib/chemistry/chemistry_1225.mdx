Not all collisions between reactant molecules lead to the formation of products, primarily because the molecules may lack the required energy or the correct orientation.

In a chemical reaction, reactant molecules must collide with one another with sufficient energy and in the appropriate orientation for a successful reaction to occur. This concept is encapsulated in the collision theory. However, it is important to note that not all collisions result in a reaction, and there are two main reasons for this.

First, the colliding molecules must possess enough kinetic energy to surpass the activation energy barrier. The activation energy, denoted as $E_a$, is the minimum amount of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactant molecules so that new bonds can form in the product molecules. If the colliding molecules do not have energy equal to or greater than $E_a$, the reaction will not take place, regardless of whether the molecules collide. The proportion of molecules that have sufficient energy to react depends on the temperature; at higher temperatures, a greater number of molecules possess the necessary energy, resulting in an increased reaction rate.

Second, the molecules must collide in the correct orientation for a successful reaction to occur. This requirement arises because only specific parts of the molecules—typically the reactive sites—are involved in the reaction. If these reactive sites do not come into contact during the collision, the reaction will not occur. This is particularly relevant in complex molecules, where the reactive site may be obstructed by other structural components.

Moreover, even when molecules collide with adequate energy and the correct orientation, there remains a probabilistic factor. Not every collision, even under ideal conditions, will lead to a reaction. This uncertainty is attributed to quantum mechanical effects, which introduce an element of randomness into the reaction process.

In summary, while collisions between reactant molecules are essential for a chemical reaction to occur, they are insufficient on their own. The molecules must have enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier and must collide in the correct orientation. Even in ideal circumstances, not every collision will result in a reaction due to the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.
