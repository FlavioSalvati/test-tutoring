Carboxylic acids are classified as weak acids because they only partially ionize in water, thereby releasing a limited number of hydrogen ions.

Carboxylic acids, including acetic acid and formic acid, are organic compounds characterized by the presence of a carboxyl group (-COOH). This functional group consists of a carbon atom that is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH). The acidic properties of carboxylic acids arise from this carboxyl group.

When a carboxylic acid is dissolved in water, it can donate a proton ($\text{H}^+$) from the hydroxyl group to a water molecule. This process generates a hydronium ion ($\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$) and a carboxylate ion ($\text{RCOO}^-$). The reaction is reversible, establishing an equilibrium between the reactants and products. However, not all molecules of the carboxylic acid will lose a proton; only a small fraction will do so. This incomplete ionization is what classifies carboxylic acids as weak acidsâ€”indicating they do not fully ionize in solution.

The strength of an acid is determined by the degree of its ionization in water. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$), fully ionize, releasing all their hydrogen ions. In contrast, weak acids only partially ionize, releasing some but not all of their hydrogen ions. In these cases, the equilibrium shifts to the left, indicating that there are more un-ionized acid molecules than ionized ones.

The partial ionization of carboxylic acids can be represented by the following equilibrium expression:

$$
\text{HA} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^-
$$

In this expression, $\text{HA}$ denotes the carboxylic acid, $\text{H}^+$ represents the hydrogen ion, and $\text{A}^-$ is the carboxylate ion. The equilibrium constant for this reaction, denoted as $K_a$, serves as an indicator of the acid's strength. A lower $K_a$ value signifies a weaker acid.

In summary, carboxylic acids are considered weak acids because they only partially ionize in water, releasing only a fraction of their hydrogen ions. This behavior can be attributed to the equilibrium nature of the ionization process, where the equilibrium position favors the un-ionized form of the acid.
