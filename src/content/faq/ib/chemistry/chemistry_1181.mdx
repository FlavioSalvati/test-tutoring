The Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G$) is zero at equilibrium, signifying that there is no net change occurring within the system.

To elaborate, the Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) is a thermodynamic potential that quantifies the maximum reversible work that a system can perform when held at constant temperature and pressure. It serves as a crucial indicator for predicting whether a reaction will occur spontaneously. Specifically, if $\Delta G$ is negative, the reaction is spontaneous; if it is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous; and if it is zero, the system has reached equilibrium.

At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, resulting in no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products. This explains why $\Delta G$ is zero at this state: the system achieves maximum stability, and no additional work can be performed. This principle is fundamental to the study of thermodynamics.

The relationship between Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy is expressed by the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

where $\Delta H$ represents the change in enthalpy, $T$ denotes the absolute temperature, and $\Delta S$ indicates the change in entropy. At equilibrium, the condition $\Delta G = 0$ leads to the conclusion that $\Delta H = T \Delta S$. This relationship implies that the energy available for work (enthalpy) is being utilized to increase the disorder (entropy) within the system.

In the context of chemical reactions, the change in Gibbs free energy provides essential insights into the feasibility and direction of the reaction. A reaction will tend to progress in the direction that minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the system. At equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy reaches its minimum value, indicating that the reaction will not spontaneously shift in either direction.

In summary, the Gibbs free energy change is zero at equilibrium due to the system's state of maximum stability, characterized by the absence of net changes. This concept is pivotal in thermodynamics and is essential for comprehending the behavior of chemical reactions.
