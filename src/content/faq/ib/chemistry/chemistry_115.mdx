The atomic radii of transition metals typically decrease as one moves across the periodic table from left to right, primarily due to the increasing nuclear charge.

As we progress across the periodic table, particularly through groups 3 to 12 where the transition metals are located, the atomic radii show a general decreasing trend. This phenomenon is largely attributed to the rise in nuclear charge, which pulls electrons closer to the nucleus, thereby reducing the atomic radius. Although this trend is less pronounced compared to the main group elements, it remains observable.

Transition metals possess partially filled $d$ orbitals. As we move from left to right within a period, electrons are added incrementally to these $d$ orbitals, while protons are simultaneously added to the nucleus. The resultant increase in nuclear charge exerts a stronger attractive force on the electrons, drawing them nearer to the nucleus and leading to a reduction in atomic radius.

However, the decrease in atomic radius among transition metals is not as significant as that observed in the main group elements. This is due, in part, to a shielding effect. The inner electrons effectively shield the outer electrons from experiencing the full impact of the nuclear charge, which mitigates the decrease in atomic radius.

Moreover, $d$ orbitals are more diffuse than $s$ and $p$ orbitals, extending further from the nucleus. This characteristic also contributes to a less pronounced reduction in atomic radius across the transition metals.

It is important to note that there are exceptions to this general trend. For instance, the atomic radii of elements in the second and third transition series do not always exhibit a consistent decrease across the period. This anomaly can be attributed to the lanthanide contraction, a phenomenon whereby the $4f$ electrons in the lanthanides fail to shield the increasing nuclear charge as effectively as anticipated, resulting in smaller atomic radii.

In conclusion, while the atomic radii of transition metals generally decrease across the periodic table due to the increasing nuclear charge, this trend is influenced by additional factors such as the shielding effect and the more diffuse nature of the $d$ orbitals, making it less straightforward than the trends observed in main group elements.
