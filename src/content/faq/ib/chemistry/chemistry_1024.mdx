Alkanes can be synthesized from alkenes through a process known as hydrogenation.

Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction that involves the addition of hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) to a compound. Specifically, when converting alkenes into alkanes, hydrogenation entails the addition of hydrogen to an alkene in the presence of a catalyst. This reaction effectively transforms the double bonds present in the alkene into single bonds, yielding an alkane.

The general reaction can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{RCH}=\text{CH}_2 + \text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{RCH}_2-\text{CH}_3
$$

In this equation, $\text{RCH}=\text{CH}_2$ denotes an alkene, while $\text{RCH}_2-\text{CH}_3$ represents the corresponding alkane. Typically, this reaction occurs at room temperature and pressure, utilizing a metal catalyst such as nickel, platinum, or palladium.

Hydrogenation of alkenes is classified as an addition reaction, a type of chemical reaction where atoms or groups of atoms are added to a molecule. In this case, hydrogen atoms are added to the carbon atoms of the alkene, which breaks the double bond and forms a single bond, resulting in the formation of an alkane.

This process is extensively employed in the industrial production of alkanes, particularly within the petroleum industry, where it is used to convert unsaturated hydrocarbons (such as alkenes) into saturated hydrocarbons (such as alkanes). The significance of this conversion lies in the fact that saturated hydrocarbons are generally more stable and less reactive than their unsaturated counterparts, making them safer and more manageable for storage and handling.

Beyond its industrial relevance, the hydrogenation of alkenes is also a fundamental concept in organic chemistry. Grasping this process enhances your understanding of the properties and behaviors of various hydrocarbons and illustrates how they can be modified through chemical reactions.
