Iron exhibits magnetic properties due to its unique electron configuration, which allows for the presence of unpaired electrons. In contrast, copper possesses an electron configuration where all electrons are paired, resulting in a lack of magnetism.

Specifically, iron has a total of 26 electrons arranged in a manner that includes unpaired electrons. These unpaired electrons are not bound to specific pairs and can freely align themselves when exposed to an external magnetic field, which is what imparts magnetic properties to iron. The electron configuration of iron features two electrons in one subshell and four in another within its outermost shell, creating the conditions for unpaired electrons that can respond to magnetic influences.

Conversely, copper contains 29 electrons, all of which are paired in their respective atomic orbitals in the ground state. This complete pairing means there are no unpaired electrons available to align with a magnetic field, rendering copper non-magnetic.

The magnetic characteristics of a material are fundamentally influenced by its atomic structure, particularly the arrangement of its electrons. In materials such as iron, the presence of unpaired electrons facilitates alignment with a magnetic field, leading to magnetism. However, in materials like copper, where all electrons are paired, this alignment is not possible, and thus these materials do not exhibit magnetic properties.

Understanding this concept is essential in the fields of magnetism and materials science. It is crucial to recognize that not all metals are magnetic, and the magnetic properties of a substance are not determined solely by its metallic nature. Instead, it is the specific arrangement and behavior of the electrons within the atoms of the material that dictate whether it will be magnetic or not.
