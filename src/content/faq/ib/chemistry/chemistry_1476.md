An $s$ orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons, a limitation imposed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle asserts that no two electrons can share the same set of four quantum numbers.

The Pauli Exclusion Principle is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, originally formulated by the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925. According to this principle, every electron within an atom is defined by a unique combination of four quantum numbers. These quantum numbers specify the electron's energy level, the shape of its orbital, the orientation of its orbital, and its intrinsic spin.

For an $s$ orbital, the first three quantum numbers remain identical for both electrons. The principal quantum number ($n$) indicates the energy level and size of the orbital; the azimuthal quantum number ($l$) describes the shape of the orbital (which is spherical for an $s$ orbital); and the magnetic quantum number ($m$) specifies the orientation of the orbital (which is uniform across all $s$ orbitals due to their symmetrical nature).

The fourth quantum number, known as the spin quantum number ($s$), can take on one of two values: $+\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Consequently, when two electrons occupy the same $s$ orbital, they must have opposite spinsâ€”one with a spin of $+\frac{1}{2}$ and the other with a spin of $-\frac{1}{2}$.

This principle is applicable not only to $s$ orbitals but to all types of orbitals. Each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, provided that these electrons have opposite spins. This foundational aspect of atomic electronic structure is crucial for understanding the chemical behavior of elements.
