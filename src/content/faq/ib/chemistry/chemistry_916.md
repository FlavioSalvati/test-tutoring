The enthalpy of solution can sometimes result in an exothermic value when the energy released from forming new solute-solvent bonds exceeds the energy required to break the solute-solute and solvent-solvent bonds.

The enthalpy of solution, also known as the heat of solution, refers to the total amount of heat energy absorbed or released as a solute dissolves in a solvent. The dissolution process can be broken down into three distinct steps: 

1. Breaking the solute-solute bonds,
2. Breaking the solvent-solvent bonds, and 
3. Forming new solute-solvent bonds.

Each of these steps involves energy transfer, either absorbing or releasing energy, and the overall enthalpy of solution is the net result of these energy changes.

In the first step, energy is absorbed to overcome the attractive forces between the solute particles, making this an endothermic process. Similarly, in the second step, energy is also absorbed to break the attractive forces between the solvent particles, which is again endothermic. In contrast, the third step is exothermic, as energy is released when new solute-solvent bonds are formed.

The overall enthalpy of solution can either be endothermic or exothermic, depending on the relative magnitudes of these energy changes. If the energy released during the formation of new solute-solvent bonds is greater than the total energy absorbed in breaking the solute-solute and solvent-solvent bonds, the overall enthalpy of solution will be exothermic. In this case, the solution process releases heat to the surroundings, resulting in an increase in the temperature of the solution.

Conversely, if the energy released in forming new solute-solvent bonds is less than the total energy absorbed in breaking the solute-solute and solvent-solvent bonds, the overall enthalpy of solution will be endothermic. This means that the dissolution process absorbs heat from the surroundings, causing the temperature of the solution to decrease.

In summary, the enthalpy of solution can yield an exothermic value when the energy released from forming new solute-solvent bonds surpasses the energy absorbed in breaking solute-solute and solvent-solvent bonds. This concept is fundamental in physical chemistry and provides insight into the energetics involved in the solution process.
