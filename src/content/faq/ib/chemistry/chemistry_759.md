To calculate the reaction rate from a concentration-time graph, you need to determine the gradient (slope) of the line at any specific point on the graph.

In more detail, the rate of a reaction can be derived from a concentration-time graph by assessing the gradient of the line. The gradient reflects the rate of reaction: a steeper gradient indicates a faster reaction rate.

To find the rate at a particular moment, you must draw a tangent line to the curve at that point and calculate the gradient of this tangent. The gradient of a line is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Gradient} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\text{Change in concentration}}{\text{Change in time}}.
$$

This means it represents the change in concentration per unit of time.

For instance, if the concentration of a reactant decreases from $0.5 \, \text{mol/dm}^3$ to $0.3 \, \text{mol/dm}^3$ over a span of $2$ seconds, the rate of reaction can be computed as follows:

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{0.5 - 0.3 \, \text{mol/dm}^3}{2 \, \text{s}} = 0.1 \, \text{mol/dm}^3/\text{s}.
$$

This result indicates that the concentration of the reactant is decreasing by $0.1 \, \text{mol/dm}^3$ each second, which reflects the speed of the reaction.

If the graph is a straight line, the reaction rate remains constant, and you can calculate the gradient between any two points on that line. Conversely, if the graph is curved, the reaction rate varies over time. In such cases, you will need to draw tangents at different points along the curve to determine the rate at those specific times.

It's important to note that a negative gradient signifies a decrease in concentration over time (typical for reactants), while a positive gradient indicates an increase in concentration over time (as seen with products).

In summary, the reaction rate from a concentration-time graph can be calculated by determining the gradient of the line or tangent at a specific point, which represents the change in concentration over time.
