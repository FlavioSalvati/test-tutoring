Percent purity and yield play critical roles in determining stoichiometric outcomes by influencing the quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions.

In chemistry, stoichiometry involves the quantitative analysis of reactants and products in chemical reactions. This practice is grounded in the law of conservation of mass, which asserts that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Consequently, the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products. However, this assumption is valid only when all reactants are pure and the reaction proceeds to completion, resulting in a yield of $100\%$ of the theoretical product.

Percent purity indicates the proportion of a substance that is pure, meaning it is free from contaminants. If a reactant is not $100\%$ pure, it implies that a fraction of it will remain unreacted, thereby affecting stoichiometric calculations. For instance, if you start with $10$ grams of a reactant that has a purity of $90\%$, only $9$ grams will actively participate in the reaction. This situation leads to the formation of less product than what the stoichiometric calculations would predict.

Yield, in contrast, refers to the actual quantity of product obtained from a reaction compared to the theoretical amount estimated by stoichiometry. Various factors can result in the actual yield being lower than the theoretical yield, including incomplete reactions, side reactions, and product loss during purification. For example, if a reaction achieves a yield of $80\%$, it means that only $80\%$ of the theoretically expected product was successfully produced. This discrepancy further contributes to the differences between stoichiometric predictions and real-world results.

In summary, percent purity and yield are essential considerations in stoichiometry. They can significantly influence the amounts of reactants and products, leading to discrepancies between theoretical predictions and actual results. Therefore, when conducting stoichiometric calculations, it is vital to consider both the percent purity of the reactants and the yield of the reaction.
