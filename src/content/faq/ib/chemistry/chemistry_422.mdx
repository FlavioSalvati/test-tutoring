Bond polarity refers to the distribution of electrical charge within a chemical bond between two atoms.

In a chemical bond, the atoms involved do not always share electrons equally. This unequal sharing occurs because different atoms possess varying electronegativities, which measure an atom's ability to attract shared electrons within a bond. When two atoms with differing electronegativities form a bond, the atom with the higher electronegativity exerts a stronger pull on the shared electrons, drawing them closer. This results in a charge imbalance: the more electronegative atom becomes slightly negatively charged (denoted as $\delta^-$), while the less electronegative atom acquires a slight positive charge (denoted as $\delta^+$). This phenomenon is what we refer to as bond polarity.

For instance, consider a water molecule ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). Oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen, which causes the shared electrons in the O-H bonds to spend more time near the oxygen atom. As a result, the oxygen end of the molecule becomes slightly negative, while the hydrogen end becomes slightly positive, creating a polar bond.

Conversely, not all bonds exhibit polarity. If two atoms possess the same electronegativity, they will share electrons equally, resulting in a nonpolar bond. A prime example of this is nitrogen gas ($\text{N}_2$); the two nitrogen atoms have identical electronegativities, leading to a nonpolar bond between them.

Understanding bond polarity is essential in chemistry, as it significantly influences various molecular properties, including shape, reactivity, and the types of intermolecular forces they can engage in. For example, molecules with polar bonds typically have higher boiling points compared to similar nonpolar molecules, as polar molecules can form stronger intermolecular interactions. Moreover, knowledge of bond polarity aids in predicting a molecule's behavior during chemical reactions. In a reaction involving a polar molecule and a nonpolar molecule, the polar molecule is likely to act as the electron donor, due to its electrons being less tightly held.
