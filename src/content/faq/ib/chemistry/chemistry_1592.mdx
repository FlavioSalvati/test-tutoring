Helium is categorized in Group 18 of the periodic table due to its resemblance to the noble gases, despite its unique electron configuration of $1s^2$.

Helium is a distinctive element within the periodic table, being the second lightest element. Its electron configuration of $1s^2$ sets it apart from other elements in Group 18, which typically have configurations ending in $p^6$. Nevertheless, helium's placement in Group 18, which is known as the noble gases group, is based on its chemical properties rather than its electron configuration.

The arrangement of elements in the periodic table is primarily determined by their chemical properties, which are influenced by the configuration of electrons in their outermost shell. Noble gases, including helium, are characterized by having full electron shells and exhibiting low reactivity. Helium, with its two electrons filling its valence shell, is stable and unreactive, much like the other noble gases. This stability is the reason helium, despite its $s^2$ configuration, is classified alongside the noble gases.

Additionally, helium's placement in Group 18 is supported by its physical characteristics. Similar to other noble gases, helium is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-toxic. Under standard conditions, it exists as a monatomic gas, which is another defining trait of noble gases.

Moreover, helium's ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from an atom—closely matches that of other noble gases. This property further reinforces its classification in Group 18.

In summary, although helium's electron configuration of $1s^2$ differs from the $p^6$ configurations of other noble gases, its chemical and physical properties align closely with those of Group 18 elements. Thus, helium is appropriately placed in Group 18 of the periodic table.
