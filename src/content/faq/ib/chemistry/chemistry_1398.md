Stoichiometry is an essential concept in chemistry that enables us to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions by calculating the quantities of reactants and products involved.

At its core, stoichiometry examines the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is grounded in the law of conservation of mass, which asserts that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Consequently, the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products in any given chemical reaction.

In a balanced chemical equation, the coefficients—those numbers placed before the chemical formulas—indicate the molar ratios of the reactants and products. These ratios are crucial for performing stoichiometric calculations, allowing us to determine how much of a reactant is needed to produce a specific amount of product, or conversely, how much product can be generated from a given quantity of reactant.

For instance, consider the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water:

$$
2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

This equation reveals that two moles of hydrogen react with one mole of oxygen to yield two moles of water. If we know the amount of hydrogen available (measured in moles), we can utilize this ratio to calculate the amount of water that will be produced.

Furthermore, stoichiometry aids in predicting the outcome of a reaction by identifying the limiting reactant. The limiting reactant is the substance that is entirely consumed during the reaction, thus dictating the maximum amount of product that can be produced. By comparing the quantities of reactants present, we can identify the limiting reactant and use it to calculate the theoretical yield—the maximum possible amount of product that can be formed.

In summary, stoichiometry serves as a powerful analytical tool in chemistry, enabling us to anticipate the results of chemical reactions. By comprehending the quantitative relationships between reactants and products, we can effectively calculate the amounts of substances involved, identify the limiting reactant, and predict the theoretical yield of reactions.
