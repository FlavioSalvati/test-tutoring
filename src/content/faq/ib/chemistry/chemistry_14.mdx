Amines are classified into three categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, depending on the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or aryl groups.

Amines are organic compounds that contain nitrogen atoms with a lone pair of electrons. They are derived from ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$) through the substitution of one or more of its hydrogen atoms with alkyl or aryl groups. The classification of amines hinges on how many hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule have been replaced by these groups.

**Primary Amines**  
Primary amines are characterized by the replacement of just one hydrogen atom with an alkyl or aryl group. The general formula for primary amines is given by:

$$ \text{RNH}_2 $$

where $R$ represents the alkyl or aryl group. A common example of a primary amine is methylamine ($\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2$), in which the methyl group ($\text{CH}_3$) has replaced one hydrogen atom in the ammonia molecule.

**Secondary Amines**  
In secondary amines, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. The general formula for secondary amines can be expressed as:

$$ \text{R}_2\text{NH} $$

Here, each $R$ can denote either an identical or different alkyl or aryl group. An illustrative example of a secondary amine is dimethylamine ($(\text{CH}_3)_2\text{NH}$), where two methyl groups have taken the place of two hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule.

**Tertiary Amines**  
Tertiary amines are formed when all three hydrogen atoms in ammonia are substituted with alkyl or aryl groups. The general formula for tertiary amines is written as:

$$ \text{R}_3\text{N} $$

In this case, each $R$ may also be the same or different. A notable example of a tertiary amine is trimethylamine ($(\text{CH}_3)_3\text{N}$), in which three methyl groups have replaced all three hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule.

In summary, amines are categorized based on the number of hydrogen atoms in the ammonia molecule that are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. This classification is significant as it influences the physical and chemical properties of the amines, including their reactivity, boiling points, and solubility.
