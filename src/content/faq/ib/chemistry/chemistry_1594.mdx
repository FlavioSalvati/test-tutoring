Transition elements, commonly referred to as transition metals, possess the unique ability to exhibit multiple oxidation states. This characteristic arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in their $d$-orbitals. Oxidation states represent the effective charges that an atom would exhibit if all of its bonds were considered ionic. In transition metals, the energy levels of the $d$-orbitals are closely aligned with those of the $s$-orbitals. As a result, both $s$ and $d$ electrons can participate in bond formation, leading to a diverse range of oxidation states.

In contrast, group 1 metals, known as alkali metals, have a single electron in their outermost shell. This lone electron is easily lost during chemical reactions, resulting in a +1 oxidation state. The energy gap between the $s$ and $p$ orbitals in these elements is significant, making it energetically unfavorable for them to lose more than one electron. Consequently, alkali metals typically exhibit only one oxidation state.

The capacity of transition metals to form multiple oxidation states is a crucial factor influencing their chemical reactivity and their utility in various industrial applications. For instance, iron can exist in either a +2 or +3 oxidation state, enabling it to engage in a wide array of chemical reactions. Similarly, copper can adopt a +1 or +2 oxidation state, enhancing its role as a versatile catalyst in industrial processes.

In summary, the ability of transition elements to display multiple oxidation states is fundamentally linked to the presence of unpaired electrons in their $d$-orbitals, which are capable of participating in bond formation. This contrasts sharply with group 1 metals, which generally show a single oxidation state due to their possession of only one electron in the outermost shell.
