During vaporization, the entropy of a substance increases as it transitions from a more ordered state to a less ordered state.

To elaborate, entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. Specifically, in the context of vaporization, it pertains to the change of a substance from a liquid state to a gaseous state. In the liquid phase, the particles of the substance are relatively close together, exhibiting a certain level of order. Conversely, when the substance vaporizes, the particles disperse and move more freely, resulting in a system that is more disordered and random. This increase in disorder is directly associated with an increase in entropy.

The rise in entropy during vaporization can be understood through the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. In essence, the natural inclination of any isolated system is to maximize its entropy. Consequently, when a substance undergoes vaporization, it aligns with this inherent tendency towards greater entropy.

The change in entropy during vaporization can be quantified using the formula:

$$
\Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
$$

where $\Delta S$ represents the change in entropy, $Q_{\text{rev}}$ is the heat absorbed or released during a reversible process, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For the process of vaporization, $Q_{\text{rev}}$ corresponds to the heat of vaporization of the substance, while $T$ is the boiling point of the substance measured in Kelvin. This equation illustrates that the change in entropy is directly proportional to the heat of vaporization and inversely proportional to the boiling point.

In summary, the entropy of a substance increases during vaporization due to the transition from a more ordered liquid state to a less ordered gaseous state. This increase in entropy reflects a natural process in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics, and it can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
$$
