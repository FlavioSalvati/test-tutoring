Yes, a system can achieve equilibrium even when the concentrations of reactants and products are not equal.

In the context of a chemical reaction, equilibrium does not imply that the concentrations of reactants and products are identical. Instead, equilibrium refers to the state where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, a condition known as dynamic equilibrium. At this stage, the concentrations of both reactants and products remain constant over time, although they may not be equal.

The equilibrium constant, denoted as $K_c$, quantifies the relationship between the concentrations of products and reactants at equilibrium. It is mathematically defined as:

$$
K_c = \frac{[\text{products}]^{n}}{[\text{reactants}]^{m}}
$$

where $n$ and $m$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of the products and reactants, respectively. If $K_c$ is greater than $1$, it indicates that the equilibrium position favors the products, meaning there are more products than reactants present at equilibrium. Conversely, if $K_c$ is less than $1$, the equilibrium position favors the reactants, indicating that there are more reactants than products present at equilibrium.

Le Chatelier's principle further elucidates how a system at equilibrium responds to changes in concentration, temperature, or pressure. When an equilibrium system is disturbed, it will adjust to counteract the change and restore a new equilibrium state. For instance, if the concentration of a reactant is increased, the system will shift to the right, consuming the added reactant to produce more products, until a new equilibrium is established.

In summary, the concept of equilibrium in chemistry is not about achieving equal concentrations of reactants and products; rather, it signifies a state of balance where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. This balance can occur at varying concentrations of reactants and products, influenced by the specific nature of the reaction and the prevailing conditions.
