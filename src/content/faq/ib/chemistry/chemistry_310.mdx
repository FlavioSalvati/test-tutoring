The rate equation for a multi-step reaction is derived by focusing on the slowest step, commonly referred to as the rate-determining step.

In a multi-step reaction, the overall process can be divided into a series of simpler reactions, each described by its own rate equation. However, the rate of the overall reaction is primarily governed by the slowest of these steps, known as the rate-determining step. This is analogous to a convoy, where the speed is dictated by the slowest vehicle in the group.

To derive the rate equation for a multi-step reaction, we first need to identify the rate-determining step, which is typically characterized by the highest activation energy. This energy barrier plays a crucial role in determining the rate at which the reaction can progress. After identifying the rate-determining step, we can formulate its rate equation, which illustrates how the reaction rate depends on the concentrations of the reactants involved in that specific step.

It is important to note that the rate equation for the rate-determining step may include species that do not appear in the overall reaction, referred to as reaction intermediates. To obtain the rate equation for the overall reaction, we must eliminate these intermediates. This can be achieved by utilizing the rate equations of the other steps in the reaction to express the concentrations of the intermediates in terms of the concentrations of the reactants and products present in the overall reaction.

After substituting these expressions into the rate equation for the rate-determining step, we arrive at the rate equation for the overall reaction. This final equation delineates how the reaction rate is influenced by the concentrations of both the reactants and products. Such an equation serves as a valuable tool for predicting the behavior of the reaction under various conditions and for gaining insight into the mechanisms governing the reaction process.
