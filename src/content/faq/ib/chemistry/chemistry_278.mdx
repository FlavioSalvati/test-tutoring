A catalyst accelerates the rate of a chemical reaction by offering an alternative reaction pathway that has a lower activation energy.

To elaborate, a catalyst is a substance that enhances a chemical reaction without being consumed or permanently altered in the process. It accomplishes this by reducing the activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to take place. By providing an alternative pathway that demands less energy, the catalyst enables the reaction to occur more rapidly.

The functioning of a catalyst can be illustrated using an energy profile diagram. In a reaction that occurs without a catalyst, the reactants must surmount a high energy barrier, represented by the activation energy, to convert into products. In the presence of a catalyst, a new pathway with a lower energy barrier is created. As a result, a larger proportion of the reactant particles possess sufficient energy to react, which increases the reaction rate.

Catalysts can be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous catalysts exist in the same phase—solid, liquid, or gas—as the reactants, while heterogeneous catalysts operate in a different phase. Catalysts facilitate reactions by forming temporary bonds with the reactant molecules, thereby orienting them in a manner that enhances the likelihood of the reaction occurring.

It is essential to understand that while catalysts expedite reactions, they do not influence the position of the equilibrium in a reversible reaction. This is because catalysts increase the rates of both the forward and reverse reactions equally. Consequently, the final proportions of reactants and products remain unchanged; however, they are achieved more rapidly.

In summary, catalysts are vital in increasing the rate of chemical reactions by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. This fundamental principle is crucial for understanding a wide range of processes in chemistry, from industrial synthesis to biological metabolism.
