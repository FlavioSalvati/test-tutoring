A negative change in Gibbs free energy indicates that a reaction is spontaneous, meaning it can occur without any external energy input.

The Gibbs free energy change, represented as $\Delta G$, is a thermodynamic potential that quantifies the maximum reversible work a system can perform at constant temperature and pressure. Named after the 19th-century scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs, this concept is essential in thermodynamics as it helps determine whether a chemical reaction will take place spontaneously.

When $\Delta G$ is negative, it signifies that the reaction is exothermic, releasing energy and thus making the reaction spontaneous. This occurs because the system transitions from a higher energy state to a lower energy state, which is inherently more stable. In this situation, no external energy is required for the reaction to proceed, and it will continue until the system reaches equilibrium.

Conversely, if $\Delta G$ is positive, the reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs energy and is non-spontaneous. In this case, the system requires an external energy source to drive the reaction. However, it's important to note that non-spontaneous reactions can still occur under specific conditions, particularly if there is a continuous supply of energy.

Moreover, the value of $\Delta G$ provides insight into the equilibrium state of the reaction. When $\Delta G$ equals zero, the system is at equilibrium; this indicates that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.

In summary, a negative Gibbs free energy change is a critical indicator of a spontaneous reaction. It implies that the reaction can proceed without any external energy input, as the system is moving toward a more stable, lower energy state. Understanding this concept is fundamental for assessing the feasibility and spontaneity of chemical reactions.
