Percent transmittance can be calculated from absorbance using the formula:

$$
\%T = 100 \times 10^{-A}
$$

where $ A $ denotes the absorbance.

To understand this relationship more deeply, we can refer to the Beer-Lambert Law, which describes how absorbance $ A $ is logarithmically related to transmittance $ T $. According to this law, the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to both the concentration of the solute and the path length of the light passing through the solution. Thus, if a solution is more concentrated or if the light travels a longer distance through it, more light will be absorbed, resulting in less light being transmitted.

The formula for percent transmittance, 

$$
\%T = 100 \times 10^{-A}
$$

is derived from the Beer-Lambert Law. In this expression, $ \%T $ represents the percentage of light that successfully passes through the solution and reaches the detector on the opposite side, while $ A $ is a measure of the light absorbed by the solution.

To compute percent transmittance from a given absorbance value, simply substitute the absorbance into the formula and carry out the calculation. For instance, if the absorbance $ A $ is $ 0.5 $, the percent transmittance would be calculated as follows:

$$
\%T = 100 \times 10^{-0.5} \approx 31.62\%
$$

It is important to note that percent transmittance can vary between $ 0\% $ (indicating no light is transmitted) and $ 100\% $ (indicating all light is transmitted). In contrast, absorbance theoretically ranges from $ 0 $ (all light transmitted) to infinity (no light transmitted). However, in practical applications, absorbance values typically lie within the range of $ 0 $ to $ 2 $.

Grasping the relationship between absorbance and transmittance is vital in various fields of chemistry, particularly in determining the concentration of substances in solution. By measuring the amount of light that is absorbed or transmitted by a solution, chemists can deduce the concentration of the solute, which provides essential insights into the solution's composition.
