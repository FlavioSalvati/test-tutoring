The Gattermann synthesis and the Gattermann-Koch synthesis are both important reactions in organic chemistry that lead to the formation of aldehydes, but they differ in their starting materials and the types of aldehydes they produce.

The Gattermann synthesis, also referred to as Gattermann formylation, is a method for synthesizing aryl aldehydes. This reaction utilizes a diazonium salt, which reacts with a compound that contains an acidic hydrogen atom, such as water, alcohol, or an amine, in the presence of a copper(I) salt. The outcome of this reaction is an aryl aldehyde, characterized by the presence of a formyl group ($-CHO$). This reaction is named after the German chemist Ludwig Gattermann.

In contrast, the Gattermann-Koch synthesis is a modification of the Gattermann synthesis designed to produce aromatic aldehydes from aromatic hydrocarbons. In this reaction, an aromatic hydrocarbon reacts with carbon monoxide and hydrochloric acid in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as aluminum chloride or ferric chloride. The result of this process is an aromatic aldehyde, which features a formyl group attached to an aromatic ring. This reaction honors both Ludwig Gattermann and his student, Julius Arnold Koch.

Although both reactions are employed to synthesize aldehydes, the primary distinction between them lies in their starting materials and the specific types of aldehydes generated. The Gattermann synthesis begins with a diazonium salt and yields aryl aldehydes, while the Gattermann-Koch synthesis starts with an aromatic hydrocarbon and produces aromatic aldehydes. Both reactions play a significant role in organic chemistry, as they offer valuable methods for synthesizing aldehydes, which are crucial intermediates in numerous chemical reactions.
