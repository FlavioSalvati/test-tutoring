Electrons in a partially filled d orbital are represented by arrows within boxes, adhering to Hund's rule and the Pauli exclusion principle.

To elaborate, the d orbital is a specific type of atomic orbital that can accommodate a maximum of $10$ electrons. When we say that the d orbital is partially filled, it indicates that the number of electrons present is fewer than $10$. To visualize these electrons, we utilize a diagram comprising five boxes, with each box symbolizing one of the five d orbitals. Each box can contain up to two electrons.

In this representation, electrons are depicted as arrows. An upward arrow signifies an electron with a spin of $+\frac{1}{2}$, while a downward arrow denotes an electron with a spin of $-\frac{1}{2}$. This representation aligns with the Pauli exclusion principle, which asserts that no two electrons in an atom can possess the same set of four quantum numbers. Consequently, within a single orbital (or box), one cannot have two upward arrows or two downward arrows.

When populating the d orbitals with electrons, we adhere to Hund's rule. This principle states that electrons will occupy each orbital singly before any orbital is doubly occupied. For instance, if we have three electrons available for a d orbital, we would place one arrow in each of the first three boxes. Only after all five boxes contain one arrow each do we begin adding a second arrow to any of the boxes.

It is also essential to recognize that the sequence in which electrons fill the orbitals can differ based on the energy levels of the orbitals. This filling order is guided by the Aufbau principle, which posits that electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy. However, in a straightforward depiction of a partially filled d orbital, we typically illustrate the electrons filling the boxes from left to right.

In summary, to represent electrons in a partially filled d orbital, we create a diagram featuring five boxes and arrows. These arrows are arranged within the boxes according to Hund's rule and the Pauli exclusion principle.
