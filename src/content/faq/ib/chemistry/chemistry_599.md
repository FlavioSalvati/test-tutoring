Ice floats on water because it is less dense, a characteristic attributed to its unique crystalline structure, which features larger spaces between its molecules.

Both ice and liquid water are composed of $H_2O$ molecules; however, their molecular arrangements differ significantly. In liquid water, the $H_2O$ molecules are closely packed and constantly moving, forming temporary hydrogen bonds. In contrast, when water freezes into ice, the molecules organize themselves into a regular, repeating arrangement known as a crystalline structure. This arrangement is stabilized by hydrogen bonds that form between the hydrogen atom of one water molecule and the oxygen atom of another.

The crystalline structure of ice is less dense than that of liquid water because the hydrogen bonds in ice cause the molecules to be spaced further apart than they are in the liquid state. As a result, ice contains fewer molecules in a given volume, which contributes to its lower density compared to water. Density plays a crucial role in determining whether an object will float or sink in a fluid. If a substance has a lower density than the fluid it is in, it will float. Therefore, since ice is less dense than water, it floats on its surface.

This phenomenon is quite remarkable, as most substances are denser in their solid form than in their liquid form. Typically, freezing allows molecules to pack more closely together, thereby increasing density. However, the unique properties of water molecules and the hydrogen bonds they form lead to a solid state that is less dense, allowing ice to float. 

This characteristic is vital for sustaining life on Earth. It causes bodies of water to freeze from the top down, creating an insulating layer of ice that protects the liquid water below. This insulation enables aquatic life to survive even in frigid conditions.
