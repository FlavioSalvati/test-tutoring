Interstitial compounds are chemical substances in which small atoms, such as hydrogen, carbon, or nitrogen, occupy the interstitial sites within the lattices of transition metals.

More specifically, interstitial compounds are created when small non-metal atoms—commonly hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, boron, or oxygen—are inserted into the interstices (the spaces) of metal lattices. These compounds are typically associated with transition metals, which possess a unique crystal structure that allows for the presence of these interstitial sites. The small atoms fit into these voids without causing significant distortion to the metal lattice.

The properties of interstitial compounds differ markedly from those of their parent metals. Generally, these compounds exhibit high hardness, elevated melting points, and reduced malleability and ductility compared to the parent metals. The presence of small atoms in the interstitial sites induces distortions in the metal lattice, which enhances the metal's strength and increases its resistance to deformation.

Additionally, interstitial compounds tend to be chemically inert. This inertness is primarily due to the non-metal atoms in the interstitial positions, which form strong covalent bonds with the metal atoms. These bonds are difficult to break, rendering the compounds resistant to chemical reactions.

Regarding electrical conductivity, interstitial compounds are typically poorer conductors than their parent metals. The presence of small atoms in the interstitial sites disrupts the regular arrangement of metal atoms, which impedes the flow of electrons.

In summary, interstitial compounds are distinctive materials formed when small atoms occupy the interstitial sites in transition metals. They exhibit unique properties, including increased hardness, high melting points, lower malleability and ductility, chemical inertness, and diminished electrical conductivity compared to their parent metals.
