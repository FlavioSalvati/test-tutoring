The shape of an orbital is dictated by the quantum numbers associated with an electron in an atom.

More specifically, the orbital shape arises from the solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom. This fundamental equation describes the behavior of quantum systems, and its solutions indicate the possible energy levels and spatial distributions of electrons in an atom, which we interpret as the shapes of orbitals.

The solutions to the Schrödinger equation are characterized by three quantum numbers: the principal quantum number ($n$), the azimuthal quantum number ($l$), and the magnetic quantum number ($m$). Each of these quantum numbers provides distinct information regarding the electron's state.

1. **Principal Quantum Number ($n$)**: This number specifies the energy level of the electron as well as the size of the orbital. It can take any positive integer value. As the value of $n$ increases, the energy level rises and the size of the orbital expands.

2. **Azimuthal Quantum Number ($l$)**: This quantum number defines the shape of the orbital. It can take integer values ranging from $0$ to $n-1$. For a given $n$, the value of $l$ indicates the number of nodes in the orbital—regions where the probability of finding the electron is zero. Different values of $l$ correspond to specific orbital shapes, commonly labeled as s, p, d, and f orbitals.

3. **Magnetic Quantum Number ($m$)**: This number determines the orientation of the orbital in space. It can take integer values from $-l$ to $+l$. For a fixed value of $l$, different values of $m$ represent various orientations of the same orbital shape in three-dimensional space.

In summary, the shape of an orbital is a result of the quantum numbers associated with an electron in an atom, derived from the solutions to the Schrödinger equation. The principal quantum number ($n$) influences the size of the orbital, the azimuthal quantum number ($l$) defines its shape, and the magnetic quantum number ($m$) determines its spatial orientation.
