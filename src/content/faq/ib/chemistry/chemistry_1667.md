Intermolecular forces in molecular substances are the forces of attraction between molecules, varying in strength and type.

Intermolecular forces, also known as van der Waals forces, are the forces of attraction that exist between molecules in a substance. These forces are weaker than the intramolecular forces that hold the atoms together within individual molecules, such as covalent or ionic bonds. However, they play a crucial role in determining the physical properties of molecular substances, including their boiling and melting points, viscosity, and solubility.

There are three main types of intermolecular forces: London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding. London dispersion forces are the weakest and are present in all molecular substances. They arise due to the temporary fluctuations in the electron distribution around an atom, which create a temporary dipole that induces a dipole in a neighbouring molecule.

Dipole-dipole interactions occur in polar molecules, i.e., molecules with a permanent dipole. In these molecules, the positive end of one molecule is attracted to the negative end of another molecule. These forces are stronger than London dispersion forces but weaker than hydrogen bonds.

Hydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction that occurs when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine) and is attracted to another electronegative atom in a different molecule. Hydrogen bonds are the strongest type of intermolecular force and significantly influence the properties of substances like water.

The strength of these intermolecular forces in a substance determines its state at a given temperature. Substances with strong intermolecular forces are likely to be solids or liquids at room temperature, while those with weak intermolecular forces are typically gases. Furthermore, these forces also affect the energy required to change a substance from one state to another, with stronger forces requiring more energy. Therefore, understanding intermolecular forces is key to predicting and explaining the behaviour of molecular substances.
