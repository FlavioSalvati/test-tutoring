Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines can be differentiated through spectroscopy by examining their distinct infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is an effective method for identifying functional groups in organic compounds. In the IR spectrum, primary amines exhibit two N-H absorption bands, typically found between $3300 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ and $3500 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$. These bands arise from the stretching vibrations of the N-H bonds. In contrast, secondary amines display only one N-H absorption band within the same range, due to the presence of a single N-H bond. Tertiary amines, however, do not exhibit any N-H absorption bands, as they lack N-H bonds altogether.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers additional insights into the structure of amines. In proton NMR, primary amines generally present a complex multiplet in the range of $0.5 \, \text{ppm}$ to $3.0 \, \text{ppm}$, attributable to the protons associated with the nitrogen atom. Secondary amines typically produce a singlet within this region, while tertiary amines do not yield any peaks here, as they lack protons directly bonded to the nitrogen atom.

In carbon-13 NMR, the carbon atom that is bonded to the nitrogen atom in primary, secondary, and tertiary amines typically appears in the range of $30 \, \text{ppm}$ to $60 \, \text{ppm}$. However, the precise chemical shift can vary depending on the specific nature of the substituents attached to the nitrogen atom.

In conclusion, by analyzing the IR and NMR spectra of an unknown amine, one can ascertain whether it is a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. The presence or absence of N-H absorption bands in the IR spectrum serves as the initial indicator, while the pattern of peaks in the proton NMR spectrum provides further corroboration. The carbon-13 NMR spectrum can also yield valuable information, although it is generally less definitive compared to the other two techniques.
