Fractional distillation is a technique used to separate the various components of crude oil based on their distinct boiling points.

Crude oil is a complex mixture comprised of numerous hydrocarbons, each possessing its unique boiling point. The process of fractional distillation takes advantage of this characteristic to effectively separate these components. The procedure begins by heating crude oil to approximately $350^\circ$ Celsius, which converts it into vapor. This vapor is subsequently introduced into a distillation column, often referred to as a fractionating column.

The fractionating column is a tall, cylindrical structure filled with trays or plates. The temperature is higher at the bottom of the column and gradually decreases as one moves upward. As the vapor ascends through the column, it encounters lower temperatures. When the temperature falls below the boiling point of a specific component, that component condenses back into liquid form and is collected on one of the trays. This collected liquid is referred to as a 'fraction'.

The fractions that are gathered lower in the column, where the temperature remains higher, are composed of hydrocarbons with lower boiling points. These typically include gases such as methane, ethane, propane, and butane. In contrast, fractions collected higher up in the column, where the temperature is cooler, contain hydrocarbons with higher boiling points, such as liquids like petrol (gasoline), kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil. At the very top of the column, where the temperature is at its lowest, one finds fractions that consist of hydrocarbons with the highest boiling points, which are often solids like bitumen, commonly used in road surfacing and roofing.

The crucial aspect of fractional distillation is the temperature gradient present within the column. This gradient enables each component to condense at its specific position within the column, thereby effectively separating the crude oil into its individual constituents. The process is continuous, with fresh crude oil constantly being added while the separated fractions are simultaneously removed.

In summary, fractional distillation separates the components of crude oil by heating the oil to convert it into vapor, which then condenses at different temperatures within a fractionating column. This results in a variety of fractions, each containing distinct types of hydrocarbons.
