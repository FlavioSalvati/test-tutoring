Halogens form diatomic molecules by sharing pairs of electrons between two atoms, resulting in a single covalent bond.

Halogens are elements located in Group 17 of the periodic table, which includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. These elements are characterized by their high reactivity, a property attributed to their electron configuration. Each halogen atom possesses seven electrons in its outermost shell and requires one additional electron to attain a stable, full outer shell, akin to the noble gases. This need for an extra electron makes halogens highly reactive and eager to form bonds with other elements or with themselves.

When two halogen atoms interact, they can share a pair of electrons—one from each atom—to establish a single covalent bond. This process is referred to as covalent bonding. The shared pair of electrons orbits the nuclei of both atoms, effectively 'gluing' them together to create a molecule. In the case of halogens, this interaction leads to the formation of a diatomic molecule, which is defined as a molecule consisting of two atoms of the same element. For instance, two fluorine atoms can bond to form a molecule of $F_2$, or diatomic fluorine.

This electron sharing enables each halogen atom to achieve a full outer shell of eight electrons, thereby satisfying the octet rule. The octet rule posits that atoms are most stable when their outermost shell contains eight electrons. By sharing a pair of electrons, each halogen atom in the molecule effectively has eight electrons in its outer shell, even though one of those electrons is shared with the other atom.

In summary, halogens form diatomic molecules through the mechanism of covalent bonding, where pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms. This process allows each atom to attain a stable, full outer shell of electrons, satisfying the octet rule and resulting in the formation of a stable diatomic molecule.
