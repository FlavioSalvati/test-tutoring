Zinc differs from typical transition metals primarily because it does not form ions with incomplete d-orbitals.

Although zinc is positioned in the d-block of the periodic table—typically associated with transition metals—it does not display the characteristics commonly attributed to these metals. Transition metals are defined by their ability to form ions with incomplete d-orbitals, enabling them to exhibit variable oxidation states, form colored compounds, and serve as catalysts in various chemical reactions.

In contrast, zinc's electron configuration is $[Ar]\, 3d^{10}\, 4s^2$. When it forms ions, zinc loses its two $4s$ electrons to become the $Zn^{2+}$ ion, which has the electron configuration $[Ar]\, 3d^{10}$. As a result, zinc ions possess a completely filled $3d$-orbital, rather than an incomplete one. Consequently, zinc does not demonstrate variable oxidation states; it consistently forms only $+2$ ions, unlike other transition metals that can generate a range of positive ions.

Additionally, zinc compounds are typically not colored. This lack of color is attributed to the fully occupied d-orbitals, which prevent d-d transitions that would allow for the absorption of visible light and the formation of colored compounds. This behavior stands in stark contrast to other transition metals, which often do exhibit color due to such transitions.

Zinc's role as a catalyst also differs from that of typical transition metals. While zinc can participate in some catalytic reactions, it does not act as a catalytic surface as many transition metals do. Instead, zinc often functions as a structural component within enzymes, facilitating reactions through its presence rather than through surface interactions.

In summary, while zinc is categorized in the d-block of the periodic table, it lacks the defining properties of transition metals, such as the ability to form ions with incomplete d-orbitals, exhibit variable oxidation states, produce colored compounds, and function as catalysts in chemical reactions. Therefore, zinc is not classified as a typical transition metal.
