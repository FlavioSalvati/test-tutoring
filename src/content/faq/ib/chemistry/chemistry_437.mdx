The spontaneity of a chemical reaction can be assessed by calculating the change in Gibbs free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$.

The Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G$) is a thermodynamic potential that quantifies the maximum reversible work that a system can perform at constant temperature and pressure. It plays a crucial role in determining whether a chemical reaction will occur spontaneously. Specifically, if $\Delta G$ is negative, the reaction is spontaneous under the specified conditions. Conversely, if $\Delta G$ is positive, the reaction will not occur spontaneously. When $\Delta G$ equals zero, the system is considered to be at equilibrium.

The Gibbs free energy change can be computed using the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S
$$

In this equation, $\Delta H$ represents the change in enthalpy (heat content), $T$ is the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin, and $\Delta S$ signifies the change in entropy (disorder). The values for enthalpy and entropy changes can typically be found in standard thermodynamic tables for the reactants and products involved in the reaction.

In addition to the Gibbs free energy change, the conditions under which a reaction occurs—such as temperature and pressure—can also affect its spontaneity. For instance, an endothermic reaction (where $\Delta H > 0$) may become spontaneous at elevated temperatures. In this case, the term $T\Delta S$ in the Gibbs free energy equation can become significantly larger and may overshadow the positive $\Delta H$. Similarly, a reaction that leads to an increase in the number of gas molecules may become spontaneous at lower pressures, as the increase in entropy is favored.

It's also essential to understand that the spontaneity of a reaction does not imply its rate of occurrence. A reaction may be spontaneous yet proceed very slowly if there is a high energy barrier, known as activation energy, that must be overcome. The rate of a reaction is primarily determined by its mechanism and can be influenced by various factors, such as the presence of a catalyst.
