The molecular formula can be derived from the empirical formula by multiplying the empirical formula by a specific whole number.

The empirical formula of a compound represents the simplest whole-number ratio of the atoms of each element present. However, it does not indicate the actual number of atoms in each molecule. To obtain the molecular formula from the empirical formula, you must first determine the molar mass of the compound.

Here are the steps to derive the molecular formula:

1. **Calculate the Molar Mass of the Empirical Formula**: 
   To find the molar mass of the empirical formula, sum the atomic masses of all the atoms present in the empirical formula. These atomic masses can be obtained from the periodic table.

2. **Determine the Ratio**: 
   Next, divide the molar mass of the compound by the molar mass of the empirical formula. This calculation will yield a whole number or a number very close to a whole number. This quotient indicates how many empirical formula units are contained in each molecule of the compound.

3. **Formulate the Molecular Formula**: 
   Finally, multiply the subscripts in the empirical formula by the whole number obtained in the previous step. This will give you the molecular formula of the compound.

For instance, consider a compound with the empirical formula $CH$ and a molar mass of $26 \, \text{g/mol}$. The molar mass of $CH$ is approximately $13 \, \text{g/mol}$. Dividing $26 \, \text{g/mol}$ by $13 \, \text{g/mol}$ results in $2$. Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is $C_2H_2$.

It is important to note that the molecular formula of a compound may be identical to its empirical formula or may represent a multiple of the empirical formula. The crucial step is identifying that multiple, which necessitates knowing the molar mass of the compound.
