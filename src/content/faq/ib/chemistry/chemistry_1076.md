Transition metals are characterized by their variable oxidation states, which arise from the presence of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals.

These metals are distinct within the periodic table due to their unique electron configurations. Specifically, the energy levels of the 4s and 3d sublevels are closely aligned. When a transition metal atom loses electrons, it can do so from either the 4s or 3d sublevel. This flexibility leads to the formation of various oxidation states.

The term "oxidation state" defines the extent to which an atom has been oxidized in a chemical compound. Put simply, it represents the charge an atom would possess if all its bonds were considered ionic. For transition metals, the oxidation state is variable because they can lose different numbers of electrons from both the 4s and 3d sublevels. For instance, iron ($\text{Fe}$) can exist in oxidation states of either $+2$ or $+3$, depending on whether it loses two or three electrons, respectively.

The capacity of transition metals to adopt multiple oxidation states is one of their most significant properties. This ability enables them to form a diverse array of compounds and to act as catalysts in numerous chemical reactions. A notable example is manganese ($\text{Mn}$), which can exist in oxidation states ranging from $+2$ to $+7$. This variability allows manganese to participate in a wide range of chemical reactions and to form different compounds.

In summary, the variable oxidation states of transition metals stem from their distinctive electron configurations, characterized by unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. This trait facilitates the loss of varying numbers of electrons, resulting in multiple oxidation states and a rich diversity of chemical behavior.
