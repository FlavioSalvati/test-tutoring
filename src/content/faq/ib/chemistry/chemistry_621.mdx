London dispersion forces are present in all molecules due to temporary fluctuations in the electron distribution around atoms.

Also known as van der Waals forces, London dispersion forces are a type of intermolecular force that exists between all atoms and molecules. They are named after the German physicist Fritz London, who first proposed their existence in 1930. While these forces are the weakest among intermolecular forces, they are universal and exert influence on all atoms and molecules to some extent.

The origin of London dispersion forces can be traced to the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons. Electrons in an atom or molecule are not stationary; rather, they constantly move around the nucleus. This movement results in a fluctuating electron cloud, which may be unevenly distributed at any given moment. This temporary uneven distribution creates a transient dipole, where one side of the atom carries a slight negative charge and the opposite side carries a slight positive charge.

This transient dipole can, in turn, induce a similar temporary dipole in a neighboring atom or molecule, leading to an attractive interaction between the two. This interaction is what we refer to as the London dispersion force. The strength of these forces increases with the size and complexity of the atoms or molecules involved, as larger and more intricate structures have more electrons, resulting in greater fluctuations in their electron clouds.

Even in molecules with permanent dipoles, such as water, London dispersion forces still play a role. They complement other intermolecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, contributing to the overall properties of the substance. For instance, they influence characteristics such as boiling and melting points, viscosity, and surface tension in liquids.

In conclusion, London dispersion forces are an intrinsic aspect of all molecules, arising from the fundamental quantum mechanical behavior of electrons. These forces result from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution around atoms and significantly affect the physical properties of all substances.
