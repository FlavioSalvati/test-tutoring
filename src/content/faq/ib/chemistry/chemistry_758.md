Peaks observed in a mass spectrum correspond to various isotopes or fragments of the molecule under analysis.

In mass spectrometry, a sample is ionized to produce positive ions, which are subsequently accelerated and deflected by magnetic fields. The degree of deflection is determined by the mass-to-charge ratio (denoted as $m/z$) of the ions. These ions are then detected, resulting in the generation of a mass spectrum. This spectrum is presented as a graph, with the relative abundance of ions (typically expressed as a percentage) plotted on the y-axis and the $m/z$ ratio on the x-axis.

Each peak within the mass spectrum corresponds to an ion with a specific $m/z$ ratio. The position of a peak along the x-axis indicates the $m/z$ ratio, which generally aligns with the relative atomic mass for ions carrying a single positive charge. The height of the peak reflects the relative abundance of that particular ion.

The peak with the highest $m/z$ value, referred to as the molecular ion peak or parent peak, signifies the intact molecule and reveals the molecular mass of the compound. This peak is frequently accompanied by a smaller peak at $m/z + 1$, attributed to the presence of the carbon-13 isotope in organic molecules.

Additional peaks in the mass spectrum arise from fragment ions, which are generated when the molecular ion undergoes fragmentation. These fragment peaks can yield critical insights into the molecular structure. For instance, a peak at $m/z = 15$ may indicate the presence of a methyl group ($\text{CH}_3$) within the molecule, as the $m/z$ ratio of a methyl cation is $15$.

In conclusion, interpreting the peaks in a mass spectrum involves identifying the molecular ion peak to ascertain the molecular mass, as well as analyzing the fragment ion peaks to derive information about the molecular structure. This analytical process necessitates a solid understanding of mass spectrometry principles and the characteristics of various atoms and molecular groups.
