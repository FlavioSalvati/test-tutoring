The rate constant of a chemical reaction increases with rising temperature, a phenomenon that is quantitatively described by the Arrhenius equation.

The relationship between temperature and the rate constant is a key concept in the field of chemical kinetics. The Arrhenius equation provides a mathematical framework for understanding this relationship, stating that the rate constant $ k $ of a reaction increases exponentially as the temperature $ T $ rises.

The Arrhenius equation is expressed as:

$$
k = A e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}
$$

In this equation, $ A $ represents the pre-exponential factor (also known as the frequency factor), $ E_a $ is the activation energy, $ R $ is the gas constant, and $ T $ is the absolute temperature. The equation illustrates that the rate constant is directly related to the temperature, implying that as the temperature increases, the rate constant $ k $ also increases, resulting in a faster reaction rate.

This relationship can be understood through the nature of chemical reactions. For a reaction to occur, the reactant molecules must collide with sufficient energy to surpass the activation energy barrier. As temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules also rises, which means that a larger proportion of the molecules possess the necessary energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. This leads to an increased reaction rate.

Additionally, the exponential term $ e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}} $ in the Arrhenius equation indicates that even a small increase in temperature can lead to a substantial increase in the rate constant. This is due to the fact that the rate constant is exponentially dependent on the inverse of the temperature, making temperature a critical factor in determining reaction rates.
