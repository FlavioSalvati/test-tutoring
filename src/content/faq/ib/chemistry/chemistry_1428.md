Discrepancies between expected and actual stoichiometric outcomes can arise from several factors, including measurement errors, the presence of impure reactants, and the occurrence of side reactions.

Stoichiometry is a fundamental principle in chemistry that involves calculating the relative quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions. However, in practical applications, the actual results frequently deviate from the predictions made using stoichiometric calculations. These discrepancies can be attributed to various influences.

Firstly, measurement errors can significantly impact stoichiometric outcomes. Such errors may occur during the weighing of reactants, the measurement of volumes, or any other process that involves quantifying substances involved in the reaction. Even a minor error in measurement can lead to substantial deviations from the expected stoichiometric results. For instance, if a reactant is weighed inaccurately, the amount of product formed will not align with the expected yield based on stoichiometric calculations.

Secondly, the purity of reactants plays a crucial role in stoichiometric calculations. In many instances, reactants are not 100% pure and may contain impurities that can interfere with the reaction. These impurities can result in a lower yield of the desired product than what stoichiometry predicts. For example, if a reactant is contaminated with a substance that reacts with one of the other reactants, it reduces the amount of that reactant available for the intended reaction, thereby decreasing the yield of the product.

Lastly, side reactions can also contribute to discrepancies in stoichiometric outcomes. In a chemical reaction, not all reactants may proceed to form the desired product; some may undergo alternative reactions, resulting in the formation of undesired byproducts, commonly referred to as side products. These side reactions consume reactants that would otherwise be available for the formation of the desired product, leading to a yield that is lower than predicted by stoichiometry.

In conclusion, while stoichiometry provides a theoretical framework for predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions, various factors—such as measurement errors, impure reactants, and side reactions—can lead to differences between expected and actual outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors when conducting chemical reactions and interpreting their results.
