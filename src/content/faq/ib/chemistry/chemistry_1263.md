The concept of molecularity is specifically applicable to elementary reactions, as these are the only reactions that occur in a single step.

Molecularity refers to the number of molecules or ions that participate in an elementary reaction. An elementary reaction is the simplest form of a chemical reaction, occurring in a single step. These reactions serve as the fundamental building blocks for more complex reactions, which may involve multiple elementary reactions occurring either sequentially or simultaneously.

In an elementary reaction, the reactants interact directly to form the products in a single collision or interaction. Consequently, the molecularity of an elementary reaction is defined as the number of reactant molecules or ions involved in that collision. Molecularity can be categorized as follows:
- **Unimolecular**: Involves one molecule.
- **Bimolecular**: Involves two molecules.
- **Termolecular**: Involves three molecules, though such reactions are quite rare due to the low probability of three particles colliding simultaneously.

Conversely, complex reactions consist of several elementary reactions, each characterized by its own molecularity. While the overall reaction may involve more molecules or ions than any individual elementary reaction, the molecularity of the entire complex reaction is not simply the sum of the molecularities of the individual elementary reactions. Instead, it is determined by the rate-determining stepâ€”the slowest elementary reaction in the sequence.

As a result, the concept of molecularity does not apply to complex reactions as a whole, since they do not occur in a single step. Rather, each elementary reaction within a complex reaction possesses its own molecularity. This limitation is why molecularity is strictly defined for elementary reactions.

In summary, molecularity is a property of elementary reactions, which occur in a single step and involve a specific number of participating molecules or ions. Complex reactions, comprising multiple elementary reactions, lack a singular molecularity because they are not confined to a single step. Each elementary reaction within a complex reaction retains its own molecularity, highlighting the unique characteristics of elementary reactions.
