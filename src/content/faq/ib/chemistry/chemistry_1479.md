You can determine the number of valence electrons for an element by examining its group number on the periodic table.

The periodic table serves as a valuable resource for understanding the properties of elements, particularly the number of valence electrons they contain. Valence electrons are the electrons located in the outermost shell of an atom, and they play a critical role in chemical reactions. These electrons are essential in determining an element's reactivity and bonding behavior.

To ascertain the number of valence electrons for a given element, you should refer to its position within the periodic table. The table is organized into groups (vertical columns) and periods (horizontal rows). Generally, the group number of an element reflects the number of valence electrons it possesses. For example, elements in Group 1, known as alkali metals, have one valence electron, while those in Group 2, referred to as alkaline earth metals, have two valence electrons.

However, this straightforward rule becomes more nuanced when considering the transition metals, which occupy Groups 3 to 12. These elements can exhibit varying numbers of valence electrons because they may utilize both their outermost and penultimate electron shells for bonding. As a result, determining the number of valence electrons for these transition metals is more complex.

For elements in Groups 13 to 18, the number of valence electrons can be calculated by subtracting ten from the group number. For instance, carbon is located in Group 14, which means it has four valence electrons, calculated as $14 - 10 = 4$. The elements in Group 18, known as noble gases, typically have eight valence electrons, with the exception of helium, which has only two.

Understanding the number of valence electrons is crucial for comprehending how elements interact with one another. This knowledge enables us to predict the types of bonds they may form, the ions they might create, and their overall reactivity. Therefore, mastering the ability to determine the number of valence electrons from the periodic table is a fundamental skill in your chemistry studies.
