To determine the amount of product generated in incomplete reactions, we utilize the concepts of limiting reactants and stoichiometry.

In any chemical reaction, the limiting reactant is the substance that is completely consumed first, and it dictates the maximum quantity of product that can be produced. Conversely, the other reactants present are in excess and will not be entirely converted into products. Therefore, identifying the limiting reactant is essential for calculating the amount of product formed in an incomplete reaction.

To identify the limiting reactant, you must first have the balanced chemical equation for the reaction, along with the quantities of each reactant. The balanced equation provides the stoichiometric ratios, which indicate how the reactants combine to yield products. For instance, in the reaction 

$$ 
2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}, 
$$ 

two moles of hydrogen react with one mole of oxygen to produce two moles of water.

Next, you need to calculate the number of moles for each reactant. This can be accomplished by dividing the mass of each reactant by its molar mass. The reactant with the smallest number of moles is identified as the limiting reactant.

After determining the limiting reactant, you can proceed to calculate the amount of product formed by applying the stoichiometric ratios derived from the balanced equation. For example, if hydrogen is the limiting reactant in the reaction mentioned above, and you start with $1$ mole of hydrogen, you can produce $1$ mole of water because the stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen to water is $2:2$, which simplifies to $1:1$.

It is important to remember that the amount of product formed is always contingent on the limiting reactant. Even in the presence of excess reactants, no additional product can be generated once the limiting reactant has been fully consumed. Thus, being able to accurately identify the limiting reactant is crucial for calculating the amount of product produced in incomplete reactions.
