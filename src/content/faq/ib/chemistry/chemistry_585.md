Atomic size and nuclear charge are two fundamental factors that significantly influence electronegativity. Specifically, an increase in atomic size tends to decrease electronegativity, while a higher nuclear charge generally increases it.

Electronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. This property is essential in chemistry, as it helps explain the nature of chemical bonds and the structure of molecules. The two primary factors that affect electronegativity are atomic size (or atomic radius) and nuclear charge.

Atomic size refers to the overall size of an atom, which is determined by the number of electron shells or energy levels surrounding the nucleus. As atomic size increases, the distance between the nucleus and the outermost electrons also increases. This greater distance diminishes the attractive force that the nucleus exerts on the electrons, thus reducing the atom's ability to attract a bonding pair of electrons. Consequently, atoms with larger atomic sizes tend to exhibit lower electronegativity.

Conversely, nuclear charge refers to the total positive charge resulting from the protons in an atom's nucleus. An atom with a higher nuclear charge exerts a stronger attractive force on its electrons due to the increased positive charge. This enhanced attraction makes it more likely for the atom to draw in a bonding pair of electrons, resulting in higher electronegativity. Therefore, atoms with greater nuclear charges typically have higher electronegativity values.

It is important to recognize that these two factors often oppose each other. For example, as one moves across a period in the periodic table from left to right, both atomic size and nuclear charge increase. However, since the electrons being added enter the same energy level while the nuclear charge rises, the influence of the nuclear charge becomes more pronounced, leading to an overall increase in electronegativity.

In summary, both atomic size and nuclear charge are critical determinants of an atom's electronegativity. Understanding how these factors interact can provide valuable insights into the behavior of atoms in chemical reactions and the properties of the compounds they form.
