Gases exhibit higher entropy than condensed phases, such as liquids and solids, primarily because their particles are more dispersed and possess a greater number of possible configurations.

Entropy is a quantitative measure of disorder or randomness within a system. When discussing gases, liquids, and solids, entropy pertains to the number of ways in which the particles within these states can be arranged. A higher number of potential arrangements corresponds to higher entropy.

In a gaseous state, particles are widely spaced and move freely in all directions. This spatial separation allows for a significantly greater number of possible arrangements, resulting in elevated entropy. Unlike solids and liquids, gas particles are not confined to a specific volume or shape; they can expand to occupy any available space, depending on the prevailing pressure and temperature conditions. This freedom of movement, combined with the minimal intermolecular forces present in gases, contributes to their high entropy.

Conversely, particles in solids and liquids are much more closely packed, which restricts their movement. In solids, particles are tightly arranged in a fixed, orderly structure and can only vibrate around their stationary positions. This limited movement leads to lower entropy due to the restricted number of possible arrangements. In liquids, while particles are still in close proximity, they possess greater mobility compared to solids. As a result, the entropy of liquids is higher than that of solids, but still lower than that of gases.

The concept of entropy is intrinsically linked to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system will always tend to increase over time. This principle explains why gases naturally tend to spread out and mix with their surroundings, thereby augmenting the overall entropy of the system.

In summary, the elevated entropy of gases, in comparison to liquids and solids, arises from the enhanced freedom of movement of their particles and the significantly larger number of possible arrangements. This fundamental concept in thermodynamics elucidates various phenomena observed in chemistry.
