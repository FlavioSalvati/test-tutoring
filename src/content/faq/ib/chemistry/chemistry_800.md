Energy levels and electron shells are crucial concepts in atomic structure, each representing different aspects of an atom's electron configuration. 

**Energy Levels**

Energy levels, often referred to as principal energy levels or quantum numbers, signify the potential energy of an electron within an atom. These levels are typically denoted by the integers $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$, where each level can accommodate a specific number of electrons. As the energy level increases, so does the energy of the electron, and consequently, it is located further from the nucleus.

**Electron Shells**

In contrast, electron shells, also known as atomic orbitals, represent the physical regions where electrons are most likely to be found. Each shell corresponds to a particular energy level and can be subdivided into subshells designated as $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$. These subshells are further divided into orbitals, with each orbital capable of holding a maximum of two electrons. The shapes and sizes of these orbitals differ: $s$ orbitals are spherical, $p$ orbitals have a dumbbell shape, and $d$ and $f$ orbitals possess more intricate geometries.

**Distinction Between Energy Levels and Electron Shells**

While energy levels and electron shells are interconnected in describing the arrangement of electrons in an atom, they are not synonymous. Energy levels primarily pertain to the energy possessed by the electrons, while electron shells focus on their physical locations. For instance, electrons in the first energy level ($n=1$) occupy the first shell, and those in the second energy level ($n=2$) are found in the second shell, and so forth. However, within each shell, electrons can exist in various energy states based on their specific subshell and orbital configurations.

**Conclusion**

In summary, energy levels and electron shells provide two distinct perspectives on the behavior and arrangement of electrons in an atom. Energy levels describe the potential energy of electrons, indicating their relative distance from the nucleus and their energy states. In contrast, electron shells depict the physical spaces where these electrons are likely to be located, offering a spatial representation of the atom's electron configuration.
