Isotopes are distinct variants of a chemical element that possess the same number of protons but differ in their number of neutrons.

The concept of isotopes is a captivating aspect of chemistry that delves into the atomic structure of elements. Each chemical element is characterized by the number of protons in its nucleus, referred to as the atomic number. However, the number of neutrons within the nucleus can vary, leading to the formation of isotopes. For instance, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are both isotopes of carbon; they contain the same number of protons, which is $6$, but have different numbers of neutrons—$6$ for carbon-12 and $8$ for carbon-14.

Although the variation in the number of neutrons does not influence the chemical properties of the element—since these properties are determined by the number of electrons, which equals the number of protons in a neutral atom—it does impact the atomic mass. This is why the atomic mass of an element, as presented on the periodic table, is typically expressed as a decimal number; it represents a weighted average of the masses of the naturally occurring isotopes.

Isotopes can be categorized as either stable or unstable. Stable isotopes remain unchanged over time, while unstable isotopes, known as radioisotopes, undergo radioactive decay. This decay process can emit various types of radiation, which can be detected and measured. This characteristic is harnessed in numerous scientific and medical applications. For example, carbon-14 is utilized in radiocarbon dating to ascertain the age of ancient organic materials, while iodine-131 is employed in the treatment of thyroid cancer.

In conclusion, isotopes enhance our comprehension of atomic structure and provide a wide array of practical applications. They exemplify the complexity and versatility of the elements that constitute our universe.
