A UV-visible spectrometer is composed of four essential components: a light source, a monochromator, a sample holder, and a detector.

The first component, the light source, typically consists of a deuterium lamp for ultraviolet light and a tungsten filament lamp for visible light. These lamps emit a broad spectrum of light that spans both the ultraviolet and visible regions. The light source is vital as it provides the initial energy that the sample will absorb.

The next component is the monochromator, which selects a specific wavelength of light to transmit through the sample. It usually employs a prism or a diffraction grating to separate the incoming light into its constituent wavelengths. By utilizing the monochromator, the spectrometer can scan across a range of wavelengths and measure the absorption at each one, thereby generating a detailed absorption spectrum.

The sample holder, commonly referred to as a cuvette, is where the sample to be analyzed is placed. Typically made of quartz or another material that does not absorb light within the desired range, the cuvette allows the light from the monochromator to pass through the sample. Any light that is absorbed by the sample results in a measurable decrease in light intensity.

Finally, the detector measures the intensity of light after it has passed through the sample. The most prevalent type of detector used is the photomultiplier tube, which converts light into an electrical signal for quantification. This detector records the amount of light that successfully passes through the sample at each wavelength, enabling the spectrometer to construct a comprehensive absorption spectrum.

In summary, a UV-visible spectrometer operates by directing light through a sample and measuring the amount of light absorbed at each wavelength. Each key component—the light source, monochromator, sample holder, and detector—plays a crucial role in this analytical process.
