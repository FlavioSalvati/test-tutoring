Chlorine is a more potent oxidizing agent than iodine, primarily due to its greater electronegativity and enhanced ability to attract electrons.

In the realm of redox reactions, an oxidizing agent is defined as a substance capable of oxidizing other substances, which means it can accept electrons from them. The strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its capacity to attract and accept electrons. Generally, the higher the electronegativity of an element, the greater its ability to pull in electrons, thus enhancing its oxidizing power.

Chlorine (Cl) and iodine (I) are both members of the halogen group, located in Group 17 of the periodic table. Each of these elements possesses seven valence electrons and requires one additional electron to achieve a stable, full outer electron shell. This characteristic makes them naturally inclined to gain electrons, thereby facilitating their roles as oxidizing agents. However, chlorine exhibits a higher electronegativity than iodine, which translates to a stronger capacity for electron attraction. This difference can be attributed to chlorine's smaller atomic radius, allowing its positively charged nucleus to exert a more substantial pull on surrounding electrons.

Moreover, the standard electrode potential of chlorine is higher than that of iodine. The standard electrode potential serves as a gauge of a chemical species' tendency to acquire electrons and undergo reduction. A higher standard electrode potential indicates a greater propensity for electron gain, thereby signifying a stronger oxidizing power.

Additionally, the bond energy of the Cl-Cl bond is lower than that of the I-I bond. This implies that less energy is required to break a Cl-Cl bond compared to an I-I bond, making it easier for chlorine to accept an electron and become reduced.

In summary, the combination of chlorine's higher electronegativity, its elevated standard electrode potential, and its lower bond energy relative to iodine all contribute to its superior oxidizing capabilities.
