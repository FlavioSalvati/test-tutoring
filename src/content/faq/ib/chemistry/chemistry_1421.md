The formula of a hydrate is determined by calculating the ratio of water molecules to the anhydrous compound present in the hydrate.

To establish the formula of a hydrate, it is essential to determine both the number of moles of water and the number of moles of the anhydrous compound contained within the hydrate. This process involves heating the hydrate to remove the water of hydration and subsequently weighing the residual anhydrous compound. The difference in mass before and after heating provides the mass of water lost.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to perform this experiment:

1. **Weigh the Crucible**: Start by weighing a clean, dry crucible along with its lid. Record this mass.

2. **Add the Hydrate**: Introduce a known mass of the hydrate into the crucible and weigh it again. Note this new mass.

3. **Heat the Crucible**: Gently heat the crucible at first, then increase the heat until the hydrate has completely decomposed. This is confirmed when the mass remains constant after cooling the crucible and its contents.

4. **Calculate Mass of Water Lost**: The difference in mass before and after heating indicates the mass of water that has been lost during the process.

5. **Determine Moles of Water Lost**: To find the number of moles of water lost, use the molar mass of water, which is approximately $18 \, \text{g/mol}$. Divide the mass of water lost by $18$ to obtain the number of moles of water.

6. **Determine Moles of Anhydrous Compound**: Next, calculate the molar mass of the anhydrous compound using the periodic table. Divide the mass of the remaining anhydrous compound by its molar mass to find the number of moles of the anhydrous compound.

7. **Find the Mole Ratio**: To determine the simplest whole number ratio of moles of water to moles of the anhydrous compound, divide both values by the smaller of the two. This will yield the number of water molecules per formula unit of the anhydrous compound, ultimately providing the formula of the hydrate. For instance, if the ratio is $5:1$, the formula of the hydrate is expressed as $M \cdot 5\text{H}_2\text{O}$, where $M$ represents the formula of the anhydrous compound.

**Safety Precautions**: It is crucial to prioritize safety while conducting this experiment. Always use tongs to handle hot equipment, and ensure that the crucible is fully cooled before weighing it again.
