Crystal field theory (CFT) provides a framework for understanding the color, magnetic properties, and structures of transition metal complexes.

CFT is a theoretical model that elucidates how the degeneracies of electron orbital states, particularly the $d$ or $f$ orbitals, are disrupted by a static electric field generated by a surrounding charge distribution. This theory is particularly relevant for analyzing the behavior of transition metal complexes, which are characterized by incompletely filled $d$ orbitals that can accept electrons from ligands to form coordination complexes.

In the context of transition metal complexes, the surrounding charge distribution is primarily supplied by ligandsâ€”ions or molecules that donate electron pairs to the metal center. As these ligands approach the metal ion, they influence the degenerate (equal-energy) $d$ orbitals of the metal ion through their electric fields. This interaction results in the splitting of the $d$ orbital energy levels into two distinct sets with different energy values. The degree of this splitting is dependent on both the nature of the ligands and the geometry of the complex.

The energy splitting of the $d$ orbitals accounts for several observable properties of transition metal complexes. For example, the color of these complexes arises from their absorption of specific wavelengths of light, which corresponds to the energy difference between the split $d$ orbitals. When light is absorbed, an electron is promoted from a lower-energy $d$ orbital to a higher-energy $d$ orbital. The wavelengths of light that are not absorbed are transmitted or reflected, producing the color we perceive.

Moreover, crystal field theory also explains the magnetic properties of transition metal complexes. If there are unpaired electrons present in the $d$ orbitals, the complex exhibits paramagnetism, meaning it is attracted to a magnetic field. Conversely, if all electrons are paired, the complex is diamagnetic and does not respond to a magnetic field.

Finally, CFT allows us to predict the structure of the complex, whether it is tetrahedral, square planar, or octahedral, among other geometries. The geometry that minimizes the overall energy of the complex is the one that will be adopted. This is influenced by the arrangement of ligands around the metal ion, which aims to minimize electron-electron repulsion between the electrons in the $d$ orbitals and the negative charge from the ligands.
