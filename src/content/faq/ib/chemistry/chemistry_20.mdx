Alkenes are hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond, which consists of a sigma bond and a pi bond. The pi bond arises from the lateral overlap of p orbitals, creating a region of high electron density situated above and below the molecular plane. This concentrated area of negative charge makes the double bond particularly attractive to electrophiles, which are species that are electron-deficient.

The process known as electrophilic addition is a prevalent reaction involving alkenes. During this reaction, an electrophile is drawn to the electron-rich double bond of the alkene. The electrophile accepts a pair of electrons from the double bond, forming a new bond with one of the carbon atoms. This interaction results in the cleavage of the pi bond, leaving behind a positively charged carbon atom, referred to as a carbocation. Subsequently, this carbocation is attacked by a nucleophile, which donates a pair of electrons to establish a new bond. The outcome of this reaction is the addition of two new groups across the original double bond.

Electrophilic addition is a crucial reaction in organic chemistry, as it enables the synthesis of a diverse array of products from simple alkene precursors. The specific nature of both the electrophile and the nucleophile, as well as the reaction conditions, can be manipulated to yield various products. This versatility makes electrophilic addition an essential reaction for constructing complex organic molecules.

In conclusion, the high electron density associated with the carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes renders them highly susceptible to electrophiles. This phenomenon facilitates electrophilic addition reactions, where both an electrophile and a nucleophile are incorporated across the double bond. These reactions form a foundational aspect of organic chemistry, enabling the production of a wide range of compounds starting from simple alkenes.
