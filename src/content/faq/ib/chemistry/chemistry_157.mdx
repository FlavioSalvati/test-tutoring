Paramagnetic and diamagnetic compounds exhibit distinct behaviors in the presence of magnetic fields, primarily due to the arrangement of their electrons.

**Paramagnetic Compounds**  
Paramagnetic compounds contain one or more unpaired electrons in their atomic or molecular orbitals. These unpaired electrons possess magnetic moments that tend to align with an external magnetic field, resulting in an attraction towards the field. This magnetic behavior is sensitive to temperature; as the temperature increases, thermal agitation can disrupt the alignment of the magnetic moments. Common examples of paramagnetic compounds include oxygen ($O_2$) and iron(III) chloride ($FeCl_3$).

**Diamagnetic Compounds**  
In contrast, diamagnetic compounds have all their electrons paired within their atomic or molecular orbitals. The magnetic moments of these paired electrons cancel each other out, leading to no net magnetic moment. When subjected to a magnetic field, diamagnetic materials develop a weak induced magnetic moment that opposes the applied field, leading to a slight repulsion. This property is independent of temperature, as the paired nature of the electrons remains unaffected by thermal agitation. Typical examples of diamagnetic compounds include water ($H_2O$) and sodium chloride ($NaCl$).

**Experimental Identification**  
The distinction between paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances can be experimentally determined using methods such as the Gouy balance method or the Faraday method. These techniques measure changes in weight or magnetic susceptibility of a sample when exposed to a magnetic field. The observed results help classify the compound as either paramagnetic or diamagnetic.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, the fundamental difference between paramagnetic and diamagnetic compounds lies in their electron configurations and their responses to magnetic fields. Paramagnetic compounds, characterized by unpaired electrons, are attracted to magnetic fields, whereas diamagnetic compounds, with all electrons paired, are repelled. Understanding these differences is crucial in various fields of chemistry, including inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, and materials science.
