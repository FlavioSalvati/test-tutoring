The activation energy can be determined experimentally using the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant of a reaction to the temperature at which the reaction occurs. To achieve this, a series of experiments measuring the reaction rates at various temperatures must be conducted.

The Arrhenius equation is given by:

$$
k = Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}
$$

In this equation, $k$ represents the rate constant of the reaction, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature measured in Kelvin.

To experimentally determine the activation energy, you will perform several reaction rate experiments at different temperatures. For each experiment, you will measure both the rate of the reaction and the corresponding temperature. This process will yield a set of values for the rate constant $k$ and the temperature $T$ for each trial.

With these values, you can create a plot of $\ln(k)$ against $\frac{1}{T}$. According to the Arrhenius equation, this plot should yield a straight line, where the slope of the line is given by $-\frac{E_a}{R}$. By calculating the slope, you can then derive the activation energy $E_a$ for the reaction. Understanding the activation energy is crucial as it provides insights into how the frequency and energy of molecular collisions influence reaction rates, which is fundamental to interpreting Arrhenius plots.

It is important to note that this method assumes the activation energy remains constant over the range of temperatures used in the experiments. This assumption is typically valid for a wide variety of reactions; however, there may be instances where the activation energy varies with temperature.

Additionally, this approach assumes that the pre-exponential factor $A$ is constant. This factor reflects the frequency of collisions between reactant molecules that have the correct orientation for a reaction to occur. Although $A$ may vary with temperature, the changes are often minor enough that they can be disregarded for many reactions. For further detailed explanations of these concepts and the specific calculations involved, additional resources are available.

In summary, to find the activation energy of a reaction, utilize the Arrhenius equation and conduct experiments at various temperatures. By plotting $\ln(k)$ against $\frac{1}{T}$ from the experimental data, you will obtain a line. The slope of this line provides the activation energy, assuming that both the activation energy and the molecular collision frequency remain relatively constant with temperature.
