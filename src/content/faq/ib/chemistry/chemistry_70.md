The electron configuration of an atom refers to the arrangement of its electrons within atomic orbitals. This configuration is established based on three fundamental principles: the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule. Together, these principles dictate how electrons are added to the atom, progressively filling the most energetically favorable orbitals.

The **Aufbau principle** states that electrons fill the lowest energy levels first. Consequently, the $1s$ orbital, which is closest to the nucleus and possesses the lowest energy, is filled before the $2s$ orbital, and this pattern continues with higher energy levels. The term "Aufbau" is derived from German, meaning "building up," which aptly describes the sequential addition of electrons to form the atom.

The **Pauli exclusion principle** asserts that each atomic orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons, provided that these electrons have opposite spins. This principle arises from the quantum mechanical nature of electrons, classified as fermions, which inherently obey the exclusion rule. As a result, no two electrons within an atom can share the same set of quantum numbers.

**Hund's rule** explains that when electrons occupy degenerate orbitals (orbitals of the same energy), they will first fill these orbitals singly before pairing up. This behavior occurs because electrons are negatively charged and repel one another; thus, it is energetically more favorable for them to occupy separate orbitals whenever possible.

Typically, the electron configuration is expressed as a series of numbers and letters that denote the energy levels, the types of orbitals, and the number of electrons in each orbital. For instance, the electron configuration of oxygen, which has an atomic number of $8$, is written as $1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$. This notation signifies that there are two electrons in the $1s$ orbital, two in the $2s$ orbital, and four in the $2p$ orbital.

A thorough understanding of electron configuration is essential in chemistry, as it elucidates the chemical behavior of atoms, including their bonding tendencies and reactivity. Moreover, it serves as the foundation for the periodic table, where elements within the same group exhibit similar electron configurations and, consequently, similar chemical properties.
