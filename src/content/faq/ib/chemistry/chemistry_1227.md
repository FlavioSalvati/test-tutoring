Intermediates in reaction mechanisms are temporary species formed and consumed throughout the reaction process.

More specifically, intermediates are molecules or ions produced during one step of a reaction mechanism and consumed in a subsequent step. They do not appear in the overall balanced chemical equation for the reaction, as they are generated and utilized during the course of the reaction. This characteristic differentiates them from reactants, which are consumed, and products, which are generated in a chemical reaction.

Intermediates play a vital role in elucidating the molecular-level details of reaction mechanisms. They are often involved in the rate-determining step, which is the slowest stage of the reaction mechanism and ultimately sets the overall rate of the reaction. By examining the intermediates and the steps in which they participate, chemists can enhance their understanding of the reaction mechanism and find ways to control or manipulate it.

For example, in the mechanism for the formation of sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide ($\text{SO}_3$) is an intermediate generated in the first step. It subsequently reacts with water in the second step to yield sulfuric acid, which is the final product. By comprehending the role of this intermediate, chemists can adjust the reaction conditions to optimize the production of sulfuric acid.

Moreover, intermediates can also be instrumental in identifying the pathway of a reaction. The detection of an intermediate during a reaction can provide evidence supporting a specific reaction pathway. For instance, if a particular intermediate is observed, it may indicate that the reaction is proceeding via one mechanism rather than an alternative.

In conclusion, intermediates are essential for understanding and controlling chemical reactions. They offer valuable insights into the steps of a reaction mechanism, the reaction rate, and the overall pathway of the reaction.
