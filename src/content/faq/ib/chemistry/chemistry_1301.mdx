A Gilman reagent, also referred to as an organocopper reagent, is a specific type of organometallic compound that plays a crucial role in organic chemistry. Named after the American chemist Henry Gilman, who first discovered it, a Gilman reagent has the general formula $R_2CuLi$, where $R$ denotes an alkyl or aryl group.

When a Gilman reagent reacts with a carbonyl compound, a nucleophilic addition reaction takes place. Carbonyl compounds feature a polar double bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms, which makes the carbon atom electrophilic. This means that the electrophilic carbon is attracted to electron-rich species, such as the nucleophilic Gilman reagent.

During the reaction, the Gilman reagent attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen double bond. This process results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, while the oxygen atom transitions to a single bond with the carbon, carrying a negative charge. Subsequently, this negatively charged oxygen atom abstracts a proton from a solvent molecule, ultimately yielding an alcohol.

This reaction is particularly valuable in organic synthesis because it facilitates the creation of new carbon-carbon bonds, a critical step in constructing complex organic molecules. Notably, Gilman reagents can react with a diverse range of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, and esters, which makes them versatile tools in the realm of organic chemistry.

In summary, the interaction between a Gilman reagent and a carbonyl compound involves a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon, resulting in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond and the production of an alcohol. This reaction is a fundamental process in organic chemistry and is widely utilized in the synthesis of intricate organic molecules.
