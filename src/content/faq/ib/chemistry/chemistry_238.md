Standard entropies can be employed to calculate absolute entropies by utilizing the third law of thermodynamics.

The third law of thermodynamics asserts that the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is precisely equal to zero. This principle establishes a reference point for measuring the absolute entropies of substances at any temperature. Standard entropy, denoted as $S^\circ$, refers to the absolute entropy of a substance under standard conditions, which typically involve a pressure of $1 \, \text{atm}$ and a specified temperature, usually $25^\circ \text{C}$.

To ascertain the absolute entropy of a substance at a specific temperature, one can start with the standard entropies of various substances at $25^\circ \text{C}$ and then apply the heat capacity to account for the temperature difference. Heat capacity, defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a substance by one degree, is essential for calculating the change in entropy as the temperature transitions from $25^\circ \text{C}$ to the desired temperature.

Standard entropy values for numerous substances have been experimentally determined and are compiled in tables. These values are instrumental in performing calculations related to entropy changes during chemical reactions. For instance, the standard entropy change for a chemical reaction can be computed by subtracting the sum of the standard entropies of the reactants from the sum of the standard entropies of the products.

In summary, standard entropies offer a practical method for determining the absolute entropies of substances at any temperature. By using the third law of thermodynamics as a foundational reference and adjusting for temperature variations through heat capacity, one can effectively calculate the absolute entropy of a substance. This concept is fundamental in thermodynamics and is critical for understanding the spontaneity of chemical reactions.
