The strength of metallic bonding exhibits distinct trends within the periodic table, generally increasing across a period while decreasing down a group.

As one moves from left to right across a period, the strength of metallic bonds tends to increase. This trend can be attributed primarily to the growing number of delocalised electrons per atom. With the increase in valence electrons, which are free to move and contribute to the 'sea' of delocalised electrons, the attraction between these electrons and the positively charged metal ions intensifies, resulting in stronger metallic bonds. For instance, aluminium, located in the third period, demonstrates stronger metallic bonds compared to sodium within the same period, as aluminium possesses a greater number of delocalised electrons.

Conversely, as one descends a group in the periodic table, the strength of metallic bonds typically decreases. This decrease is largely due to the increase in atomic radius. As the atomic radius enlarges, the distance between the metal ions increases, thereby weakening the attractive force between the positive ions and the delocalised electrons. For example, potassium, found in the fourth period, exhibits weaker metallic bonds than sodium from the third period, primarily because of its larger atomic radius. For a more comprehensive understanding of how atomic size influences bonding, further reading is recommended.

Additionally, the number of filled energy levels, or electron shells, plays a significant role in the strength of metallic bonds. More energy levels result in increased shielding between the positively charged nucleus and the delocalised electrons, which further weakens the metallic bond. This factor contributes to the observed decrease in metallic bonding strength down a group, as atoms possess more filled energy levels. A deeper exploration of the arrangement of groups and periods can provide additional insights into these trends.

**Summary for IB Chemistry Students:** In the periodic table, the strength of metallic bonding increases from left to right across a period due to the presence of additional delocalised electrons. However, it decreases down a group as the atomic radius expands, diminishing the attraction between the delocalised electrons and the metal ions. Furthermore, the presence of additional electron shells increases electron shielding, which also contributes to the reduction in bond strength.
