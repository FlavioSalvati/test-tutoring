A molecule is defined as a group of atoms that are chemically bonded together, whereas a crystal lattice refers to a three-dimensional, repeating arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules.

A molecule represents the smallest unit of a chemical element or compound that retains the chemical properties of that entity. Molecules are composed of atoms that are interconnected by chemical bonds, which arise from the sharing or transfer of electrons between them. Certain elements, such as oxygen and chlorine, have a tendency to bond with other atoms to form molecules. Notably, the molecules of pure elements consist solely of one type of atom. For example, an oxygen molecule is formed from two oxygen atoms, denoted as $O_2$. To further explore the formation and structure of molecules, you may refer to additional resources.

In contrast, a crystal lattice is characterized by a three-dimensional structure formed from a repeating pattern of atoms, ions, or molecules. This recurring arrangement is referred to as the unit cell, which serves as the fundamental building block of the crystal lattice. By repeating the unit cell in three dimensions, the overall crystal structure is established. The specific arrangement of atoms within the unit cell, along with its shape and dimensions, can vary, resulting in different types of crystal lattices. For instance, table salt, or sodium chloride ($NaCl$), exhibits a cubic lattice where each sodium ion is surrounded by six chloride ions and vice versa. For more information on the formation of these structures, please refer to relevant literature.

The primary distinction between a molecule and a crystal lattice lies in their structural characteristics and composition. A molecule is a distinct entity composed of two or more atoms, whereas a crystal lattice consists of a vast assembly of atoms, ions, or molecules organized in a highly ordered, repetitive pattern. Additionally, the properties of a molecule are influenced by the types of atoms it contains and their arrangement, while the properties of a crystal lattice depend on the types of particles within it, their arrangement, and the specific type of lattice structure formed. To delve deeper into how different types of atoms combine to create these structures, please consult supplementary materials.
