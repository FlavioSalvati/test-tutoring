A chromatogram is analyzed by identifying and quantifying its components based on their retention times and the areas under their respective peaks.

To elaborate, a chromatogram is the graphical output of the chromatography process and displays a series of peaks, each corresponding to a different component within the mixture. The first step in analyzing a chromatogram involves identifying these components. This is achieved by comparing the retention times of the peaks in the sample chromatogram to those of known reference substances. The retention time is defined as the duration it takes for a component to travel from the injection point to the detector. Since different substances exhibit distinct retention times, this characteristic can be utilized for their identification.

Following identification, the next step is to determine the quantity of each component. This is accomplished by measuring the area beneath each peak. A larger area indicates a greater quantity of that component in the mixture, as the height and width of a peak are proportional to the concentration of that component present in the sample. Consequently, measuring the area under the peak allows for the determination of the relative amounts of each component.

It is essential to ensure that the baseline of the chromatogram is clearly defined and that the peaks are well-resolved for accurate analysis. Overlapping peaks can complicate the measurement of the area under each peak, leading to potential errors in quantification.

Moreover, calibrating the chromatography system with known standards prior to sample analysis is vital. This calibration process ensures that the retention times and peak areas are accurate and reliable. Calibration involves running a sample of known composition through the system and recording the resulting chromatogram, which serves as a reference point for comparing against the sample chromatogram.

In summary, analyzing a chromatogram entails identifying the components based on their retention times and quantifying them by measuring the area under their peaks. This process requires a clear baseline, well-resolved peaks, and proper calibration with known standards to ensure accuracy and reliability in the results.
