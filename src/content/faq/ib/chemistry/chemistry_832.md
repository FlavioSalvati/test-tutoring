The similarities in properties across a transition series arise from the analogous electron configurations of the involved elements.

In a transition series, the elements exhibit comparable electron configurations because they sequentially fill the same d-orbital. This characteristic is fundamental to transition metals, defined as elements with atoms that possess an incomplete d sub-shell or that can form cations with an incomplete d sub-shell. The d-orbital has the capacity to accommodate up to $10$ electrons, and as one progresses from left to right across a transition series, electrons are added incrementally to this same d-orbital.

This systematic addition of electrons to the same orbital leads to the elements in a transition series exhibiting similar chemical and physical properties. For instance, these elements tend to form colored compounds, display multiple oxidation states, and are efficient conductors of heat and electricity. Such properties stem directly from the comparable electron configurations found within the transition series.

Moreover, the electron configuration significantly influences the reactivity of the elements. As one moves across a transition series, the increasing nuclear charge is counterbalanced by the addition of electrons to the same d-orbital, which serves to shield the outer electrons from the intensified nuclear charge. Consequently, the reactivity of the elements remains relatively stable across the transition series.

However, it is crucial to recognize that while the elements within a transition series share similar properties, they are not identical. Minor variations in electron configuration can lead to notable differences in chemical behavior. For example, chromium and copper deviate from the typical electron configuration trends observed in transition series, resulting in distinct chemical properties.

In summary, the resemblance in properties among the elements in a transition series is primarily due to their similar electron configurations as they populate the same d-orbital. This uniformity fosters consistent chemical and physical properties, although significant behavioral differences may arise from slight variations in electron configuration.
