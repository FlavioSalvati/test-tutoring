Transition metals are distinguished by their capacity to form complex ions, which arises from their ability to both donate and accept electrons, as well as their possession of multiple oxidation states.

The unique property of transition metals to form complex ions is largely attributed to their electronic configuration. Specifically, transition metals have partially filled $d$ orbitals, which enable them to accept electrons from ligands. Ligands are molecules that can donate a pair of electrons to create a coordinate bond with the metal ion. This ability to accept electrons makes transition metals particularly well-suited for forming complex ions.

Another significant factor is the presence of multiple oxidation states among transition metals. These variable oxidation states allow transition metals to create a diverse array of complex ions, each with different charges. The number of electrons that a transition metal can donate or accept changes based on its oxidation state. For instance, iron can exist in both the +2 and +3 oxidation states, allowing it to form distinct complex ions such as $$[Fe(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$$ and $$[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-}$$. 

The concept of coordination number also plays a crucial role in the formation of complex ions. The coordination number refers to the number of coordinate bonds that the central metal ion can form. Transition metals typically exhibit coordination numbers of 2, 4, or 6, although higher coordination numbers are also possible. This versatility in coordination number enables transition metals to form complex ions with a wide variety of ligands.

Additionally, the chelate effect can influence the formation of complex ions. This phenomenon occurs when a single ligand forms multiple bonds to a central metal ion, resulting in a ring-like structure. Chelating ligands can enhance the stability of a complex ion, thereby increasing its likelihood of formation. The diverse colors observed in complex ions can be understood through their electronic transitions, which are dictated by their unique arrangements of electrons.

In summary, transition metals form complex ions due to their unfilled $d$ orbitals that allow for electron acceptance from ligands, coupled with their ability to exist in various oxidation states. This, along with their adaptable coordination numbers and the stabilizing effects of chelating ligands, enables transition metals to create a wide range of varied and stable complex ions.
