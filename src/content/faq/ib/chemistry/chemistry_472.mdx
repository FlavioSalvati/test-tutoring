Catalysts play a crucial role in chemical reactions by modifying the reaction mechanism and providing an alternative pathway that requires lower activation energy.

A catalyst is a substance that accelerates the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed during the process. It achieves this by offering an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy compared to the original pathway. The activation energy, denoted as $E_a$, is the minimum energy necessary for a reaction to occur. By reducing this energy barrier, a greater number of reactant particles can acquire enough energy to react, which results in an increased reaction rate.

The mechanism by which catalysts operate involves the formation of temporary bonds with reactant molecules, leading to the creation of an intermediate species. This intermediate is typically more reactive than the initial reactants, facilitating a more favorable pathway for the reaction to proceed. At the conclusion of the reaction, the catalyst is regenerated in its original form and is therefore available to participate in subsequent reactions. This characteristic is what distinguishes catalysts from reactants, as they are not consumed in the reaction.

Catalysts can be classified into two main types: homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous catalysts exist in the same phase (solid, liquid, or gas) as the reactants, while heterogeneous catalysts are in a different phase. Homogeneous catalysts generally function by forming a temporary complex with the reactants, which then rearranges to produce the desired products while releasing the catalyst. In contrast, heterogeneous catalysts usually operate by adsorbing reactants onto their surface, where the reaction occurs more readily.

In addition to enhancing reaction rates, catalysts can also influence the reaction mechanism itself. The reaction mechanism refers to the series of elementary steps that take place during the overall chemical change. A catalyst can modify this mechanism by providing an alternative sequence of steps that exhibits a lower overall activation energy. This modification can lead to the formation of different products if the catalyst enables a pathway for an alternative reaction to occur.

In summary, catalysts alter the mechanism of a reaction by providing an alternative pathway with reduced activation energy. They achieve this by forming temporary bonds with reactants, resulting in the generation of a more reactive intermediate species. Consequently, this facilitates a faster reaction and has the potential to yield different products.
