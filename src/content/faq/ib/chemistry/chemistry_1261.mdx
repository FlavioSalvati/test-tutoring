A catalyst plays a crucial role in chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy, thereby facilitating the occurrence of the reaction.

To elaborate, a catalyst is a substance that accelerates the rate of a chemical reaction by providing an alternative pathway that requires less activation energy. The activation energy is defined as the minimum amount of energy necessary for a reaction to take place. By reducing this energy threshold, a catalyst enables a greater number of molecules to possess sufficient energy to react, which in turn enhances the reaction rate.

Catalysts operate by offering a surface for reactants to converge, thus decreasing the energy required for the reaction to proceed. They achieve this by forming temporary bonds with the reactants, positioning them in close proximity and the correct orientation for effective interaction. This mechanism effectively lowers the energy barrier that must be surmounted for the reaction to occur.

It is essential to highlight that although catalysts expedite reactions, they remain unchanged throughout the process. They do not appear in the final products of the reaction; instead, they are regenerated and can be reused. This characteristic allows even a small quantity of catalyst to exert a significant influence on the reaction rate.

Furthermore, catalysts do not alter the overall energy change of a reaction. They solely facilitate the initiation of the reaction by diminishing the activation energy. Consequently, the final products retain the same energy level as they would in the absence of a catalyst. This is because catalysts do not modify the potential energy of the reactants or products; they only affect the energy associated with the transition state.

Grasping the function of catalysts and their impact on activation energy is vital in various fields of chemistry, particularly in industrial applications where they are commonly employed to accelerate reactions and enhance efficiency. For instance, in the synthesis of ammonia via the Haber process, an iron catalyst is utilized to increase the reaction rate between nitrogen and hydrogen.
