Fluorescence spectroscopy is a technique used to identify compounds by detecting their unique light emission patterns when they are excited by incident light.

This form of spectroscopy capitalizes on the phenomenon of fluorescence, which occurs when a compound absorbs light at a specific wavelength and is subsequently excited to a higher energy state. As the compound returns to its ground state, it emits light at a different wavelength, a process referred to as fluorescence.

Each compound exhibits a distinct pattern of light absorption and emission, known as its fluorescence spectrum. This uniqueness arises from the specific energy levels of the electrons within the compound's atoms. By analyzing this spectrum, we can effectively identify the compound in question. Additionally, the intensity of the emitted fluorescence provides valuable information regarding the concentration of the compound present in the sample.

The fluorescence spectroscopy process begins by illuminating the sample with light, typically ultraviolet or visible light. The compounds within the sample absorb this light, transitioning to a higher energy state. After a brief period, usually on the order of a few nanoseconds, the compounds return to their ground state and emit light at a longer wavelength. This emitted light is then collected and analyzed by a detector.

The detector measures the intensity of light at various wavelengths, generating a fluorescence spectrum. This spectrum can be compared to known spectra of different compounds, allowing for the identification of those present in the sample. Furthermore, the intensity of fluorescence at specific wavelengths can be utilized to ascertain the concentration of the compounds.

Fluorescence spectroscopy is an invaluable tool across multiple disciplines, including chemistry, biology, and medicine. It is capable of identifying and quantifying a broad range of compounds, from small organic molecules to large biological macromolecules. Notably, it is a non-destructive technique, meaning that the sample remains unaltered and intact during the analysis. This characteristic makes fluorescence spectroscopy especially useful for studying sensitive or precious samples.
