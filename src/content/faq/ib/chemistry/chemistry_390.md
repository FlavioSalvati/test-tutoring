Energy levels and electron shells are two fundamental concepts in atomic structure that, while related, represent different aspects of an atom's electron configuration.

**Energy Levels**

Energy levels, also known as principal energy levels or quantum numbers, describe the potential energy of electrons within an atom. These levels are theoretical constructs and are typically represented by whole numbers: $1$, $2$, $3$, and so forth. Each energy level can accommodate a specific number of electrons. As the energy level increases, so does the energy of the electron, which means that the electron is located further away from the nucleus.

**Electron Shells**

In contrast, electron shells, sometimes referred to as atomic orbitals, are the physical regions where electrons are most likely to be found. Each shell corresponds to a particular energy level and is further subdivided into subshells labeled as $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$. These subshells can be divided into orbitals, with each orbital capable of holding a maximum of two electrons. The shapes and sizes of these orbitals differ: $s$ orbitals are spherical, $p$ orbitals take on a dumbbell shape, and $d$ and $f$ orbitals exhibit more complex geometries.

**Distinction Between Energy Levels and Electron Shells**

Although energy levels and electron shells are interconnected in describing electron arrangements within an atom, they are not synonymous. Energy levels pertain primarily to the energy of the electrons, while electron shells refer to their physical locations. For instance, electrons in the first energy level ($n=1$) occupy the first shell, those in the second energy level ($n=2$) reside in the second shell, and so on. However, within each shell, electrons can occupy various energy states depending on their specific subshell and orbital.

**Conclusion**

In summary, energy levels and electron shells provide two distinct perspectives on the behavior and arrangement of electrons within an atom. Energy levels indicate the potential energy of electrons, revealing their relative distances from the nucleus and their energy states. Conversely, electron shells offer a spatial representation, illustrating where these electrons are likely to be found and enriching our understanding of atomic structure.
