Electronegativity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, representing an atom's ability to attract a bonding pair of electrons. This property varies systematically across the periodic table. 

As you move from left to right across a period, electronegativity tends to increase. This trend can be attributed to the rising nuclear charge, which is the total positive charge of the nucleus due to the increasing number of protons. The greater positive charge exerts a stronger attractive force on the bonding electrons, thereby enhancing the atom's electronegativity. Importantly, the number of energy levels (or electron shells) remains constant across a period, meaning that the increased nuclear charge is not counteracted by additional shielding from inner electrons. Consequently, this results in a more significant pull on the bonding electrons, leading to an increase in electronegativity.

Conversely, as you move down a group in the periodic table, electronegativity decreases. This is primarily because the atomic radius, which is the distance from the nucleus to the outermost shell of electrons, increases. Each successive element in a group has an additional energy level, which increases the distance between the nucleus and the bonding electrons. This larger distance diminishes the attractive force that the nucleus exerts on these electrons. Additionally, the phenomenon known as shielding occurs, where inner electron shells partially block the nucleus's positive charge from reaching the outer electrons. The combination of increased atomic radius and shielding leads to a reduced ability of the atom to attract bonding electrons, thereby decreasing its electronegativity.

To gain a deeper understanding of these concepts, it is beneficial to explore how electron attraction is influenced, how these factors impact an atom's capacity to gain electrons, and the role of nuclear charge in shaping electronegativity.

**IB Chemistry Tutor Summary**: Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's attraction to bonding electrons. It increases across a period due to the rise in nuclear charge without additional shielding, resulting in a stronger pull on electrons. Conversely, electronegativity decreases down a group as the atomic radius increases and shielding reduces the nucleus's effective pull on electrons. Understanding these trends is essential for grasping the dynamics of chemical bonding.
