The Favorskii rearrangement is an intriguing organic reaction that transforms a halogenated carbonyl compound into either a carboxylic acid or a ketone. This reaction is named after the Russian chemist Alexei Favorskii, who first described it in the late 19th century. The rearrangement is favored under either acidic or basic conditions, with a suitable halogenated carbonyl compound serving as the substrate.

In a basic environment, the reaction begins with the deprotonation of the carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of an enolate ion. This enolate ion then undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, where the halogen atom is displaced, resulting in the formation of a cyclic intermediate. Subsequently, this intermediate is hydrolyzed to yield the final product.

Conversely, under acidic conditions, the carbonyl oxygen is first protonated. This protonation increases the susceptibility of the carbonyl carbon to nucleophilic attack by the halogen atom. The result is the formation of a cyclic intermediate, which, after hydrolysis, produces the final product.

The substrate for the Favorskii rearrangement is typically a halogenated carbonyl compound. The halogen atom is crucial in the reaction mechanism as it acts as a leaving group during the formation of the cyclic intermediate. Additionally, the carbonyl group is vital, as it serves as the site for nucleophilic attack and is incorporated into the final product.

The Favorskii rearrangement is a valuable tool in synthetic chemistry, facilitating the conversion of readily available starting materials into more complex structures. However, it is essential to control the reaction conditions carefully to ensure the desired rearrangement occurs. Excessively acidic or basic conditions can lead to side reactions or the decomposition of the starting material. Therefore, achieving a balanced environment is crucial for optimal conditions in the Favorskii rearrangement.
