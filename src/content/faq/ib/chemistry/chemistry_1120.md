Boron trifluoride, denoted as BF$_3$, is classified as a planar molecule due to its trigonal planar molecular geometry, which arises from the sp$^2$ hybridization of the boron atom.

The BF$_3$ molecule comprises one boron atom at its center surrounded by three fluorine atoms. The arrangement of these atoms, along with the distribution of electron pairs around the central boron atom, determines the molecular geometry.

In BF$_3$, the boron atom possesses three valence electrons, while each fluorine atom has seven valence electrons. When boron forms covalent bonds with the three fluorine atoms, it shares one of its electrons with each fluorine atom. This sharing allows the boron atom to achieve a full outer shell of electrons, and similarly, each fluorine atom also attains a complete outer shell.

The electron pairs in the boron trifluoride molecule are organized to minimize repulsion, following the principles of Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. According to VSEPR theory, the electron pairs will adopt a trigonal planar configuration, which is a flat, three-sided arrangement. This configuration represents the most stable arrangement for the three bonding electron pairs, resulting in the molecule's planar shape.

Additionally, the boron atom in BF$_3$ experiences sp$^2$ hybridization. Hybridization refers to the process in which atomic orbitals combine to form new, equivalent hybrid orbitals. In the case of sp$^2$ hybridization, one s orbital and two p orbitals of the boron atom merge to create three sp$^2$ hybrid orbitals. These hybrid orbitals are arranged in a trigonal planar geometry, which reinforces the planar structure of the boron trifluoride molecule.

In conclusion, boron trifluoride is regarded as a planar molecule due to its sp$^2$ hybridization and the spatial arrangement of its electron pairs, as predicted by VSEPR theory.
