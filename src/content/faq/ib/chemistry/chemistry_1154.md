A negative change in Gibbs free energy indicates that a reaction is spontaneous, meaning it will occur without the need for external energy input.

To elaborate, the Gibbs free energy change, represented as $\Delta G$, is a thermodynamic potential that quantifies the maximum reversible work a system can perform under conditions of constant temperature and pressure. Named after the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs, who introduced this concept in the 19th century, the Gibbs free energy change plays a critical role in thermodynamics and is essential for assessing the spontaneity of chemical reactions.

When $\Delta G$ is negative, it signifies that the reaction is exothermic, meaning energy is released, which facilitates spontaneity. This occurs because the system transitions from a higher energy state to a lower energy stateâ€”a more stable configuration. In such cases, the reaction can proceed autonomously without requiring any external energy, continuing until equilibrium is achieved.

Conversely, if $\Delta G$ is positive, the reaction is classified as endothermic, indicating that it absorbs energy and is therefore non-spontaneous. In this scenario, the system requires an external energy source to initiate the reaction. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that a non-spontaneous reaction can still take place under specific conditions, such as the presence of a continuous energy supply.

Additionally, the value of $\Delta G$ provides insight into the equilibrium of the reaction. When $\Delta G$ equals zero, the system is at equilibrium, signifying that the rate of the forward reaction matches the rate of the reverse reaction.

In summary, a negative Gibbs free energy change is a crucial indicator of a spontaneous reaction, suggesting that the reaction can occur without any external energy input as the system moves toward a more stable, lower energy state. This concept is fundamental for understanding the feasibility and spontaneity of chemical reactions.
