The first law of thermodynamics is fundamentally connected to enthalpy changes, as it governs the principle of energy conservation in chemical reactions.

The first law of thermodynamics, often referred to as the law of energy conservation, asserts that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or transformed. This principle directly relates to enthalpy changes occurring during chemical reactions. Enthalpy, denoted as $H$, represents the total energy of a thermodynamic system. This includes the internal energy, which is the energy needed to create the system, as well as the energy required to make space for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure.

In the context of a chemical reaction, the change in enthalpy, represented as $\Delta H$, quantifies the total energy absorbed or released during the reaction. It is calculated as the difference between the enthalpy of the products and that of the reactants. A reaction that absorbs energy is classified as endothermic, resulting in a positive $\Delta H$. Conversely, a reaction that releases energy is termed exothermic, which corresponds to a negative $\Delta H$.

The first law of thermodynamics guarantees that the total energy change in the universe remains constant, or zero. This implies that the energy absorbed or released in a chemical reaction must be balanced by an equal amount of energy change elsewhere in the universe. For instance, in an exothermic reaction, the energy released is transferred to the surroundings, leading to an increase in their temperature. On the other hand, during an endothermic reaction, the energy absorbed is drawn from the surroundings, resulting in a decrease in their temperature.

In conclusion, the first law of thermodynamics and enthalpy changes are deeply interconnected. The law of energy conservation ensures that the energy change occurring in a chemical reaction, as measured by the change in enthalpy, is balanced by an equal and opposite energy change in the surroundings. This essential principle is foundational to our understanding of energy transfer in chemical reactions and serves as a key concept within the realm of thermodynamics.
