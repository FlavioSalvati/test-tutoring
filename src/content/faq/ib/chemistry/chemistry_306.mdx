In chemical kinetics, the units of the rate constant for a zero-order reaction are expressed as concentration per unit time, typically represented as $\text{mol/L·s}$ or $\text{M/s}$.

A zero-order reaction is characterized by a reaction rate that is independent of the concentration of the reactants. This means that the reaction rate remains constant throughout the course of the reaction. The rate law for a zero-order reaction can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\text{Rate} = k
$$

In this equation, 'Rate' represents the rate of the reaction, and 'k' denotes the rate constant.

The units of the rate constant 'k' are influenced by the order of the reaction. For zero-order reactions, the rate constant has the units of concentration per time. This relationship arises because the rate of the reaction is equal to the rate constant, and the rate is conventionally expressed in terms of the change in concentration of reactants or products over time. Consequently, the units of the rate constant for a zero-order reaction are typically $\text{mol/L·s}$ or $\text{M/s}$, where $\text{mol/L}$ represents moles per liter (a unit of concentration) and $\text{s}$ denotes seconds (a unit of time).

It is essential to recognize that the units of the rate constant vary depending on the reaction order. For first-order reactions, the units are $\text{s}^{-1}$ (per second), while for second-order reactions, the units are $\text{L/mol·s}$ or $\text{M}^{-1}·\text{s}^{-1}$. This variance occurs because the rates of these reactions depend on the concentrations of the reactants raised to the power corresponding to the reaction order. In contrast, for zero-order reactions, the rate remains unaffected by the concentration of reactants, leading to the straightforward unit of concentration per time for the rate constant.

Understanding the units of the rate constant is crucial for grasping the kinetics of a reaction and comprehending how the reaction rate changes with variations in reactant concentration. This concept is fundamental in the study of chemical kinetics, a key topic in IB Chemistry.
