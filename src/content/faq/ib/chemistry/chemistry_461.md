Standard entropies can be utilized to determine absolute entropies by applying the third law of thermodynamics.

The third law of thermodynamics posits that the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero ($0 \, \text{K}$) is precisely equal to zero. This principle provides a reference point for measuring the absolute entropies of substances at any given temperature. Standard entropy, denoted as $S^\circ$, refers to the absolute entropy of a substance under standard conditions, which typically include a pressure of $1 \, \text{atm}$ and a temperature of $25 \, \text{°C}$.

To ascertain the absolute entropy of a substance at a specific temperature, one can start with the standard entropies of substances at $25 \, \text{°C}$ and then apply the heat capacity to account for the temperature difference. The heat capacity is defined as the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a substance by one degree. This value is instrumental in calculating the change in entropy as the temperature transitions from $25 \, \text{°C}$ to the target temperature.

Standard entropy values for numerous substances have been experimentally determined and are compiled in reference tables. These values are essential for performing calculations related to entropy changes in chemical reactions. For instance, the standard entropy change for a reaction can be computed by subtracting the sum of the standard entropies of the reactants from the sum of the standard entropies of the products:

$$
\Delta S^\circ = S^\circ_{\text{products}} - S^\circ_{\text{reactants}}.
$$

In summary, standard entropies offer a practical method for determining the absolute entropies of substances at any temperature. By utilizing the third law of thermodynamics as a foundational reference and adjusting for temperature variations with heat capacity, one can effectively calculate the absolute entropy of a substance. This concept is fundamental in thermodynamics and plays a crucial role in understanding the spontaneity of chemical reactions.
