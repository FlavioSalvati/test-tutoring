The dipole moment of a molecule is calculated based on its molecular geometry by multiplying the charge difference by the distance between the charges.

In more detail, the dipole moment $\mu$ of a molecule quantifies its polarity, which reflects the separation of electric charge within the molecule. It is determined using the formula:

$$
\mu = Qd
$$

where $Q$ represents the charge difference, and $d$ denotes the distance between the charges. The charge difference arises from the difference in electronegativity between the atoms, while the distance corresponds to the bond length. The dipole moment is measured in Debye units, denoted by $D$.

To compute the dipole moment from molecular geometry, the first step is to determine the molecular geometry itself. This can be accomplished using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, which predicts molecular shapes based on the repulsion between electron pairs in the valence shell of the central atom. Once the molecular geometry is established, you can then ascertain both the direction and magnitude of the dipole moment.

For molecules containing more than two atoms, the total dipole moment is the vector sum of the individual bond dipoles. This necessitates considering both the magnitude and direction of each bond dipole. In symmetrical molecules, individual bond dipoles may cancel each other out, resulting in a net dipole moment of zero. Examples of such molecules include carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and methane ($\text{CH}_4$).

Conversely, in a molecule such as water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), the bond dipoles do not cancel out due to the bent shape of the molecule. The oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, causing the bond dipoles to point toward the oxygen atom. Since the angle between the bond dipoles is less than $180^\circ$, their vector sum is non-zero, resulting in a net dipole moment for the water molecule.

In summary, to calculate the dipole moment from molecular geometry, you must first determine the molecular geometry, identify the charge difference, and measure the distance between the charges. Then, you multiply the charge difference by the distance to obtain the dipole moment. For molecules with more than two atoms, it is also essential to consider the vector sum of the individual bond dipoles.
