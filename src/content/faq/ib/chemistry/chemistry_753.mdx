In an experiment involving multiple trials, it is essential to process the data by calculating the mean, range, and standard deviation.

### Step 1: Data Recording
The initial step in data processing is to accurately record all results from the trials. This should include any anomalies or outliersâ€”results that significantly differ from the majority. Acknowledging these outliers is crucial, as they can influence the overall analysis of the data.

### Step 2: Calculating the Mean
Next, you will calculate the mean (average) of the results. This is achieved by summing all the results and then dividing by the total number of trials. The mean provides a general indication of the typical outcome expected from the experiment. However, it is important to note that outliers can skew the mean, making it less reliable as a measure of central tendency.

### Step 3: Determining the Range
The range is another important statistical measure. It is calculated by subtracting the smallest result from the largest result. The range gives insight into the variability of the results; a large range indicates considerable variation, while a small range suggests that the results are fairly consistent.

### Step 4: Calculating the Standard Deviation
Finally, you will calculate the standard deviation, which is more complex than the mean or range but provides a clearer picture of how much the results deviate from the mean. A small standard deviation indicates that most results are close to the mean, whereas a large standard deviation signifies a wider spread of results.

### Data Presentation
In addition to performing these calculations, it is vital to present the data in a clear and comprehensible manner. This could involve creating tables, graphs, or charts. Such visual representations can enhance understanding of the experimental results for both you and your audience.

### Conclusion
Remember, the process of data handling extends beyond mere calculations. It involves interpreting the results, identifying patterns and trends, and drawing meaningful conclusions. Your understanding of the experiment and its context plays a crucial role in this process. Therefore, while the mathematical components are important, it is equally essential to apply your scientific knowledge and critical thinking skills in the analysis.
