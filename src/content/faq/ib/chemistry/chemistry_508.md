Infrared spectroscopy is grounded in the principle that molecules absorb specific frequencies of infrared light, resulting in molecular vibrations.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique utilized to identify and analyze chemical substances based on their infrared absorption characteristics. This technique operates on the principle that each molecule absorbs specific frequencies of infrared light that are unique to its structure. These frequencies correspond to the energy required to elevate the molecule from one vibrational level to another.

When infrared radiation is transmitted through a sample, certain frequencies are absorbed, leading to the excitation of molecular vibrations. These vibrations can manifest in various modes, such as stretching or bending, which depend on the types of chemical bonds and the overall molecular structure. The light that is not absorbed continues through the sample and is detected on the opposite side. By analyzing the frequencies of light that are absorbed, we can extract valuable information about the types of bonds present in the sample and, consequently, its molecular structure.

The principles of IR spectroscopy are deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. According to quantum theory, molecules can absorb energy only in discrete amounts known as quanta. The energy of a quantum of light, or a photon, is directly proportional to its frequency. Thus, when a molecule absorbs a photon of infrared light, it acquires a specific amount of energy that induces vibrational motion. The frequency of the absorbed light correlates to the energy difference between two vibrational levels of the molecule.

In practical applications, an IR spectrometer produces an absorption spectrum, which is a graphical representation of the intensity of absorbed light plotted against frequency. Each peak in this spectrum corresponds to a distinct vibrational mode of the molecule. By comparing the recorded spectrum with reference spectra of known substances, we can accurately identify the chemical compounds present in the sample.

In summary, the fundamental principle of IR spectroscopy is that molecules absorb specific frequencies of infrared light, which are indicative of their vibrational energy levels. This absorption leads to molecular vibrations, and by examining the absorbed frequencies, we can determine the types of bonds and the overall molecular structure of the sample.
