A transition metal is defined by its location in the periodic table, specifically within groups $3$ to $12$, and by its unique chemical properties.

Transition metals are elements that occupy groups $3$ to $12$ of the periodic table. These metals possess the remarkable ability to form compounds with variable oxidation states, create a wide variety of coordination compounds, and often exhibit vibrant colors in their compounds. They are also characterized by their high melting and boiling points, significant density, and strong metallic bonding.

The defining feature of transition metals is their electronic configuration. They have partially filled $d$ orbitals, either in their ground state or in one or more of their oxidation states. This partial filling enables them to exhibit multiple oxidation states. For instance, iron (Fe) can exist in both the $+2$ and $+3$ oxidation states. This variability arises from the relatively small energy difference between the $3d$ and $4s$ orbitals, which allows for the easy removal or addition of electrons.

Transition metals are also capable of forming a diverse range of coordination compounds. These compounds consist of a central metal atom or ion surrounded by several neutral molecules or anions, referred to as ligands. The ability to form these complexes is attributed to the availability of vacant $d$ orbitals, which can accept electron pairs from the ligands.

Another notable characteristic of transition metals is the formation of colored compounds. This phenomenon occurs due to the presence of partially filled $d$ orbitals. When light is absorbed, an electron can be excited from a lower-energy $d$ orbital to a higher-energy $d$ orbital, resulting in the compound displaying a specific color.

Finally, transition metals are recognized for their high melting and boiling points, substantial density, and strong metallic bonding. This is attributed to the presence of delocalized electrons in the $d$ orbitals, which can move freely, creating a "sea of electrons." This electron delocalization leads to strong metallic bonds, contributing to their high melting and boiling points as well as their high density.

In summary, an element is classified as a transition metal based on its position in the periodic table, its unique electronic configuration, and its distinctive chemical properties.
