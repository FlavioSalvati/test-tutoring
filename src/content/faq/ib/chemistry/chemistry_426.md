A molecule can exhibit tautomeric forms if it contains a functional group capable of rearranging its atoms and bonds.

Tautomerism is a specific type of isomerism where a molecule can exist in two or more structural forms that are in rapid equilibrium with one another. These structural variants, known as tautomers, differ primarily in the position of a proton and the placement of a double bond. The most prevalent type of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism, in which a molecule can alternate between a ketone and an enol form.

To ascertain whether a molecule can display tautomeric forms, one must identify functional groups that can undergo this rearrangement. The most frequently encountered functional groups associated with tautomerism include carbonyl groups ($\text{C}= \text{O}$), such as those present in ketones and aldehydes, as well as hydroxyl groups ($\text{OH}$), commonly found in alcohols and phenols.

In the case of keto-enol tautomerism, it is essential that the molecule possesses a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. This hydrogen atom is acidic and can be removed by a base, leading to the formation of an enolate ion. The negative charge on the oxygen atom of the enolate can then be delocalized onto the adjacent carbon atom, resulting in the formation of a double bond and the migration of the original double bond to yield a hydroxyl group. This process results in the enol form of the molecule.

Beyond keto-enol tautomerism, other types of tautomerism exist, such as nitroso-oxime tautomerism and amide-imidic acid tautomerism. These variations also involve the rearrangement of atoms and bonds but occur with different functional groups.

In summary, to determine whether a molecule can exhibit tautomeric forms, one should look for functional groups capable of rearrangement, such as carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, as well as the presence of an acidic hydrogen atom that can be removed by a base.
