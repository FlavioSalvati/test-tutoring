The rate of a first-order reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant.

In a first-order reaction, the reaction rate is directly dependent on the concentration of a single reactant. Specifically, if the concentration of the reactant is doubled, the rate of the reaction will also double. This relationship can be expressed mathematically by the rate equation:

$$
\text{rate} = k[A]
$$

In this equation, $\text{rate}$ represents the rate of the reaction, $k$ is the rate constant, and $[A]$ denotes the concentration of the reactant.

The rate constant $k$ is a proportionality constant that is specific to each reaction at a given temperature. It is essential to understand that while the rate constant remains unchanged with variations in reactant concentration, it does vary with temperature. Consequently, for a first-order reaction, the reaction rate can be adjusted by altering either the concentration of the reactant or the temperature.

The direct proportionality between the rate of a first-order reaction and the reactant concentration can be illustrated graphically. If you plot the concentration of the reactant against time, the resulting curve will slope downwards, indicating a decrease in the reactant's concentration over time. In contrast, if you plot the natural logarithm of the concentration of the reactant against time, the graph will yield a straight line. This linearity demonstrates that the rate of the reaction is indeed directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant.

In summary, the concentration of the reactant is a critical factor in determining the rate of a first-order reaction. By adjusting the concentration of the reactant, one can effectively control the rate of the reaction. This principle is widely applied in the chemical industry to manage the rates of various chemical reactions.
