Balanced equations play a crucial role in stoichiometric calculations, as they ensure adherence to the law of conservation of mass.

Stoichiometry is a specialized branch of chemistry that examines the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. These relationships are derived from the coefficients in a balanced chemical equation, which indicate the number of moles of each substance involved. Without a balanced equation, accurately determining these relationships and performing stoichiometric calculations becomes impossible.

The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. In the context of a chemical reaction, this implies that the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products. A balanced chemical equation guarantees compliance with this law, as the number of atoms of each element on the reactant side must match the number of atoms of that element on the product side.

For instance, consider the combustion of methane ($\text{CH}_4$). The unbalanced equation for this reaction is:

$$
\text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

Attempting to perform stoichiometric calculations with this unbalanced equation presents difficulties, as the number of oxygen atoms on the reactant side ($2$) does not equal the number of oxygen atoms on the product side ($3$). However, by balancing the equation as follows:

$$
\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

we can observe that there are now $4$ oxygen atoms on each side of the equation, thereby upholding the law of conservation of mass and enabling accurate stoichiometric calculations.

In summary, balanced equations are vital for stoichiometric calculations as they uphold the law of conservation of mass, facilitating the precise determination of quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Without a balanced equation, performing these calculations would be impossible.
