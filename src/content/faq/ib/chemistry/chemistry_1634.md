Metals are malleable and ductile due to the unique structure of their atoms, which allows layers to slide over each other.

Metals are made up of a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons. This structure is often referred to as a 'metallic bond'. The positive metal ions are arranged in a regular pattern, but the electrons are free to move throughout the structure. This movement of electrons is what gives metals their good electrical and thermal conductivity.

The malleability and ductility of metals, which means their ability to be shaped or drawn into wires, is also a result of this unique structure. When a force is applied to a metal, the layers of positive ions can slide over each other. This is possible because the delocalised electrons can adjust their positions and maintain the attraction between the positive ions and the 'sea' of electrons. This allows the metal to change shape without breaking or cracking.
