Electron dot diagrams, also referred to as Lewis dot structures, are graphical tools that illustrate covalent bonding between atoms by depicting shared pairs of electrons. 

These diagrams serve as simple yet effective representations of molecular bonding and the presence of lone pairs of electrons within a molecule. In an electron dot diagram, each dot symbolizes a single electron. Typically, the central atom, which is the one with the lowest electronegativity, is denoted by its chemical symbol. The valence electrons, which are the electrons in the outermost shell, are shown as dots surrounding this symbol.

Covalent bonds are created when two atoms share a pair of electrons. In the Lewis dot structure, this shared pair is illustrated by two dots positioned between the symbols of the bonded atoms. For example, in a hydrogen molecule ($\text{H}_2$), each hydrogen atom contributes one electron to form a shared pair, represented by two dots between the two $\text{H}$ symbols.

Electron dot diagrams can also depict multiple covalent bonds. For instance, in an oxygen molecule ($\text{O}_2$), each oxygen atom shares two pairs of electrons with the other, resulting in a double bond. This is illustrated by four dots (or sometimes by two lines) between the two $\text{O}$ symbols.

Additionally, lone pairs, which are non-bonding pairs of electrons, are represented in these diagrams. Lone pairs are shown as pairs of dots adjacent to a single atom. For example, in a water molecule ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), the oxygen atom has two lone pairs of electrons, represented as four dots beside the $\text{O}$ symbol.

In summary, electron dot diagrams provide a visual representation of covalent bonds, illustrating how atoms share electrons to form molecules. They are essential tools for understanding the structure and reactivity of covalent compounds.
