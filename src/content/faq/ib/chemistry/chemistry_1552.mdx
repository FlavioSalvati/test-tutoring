Ionisation energy exhibits notable exceptions in certain areas of the periodic table, primarily due to the effects of electron shielding and electron pair repulsion.

Ionisation energy is defined as the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. Typically, this energy increases as one moves across a period from left to right and decreases when moving down a group. The increase across a period can be attributed to the rising number of protons in the nucleus, which enhances the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the outer electrons, making these electrons harder to remove. Conversely, the decrease down a group occurs because the outer electrons are situated further from the nucleus, reducing the attractive force and making them easier to remove.

Despite these general trends, exceptions arise due to electron shielding and electron pair repulsion. 

**Electron Shielding:** This phenomenon occurs when inner shell electrons shield outer shell electrons from the full attractive force of the nucleus. As a result, the outer electrons experience a diminished effective nuclear charge, making them easier to remove and consequently lowering the ionisation energy. This effect is especially pronounced in transition metals, where the $3d$ electrons provide shielding for the $4s$ electrons, leading to a smaller than anticipated increase in ionisation energy across the series.

**Electron Pair Repulsion:** This occurs when two electrons occupy the same orbital. Because electrons are negatively charged, they repel each other. When two electrons share an orbital, their mutual repulsion makes it easier to remove one of them, thereby decreasing the ionisation energy. This effect is particularly evident in p-block elements, where the second ionisation energy is often lower than expected. This is due to the removal of the second electron alleviating the electron pair repulsion within the orbital.

For instance, the ionisation energy of aluminium ($\text{Al}$) is lower than that of magnesium ($\text{Mg}$), despite aluminium being to the right of magnesium in the periodic table. The outer electron in aluminium occupies a $3p$ orbital, which is shielded by the $3s$ electrons. In contrast, the outer electron in magnesium resides in a $3s$ orbital, which is closer to the nucleus and experiences less shielding. Similarly, the ionisation energy of sulfur ($\text{S}$) is lower than that of phosphorus ($\text{P}$) because removing an electron from sulfur reduces the electron pair repulsion present in its $3p$ orbital.
