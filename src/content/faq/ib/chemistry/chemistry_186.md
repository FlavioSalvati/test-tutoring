Boron trifluoride, commonly denoted as BF$_3$, is classified as a planar molecule due to its trigonal planar molecular geometry, which arises from sp$^2$ hybridization.

The BF$_3$ molecule comprises one boron atom surrounded by three fluorine atoms. In this configuration, the boron atom occupies the center, with the three fluorine atoms positioned around it. The molecular geometry is influenced by the arrangement of these atoms and the electron pairs surrounding the central boron atom.

The boron atom possesses three valence electrons, while each fluorine atom has seven valence electrons. When boron forms covalent bonds with the three fluorine atoms, it shares one of its electrons with each fluorine atom. This bonding results in the boron atom achieving a complete outer electron shell, while each fluorine atom also attains a full outer shell.

The arrangement of electron pairs in the boron trifluoride molecule is optimized to minimize repulsion, a principle outlined by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. According to VSEPR theory, electron pairs will position themselves in a trigonal planar formation, which is a flat, three-sided structure. This geometric arrangement is the most stable for three electron pairs, leading to the overall planar shape of the molecule.

Additionally, the boron atom in BF$_3$ undergoes sp$^2$ hybridization. Hybridization is the process by which atomic orbitals combine to form new, equivalent hybrid orbitals. In sp$^2$ hybridization, one s orbital and two p orbitals from the boron atom merge to create three sp$^2$ hybrid orbitals. These hybrid orbitals are arranged in a trigonal planar configuration, reinforcing the planar structure of the boron trifluoride molecule.

In summary, boron trifluoride is regarded as a planar molecule due to its sp$^2$ hybridization and the arrangement of its electron pairs as predicted by VSEPR theory.
