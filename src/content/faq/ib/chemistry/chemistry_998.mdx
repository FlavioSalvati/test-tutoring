Markovnikov's rule is a key principle in organic chemistry that predicts the outcome of addition reactions involving alkenes. Formulated by the Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov in 1869, this rule is particularly relevant when adding hydrogen halides to alkenes.

In an addition reaction, two or more molecules combine to create a larger molecule. Alkenes, which are hydrocarbons characterized by a carbon-carbon double bond, frequently participate in such reactions. When a hydrogen halide (denoted as $HX$, where $X$ represents a halogen) is added to an alkene, the hydrogen atom ($H$) and the halogen ($X$) can add across the double bond in two distinct manners, resulting in two potential products.

Markovnikov's rule provides a method to predict which of these products will be formed in greater abundance. The rule states that the hydrogen atom will attach to the carbon atom of the double bond that is already bonded to more hydrogen atoms (the least substituted carbon), while the halogen will bond to the other carbon atom (the more substituted carbon).

This predictive capability is rooted in the stability of carbocations, which are reactive intermediates formed during the reaction. More substituted carbocations are generally more stable, which leads to a preference for the formation of the more stable carbocation. Consequently, the reaction proceeds in a manner that aligns with Markovnikov's rule, yielding the predicted product.

However, it is important to acknowledge that there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, in the presence of peroxides, the addition of hydrogen bromide ($HBr$) to alkenes can produce an 'anti-Markovnikov' product, where the bromine atom adds to the least substituted carbon. This phenomenon is referred to as the peroxide effect or Kharasch effect.

In summary, Markovnikov's rule serves as a valuable guideline for anticipating the major products of addition reactions involving alkenes and hydrogen halides. It is based on the stability of carbocation intermediates and reflects the fundamental principle that chemical reactions tend to proceed in ways that minimize their energy.
