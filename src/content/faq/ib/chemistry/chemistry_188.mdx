A molecule may display tautomeric forms if it possesses a functional group that allows for the rearrangement of its atoms and bonds.

Tautomerism is a subtype of isomerism in which a molecule can exist in two or more structural forms that rapidly interconvert with one another. These structural variations, known as tautomers, differ primarily in the position of a proton and the configuration of a double bond. The most prevalent example of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism, where a molecule can exist in either the ketone or enol form.

To assess whether a molecule exhibits tautomeric forms, it is essential to identify functional groups capable of such rearrangements. The most common functional groups associated with tautomerism are carbonyl groups ($\text{C=O}$), which are found in ketones and aldehydes, and hydroxyl groups ($\text{OH}$), which are present in alcohols and phenols.

In the context of keto-enol tautomerism, the molecule must have a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. This hydrogen atom is acidic and can be abstracted by a base, resulting in the formation of an enolate ion. The negative charge on the oxygen atom can then be delocalized onto the adjacent carbon atom, facilitating the formation of a double bond while concurrently converting the original double bond into a hydroxyl group. This process yields the enol form of the molecule.

Beyond keto-enol tautomerism, other types of tautomerism exist, such as nitroso-oxime tautomerism and amide-imidic acid tautomerism. Each of these tautomeric forms involves the rearrangement of atoms and bonds but occurs within different functional groups.

In summary, to determine if a molecule can exhibit tautomeric forms, one must identify functional groups that are capable of rearrangement, such as carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, as well as the presence of an acidic hydrogen atom that can be removed by a base.
