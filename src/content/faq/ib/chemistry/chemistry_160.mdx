Certain molecules exhibit geometric isomerism due to restricted rotation around a double bond or within a ring structure.

Geometric isomerism, often referred to as cis-trans isomerism, is a specific type of stereoisomerism. This phenomenon occurs because the restricted rotation around a double bond or a ring structure results in distinct spatial arrangements of the atoms or groups attached to the carbon atoms involved in the double bond or within the ring.

In molecules containing a double bond, the formation of a pi bond—resulting from the sideways overlap of p orbitals—prevents free rotation. Consequently, the groups or atoms attached to the carbon atoms of the double bond become 'locked' in position, leading to different geometric configurations. For instance, in but-2-ene, the two methyl groups ($\text{CH}_3$) can either be positioned on the same side of the double bond (the cis isomer) or on opposite sides (the trans isomer).

Similarly, in cyclic structures such as cycloalkanes, the inherent rigidity of the ring restricts rotation as well. This rigidity can produce varying spatial arrangements of the substituents, depending on whether they are positioned on the same side of the ring (cis isomer) or on opposite sides (trans isomer).

It is crucial to recognize that geometric isomerism can significantly influence the physical and chemical properties of the molecules. For example, cis-isomers typically have higher boiling points than their trans counterparts. This difference arises because cis-isomers often possess a dipole moment. In these molecules, the similar groups are located on the same side, creating a region of higher electron density and resulting in a dipole. Conversely, in trans-isomers, the similar groups are arranged on opposite sides, which tends to cancel out the dipole moment.

In summary, geometric isomerism is an intriguing aspect of molecular structure that stems from restricted rotation in certain molecules. This phenomenon not only creates various spatial arrangements of atoms or groups but can also have a substantial impact on the properties of the molecules.
