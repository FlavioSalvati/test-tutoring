In mass spectrometry, isotopes are distinguished by their unique mass-to-charge ratios.

Mass spectrometry is an advanced analytical technique utilized to identify and quantify the types and amounts of chemicals present in a sample by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio and abundance of gas-phase ions. This method is particularly effective for differentiating isotopes—atoms of the same element that possess varying numbers of neutrons, resulting in distinct atomic masses.

The process begins with the ionization of the sample. During this stage, the sample is bombarded with a stream of electrons, which knocks off one or more electrons and generates positive ions. These ions are then accelerated through an electric field, imparting equal kinetic energy to all ions. Subsequently, the ions enter a magnetic field, where they experience deflection along a curved path. The degree of deflection is contingent upon the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions; lighter ions and ions with higher charges are deflected more than heavier ions or those with lower charges.

Here is where isotope differentiation becomes crucial. Isotopes of the same element will carry the same charge after ionization since they contain the same number of protons. However, they differ in mass because of their varying numbers of neutrons. Consequently, this results in different extents of deflection in the magnetic field, enabling their separation and individual detection.

Once the ions reach a detector, they generate an electric current. The magnitude of this current is proportional to the abundance of the ions, which allows for the determination of the relative abundance of different isotopes. The results are presented as a mass spectrum—a graph plotting intensity (relative abundance) against mass-to-charge ratio. Each peak on the spectrum corresponds to an isotope, with the peak's position indicating the mass-to-charge ratio (and thus the mass) of the isotope, while the height of the peak reflects its relative abundance.

In summary, mass spectrometry effectively differentiates isotopes by their distinct mass-to-charge ratios, enabling the identification and quantification of various isotopes within a sample.
