Diamond and graphite are two distinct allotropes of carbon, differing significantly in their structural arrangements. Diamond features a tetrahedral structure, whereas graphite is characterized by a layered arrangement.

In diamond, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four neighboring carbon atoms, forming a tetrahedral geometry. This arrangement results in a robust three-dimensional network of carbon atoms, which contributes to diamond's exceptional hardness and its characteristic brilliance. The strong covalent bonds require substantial energy to break, making diamond the hardest known natural substance. Additionally, diamond is a poor conductor of electricity due to the absence of free electrons.

In contrast, graphite consists of carbon atoms that are covalently bonded to three neighboring carbon atoms, creating layers of hexagonal rings. These layers are held together by weak Van der Waals forces, which allow them to slide over one another easily. This property gives graphite its distinctive slippery feel, making it useful as a lubricant and in pencil lead. Unlike diamond, graphite is an excellent conductor of electricity. This conductivity arises from the delocalization of one electron from each carbon atom, which allows these electrons to move freely between the layers, facilitating electrical conduction.

The structural differences between diamond and graphite lead to their contrasting physical properties. The tetrahedral structure of diamond accounts for its remarkable hardness and poor electrical conductivity, while the layered structure of graphite results in its softness, lubricating qualities, and good electrical conductivity. Understanding these structural variations is essential for appreciating why diamond and graphite, despite both being forms of carbon, exhibit such diverse characteristics.
