The d-block elements in the periodic table are positioned one period behind in their electron configurations because they fill their orbitals after the s-block of the subsequent period.

In the periodic table, the d-block elements, commonly referred to as transition metals, are located in groups 3 through 12. The reason for their one-period delay in electron configurations lies in how electrons are added to atomic orbitals as the atomic number increases, following the principles of the Aufbau principle. This principle posits that electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first.

It is important to note that the energy levels of atomic orbitals do not always follow a straightforward ascending sequence. For instance, the $4s$ orbital is filled before the $3d$ orbital because the $4s$ orbital possesses a lower energy level than the $3d$ orbital. Consequently, according to the Aufbau principle, the $4s$ orbital is filled first. This results in the first two elements of the fourth period—potassium (K) and calcium (Ca)—having their outermost electrons in the $4s$ orbital.

Once the $4s$ orbital is filled, the next available lower energy level is the $3d$ orbital. Thus, the following ten elements in the fourth period, which constitute the first row of transition metals, have their outermost electrons in the $3d$ orbital. This is why the electron configurations of these elements are expressed as follows: $[Ar] 4s^2 3d^1$, $[Ar] 4s^2 3d^2$, and so forth, even though they belong to the fourth period. The $3d$ orbital is not completely filled until the end of the fourth period, after which the $4p$ orbital begins to fill.

This pattern persists into the fifth and sixth periods with the $4d$ and $5d$ orbitals, respectively. The s-block of the subsequent period is always filled before the d-block of the current period, which is the reason the d-block appears to be a period behind in electron configurations. Understanding this aspect of atomic structure and electron configuration is essential for comprehending the properties and behaviors of elements within the d-block.
