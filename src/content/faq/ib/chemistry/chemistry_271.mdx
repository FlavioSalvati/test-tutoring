Inhibitors significantly influence rate expressions in biochemistry by decreasing the reaction rate through the blockage or alteration of the active site.

In the realm of biochemistry, inhibitors are vital for regulating the speed of biochemical reactions. They achieve this by interacting with the enzymes that facilitate these reactions. Enzymes, which are proteins, accelerate biochemical processes by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. Each enzyme contains a specific region called the active site, where substrate molecules bind and undergo chemical transformations.

Inhibitors reduce the activity of these enzymes through two primary mechanisms: competitive inhibition and non-competitive inhibition. 

**Competitive Inhibition** occurs when an inhibitor, which has a structure similar to that of the substrate, binds to the active site of the enzyme. This binding prevents the substrate from attaching, thus diminishing the reaction rate due to the reduced availability of enzyme-substrate complexes. The impact of competitive inhibitors can be mitigated by increasing the substrate concentration, as a higher concentration increases the likelihood that substrate molecules will outcompete the inhibitor for the active site.

**Non-competitive Inhibition**, in contrast, involves the inhibitor binding to a different site on the enzyme, which leads to a conformational change in the enzyme's structure. This alteration affects the shape of the active site, making it less effective for substrate binding. Consequently, the reaction rate decreases, and in this case, the inhibitory effect cannot be overcome by simply increasing the substrate concentration.

From a mathematical perspective, the presence of an inhibitor modifies the rate expression of the enzymatic reaction. For a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme in the absence of an inhibitor, the rate equation is generally expressed as:

$$ \text{rate} = k[\text{enzyme}][\text{substrate}], $$

where $k$ is the rate constant. However, when an inhibitor is present, the rate equation becomes more complex, reflecting the reduced activity of the enzyme.

In summary, inhibitors are essential in modulating the rates of biochemical reactions. They accomplish this by interacting with enzymes—either by obstructing the active site or by altering its shape—thereby decreasing the overall reaction rate.
