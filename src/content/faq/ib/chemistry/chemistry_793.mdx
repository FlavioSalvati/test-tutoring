Absolute error represents the actual difference between a measured value and the true value, while relative error expresses this difference as a percentage of the true value.

To elaborate, absolute error quantifies how far a measurement deviates from the true or accepted value. It is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the measured value and the true value. For instance, if you measure the length of a table to be $1.02$ meters, but the actual length is $1.00$ meter, the absolute error would be 

$$
|1.02 - 1.00| = 0.02 \text{ meters}.
$$ 

This provides a clear and straightforward representation of the error in your measurement.

In contrast, relative error measures the absolute error in relation to the size of the quantity being measured. It is calculated by dividing the absolute error by the true value and then multiplying by $100$ to convert it into a percentage. In the table example, the relative error can be computed as follows:

$$
\text{Relative Error} = \left(\frac{0.02}{1.00}\right) \times 100 = 2\%.
$$ 

This percentage indicates the significance of the error relative to the measurement size. While a $2\%$ error might be acceptable when measuring a table, it could be unacceptable when determining the concentration of a chemical in a solution during a chemistry experiment.

Both absolute and relative errors are essential in various contexts. Absolute error provides a clear measure of the discrepancy in your measurement, which is crucial when understanding how far off a measurement is. However, it does not convey the significance of this error relative to the magnitude of the quantity being measured. This is where relative error becomes valuable. By expressing the error as a percentage of the true value, relative error offers insight into the impact of the error. This is particularly important in fields such as chemistry, where a small absolute error can have a significant effect if it constitutes a large percentage of the total measurement. For a deeper understanding of these concepts, especially in practical scenarios, consider exploring common errors encountered during experiments.
