Infrared spectroscopy is an essential analytical technique used in chemistry for identifying various molecules, particularly functional groups. This method operates on the principle that molecules absorb specific frequencies of infrared light, corresponding to the vibrations of their chemical bonds. Each functional group possesses a distinct set of vibrational frequencies, effectively serving as a 'fingerprint'. By comparing the absorption patterns observed in the infrared spectrum of a sample with established patterns of known functional groups, we can determine which groups are present in the molecule.

The procedure initiates by passing infrared radiation through a sample. The molecules within the sample absorb portions of this radiation, leading to vibrations at characteristic frequencies. These vibrations can occur as either stretching (altering the bond length) or bending (changing the bond angle). The amount of radiation absorbed at each frequency is quantified and plotted, resulting in an infrared spectrum.

The x-axis of the spectrum depicts the frequency of the infrared radiation, typically expressed in terms of wavenumber, which is the number of wavelengths per centimeter ($\text{cm}^{-1}$). Meanwhile, the y-axis indicates the amount of radiation absorbed. The peaks on the graph represent frequencies at which significant radiation is absorbed, corresponding to the vibrational frequencies of various bonds within the molecule.

Functional groups are specific clusters of atoms in molecules that exhibit unique behaviors during chemical reactions. They each have characteristic absorption patterns in an infrared spectrum. For instance, the carbonyl bond ($C=O$) in a carbonyl group absorbs infrared radiation at approximately $1700 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$, resulting in a strong, sharp peak in that region of the spectrum.

By analyzing the positions, shapes, and intensities of the peaks in the spectrum, we can identify the functional groups present in the molecule. This identification is often achieved by comparing the spectrum to a reference table or database of known spectra. Thus, infrared spectroscopy serves as a valuable tool for identifying functional groups and elucidating the structures of organic molecules.
