The presence of lone pairs of electrons can significantly reduce the bond angle in a molecule due to their increased repulsion compared to bonding pairs.

In any molecule, the geometric shape and the angles between bonds are influenced by the repulsion between the electron pairs in the valence shell of the central atom. This phenomenon is explained by the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. According to VSEPR theory, electron pairs arrange themselves in a manner that minimizes repulsion and maximizes the distance between them.

Lone pairs of electrons, which are not involved in chemical bonding, occupy more space within the electron cloud than bonding pairs. This is because lone pairs are associated with only one atomic nucleus, allowing them to spread out more. Consequently, they exert a stronger repulsive force on adjacent electron pairs. This increased repulsion causes the bonding pairs to be pushed closer together, resulting in a decrease in the bond angle.

For instance, let us examine the molecules water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) and ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$). In water, there are two bonding pairs (formed between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms) alongside two lone pairs located on the oxygen atom. In contrast, ammonia features three bonding pairs (between the nitrogen and hydrogen atoms) and one lone pair on the nitrogen atom. According to VSEPR theory, the ideal bond angle for a tetrahedral arrangement is $109.5^\circ$. However, due to the stronger repulsion exerted by the lone pairs, the bond angle in water is reduced to $104.5^\circ$, while in ammonia it measures $107^\circ$.

In conclusion, the presence of lone pairs has a notable impact on the bond angles within a molecule. The increased repulsion from lone pairs forces bonding pairs closer together, leading to smaller bond angles. Understanding this concept is essential for predicting the shapes and properties of molecules.
