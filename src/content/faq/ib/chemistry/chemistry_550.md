The s orbital is characterized by its spherical shape and is recognized as having the lowest energy level among all atomic orbitals.

Named after the German word "sph√§risch," which translates to "spherical," the s orbital is the first type of atomic orbital encountered in quantum chemistry. Its symmetrical shape surrounds the nucleus of an atom, reflecting the equal probability of locating an electron at any distance from the nucleus. The s orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons, which must have opposite spins. This arrangement is a consequence of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, a fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics.

In terms of energy levels, the s orbital is unique as it possesses the lowest energy among all orbital types, including s, p, d, and f. This low energy is attributed to its proximity to the nucleus, where it experiences the strongest attractive force from the positively charged protons. The relationship between an orbital's energy and its distance from the nucleus is direct: the closer an orbital is to the nucleus, the lower its energy level. Therefore, the 1s orbital, which is the s orbital located in the first energy level, is always filled first during the process of electron configuration.

The s orbital plays a vital role in determining the structure and reactivity of atoms. For instance, the 1s orbital is the innermost orbital and is consistently occupied in ground state atoms, contributing significantly to atomic stability. Additionally, the shape and energy characteristics of the s orbital influence the types of chemical bonds that an atom can form. For example, hydrogen and helium, which possess only s orbitals, can only participate in single bond formations.

In summary, the s orbital is a spherical atomic orbital with the lowest energy level. Understanding its shape and energy is essential for grasping the structural and reactive properties of atoms in the field of chemistry.
