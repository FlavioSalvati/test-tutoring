Crystal field theory (CFT) elucidates the colors observed in transition metal complexes by explaining how light absorption induces electronic transitions.

CFT is a model that describes the splitting of degenerate electron orbital states, specifically the $d$ or $f$ orbitals, due to a static electric field generated by a surrounding charge distribution. This field is created by ligandsâ€”ions or molecules that coordinate with the central metal ion in a complex. The presence of ligands alters the energy levels of the $d$ orbitals within the transition metal ion.

In an isolated atom, the five $d$ orbitals are degenerate, meaning they possess the same energy. However, when ligands approach the metal ion, they induce a splitting of these five $d$ orbitals into two distinct energy levels. This splitting is fundamental to the color observed in transition metal complexes.

When white light, which encompasses all colors, shines on a transition metal complex, specific wavelengths of light are absorbed. The absorbed wavelengths correspond to the energy difference between the two sets of split $d$ orbitals. The remaining light, which is not absorbed, reaches our eyes and imparts color to the complex. For instance, if a complex absorbs light in the red region of the spectrum, it will appear green, which is the complementary color to red.

The degree of orbital splitting, and consequently the observed color, is influenced by several factors, including the nature of the metal ion, the types of ligands attached, and the geometry of the complex. For example, strong-field ligands such as cyanide ($\text{CN}^-$) cause significant splitting of the $d$ orbitals, resulting in complexes that often appear blue or green. Conversely, complexes with weak-field ligands like iodide ($\text{I}^-$) typically exhibit red or orange colors due to their lesser degree of splitting.

In summary, crystal field theory explains that the colors of transition metal complexes arise from light absorption, which leads to electronic transitions. The ligands surrounding the metal ion cause the $d$ orbital energies to split into two levels. The color we perceive is determined by the light that is not absorbed, which is contingent upon the characteristics of the metal, the nature of the ligands, and the geometry of the complex. Strong-field ligands are likely to produce blue or green colors, while weak-field ligands tend to result in red or orange hues. For more detailed examples of how these processes yield various colors in transition metal complexes, please refer to additional resources. Further insights into the influence of $d$-block elements on color can also be found in supplementary notes.
