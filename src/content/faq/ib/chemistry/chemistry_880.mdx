Molecular orbital diagrams exhibit distinct characteristics depending on whether they represent homonuclear or heteronuclear diatomic molecules. 

For homonuclear diatomic molecules, such as O$_2$ or N$_2$, the atomic orbitals of both atoms are identical. This results in a symmetrical molecular orbital diagram. When these atomic orbitals combine, they form molecular orbitals that are categorized into two types: bonding and antibonding. Bonding orbitals, which are lower in energy and more stable than the original atomic orbitals, exist below the atomic orbitals in the diagram. In contrast, antibonding orbitals, which are higher in energy and less stable, are positioned above the atomic orbitals. In these diagrams, the number of electrons occupying each orbital is represented by arrows. The overall symmetry of the diagram reflects the fact that the atomic orbitals and resulting molecular orbitals are the same for both atoms.

In contrast, heteronuclear diatomic molecules, such as CO or NO, feature atomic orbitals that differ between the two atoms, leading to an asymmetrical molecular orbital diagram. Although the atomic orbitals still combine to create molecular orbitals, the energy levels and stability of these orbitals can vary significantly due to differences in electronegativity. The more electronegative atom possesses lower energy atomic orbitals, which in turn results in lower energy bonding orbitals and higher energy antibonding orbitals. In the molecular orbital diagram, this is illustrated by positioning the bonding orbitals closer to the more electronegative atom and the antibonding orbitals nearer to the less electronegative atom. While arrows indicate the number of electrons in each orbital, the overall asymmetry of the diagram arises from the differing atomic characteristics of the two atoms.

In summary, the key distinction between molecular orbital diagrams for homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules lies in the symmetry of the diagrams. This difference originates from the identical atomic orbitals in homonuclear diatomic molecules, in contrast to the distinct atomic orbitals found in heteronuclear diatomic molecules.
