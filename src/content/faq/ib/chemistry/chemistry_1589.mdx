The metallic character of elements decreases across a period in the periodic table due to a combination of factors: the reduction in atomic radius and the increase in nuclear charge, both of which diminish the tendency of atoms to lose electrons.

As you move from left to right across a period, the atomic number increases, indicating that there are more protons within the nucleus. This increase in protons leads to a higher nuclear charge. Concurrently, the atomic radius—the distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron shell—decreases. This reduction in atomic radius occurs because the increased nuclear charge exerts a stronger attractive force on the electrons, pulling them closer to the nucleus.

The metallic character of an element is primarily defined by its ability to lose electrons and form positive ions, a process known as oxidation. Metals are characterized by their relatively low ionization energies, which allow them to readily lose electrons. However, as we move across a period and experience a decrease in atomic radius coupled with an increase in nuclear charge, the electrons are held more tightly by the nucleus. This enhanced attraction makes it increasingly difficult for the atom to lose electrons, resulting in a diminished metallic character.

Additionally, the rise in nuclear charge is associated with an increase in electronegativity, which is the tendency of an atom to attract shared electrons within a chemical bond. Nonmetals, typically located on the right side of the periodic table, exhibit high electronegativities, as they are more inclined to gain electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. This behavior contrasts sharply with metallic character, which involves the loss of electrons.

In summary, the interplay of decreasing atomic radius and increasing nuclear charge across a period leads to a decline in metallic character. These changes collectively make it more challenging for atoms to lose electrons—a defining characteristic of metals.
