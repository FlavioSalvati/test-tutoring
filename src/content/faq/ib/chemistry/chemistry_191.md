Certain elements have the unique capability to form multiple bonds due to their ability to share more than one pair of electrons in their outer electron shell.

The propensity of an element to form multiple bonds is primarily influenced by its electron configuration, particularly the number of valence electrons present. Valence electrons are the electrons located in the outermost shell of an atom, and they are crucial for the formation of chemical bonds with other atoms. Elements that possess more than one valence electron can potentially share multiple pairs of electrons, thereby enabling the formation of multiple bonds.

For example, consider the elements carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Carbon has four valence electrons, allowing it to form four covalent bonds with other atoms. Nitrogen, with five valence electrons, can form three covalent bonds, while oxygen, which has six valence electrons, is capable of forming two covalent bonds. These multiple bonds can occur between the same atoms, resulting in double or triple bonds, or they can involve different atoms.

The formation of multiple bonds is also affected by the concept of hybridization. In the case of carbon, the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals hybridize to create four $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals, each of which can form a single bond. However, under specific conditions, carbon can undergo $sp^2$ or $sp$ hybridization, leading to the formation of double or triple bonds, respectively.

Additionally, the ability to form multiple bonds is not confined to the elements in the second period of the periodic table. Transition metals, for instance, are also capable of forming multiple bonds due to the presence of $d$-orbitals. These $d$-orbitals can accommodate additional electrons, enabling transition metals to establish multiple bonds with other atoms.

In conclusion, the ability of an element to form multiple bonds is primarily dictated by its electron configuration and the number of valence electrons it possesses. Moreover, the processes of hybridization and the availability of $d$-orbitals in transition metals significantly contribute to the formation of multiple bonds.
