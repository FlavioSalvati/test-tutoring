An aldehyde is characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group ($\text{C}= \text{O}$) located at the end of a carbon chain, whereas a ketone has its carbonyl group situated in the middle of the chain.

To elaborate, both aldehydes and ketones fall under the category of carbonyl compounds, which are defined by the presence of a carbon-oxygen double bond ($\text{C} = \text{O}$). This carbonyl group serves as the distinguishing feature for both types of compounds. However, the key difference lies in the position of the carbonyl group within the molecular structure.

In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is always positioned at the terminal end of the carbon chain. Consequently, the carbon atom of the carbonyl group is bonded to at least one hydrogen atom. The general formula for an aldehyde can be expressed as $R\text{CHO}$, where $R$ represents any alkyl group and $\text{CHO}$ indicates the carbonyl group along with the hydrogen atom. For instance, ethanal ($\text{CH}_3\text{CHO}$) is a common example of an aldehyde, where the carbonyl group is located at the end of the molecule.

Conversely, in ketones, the carbonyl group is found within the carbon chain, bonded to two carbon atoms. The general formula for a ketone is represented as $R\text{C}(= \text{O})R'$, where $R$ and $R'$ denote any alkyl groups and $\text{C}(= \text{O})$ signifies the carbonyl group. An example of a ketone is propanone ($\text{CH}_3\text{CO}\text{CH}_3$), where the carbonyl group is centrally positioned within the molecule.

When considering physical properties, both aldehydes and ketones are generally colorless and possess strong, often pleasant, odors. Their polarity, attributed to the carbonyl group, results in higher boiling points compared to similar-sized hydrocarbons or ethers.

Regarding chemical reactivity, aldehydes tend to be more reactive than ketones. This increased reactivity stems from the fact that the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes is more accessible to nucleophilic attack, as it is bonded to a hydrogen atomâ€”an atom that is less electron-donating than another carbon atom. Consequently, aldehydes are more prone to oxidation reactions, whereas ketones exhibit greater resistance to such oxidation.
