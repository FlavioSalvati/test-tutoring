Hypervalent compounds are those in which certain atoms form more bonds than would typically be anticipated according to the octet rule.

The term "hypervalent" refers to molecules and ions that contain main group elements which participate in bonding beyond the usual limits. According to the octet rule, atoms achieve stability when their outermost electron shell is filled, typically with eight electrons. Hypervalency is frequently observed in compounds containing elements such as silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine, among others.

The concept of hypervalency was first established in the early 20th century to account for the structures of certain compounds that appeared to contravene the octet rule. A classic example is phosphorus pentachloride, denoted as $PCl_5$. In this molecule, the phosphorus atom forms five bonds, resulting in a total of ten valence electrons. According to the octet rule, phosphorus should only form three bonds because it possesses five valence electrons and requires three additional electrons to complete its octet.

Hypervalency is feasible due to the presence of empty $d$ orbitals in the third period and beyond of the periodic table. These $d$ orbitals can engage in bonding, enabling atoms to expand their valence shell and form more than four bonds. This phenomenon is often referred to as the "expanded octet" or "hypervalent" rule.

Nevertheless, the notion of hypervalency has sparked considerable debate among chemists. Some experts contend that the involvement of $d$ orbitals is not essential for explaining the structures of hypervalent compounds. Instead, they argue that these structures can be adequately described through a combination of resonance and ionic models, without needing to consider $d$ orbital participation. Despite these differing opinions, the term "hypervalent" remains widely accepted in the field of chemistry to describe compounds that form more bonds than would be predicted by the octet rule.
