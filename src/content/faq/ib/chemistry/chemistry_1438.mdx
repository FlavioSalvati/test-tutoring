Stoichiometric calculations are essential for determining the concentration of substances by relating the amounts of reactants to the amounts of products in a chemical reaction.

**Understanding Stoichiometry**  
Stoichiometry is a branch of chemistry that focuses on the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. These relationships are typically represented by balanced chemical equations, which indicate the ratios in which substances react and are produced. By utilizing these ratios, one can calculate the concentration of a substance within a solution.

**Steps to Determine Concentration Using Stoichiometry**  
To calculate the concentration of a substance using stoichiometry, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Balanced Chemical Equation**:  
   Begin by obtaining the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. This equation reveals the stoichiometric ratios in which reactants combine to produce products. For instance, in the reaction 

   $$ 
   2 \text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} 
   $$ 

   two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to yield two molecules of water.

2. **Measure the Amount of One Reactant or Product**:  
   Determine the quantity of one of the reactants or products, which can be expressed as mass, volume, or number of moles. For example, you may have a known mass of hydrogen: 

   $$ 
   10 \text{ grams of } \text{H}_2 
   $$

3. **Apply Stoichiometric Ratios to Calculate Other Substances**:  
   Utilize the stoichiometric ratios from the balanced equation to calculate the amounts of the other substances involved. In this case, from the balanced equation, you can deduce that 

   $$ 
   10 \text{ grams of } \text{H}_2 
   $$ 

   would react with 

   $$ 
   5 \text{ grams of } \text{O}_2 
   $$ 

   to produce 

   $$ 
   15 \text{ grams of } \text{H}_2\text{O} 
   $$.

4. **Calculate the Concentration**:  
   Concentration is defined as the amount of a substance per unit volume of solution. If the volume of the solution is known, you can calculate the concentration by dividing the amount of the substance by the volume. For instance, if you have 

   $$ 
   15 \text{ grams of } \text{H}_2\text{O} 
   $$ 

   in a 

   $$ 
   1 \text{ liter (L)} 
   $$ 

   solution, the concentration of water would be 

   $$ 
   15 \text{ g/L} 
   $$.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, stoichiometric calculations enable the determination of concentration by using the ratios from a balanced chemical equation to find the amount of a substance, followed by dividing that value by the volume of the solution. This method requires knowledge of the balanced chemical equation for the reaction, the mass or amount of one reactant or product, and the volume of the solution.
