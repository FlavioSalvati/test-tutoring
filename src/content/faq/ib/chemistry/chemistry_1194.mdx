The overall order of a chemical reaction is determined by summing the individual orders of all the reactants involved in the process.

In a chemical reaction, the rate at which the reaction occurs can be significantly influenced by the concentrations of the reactants. This relationship is expressed in the rate equation, which typically takes the form:

$$
\text{rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n
$$

In this equation, $A$ and $B$ represent the reactants, $m$ and $n$ denote the orders of reaction with respect to $A$ and $B$, respectively, and $k$ is the rate constant. The overall order of the reaction is calculated as the sum of $m$ and $n$:

$$
\text{Overall order} = m + n
$$

The order of reaction with respect to a specific reactant indicates how the rate of the reaction changes as the concentration of that particular reactant varies. For instance, if the order of reaction with respect to $A$ is $1$, then doubling the concentration of $A$ will result in a doubling of the reaction rate. Conversely, if the order is $2$, doubling the concentration of $A$ will lead to a quadrupling of the reaction rate. If the order is $0$, the reaction rate remains constant regardless of the concentration of $A$.

It is essential to note that the orders of reaction do not necessarily correspond to the stoichiometric coefficients found in the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. Instead, they are determined experimentally by measuring how the reaction rate changes as the concentrations of the reactants are varied.

To find the overall order of a reaction, one simply adds together the orders of reaction for each reactant. For example, if a reaction is first order with respect to $A$ (i.e., $m=1$) and second order with respect to $B$ (i.e., $n=2$), then the overall order of the reaction is:

$$
1 + 2 = 3
$$

This implies that if the concentrations of both $A$ and $B$ are doubled, the rate of reaction will increase by a factor of:

$$
2^3 = 8
$$

Understanding the order of a reaction is crucial as it enables us to predict how the rate will change under varying conditions. This knowledge is applicable in numerous practical scenarios, ranging from industrial chemical processes to environmental chemistry.
