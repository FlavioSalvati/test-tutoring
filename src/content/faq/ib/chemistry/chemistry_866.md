Electron pair repulsion plays a critical role in determining molecular geometry by influencing the spatial arrangement of atoms within a molecule.

This concept is central to VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, which is employed to predict the shapes of individual molecules based on the electrostatic repulsion between electron pairs. According to VSEPR theory, the electron pairs surrounding a central atom repel each other and strive to maximize their separation. This repulsion occurs because electrons are negatively charged and repel one another due to their like charges.

The geometry of a molecule is dictated by the number of bonding electron pairs and lone pairs present in the valence shell of the central atom. For example, if there are two electron pairs in the valence shell, they will arrange themselves in a linear configuration to maintain maximum distance from one another. When three electron pairs are present, they will adopt a trigonal planar shape, while four pairs will form a tetrahedral shape.

It is essential to recognize that not all electron pairs exert equal repulsive forces. Lone pairs of electrons, which are non-bonding pairs, exert a stronger repulsion than bonding pairs. This is due to the fact that lone pairs are situated closer to the central atom and occupy more spatial volume. Consequently, lone pairs tend to push the bonding pairs closer together, leading to distortions in the molecular shape. For instance, in water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), there are two bonding pairs and two lone pairs on the oxygen atom. While the presence of four electron pairs might suggest a tetrahedral arrangement, the stronger repulsion from the lone pairs results in a bent or V-shaped configuration.

In conclusion, electron pair repulsion is a fundamental principle for understanding molecular geometry. It elucidates the specific shapes of molecules, as electron pairs arrange themselves to minimize repulsion by maximizing their distance from one another. The type of electron pair—whether bonding or lone—also significantly influences the ultimate shape of the molecule. Grasping this concept is crucial for predicting the shapes and properties of molecules in the field of chemistry.
