The formal charge of an atom within a molecule is calculated by taking the total number of valence electrons, subtracting the number of non-bonding electrons, and also subtracting half the number of bonding electrons. The formula for this calculation can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Formal Charge} = \text{Valence Electrons} - \text{Non-bonding Electrons} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Bonding Electrons}
$$

To clarify this process, let's break it down step by step. The formal charge represents a hypothetical charge that an atom would possess if all atoms in the molecule shared their electrons equally. 

### Key Definitions

1. **Valence Electrons**: These are the electrons located in the outermost shell of an atom that participate in chemical reactions. The number of valence electrons can be determined from the periodic table. For instance, carbon, belonging to group 14, has $4$ valence electrons.

2. **Non-bonding Electrons**: Also known as lone pairs, these are the electrons that do not participate in bonding and are typically represented as dots in Lewis structures.

3. **Bonding Electrons**: These electrons are involved in forming bonds between atoms. Each bond consists of two electrons: 
   - A single bond contains $2$ bonding electrons.
   - A double bond contains $4$ bonding electrons.
   - A triple bond contains $6$ bonding electrons.
   However, since bonding electrons are shared between two atoms, each atom counts only half of these electrons.

### Calculation Steps

To calculate the formal charge for a specific atom in a molecule, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Valence Electrons**: Refer to the periodic table to find the number of valence electrons for the atom of interest.

2. **Count Non-bonding Electrons**: Identify the lone pairs associated with the atom in the Lewis structure and count the corresponding electrons.

3. **Count Bonding Electrons**: Identify the bonds that the atom is involved in, and calculate the total number of bonding electrons. Remember to take half of this number for your calculations.

4. **Apply the Formula**: Use the values obtained in the previous steps to apply the formula for the formal charge.

### Final Considerations

It is important to keep in mind that the sum of the formal charges for all atoms in a molecule or ion must equal the overall charge of that molecule or ion. This serves as a valuable check to ensure that your calculations are accurate.

Understanding formal charge is essential for predicting the structure and reactivity of molecules, making it a fundamental concept in the study of chemistry.
