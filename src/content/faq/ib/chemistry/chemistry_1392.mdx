An excess reactant is defined as the substance that remains after all other reactants have been consumed in a chemical reaction.

In a chemical reaction, reactants are the substances that interact with one another to produce new substances known as products. The amount of product formed is determined by the quantities of reactants available. If one reactant is completely consumed before the others, it is termed the limiting reactant, as its quantity restricts the overall amount of product that can be produced. The remaining reactants, which are present in greater quantities than required to fully react with the limiting reactant, are referred to as excess reactants.

The concept of excess reactants is particularly important in practical applications of chemistry, such as in industrial processes. For instance, in the synthesis of ammonia via the Haber process, nitrogen and hydrogen are reacted together. To ensure complete consumption of nitrogen and prevent waste, an excess of hydrogen is utilized. This approach guarantees that the reaction proceeds to completion, with all nitrogen being converted into ammonia.

In laboratory settings, chemists often employ an excess of one reactant to ensure that the reaction reaches completion. This practice can simplify yield calculations, as it is clear that all of the limiting reactant has been utilized. However, it also necessitates the separation of the excess reactant from the product, which can complicate the overall process.

In summary, an excess reactant is a substance that is present in greater quantities than necessary to react with the limiting reactant in a chemical reaction. It remains after the reaction has completed. Understanding the concept of excess reactants is essential for both theoretical and practical applications in chemistry.
