In metallic bonding, the valence electrons, which are the outermost electrons of an atom, are delocalized and move freely, creating what is often referred to as a 'sea of electrons'. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in holding the metal atoms together.

Valence electrons are not confined to individual atoms or covalent bonds. Instead, their delocalization allows them to move freely throughout the entire metallic structure, forming a cohesive 'sea of electrons' that surrounds positively charged metal ions.

This 'sea of electrons' imparts several unique properties to metals. The ability of these electrons to move freely enables efficient conduction of electricity and heat. When an electric field is applied, the delocalized electrons can traverse the metal, transporting electric charge from one end to the other. Similarly, when heat is introduced, the energy is rapidly transferred via the movement of these electrons.

Additionally, the delocalized electrons create a strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged metal ions and the negatively charged electron cloud. This attractive force, known as metallic bonding, is responsible for maintaining the regular structure of metal atoms, contributing to their characteristic strength and malleability. The ability of electrons to move and rearrange themselves allows metals to be bent or shaped without fracturing.

The 'sea of electrons' model also accounts for the high melting and boiling points observed in metals. Significant energy is required to overcome the strong electrostatic forces between the delocalized electrons and the positive metal ions. Consequently, metals typically exhibit high melting and boiling points.

In summary, valence electrons in metallic bonding are not bound to specific atoms but are delocalized, forming a 'sea of electrons'. This delocalization is fundamental to the distinct properties of metals, including their electrical and thermal conductivity, strength, malleability, and elevated melting and boiling points.
