Transition metals are characterized by their ability to exhibit variable oxidation states, a phenomenon that arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in their $d$-orbitals.

These metals occupy a distinctive position in the periodic table due to their unique electron configurations, where the $4s$ and $3d$ sublevels are closely aligned in energy. Consequently, when a transition metal atom loses electrons, it can do so from either the $4s$ or $3d$ sublevel. This dual possibility results in a wide array of potential oxidation states.

The term "oxidation state" denotes the degree of oxidation of an atom within a chemical compound. In simpler terms, it represents the charge that an atom would possess if all of its bonds were considered ionic. For transition metals, the oxidation state can vary since they can lose different quantities of electrons from the $4s$ and $3d$ sublevels. For instance, iron ($\text{Fe}$) can exist in the +2 or +3 oxidation states, corresponding to the loss of two or three electrons, respectively.

The capacity of transition metals to adopt multiple oxidation states is one of their most significant characteristics. This versatility allows them to form a diverse range of compounds and to function as catalysts in various chemical reactions. For example, manganese ($\text{Mn}$) can exhibit oxidation states ranging from +2 to +7, enabling it to participate in numerous chemical processes and to form a variety of distinct compounds.

In summary, the variable oxidation states of transition metals result from their unique electron configurations, particularly the presence of unpaired electrons in their $d$-orbitals. This characteristic allows them to lose varying numbers of electrons, leading to a multitude of oxidation states and contributing to their diverse chemical behaviors.
