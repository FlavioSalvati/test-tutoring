The size of an atom decreases as you move across a period on the periodic table, while it increases as you move down a group. This behavior can be attributed to changes in nuclear charge and the addition of energy levels.

When you traverse a period from left to right, the atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus, increases. This rise in nuclear charge enhances the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons in the outer energy levels, effectively pulling them closer to the nucleus. This phenomenon is referred to as the effective nuclear charge. It's crucial to understand that the number of energy levels remains constant across a period, meaning there is no additional shielding effect from inner electrons that could mitigate the impact of the increasing nuclear charge.

Conversely, as you progress down a group in the periodic table, new energy levels are introduced. Each successive energy level is situated farther from the nucleus than the previous one, leading to an increase in atomic size. The outermost electrons reside in these higher energy levels, and due to their greater distance from the nucleus, they experience a weaker attraction. Additionally, the shielding effect plays a significant role in this context. The inner electrons, located in the lower energy levels, shield the outer electrons from the full attractive force of the nucleus, thereby diminishing the effective nuclear charge. As a result, the outermost electrons are held less tightly and can drift further away from the nucleus, which increases the atomic size.

In conclusion, atomic size is primarily influenced by two key factors: effective nuclear charge and the number of energy levels (or electron shells). The effective nuclear charge increases across a period, drawing electrons closer to the nucleus and resulting in a decrease in atomic size. In contrast, the addition of energy levels down a group pushes the outermost electrons further away from the nucleus, leading to an increase in atomic size. The shielding effect of inner electrons also contributes to this enlargement of atomic size as you move down a group.
