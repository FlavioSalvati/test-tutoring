The s, p, d, and f orbitals are distinct types of atomic orbitals, which are regions around an atom where the probability of finding electrons is highest. Each orbital type varies in shape, energy level, and electron capacity.

The s orbital is the simplest of the four. It has a spherical shape and can accommodate up to $2$ electrons. There is only one s orbital present in each energy level, beginning from the first level.

The p orbitals, in contrast, have a dumbbell shape and can hold a total of $6$ electrons. Starting from the second energy level, there are three p orbitals, each aligned along one of the three Cartesian axes: x, y, or z.

D orbitals are more complex, often resembling a four-leaf clover, and they can hold up to $10$ electrons. There are five d orbitals available in each energy level, starting from the third level.

The f orbitals are the most intricate and can accommodate as many as $14$ electrons. There are seven f orbitals in each energy level, commencing from the fourth level.

As we progress from s to f orbitals, the energy levels also increase. This implies that electrons in s orbitals are situated closer to the nucleus and possess lower energy, while electrons in f orbitals are found further away and have higher energy.

Furthermore, the number of orbitals within each type increases as we move from s to f. Specifically, there is one s orbital, three p orbitals, five d orbitals, and seven f orbitals. Consequently, the capacity for holding electrons rises from s to f, allowing for a greater number of electrons in the higher-energy orbitals.
