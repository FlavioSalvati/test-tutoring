Internal energy is defined as the total energy contained within the particles of a system, encompassing both kinetic and potential energy.

Often represented by the symbol $U$, internal energy is a crucial concept in thermodynamics. It refers to the overall energy present in a system, which is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the individual particles that constitute the system. The kinetic energy arises from the motion of these particles, while potential energy is associated with the interactions and forces between them.

For instance, in a gas, the kinetic energy corresponds to the random motion of gas molecules, whereas the potential energy relates to the attractive or repulsive forces acting between these molecules. In solids and liquids, the potential energy also includes the energy related to the forces that maintain the positions of atoms or molecules within the structure.

The internal energy of a system can fluctuate due to heat transfer, work performed on or by the system, or a combination of the two. For example, when heat is introduced to a system, the kinetic energy of the particles increases, which in turn raises the internal energy. On the other hand, if work is done by the system, such as during the expansion of a gas, the internal energy may decrease.

It is essential to highlight that internal energy is a state function, meaning it is determined solely by the current state of the system and is independent of the specific path taken to achieve that state. Consequently, the change in internal energy of a system remains constant, regardless of the processes that lead to that change.

In conclusion, internal energy is a fundamental concept for understanding how energy is stored and transferred in chemical systems. It serves as a framework for analyzing energy changes during reactions and processes, making it integral to the field of thermodynamics.
