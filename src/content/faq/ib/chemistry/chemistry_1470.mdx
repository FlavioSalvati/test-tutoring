The atomic number and mass number are essential concepts in atomic science, each serving a distinct role in defining an atom's characteristics.

The atomic number, represented by the symbol $Z$, signifies the number of protons located in an atom's nucleus. This fundamental property is crucial as it defines the chemical identity of an element. Each element possesses a unique atomic number, which is used to organize elements in the periodic table. For instance, hydrogen has an atomic number of $1$, helium has an atomic number of $2$, and this pattern continues for other elements. Additionally, the atomic number determines the number of electrons in a neutral atom, which significantly influences the atom's chemical behavior.

Conversely, the mass number, denoted by the symbol $A$, is the sum of the protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. Neutrons are neutral particles that have a mass similar to that of protons. The mass number provides an approximation of an atom's atomic mass, typically measured in atomic mass units (amu). For example, carbon contains six protons and six neutrons, resulting in a mass number of $12$.

It is crucial to understand that while the atomic number is constant for a specific element, the mass number can vary. This variation arises because atoms of the same element can contain different numbers of neutrons. Such variations are termed isotopes. For instance, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are both isotopes of carbon; they share the same atomic number of $6$, indicating that they each have $6$ protons. However, carbon-12 contains $6$ neutrons, while carbon-14 has $8$ neutrons, leading to their respective mass numbers of $12$ and $14$.

In summary, the atomic number and mass number are fundamental properties that describe an atom's structure and identity. The atomic number ($Z$) indicates the number of protons and defines the element, whereas the mass number ($A$) represents the total count of protons and neutrons, providing an estimate of the atom's mass.
