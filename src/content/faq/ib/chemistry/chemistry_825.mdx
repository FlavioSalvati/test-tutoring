The maximum number of electrons that can occupy a single orbital is governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

The Pauli Exclusion Principle is a foundational concept in quantum mechanics, named after physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who formulated it. This principle asserts that no two electrons in an atom can possess the same set of four quantum numbers. Quantum numbers serve as unique 'addresses' for electrons, providing information about their energy level, the shape of their orbital, their orientation in space, and their spin.

The first three quantum numbers—principal, azimuthal, and magnetic—characterize the orbital in which an electron is located. The fourth quantum number, known as the spin quantum number, indicates the direction of the electron's spin. This spin quantum number can take on one of two values: $+\frac{1}{2}$ (often referred to as 'up') or $-\frac{1}{2}$ (commonly referred to as 'down'). Consequently, only two electrons can occupy a single orbital: one with an 'up' spin and the other with a 'down' spin.

Thus, the maximum number of electrons that an orbital can hold is $2$. This rule is essential for understanding atomic structure and plays a crucial role in the arrangement of electrons within atoms, a concept known as electron configuration. It also provides insight into the organization of the periodic table, where each row signifies a new energy level, and each block corresponds to a different type of orbital.

In summary, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, a key tenet of quantum mechanics, dictates that an orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons. These electrons must have opposite spins, as indicated by their respective spin quantum numbers. This principle is fundamental to our understanding of atomic structure and the layout of the periodic table.
