Atomic mass and molecular mass are two fundamental concepts in chemistry that describe the mass of atoms and molecules, respectively.

**Atomic Mass**

Atomic mass, often referred to as atomic weight, represents the weighted average mass of an atom of an element. This average takes into account the relative abundance of the various isotopes of that element. Atomic mass is typically expressed in atomic mass units (amu), where $1 \, \text{amu}$ is approximately equivalent to the mass of a single proton or neutron. You can find the atomic mass of an element on the periodic table, which provides insight into the mass of an individual atom of that element.

**Molecular Mass**

In contrast, molecular mass (or molecular weight) is defined as the total mass of a molecule. It is determined by summing the atomic masses of all the atoms within the molecule. For instance, to calculate the molecular mass of water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), one would add the atomic masses of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

**Key Differences**

It is essential to understand that atomic mass pertains to individual atoms, while molecular mass relates to entire molecules, which may consist of multiple atoms of the same or different elements. As a result, the molecular mass of a molecule will always be equal to or greater than the atomic masses of its constituent elements.

**Importance in Chemistry**

Grasping the distinction between atomic mass and molecular mass is crucial in the field of chemistry, particularly in the context of chemical reactions and stoichiometry. This understanding enables chemists to calculate the quantities of substances that will react with or produce other substances, as well as to comprehend the physical and chemical properties of various compounds.
