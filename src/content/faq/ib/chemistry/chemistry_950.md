The spontaneity of a chemical reaction can be assessed by calculating the change in Gibbs free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$.

The Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G$) is a thermodynamic potential that quantifies the maximum reversible work a system can perform at constant temperature and pressure. It plays a crucial role in determining whether a chemical reaction will proceed spontaneously. Specifically, if $\Delta G$ is negative, the reaction is spontaneous under the specified conditions. Conversely, if $\Delta G$ is positive, the reaction will not occur spontaneously. When $\Delta G$ equals zero, the system is in a state of equilibrium.

The Gibbs free energy change can be calculated using the equation 

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S,
$$

where $\Delta H$ represents the change in enthalpy (or heat content), $T$ is the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin, and $\Delta S$ denotes the change in entropy (or disorder). The values for $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ can be obtained from standard thermodynamic tables for the reactants and products involved in the reaction.

In addition to the Gibbs free energy change, the spontaneity of a reaction can also be affected by the reaction conditions, which include temperature and pressure. For instance, an endothermic reaction (where $\Delta H > 0$) may become spontaneous at elevated temperatures. This is because the term $T\Delta S$ in the Gibbs free energy equation increases with temperature and can surpass the positive $\Delta H$. Similarly, a reaction that produces an increase in the number of gas molecules may become spontaneous at lower pressures, as the associated increase in entropy (disorder) is favored.

It is important to understand that the spontaneity of a reaction does not imply the speed at which the reaction occurs. A reaction can be spontaneous yet proceed at a very slow rate if there exists a significant energy barrier, known as the activation energy, that must be overcome. The rate of a reaction is governed by its mechanism and can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of a catalyst.
