Group 1 elements, commonly referred to as alkali metals, are characterized by their high reactivity, softness, and low melting and boiling points.

The alkali metals include lithium ($\text{Li}$), sodium ($\text{Na}$), potassium ($\text{K}$), rubidium ($\text{Rb}$), caesium ($\text{Cs}$), and francium ($\text{Fr}$). These elements occupy the first column of the periodic table, and they share similar chemical properties due to the presence of a single electron in their outermost energy level. This unique configuration contributes to their high reactivity, particularly with water and oxygen. To mitigate their tendency to react with moisture in the air, these metals are typically stored in oil.

Alkali metals are classified as soft metals, which means they can be easily cut with a knife. Their softness increases as one moves down the group, with caesium and francium being the softest members. Additionally, these metals have low densities; in fact, lithium, sodium, and potassium are less dense than water, allowing them to float on its surfaceâ€”an uncommon trait among metals.

When it comes to melting and boiling points, alkali metals exhibit relatively low values compared to other metals. These points decrease progressively as you move down the group, with francium having the lowest melting and boiling points among the alkali metals. This trend can be attributed to the increasing atomic size and the diminishing strength of the metallic bonds as one descends the group.

From an electronic configuration standpoint, all alkali metals possess a single electron in their outermost shell. This configuration makes them highly reactive, as they tend to lose this electron in pursuit of a stable electronic arrangement. Consequently, they form +1 ions and exhibit an oxidation state of +1 in their compounds.

Lastly, alkali metals are excellent conductors of heat and electricity, a property stemming from the presence of free-moving electrons that can carry charge and thermal energy. Despite their inherent reactivity and softness, these conductive properties render them valuable in various applications, including batteries and heat transfer systems.
