Transition metals are generally denser than s-block elements, and this can be attributed to their smaller atomic radii and greater atomic masses.

Transition metals, located in the d-block of the periodic table, exhibit higher densities compared to s-block elements primarily due to their atomic structure. Specifically, the atomic radius of transition metals is smaller than that of s-block elements. This difference arises because the additional electrons in transition metals are added to the inner d-orbitals rather than the outermost shell. As a result, the outermost electrons are drawn closer to the nucleus, which increases the effective nuclear charge experienced by these electrons and leads to a reduction in atomic size.

Moreover, transition metals possess higher atomic masses. Atomic mass is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atom. Transition metals typically have more protons and neutrons than their s-block counterparts, resulting in a greater overall atomic mass.

When evaluating density, it is essential to understand that density is defined as mass per unit volume. Transition metals, with their higher atomic masses and smaller atomic radii, occupy less volume for a greater amount of mass. This characteristic leads to their higher density when compared to s-block elements, which have larger atomic radii and lower atomic masses.

Additionally, transition metals exhibit a higher packing efficiency due to their close-packed atomic structures. This means that the atoms can arrange themselves more closely together, minimizing the amount of empty space between them. This close packing further contributes to their increased density.

In conclusion, the greater density of transition metals compared to s-block elements can be ascribed to their smaller atomic radii, higher atomic masses, and superior packing efficiency. These factors enable a larger quantity of matter to occupy a smaller volume, resulting in a higher density.
