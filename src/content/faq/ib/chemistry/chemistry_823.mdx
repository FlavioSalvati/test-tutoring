Excited state electron configurations are characterized by the promotion of an electron from a lower energy level to a higher energy level.

In an atom, electrons are arranged in distinct energy levels surrounding the nucleus. This arrangement is referred to as the electron configuration. In the ground state, electrons occupy the lowest possible energy levels. However, when an atom absorbs energy, one or more of its electrons may be excited to a higher energy level, resulting in what is known as the excited state.

To represent the excited state electron configuration, you first need to establish the ground state electron configuration. For instance, the ground state electron configuration of a carbon atom is given by $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. This notation indicates that there are two electrons in the $1s$ orbital, two in the $2s$ orbital, and two in the $2p$ orbital.

When an electron is excited, it transitions from a lower energy level to a higher one. For example, if a carbon atom absorbs sufficient energy, one of its $2s$ electrons may be excited to the $2p$ orbital. Consequently, the excited state electron configuration would be represented as $1s^2 2s^1 2p^3$.

It is important to note that the excited state is inherently less stable than the ground state. The excited electron will ultimately return to its original energy level, releasing the absorbed energy in the process. This energy is often emitted as light, which explains why excited atoms can exhibit a glow.

In summary, to depict an excited state electron configuration, you must illustrate the transition of an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. This is accomplished by adjusting the superscript numbers in the electron configuration to reflect the new arrangement of electrons. Keep in mind that the excited state is temporary and less stable than the ground state, so the electron will eventually revert to its original energy level.
