Ions can be larger than their parent atoms due to the process of electron gain, which increases electron-electron repulsion and causes the electron cloud to expand.

The size of an ion relative to its parent atom is influenced by the balance between the number of electrons and protons present. When an atom transitions to an ion, it either loses or gains electrons. If an atom loses electrons and forms a positive ion (or cation), it typically becomes smaller than its parent atom. This size reduction occurs because there are fewer electrons being attracted by the same number of protons, resulting in a contracted electron cloud.

Conversely, when an atom gains electrons and becomes a negative ion (or anion), it generally increases in size compared to its parent atom. This enlargement happens because the additional electrons are still being attracted by the same number of protons, leading to increased electron-electron repulsion. This repulsion causes the electron cloud to expand, resulting in a larger ionic radius and making the anion larger than the original atom.

For instance, letâ€™s consider a neutral chlorine atom that gains an electron to form a chloride ion. The chlorine atom has $17$ protons and $17$ electrons, while the chloride ion has $17$ protons and $18$ electrons. The introduction of the extra electron in the chloride ion heightens electron-electron repulsion, which expands the electron cloud, thereby making the chloride ion larger than the neutral chlorine atom.

Additionally, the overall nuclear charge, defined as the total charge from all the protons in the nucleus, significantly influences the size of an ion. A higher nuclear charge results in a stronger attraction between the nucleus and the electrons, typically leading to a smaller ion. However, when an atom gains electrons and becomes an anion, the resultant increase in electron-electron repulsion usually surpasses the effects of nuclear charge, ultimately resulting in a larger ionic size.
