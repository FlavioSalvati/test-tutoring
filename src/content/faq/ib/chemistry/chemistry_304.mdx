The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution effectively illustrates the proportion of molecules that possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy.

This distribution serves as a statistical representation of the range of energies that particles in a gas or liquid have at a specific temperature. It is a probability distribution that characterizes the kinetic energy of particles within a system. The distribution curve plots the number of particles (on the y-axis) against their corresponding energy levels (on the x-axis).

Activation energy, in contrast, refers to the minimum energy required for a chemical reaction to take place. It represents the energy barrier that reactant molecules must overcome to be transformed into products.

The connection between the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and activation energy becomes evident when examining the area under the curve to the right of the activation energy. This area signifies the proportion of molecules that possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. These are the molecules that have sufficient energy to participate in a reaction.

As temperature increases, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve flattens and broadens. This change indicates that a larger proportion of molecules achieve higher kinetic energy levels. Consequently, more molecules exceed the activation energy threshold, thereby accelerating the reaction rate.

In essence, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution visually demonstrates how temperature influences the proportion of molecules capable of surpassing the activation energy barrier. This understanding clarifies why increasing temperature enhances the rate of a chemical reaction: it boosts the number of molecules with adequate energy to react.

In summary, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and activation energy are fundamentally interconnected. The distribution curve provides a statistical portrayal of the energies of particles in a system, while activation energy defines the minimum energy necessary for a reaction to occur. The area under the curve to the right of the activation energy represents the proportion of molecules with sufficient energy to react, and this proportion increases with rising temperature.
