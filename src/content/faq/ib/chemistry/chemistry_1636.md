The tetrahedral shape of methane is primarily the result of the repulsion between the four pairs of bonding electrons surrounding the central carbon atom.

In methane, denoted as $\text{CH}_4$, the central carbon atom forms covalent bonds with four hydrogen atoms. Each carbon atom possesses four valence electrons, and each hydrogen atom contributes one electron, resulting in a total of four pairs of bonding electrons around the carbon atom. According to Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, these electron pairs arrange themselves to maximize their distance from one another, thereby minimizing repulsion. This arrangement leads to a tetrahedral molecular geometry, characterized by bond angles of approximately $109.5^\circ$.

VSEPR theory is a widely used model in chemistry that predicts the geometry of individual molecules based on the number of electron pairs surrounding their central atoms. The core principle of this theory is that electron pairs occupy space around an atom and will position themselves to minimize repulsion, which ultimately determines the molecular shape. For methane, the four pairs of bonding electrons are arranged in a tetrahedral configuration to achieve this minimization of repulsion.

The tetrahedral shape is one of the most prevalent molecular geometries in chemistry, particularly for molecules with a single central atom. This geometry is characterized by four atoms or groups of atoms located at the corners of a tetrahedron, with the central atom positioned at the center. Such an arrangement allows for maximum separation of the electron pairs, reducing repulsion and contributing to the stability of the molecule.

In summary, the tetrahedral shape of methane arises from the repulsion between the four pairs of bonding electrons around the carbon atom, in accordance with VSEPR theory, which predicts molecular geometry based on the configuration of electron pairs surrounding central atoms.
