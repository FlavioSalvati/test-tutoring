The $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$ orbitals are distinct types of atomic orbitals, each characterized by unique shapes, energy levels, and the maximum number of electrons they can accommodate. These orbitals represent the regions surrounding an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.

The $s$ orbital is the simplest of all. It possesses a spherical shape and can hold a maximum of two electrons. There is only one $s$ orbital in each energy level, starting from the first level.

In contrast, the $p$ orbitals have a dumbbell shape and can hold up to six electrons in total. Each principal energy level from the second onward contains three $p$ orbitals, each oriented along one of the three Cartesian axes: $x$, $y$, or $z$.

The $d$ orbitals are more intricate in shape, often resembling a four-leaf clover. They can accommodate up to ten electrons. Each energy level from the third level onward contains five $d$ orbitals.

The $f$ orbitals are the most complex, capable of holding up to fourteen electrons. There are seven $f$ orbitals in each energy level, starting from the fourth.

Additionally, the energy levels of these orbitals increase sequentially from $s$ to $f$. This means that electrons in $s$ orbitals are positioned closer to the nucleus and possess lower energy, while electrons in $f$ orbitals are situated further away and have higher energy.

Moreover, the number of available orbitals increases as we progress from $s$ to $f$: there is one $s$ orbital, three $p$ orbitals, five $d$ orbitals, and seven $f$ orbitals. Consequently, the maximum number of electrons that can be held within each type of orbital also rises.

Grasping the distinctions between $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$ orbitals is essential for understanding the electronic configuration of atoms. This knowledge is fundamentally important for comprehending chemical reactions and the properties of various elements.
