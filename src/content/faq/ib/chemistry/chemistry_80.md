The filling of the $4s$ sub-shell occurs before the $3d$ sub-shell due to its lower energy level, as dictated by the Aufbau principle.

The Aufbau principle is a key concept in quantum mechanics that describes the order in which electrons occupy atomic orbitals. According to this principle, electrons fill the lowest energy levels first before progressing to higher ones. This explains why the $1s$ sub-shell is filled first, followed by the $2s$, $2p$, $3s$, $3p$, and so on. For more details, please refer to the relevant literature.

However, the order of filling does not strictly follow the principal quantum number ($n$). This is primarily because the unique shapes and orientations of various orbital types (s, p, d, f) can affect their energy levels. The $4s$ orbital is spherical in shape, whereas the $3d$ orbital exhibits a more complex cloverleaf structure. This difference in shape results in the $4s$ orbital having lower energy than the $3d$ orbital. For a more comprehensive understanding of the different types of orbitals, please consult the appropriate resources.

Moreover, the energy levels of orbitals can also be influenced by electron-electron interactions. When an electron is added to an orbital, it can increase the energy of that orbital due to electron-electron repulsion. This effect is particularly pronounced in the $d$ and $f$ orbitals, which can accommodate more electrons and therefore experience greater electron-electron interactions compared to the $s$ and $p$ orbitals. Consequently, the $4s$ orbital, which typically holds only one electron, has a lower energy than the $3d$ orbital, which can hold up to five electrons.

In summary, electrons fill orbitals starting from the lowest energy levels, in accordance with the Aufbau principle. Although the $4s$ and $3d$ orbitals are close in energy, the $4s$ orbital is slightly lower in energy and is filled first. This preference arises from the differences in their shapes and the interactions among electrons within these orbitals, making the $4s$ orbital the preferred choice before electrons move to the $3d$ orbital.
