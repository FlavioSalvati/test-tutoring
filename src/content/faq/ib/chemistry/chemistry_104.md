Atomic and ionic radii vary based on electron configurations, which are influenced by changes in electron shielding and nuclear charge.

**Atomic Radius**: The atomic radius defines the size of an atom, determined primarily by its electron configuration. As the number of electron shells increases, the atomic radius also increases. This is because the outer electrons are positioned further from the nucleus and are shielded by the inner shells from the positive charge of the protons. This phenomenon, known as the shielding effect, reduces the effective nuclear charge that the outer electrons experience. As a result, these outer electrons are held less tightly, allowing them to occupy a larger volume and thus increasing the atomic radius.

**Ionic Radius**: In contrast, the ionic radius refers to the size of an ion, which is formed when an atom or a group of atoms gains or loses electrons. When an atom loses an electron to create a positively charged ion (cation), its electron configuration changes, leading to fewer electron shells. This reduction in electron shells decreases electron shielding and increases the effective nuclear charge felt by the remaining electrons. Consequently, the protons in the nucleus hold these electrons more tightly, resulting in a smaller ionic radius. Conversely, when an atom gains an electron to form a negatively charged ion (anion), the electron configuration expands to include an additional electron shell. This addition increases electron shielding and diminishes the effective nuclear charge felt by the outer electrons, allowing them to be held less tightly and occupy a larger volume, thereby increasing the ionic radius.

In summary, the electron configuration of an atom or ion directly influences its atomic or ionic radius. The number of electron shells, which changes with the gain or loss of electrons, affects both the degree of electron shielding and the effective nuclear charge. These factors play a critical role in determining the size of the atom or ion. Understanding these principles is essential for predicting the properties of atoms and ions and for explaining the trends observed in the periodic table.
