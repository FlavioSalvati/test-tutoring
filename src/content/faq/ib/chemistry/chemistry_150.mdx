Bond polarity describes the uneven distribution of electrical charge in a chemical bond between two atoms.

In a chemical bond, the electrons involved are not always shared equally. This unequal sharing occurs because different atoms possess varying electronegativities, which quantify an atom's ability to attract shared electrons. When two atoms with differing electronegativities form a bond, the atom with the higher electronegativity pulls the shared electrons closer to itself. This leads to a charge imbalance: the more electronegative atom becomes slightly negative (denoted as $\delta^-$), while the less electronegative atom becomes slightly positive (denoted as $\delta^+$). This phenomenon is known as bond polarity.

For instance, consider a water molecule, represented as $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. The oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, causing the shared electrons in the O-H bonds to spend more time nearer to the oxygen atom. Consequently, the oxygen end of the molecule acquires a slight negative charge, while the hydrogen ends acquire a slight positive charge, resulting in polar bonds.

Conversely, not all chemical bonds exhibit polarity. When two atoms have identical electronegativities, they share their electrons equally, resulting in a nonpolar bond. A prime example is nitrogen gas, represented as $\text{N}_2$, where the two nitrogen atoms have the same electronegativity and thus form a nonpolar bond.

Understanding bond polarity is essential in chemistry, as it affects various molecular properties, including shape, reactivity, and the types of intermolecular forces present. For example, molecules with polar bonds typically have higher boiling points compared to similar nonpolar molecules, as polar molecules can form stronger intermolecular attractions. Additionally, knowledge of bond polarity can aid in predicting molecular behavior in chemical reactions. In a scenario where a polar molecule interacts with a nonpolar molecule, the polar molecule is likely to act as the electron donor, since its electrons are held less tightly.
