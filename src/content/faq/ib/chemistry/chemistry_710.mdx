Markovnikov's rule, a fundamental principle in organic chemistry, provides valuable insight into the outcome of addition reactions involving alkenes. Formulated by Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov in 1869, this rule specifically applies to the addition of hydrogen halides to alkenes.

In an addition reaction, two or more molecules combine to form a larger molecule. Alkenes, characterized by their carbon-carbon double bonds, frequently participate in these reactions. When a hydrogen halide (denoted as $HX$, where $X$ represents a halogen) is added to an alkene, the addition can occur in two distinct ways across the double bond, resulting in two potential products.

Markovnikov's rule aids in predicting which of these products will be formed in greater abundance. According to the rule, the hydrogen atom will attach to the carbon atom of the double bond that already has more hydrogen atoms (referred to as the least substituted carbon). Conversely, the halogen will bond to the other carbon atom (the more substituted carbon).

This rule is grounded in the concept of carbocation stability. Carbocations are intermediates that form during the reaction, and their stability increases with the degree of substitution; more substituted carbocations are more stable. Thus, the reaction tends to favor the formation of the more stable carbocation, leading to the product predicted by Markovnikov's rule.

It is important to recognize that there are exceptions to Markovnikov's rule. For instance, when peroxides are present, the addition of hydrogen bromide ($HBr$) to alkenes can yield an 'anti-Markovnikov' product, where the bromine attaches to the least substituted carbon. This phenomenon is known as the peroxide effect or Kharasch effect.

In summary, Markovnikov's rule serves as a practical guideline for predicting the major product of addition reactions that involve alkenes and hydrogen halides. It is fundamentally based on the stability of carbocation intermediates and illustrates the principle that chemical reactions tend to favor pathways that minimize energy.
