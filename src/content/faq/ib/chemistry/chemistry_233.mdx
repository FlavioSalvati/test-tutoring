Systems tend to evolve toward states of higher entropy because such states are statistically more likely to occur than ordered ones.

Entropy is a quantitative measure of disorder or randomness within a system. In the microscopic realm, each possible state of a system corresponds to a specific arrangement of its constituent particles. For instance, consider a gas contained within a vessel: one possible state might have all the gas particles clustered in one half of the container, while another state might feature the particles evenly distributed throughout the entire volume. The latter configuration is more disordered and, therefore, has a higher entropy.

The fundamental reason for the tendency of systems to evolve toward higher entropy lies in the concept of probability. There are significantly more configurations that lead to disordered arrangements of particles compared to ordered ones. If we randomly rearranged the particles in our gas container, it is overwhelmingly more probable that we would find them in a dispersed state rather than clumped together. This is due to the sheer number of possible arrangements that correspond to the spread-out configuration.

This principle is encapsulated in the second law of thermodynamics, which asserts that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. While it may remain constant in specific ideal scenarios—such as when the system is in a steady state or undergoing a reversible process—any spontaneous change will invariably result in an increase in total entropy. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the principle of the increase of entropy.

In summary, systems naturally progress toward higher entropy states because these configurations are statistically favored. To illustrate this concept, think of tossing a handful of marbles onto a chessboard; it is far more likely that the marbles will land in a random, disordered pattern rather than in a straight line. The same principle applies to particles in a system, thereby explaining the inherent tendency for systems to evolve toward states of greater entropy.
