The Wittig reaction is a distinctive organic reaction that facilitates the transformation of a carbonyl compound into an alkene through the use of a phosphonium ylide.

Named after its inventor, the German chemist Georg Wittig, this reaction is notable for its specific mechanism and the unique products it generates. Unlike many other organic reactions, the Wittig reaction exclusively converts a carbonyl compound—characterized by the presence of a C=O functional group—into an alkene, which is a hydrocarbon featuring a carbon-carbon double bond. This transformation is achieved through the involvement of a specialized reagent known as a phosphonium ylide.

A phosphonium ylide is defined as a compound that contains a negatively charged carbon atom adjacent to a positively charged phosphorus atom. This unique structure is central to the Wittig reaction, setting it apart from other organic transformations. The ylide itself is synthesized by first reacting a phosphine with an alkyl halide, followed by deprotonation using a strong base.

The mechanism of the Wittig reaction is also distinctive. It proceeds through a concerted [2+2] cycloaddition between the ylide and the carbonyl compound, forming a four-membered ring intermediate known as an oxaphosphetane. This intermediate then undergoes a [2+2] cycloreversion, resulting in the production of the alkene and a phosphine oxide.

The Wittig reaction is highly valued in organic synthesis due to its ability to generate alkenes with a high degree of control over stereochemistry. This precision is particularly advantageous in the synthesis of complex organic molecules, where the spatial arrangement of atoms is critical. Moreover, the reaction is versatile, applicable to a diverse array of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, and esters.

In summary, the Wittig reaction is distinguished by its use of a phosphonium ylide, its unique reaction mechanism involving a four-membered ring intermediate, and its capacity to convert carbonyl compounds into alkenes while maintaining control over stereochemistry.
