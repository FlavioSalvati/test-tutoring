Electron delocalisation plays a crucial role in resonance by enabling electrons to move freely across multiple atoms, thereby stabilising the molecule.

To elaborate, electron delocalisation refers to the phenomenon where electrons are not restricted to a single bond or atom; instead, they can traverse different regions of the molecule. This behavior is especially prevalent in molecules featuring conjugated systems, which consist of alternating single and double bonds that permit the unrestricted movement of $\pi$ electrons.

Resonance is a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes the delocalisation of electrons in molecules with conjugated structures. It serves as a method for representing the actual structure of a molecule, which is often a hybrid of several possible configurations known as resonance forms. These resonance forms are not actual molecular structures but rather idealised representations that illustrate the extremes of electron distribution. The true structure of the molecule is a more stable, average form.

Through electron delocalisation, molecules can achieve this more stable intermediate state. The ability of electrons to move freely across the molecule allows for the distribution of charge, which reduces areas of high electron density. This redistribution contributes to the stability of the molecule, as regions with high electron density can be energetically unfavorable.

For instance, in benzene, a molecule characterised by a conjugated system of six carbon atoms, the electrons are delocalised throughout the entire ring. This delocalisation is illustrated by a resonance structure that includes a circle in the center of the ring, symbolising the presence of delocalised electrons. As a result of this delocalisation, benzene is more stable compared to a structure where the electrons are confined to alternating single and double bonds.

In conclusion, electron delocalisation is a pivotal factor in resonance. It allows electrons to traverse the molecule freely, which helps to spread out the charge and enhance molecular stability. This phenomenon is particularly significant in conjugated systems, where the alternating single and double bonds facilitate the movement of electrons.
