Metallic bonding significantly influences the physical properties of metals, including their high melting points, malleability, ductility, and electrical conductivity.

Metallic bonding is a type of chemical bonding that arises from the electrostatic attractive force between conduction electrons and positively charged metal ions. It is the main reason why metals have unique physical properties that distinguish them from other substances.

One of the most noticeable properties of metals is their high melting and boiling points. This is due to the strong forces of attraction between the positive metal ions and the sea of delocalised electrons. These forces require a large amount of energy to overcome, hence the high temperatures needed to melt or boil metals. For instance, tungsten, which has the highest melting point of all metals, is used to make filaments for light bulbs because it can withstand high temperatures without melting.

Another property influenced by metallic bonding is malleability, which is the ability of metals to be hammered into thin sheets. This is possible because the layers of positive ions in a metal can slide over each other without breaking the bonds between them and the delocalised electrons. This is also the reason why metals are ductile, meaning they can be drawn into thin wires. The delocalised electrons allow the ions to slide past each other without causing the metal to break.

Furthermore, metallic bonding is responsible for the high electrical and thermal conductivity of metals. The delocalised electrons are free to move throughout the metal, allowing it to conduct electricity. Similarly, these free electrons can also transfer kinetic energy, which is why metals are good conductors of heat.

Lastly, the shiny appearance of metals, also known as their lustre, is a result of metallic bonding. When light hits the surface of a metal, the delocalised electrons vibrate and re-emit the light, causing the metal to shine.

In conclusion, metallic bonding plays a crucial role in determining the physical properties of metals. Understanding this can help us utilise metals more effectively in various applications, from construction to electronics.
