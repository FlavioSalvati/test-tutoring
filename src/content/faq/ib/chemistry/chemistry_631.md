In the context of resonance, the term 'delocalised' refers to the distribution of electrons across multiple atoms rather than their confinement to just two atoms. 

More specifically, 'delocalised' describes the behavior of electrons in certain molecular structures where they are not restricted to a specific pair of atoms. Instead, these electrons are spread out, or 'delocalised', over three or more atoms. This phenomenon is frequently observed in molecular structures that exhibit resonance.

Resonance is a fundamental concept in chemistry, indicating that certain molecules cannot be accurately depicted by a single Lewis structure. Instead, these molecules are best represented as a hybrid of several structures, known as resonance structures. The actual molecule can be thought of as the average of these structures, with electrons not localized in any specific area, but rather delocalised throughout the entire molecular framework.

For instance, consider benzene, a well-known organic compound. Benzene is often depicted as a hexagon featuring alternating single and double bonds. However, this representation oversimplifies the true nature of the molecule. In reality, the electrons associated with the double bonds are not confined to any two adjacent carbon atoms; they are delocalised over all six carbon atoms in the ring. This delocalisation of electrons leads to a structure that exhibits greater stability than any individual resonance structure would suggest.

The concept of delocalisation is essential for understanding the properties of many molecules, including their stability, reactivity, and the nature of the bonds that connect them. It also plays a significant role in the behavior of electrons in metals and semiconductors, as well as in the principles of quantum mechanics.

In summary, 'delocalised' in the context of resonance describes the phenomenon where electrons are not limited to a single pair of atoms but are instead spread out over multiple atoms. This delocalisation contributes to the overall stability and distinctive properties of the molecule.
