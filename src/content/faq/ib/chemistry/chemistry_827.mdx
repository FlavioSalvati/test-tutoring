The energy of electrons increases across a period in the periodic table due to the rising nuclear charge, which occurs without a corresponding increase in shielding.

To elaborate, as you progress from left to right across a period, the atomic number, which represents the number of protons in the nucleus, increases. This leads to a higher nuclear charge. However, the number of energy levels, or electron shells, remains constant. Consequently, the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons within the same energy level becomes stronger, resulting in an increase in the energy of those electrons.

The shielding effect, which refers to the reduction in effective nuclear charge caused by the repulsion of electrons in inner shells, does not significantly increase as one moves across a period. This is primarily because the additional electrons are being added to the same energy level rather than to inner levels. As a result, the growing nuclear charge is not balanced by a corresponding increase in shielding, leading to a greater effective nuclear charge. This enhanced attraction between the nucleus and the electrons contributes to an increase in electron energy.

Moreover, the rise in electron energy across a period is closely linked to the concept of ionization energy. Ionization energy is defined as the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. As the nuclear charge increases across a period, the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons intensifies, making it more difficult to remove an electron. Thus, the ionization energy also increases, serving as another indicator of the heightened energy of the electrons.

In summary, the increase in electron energy across a period can be attributed to the escalating nuclear charge, which strengthens the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons, coupled with a minimal increase in shielding. This results in a higher effective nuclear charge and elevated ionization energy, both of which signify an increase in electron energy.
