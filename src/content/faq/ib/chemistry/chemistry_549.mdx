Protons define the atomic number, neutrons contribute to atomic mass, and electrons govern the atom's chemical behavior.

Atoms are composed of three primary subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Each of these particles plays a distinct and vital role in determining the characteristics of an atom.

**Protons** are positively charged particles located in the nucleus of the atom. The count of protons in an atom, known as the atomic number, uniquely identifies the element. For instance, hydrogen has one proton ($1$), helium has two protons ($2$), and so forth. The number of protons remains constant under normal circumstances, except during nuclear reactions. Consequently, altering the number of protons changes the element itself.

**Neutrons** are neutral particles that also reside in the nucleus. While they do not influence the atomic number, they significantly contribute to the atomic mass. The number of neutrons can vary within atoms of the same element, resulting in the formation of isotopes. Isotopes are atoms that share the same number of protons but have differing neutron counts. This variation can impact the atom's stability, with some isotopes being radioactive.

**Electrons** are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels, or shells. The arrangement and behavior of these electrons are critical in determining the atom's chemical properties. Electrons participate in bonding, as they can be shared, lost, or gained during chemical reactions. The outermost shell, known as the valence shell, plays a particularly crucial role in defining how an atom interacts with others. Atoms tend to seek a full valence shell, which often leads to the formation of bonds with neighboring atoms.

In summary, protons establish the identity of an atom, neutrons contribute to its mass and stability, and electrons dictate its chemical behavior. A comprehensive understanding of these roles is essential for the study of atomic structure and the broader field of chemistry.
