Interstitial compounds are chemical substances in which small atoms, such as hydrogen, carbon, or nitrogen, occupy the interstitial sites within transition metals.

In greater detail, these compounds are formed when small non-metal atoms—typically hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, boron, or oxygen—are inserted into the interstices (the empty spaces) of metal lattices. Interstitial compounds are predominantly associated with transition metals, which possess a unique crystal structure that accommodates these interstitial sites. The small atoms can fit into these spaces without causing significant distortion to the surrounding metal lattice.

The properties of interstitial compounds differ markedly from those of the parent metals. Generally, these compounds exhibit high hardness, elevated melting points, and reduced malleability and ductility compared to the parent metals. The presence of small atoms in the interstitial sites induces distortions in the metal lattice, thereby enhancing the strength of the material and increasing its resistance to deformation.

Moreover, interstitial compounds tend to be chemically inert. This inertness arises because the small non-metal atoms in the interstitial sites form strong covalent bonds with the metal atoms. These bonds are challenging to break, which contributes to the compounds' resistance to chemical reactions.

Regarding electrical conductivity, interstitial compounds are typically poorer conductors than their parent metals. This reduced conductivity is attributed to the small atoms in the interstitial sites disrupting the orderly arrangement of the metal atoms, which impedes the flow of electrons.

In summary, interstitial compounds are unique materials formed when small atoms occupy the interstitial sites within transition metals. They display distinct properties compared to the parent metals, including increased hardness, high melting points, reduced malleability and ductility, chemical inertness, and lower electrical conductivity.
