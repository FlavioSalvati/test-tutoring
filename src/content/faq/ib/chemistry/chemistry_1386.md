One mole of any ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP) occupies a volume of $22.4$ liters.

This volume, known as the molar volume, is a constant $22.4 \, \text{L}$ at STP. STP is defined as a temperature of $0^\circ \text{C}$ (equivalent to $273.15 \, \text{K}$) and a pressure of $1 \, \text{atm}$. This concept is a fundamental aspect of the ideal gas law, which states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas present, provided that the temperature and pressure remain constant.

The ideal gas law is typically expressed in the equation:

$$ PV = nRT $$

where:
- $P$ is the pressure,
- $V$ is the volume,
- $n$ is the number of moles,
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and
- $T$ is the temperature.

At STP, both the temperature and pressure are fixed values, allowing us to calculate the volume $V$ for any given number of moles $n$. For one mole of gas, the volume $V$ is $22.4 \, \text{L}$.

This principle applies universally to all gases, assuming they behave as ideal gases. However, real gases can deviate from this ideal behavior under certain conditions, such as at high pressures or low temperatures, due to intermolecular forces and the finite size of gas particles. Nonetheless, under many conditions—particularly at STP—most gases behave sufficiently like ideal gases that the molar volume of $22.4 \, \text{L}$ serves as a reliable approximation.

Understanding the concept of molar volume is essential in various areas of chemistry, including stoichiometry, gas laws, and thermodynamics. It enables chemists to convert between the volume of a gas and the number of moles, which is often necessary for calculating reaction yields or designing chemical processes.
