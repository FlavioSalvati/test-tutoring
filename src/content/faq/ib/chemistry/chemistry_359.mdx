The slope of a non-linear curve is determined by calculating the derivative of the function that describes the curve.

In mathematics, the slope of a curve at a specific point is represented by the derivative of the function defining that curve. The derivative is a fundamental concept in calculus that measures how a function changes in response to changes in its input. In essence, it indicates the rate of change of the function at a particular point, which corresponds to the slope of the curve at that point.

For non-linear curves, the slope is not constant; it varies depending on the specific location along the curve. This contrasts with linear curves, where the slope remains the same at every point. To determine the slope of a non-linear curve at a given point, one must first have a mathematical function that accurately describes the curve. This function could be a polynomial, an exponential function, a logarithmic function, or any other type of non-linear function.

Once you have the function, you can compute its derivative. Various rules and techniques of differentiation, which are fundamental topics in calculus, can be employed to find the derivative of a function. The derivative evaluated at a specific point yields the slope of the curve at that location.

For instance, consider a curve described by the function $$y = x^2$$. The derivative of this function is $$\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$$. This indicates that the slope of the curve at any point $$x$$ is given by $$2x$$. Therefore, at the point where $$x = 3$$, the slope of the curve is $$2 \times 3 = 6$$.

In the context of IB Chemistry, understanding the concept of slope is valuable in various applications, such as reaction kinetics. In this field, the rate of a chemical reaction can be represented graphically as a curve, and determining the slope of that curve allows for the calculation of the rate of change of the reaction (the reaction rate).
