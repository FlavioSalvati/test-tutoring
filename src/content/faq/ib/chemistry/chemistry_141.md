Transition metals and inner transition metals are both important categories of elements found on the periodic table, but they occupy different regions and exhibit distinct properties. 

**Transition Metals**  
Transition metals are located in groups 3 through 12 of the periodic table. Notable examples include elements such as iron, copper, and gold. These metals are characterized by their ability to form stable, colored compounds and their variable oxidation states. Additionally, transition metals often serve as catalysts in chemical reactions due to their capacity to easily lend and accept electrons.

**Inner Transition Metals**  
In contrast, inner transition metals, also referred to as f-block elements, are situated at the bottom of the periodic table and are divided into two series: the lanthanides and the actinides. The lanthanides, commonly known as rare earth metals, include elements like cerium and europium. The actinides consist of elements such as uranium and plutonium. These inner transition metals are characterized by their large atomic and ionic sizes, complex electron configurations, and the presence of f-orbitals in their ground state or common oxidation states.

**Key Differences**  
A fundamental distinction between transition metals and inner transition metals lies in their electron configurations, specifically regarding the orbitals that are being filled with electrons. For transition metals, the final electron enters a d-orbital, while for inner transition metals, the last electron occupies an f-orbital. This difference in electron configuration leads to varying chemical and physical properties. For instance, inner transition metals typically possess higher melting and boiling points compared to transition metals.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, both transition metals and inner transition metals play essential roles in chemistry and various industrial applications. However, they can be differentiated by their position on the periodic table, their electron configurations, and the resulting properties. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for mastering the complexities of the periodic table and exploring the intriguing realm of inorganic chemistry.
