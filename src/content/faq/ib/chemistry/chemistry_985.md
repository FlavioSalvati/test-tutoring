Some chemical reactions do not adhere to straightforward rate laws due to the intricacies of their reaction mechanisms.

Typically, simple rate laws apply to elementary reactions, which are characterized by occurring in a single step. However, many reactions in chemistry are not elementary; rather, they consist of multiple steps, leading to complex reaction mechanisms. A reaction mechanism is a sequence of elementary reactions that collectively contribute to the overall reaction. The rate law for a complex reaction is primarily governed by its slowest step, often referred to as the rate-determining step. Consequently, the rate law for such a reaction may not correlate directly with the stoichiometry of the overall reaction, resulting in a deviation from a simple rate law.

Moreover, certain reactions involve intermediate species that are generated in one step and consumed in a subsequent step. The presence of these intermediates can complicate the rate law since they may not be present in the overall balanced equation for the reaction, yet they significantly influence the reaction rate.

Additionally, the existence of a catalyst can lead to reactions that do not follow simple rate laws. Catalysts accelerate reactions by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. This alteration can shift the rate law, making it dependent not only on the concentrations of the reactants but also on the concentration of the catalyst.

Finally, reversible reactions, which allow products to react back into reactants, also tend not to conform to simple rate laws. The rate of a reversible reaction is influenced by the concentrations of both reactants and products, necessitating a rate law that accounts for the rates of both the forward and reverse reactions.

In summary, the complexity inherent in reaction mechanisms, the involvement of intermediate species or catalysts, and the reversible nature of certain reactions can all contribute to deviations from simple rate laws.
