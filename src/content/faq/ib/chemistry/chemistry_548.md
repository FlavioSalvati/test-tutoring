Catalysts are substances that enhance the rate of a chemical reaction without affecting its stoichiometry. They achieve this by providing an alternative reaction pathway that has a lower activation energy, which facilitates the reaction process.

The stoichiometry of a chemical reaction is defined by the balanced chemical equation, which indicates the ratio of reactants to products. This ratio adheres to the law of conservation of mass, which asserts that matter cannot be created or destroyed during a chemical reaction. Consequently, the total amounts of reactants and products must remain consistent before and after the reaction, irrespective of whether a catalyst is present.

While catalysts can significantly accelerate a reaction, they do not change the quantities of reactants and products produced. They lower the activation energy, which is the energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to proceed. By doing so, catalysts enable more molecules to possess sufficient energy to participate in the reaction, thereby increasing the reaction rate. However, the overall change in energy, known as the enthalpy change, along with the quantities of reactants and products, remains unchanged.

For instance, in the reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen to produce ammonia, the stoichiometric relationship is always maintained: one molecule of nitrogen reacts with three molecules of hydrogen to yield two molecules of ammonia. Although the presence of a catalyst, such as iron, can hasten this reaction, it does not modify the stoichiometry.

In summary, catalysts play an essential role in many chemical reactions by increasing the reaction rate but do not alter the stoichiometry. The stoichiometric relationships are dictated by the balanced chemical equation and the law of conservation of mass, remaining constant regardless of the presence of a catalyst.
