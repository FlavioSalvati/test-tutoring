Polar covalent bonds are characterized by an unequal distribution of electron density, whereas non-polar covalent bonds exhibit an equal distribution.

Covalent bonds form when two atoms share a pair of electrons. The nature of the covalent bond—whether it is polar or non-polar—depends on the electronegativity of the participating atoms. Electronegativity is defined as the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons.

In a polar covalent bond, the shared electrons are not distributed equally because one atom possesses a higher electronegativity than the other. This results in a shift of the electron pair towards the more electronegative atom, which acquires a partial negative charge. Conversely, the less electronegative atom develops a partial positive charge. The polarity of the bond is determined by the difference in electronegativity values between the two atoms: the greater the difference, the more polar the bond becomes. Common examples of polar covalent bonds include those found in water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) and hydrogen fluoride ($\text{HF}$).

In contrast, a non-polar covalent bond occurs when two atoms share electrons equally. This scenario typically arises when the atoms have identical or very similar electronegativity values. In such cases, the electron pair is equally attracted to both atoms, resulting in a balanced distribution of electron density. Consequently, there is no charge separation, and the molecule remains electrically neutral overall. Examples of non-polar covalent bonds include the bonds in molecular oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) and methane ($\text{CH}_4$).

In summary, the primary distinction between polar and non-polar covalent bonds lies in the distribution of electron density. Polar covalent bonds feature an unequal distribution due to differing electronegativities, which leads to the formation of partial charges. In contrast, non-polar covalent bonds have an equal distribution of electron density, resulting in no charge separation. Grasping these concepts is essential for predicting the properties and behaviors of various molecules.
