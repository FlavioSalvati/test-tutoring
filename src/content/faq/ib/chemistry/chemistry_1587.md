At room temperature, the physical states of the halogens vary: fluorine and chlorine exist as gases, bromine is a liquid, while iodine and astatine are solid.

The halogens comprise a group of elements in the periodic table, specifically fluorine ($\text{F}$), chlorine ($\text{Cl}$), bromine ($\text{Br}$), iodine ($\text{I}$), and astatine ($\text{At}$). These elements are characterized by their high reactivity and their tendency to gain an electron in order to achieve a stable electron configuration. The differing physical states of these elements at room temperature can be attributed to variations in their atomic structures and the strength of their intermolecular forces.

Fluorine and chlorine are both gases at room temperature. Fluorine is a pale yellow gas, whereas chlorine appears as a greenish-yellow gas. These elements exist as diatomic molecules ($\text{F}_2$ and $\text{Cl}_2$), which are held together by relatively weak Van der Waals forces. Due to these weak intermolecular forces, less energy is required to separate the molecules, allowing them to maintain a gaseous state at room temperature. For a deeper understanding of these forces, please refer to the relevant notes.

Bromine stands out among the halogens as the only one that is a liquid at room temperature. It appears as a reddish-brown liquid that emits a vapor of a similar color. The stronger intermolecular forces in bromine, compared to those in fluorine and chlorine, necessitate more energy to separate the molecules, which is why it remains in liquid form.

Iodine and astatine are solids at room temperature. Iodine is a shiny, dark grey solid that sublimates into a purple vapor upon heating. Astatine, a radioactive element, is typically produced in very small quantities for research purposes and is thought to be a black or dark-colored solid. The intermolecular forces in both iodine and astatine are stronger than those in the lighter halogens, requiring more energy to separate the molecules, which results in their solid state. For more detailed information about iodineâ€™s properties within its group, you may find the relevant section useful.

In summary, the physical states of the halogens at room temperature are influenced by the strength of their intermolecular forces. Weaker forces correspond to lower temperatures at which a substance transitions from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. Additional insights into the halogens, especially their role in organic chemistry, can be found in our notes.
