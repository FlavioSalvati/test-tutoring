Transition metals are characterized by their variable oxidation states, a property that arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in their $d$-orbitals.

Located in the $d$-block of the periodic table, transition metals encompass the elements found in groups 3 to 12. One of their distinguishing features is their ability to form compounds with multiple oxidation states. This versatility is primarily attributed to the unpaired electrons in their $d$-orbitals.

In transition metals, the $4s$ and $3d$ sub-levels have energies that are very close to each other. When these metals form ions, they can lose electrons from both the $4s$ and $3d$ sub-levels. This capacity to lose electrons from multiple sub-levels allows transition metals to exhibit a wide range of oxidation states. For instance, iron (Fe) can exist in the +2 and +3 oxidation states, depending on whether it loses two or three electrons, respectively.

The variable oxidation states of transition metals also play a significant role in their ability to form complex ions and colorful compounds. Different oxidation states can lead to distinct electron configurations, which can absorb various wavelengths of light, thereby influencing the color of the resulting compounds.

Moreover, the ability of transition metals to adopt different oxidation states makes them highly effective catalysts. Catalysts facilitate chemical reactions by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. The capacity of transition metals to change their oxidation state enables them to form temporary bonds with reactant molecules, which helps to lower the activation energy of the reaction.

In conclusion, the variable oxidation states of transition metals stem from the presence of unpaired electrons in their $d$-orbitals. This unique property allows them to form a diverse array of compounds, contributes to the coloration of these compounds, and enhances their effectiveness as catalysts.
