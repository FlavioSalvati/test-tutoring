Sigma bonds and pi bonds are two types of covalent bonds that play a fundamental role in the structure and behavior of molecules. 

A sigma bond, denoted as $\sigma$, is a single covalent bond characterized by the direct overlap of atomic orbitals between the nuclei of two atoms. This type of bond is the strongest among covalent bonds due to its end-to-end orbital overlap. Sigma bonds can be formed from various combinations of atomic orbitals, including $s-s$, $s-p$, and $p-p$ overlaps. One distinctive feature of sigma bonds is that they allow for free rotation; thus, the atoms connected by a sigma bond can rotate relative to each other without breaking the bond.

In contrast, pi bonds, represented as $\pi$, are typically found in double and triple bonds and are weaker than sigma bonds. A pi bond is formed through the lateral (side-to-side) overlap of two $p$-orbitals, resulting in two regions of electron density above and below the plane of the nuclei of the bonded atoms. Unlike sigma bonds, pi bonds restrict rotation. This limitation arises because rotating the bonded atoms would require the overlapping $p$ orbitals to separate, which would disrupt the electron cloud and break the pi bond. As a result, molecules that contain pi bonds, such as alkenes and alkynes, exhibit greater rigidity in their molecular structure.

Regarding electron distribution, the electron density in a sigma bond is symmetrically concentrated along the bond axis, leading to a cylindrical symmetry. Conversely, in a pi bond, the electron density is not concentrated along the axis but is instead distributed above and below the plane formed by the two nuclei.

It is also vital to understand the relationship between bond types and their composition: a single bond is always a sigma bond, while a double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. Similarly, a triple bond comprises one sigma bond and two pi bonds. This distinction arises because a single orbital can form only one sigma bond, but it can form up to two pi bonds. Therefore, to accommodate multiple bonds (such as double and triple bonds), the presence of pi bonds is necessary.

In summary, sigma and pi bonds differ in terms of strength, rotational flexibility, formation mechanisms, and electron density distribution. Grasping these differences is essential for understanding the properties and behaviors of various molecules.
