Alkenes participate in electrophilic addition reactions due to the high electron density present in their carbon-carbon double bonds, which effectively attracts electrophiles.

Alkenes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. This double bond consists of a sigma ($\sigma$) bond and a pi ($\pi$) bond. The $\pi$ bond is formed through the lateral overlap of p orbitals and is situated above and below the molecular plane. This configuration generates a region of high electron density, rendering the double bond a site of negative charge. Consequently, this negative charge attracts electrophiles, which are species that lack electrons.

Electrophilic addition is a prevalent reaction mechanism for alkenes. During this process, an electrophile is drawn to the electron-rich double bond of the alkene. The electrophile accepts a pair of electrons from the double bond, resulting in the formation of a new bond with one of the carbon atoms. This interaction disrupts the $\pi$ bond, leading to the formation of a positively charged carbon atom known as a carbocation. Subsequently, this carbocation is attacked by a nucleophile, which donates a pair of electrons to establish a new bond. This sequence of events leads to the addition of two distinct groups across the double bond.

The electrophilic addition reaction is a crucial transformation in organic chemistry, as it enables the synthesis of a diverse array of products from simple alkene precursors. The specific nature of the electrophile and nucleophile, along with the reaction conditions, can be manipulated to yield different products. This versatility underscores the significance of electrophilic addition in the construction of complex organic molecules.

In summary, the pronounced electron density of the carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes makes them highly attractive to electrophiles. This interaction facilitates electrophilic addition reactions, wherein an electrophile and a nucleophile are added across the double bond. Such reactions form a foundational aspect of organic chemistry, enabling the generation of a wide variety of products from simple alkene starting materials.
