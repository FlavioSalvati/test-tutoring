Transition metals are characterized by their electron configurations, which involve the filling of d-orbitals. This distinguishes them from main group elements, which primarily fill s and p orbitals.

Transition metals occupy the d-block of the periodic table, meaning their electron configurations culminate in d-orbitals. In contrast, main group elements—often referred to as representative elements—are located in the s and p blocks. Their electron configurations conclude in either s or p orbitals.

An atom's electron configuration outlines the arrangement of its electrons across various atomic orbitals. For main group elements, the filling sequence adheres to a systematic pattern: starting with the $1s$ orbital, followed by $2s$, $2p$, $3s$, $3p$, $4s$, and so forth. This sequence is governed by the Aufbau principle, which posits that electrons fill the lowest energy levels first.

Transition metals, however, deviate from this strict filling pattern. Once the $4s$ orbital is filled, electrons commence filling the $3d$ orbital. This occurs because the $3d$ and $4s$ orbitals possess similar energy levels, with the $3d$ orbital sometimes being lower in energy depending on the specific transition metal. Consequently, transition metals exhibit a distinctive electron configuration where the outermost electrons are distributed across both the $4s$ and $3d$ orbitals.

Another significant distinction is that transition metals frequently have partially filled d-orbitals. This contrasts with main group elements, whose s and p orbitals are either fully occupied or entirely vacant in their ground state. The presence of partially filled d-orbitals in transition metals imparts unique characteristics, including their ability to form complex ions, exhibit variable oxidation states, and display magnetic properties.

In summary, the electron configurations of transition metals differ from those of main group elements in that they involve the filling of d-orbitals, often feature partially filled d-orbitals, and do not strictly adhere to the Aufbau principle. These variations in electron configuration are responsible for the distinctive chemical and physical properties observed in transition metals.
