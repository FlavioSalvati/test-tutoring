A dative covalent bond, also known as a coordinate bond, is a specific type of covalent bond in which both electrons involved in the bond are provided by a single atom.

To elaborate, in a standard covalent bond, each participating atom contributes one electron to the bond. In contrast, a dative covalent bond features one atom that supplies both electrons. This scenario typically arises when one atom possesses a lone pair of electrons, while the other atom lacks sufficient electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration.

The atom that donates the electron pair is termed the donor atom, whereas the atom that accepts the electrons is referred to as the acceptor atom. In molecular representations, a dative covalent bond is indicated by an arrow pointing from the donor atom to the acceptor atom.

A classic example of a molecule exhibiting a dative covalent bond is ammonia, represented as $NH_3$. In this molecule, the nitrogen atom possesses a lone pair of electrons that it can donate. When a hydrogen ion, denoted as $H^+$, approaches the ammonia molecule, the nitrogen atom can transfer its lone pair to form a bond with the hydrogen ion, resulting in the formation of the ammonium ion, $NH_4^+$.

Grasping the concept of dative covalent bonding is essential in chemistry, as it provides insights into the structure and behavior of various molecules and ions. This concept is particularly significant in the study of transition metal complexes and organic compounds.
