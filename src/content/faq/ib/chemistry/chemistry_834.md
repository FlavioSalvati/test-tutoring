Iron plays a critical role in hemoglobin molecules because of its ability to bind with oxygen, which facilitates the transport of oxygen throughout the body.

Hemoglobin is a protein molecule located in red blood cells and is essential for oxygen transport. Its structure is complex, comprising four protein chains, each containing a heme group. The heme group is the part of hemoglobin that contains an iron atom, which is responsible for binding with oxygen.

The use of iron in hemoglobin is attributed to its unique chemical properties. As a transition metal, iron can exist in various oxidation states. Within hemoglobin, iron is present in the $Fe^{2+}$ oxidation state. This allows it to form a coordinate bond with oxygen, effectively 'grabbing' the oxygen molecule and holding it in place. This binding process is reversible, meaning that when red blood cells reach tissues in need of oxygen, the iron can release the oxygen molecule, making it available for the body's cells.

Moreover, the iron atom in the heme group is coordinated to a nitrogen atom in a histidine residue of the protein chain. This histidine residue is vital for facilitating the binding and release of oxygen. When oxygen attaches to the iron atom, it induces a slight conformational change in the hemoglobin molecule. This change is then transmitted to the histidine residue, which triggers the release of oxygen.

In summary, the incorporation of iron in hemoglobin is essential for oxygen transport in the body. Its capacity to form a coordinate bond with oxygen, along with its interaction with the histidine residue, enables hemoglobin to efficiently pick up oxygen in the lungs and deliver it to cells throughout the body where it is needed. Without iron, this crucial physiological process would not be possible.
