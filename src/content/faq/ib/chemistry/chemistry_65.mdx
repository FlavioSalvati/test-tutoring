Spectra can sometimes display negative peaks, a phenomenon that occurs due to phase inversion in Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

FTIR spectroscopy is a technique employed to obtain an infrared spectrum that reflects the absorption, emission, or photoconductivity of solids, liquids, or gases. In this context, negative peaks may arise as a result of a process known as phase inversion. This phase inversion is a mathematical occurrence that takes place during the Fourier transformation of the raw data.

The Fourier transformation is a mathematical method that converts a time-domain signal—representing a physical quantity as a function of time—into a frequency-domain signal, which similarly represents that physical quantity but as a function of frequency. In FTIR spectroscopy, this transformation is essential for converting raw time-domain data into a frequency-domain spectrum.

During the process of Fourier transformation, the raw data is multiplied by a phase factor, which is a complex number. This multiplication can lead to the inversion of the signal's phase, effectively flipping the signal over the horizontal axis. Consequently, this inversion causes positive peaks to become negative and vice versa.

It is important to emphasize that this phase inversion is not a physical phenomenon; rather, it is purely mathematical. It does not imply that the substance being analyzed is absorbing negative amounts of light. Instead, it results from the mathematical procedures used to transition from raw data to a spectrum.

In practice, phase inversion can be rectified by applying a phase correction to the raw data prior to performing the Fourier transformation. This phase correction is a mathematical operation that adjusts the phase of the signal to prevent inversion during the transformation. Once the phase correction is applied, the resulting spectrum will consist solely of positive peaks.

In summary, negative peaks in a spectrum should not be a cause for concern; they are merely a byproduct of the mathematical processes inherent in FTIR spectroscopy and can be readily corrected.
