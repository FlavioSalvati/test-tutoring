Expanded octets are observed in certain elements due to the availability of d-orbitals for bonding within their valence shells.

To elaborate, the octet rule posits that atoms generally combine in such a manner that each possesses eight electrons in their valence shell, thereby achieving an electronic configuration similar to that of a noble gas. This principle is founded on the tendency of main group elements to bond in ways that allow each atom to attain eight valence electrons. However, it is important to note that this rule does have exceptions.

One notable exception is the phenomenon of expanded octets, which occurs when an atom contains more than eight electrons in its valence shell. This situation is feasible for elements located in the third period and beyond because they possess d-orbitals in their valence shells that can participate in bonding. These d-orbitals can hold up to ten electrons, enabling these elements to form more than four covalent bonds and, consequently, to have more than eight electrons in their valence shells.

For instance, phosphorus ($\text{P}$), sulfur ($\text{S}$), and chlorine ($\text{Cl}$) are elements that frequently exhibit expanded octets. Phosphorus can form five bonds, as seen in the molecule $\text{PCl}_5$, while sulfur can form six bonds, as in the molecule $\text{SF}_6$. In these examples, the central atom (either $\text{P}$ or $\text{S}$) accommodates ten and twelve electrons in its valence shell, respectively, thus exceeding the typical octet.

The capacity to form expanded octets offers these elements enhanced opportunities for bonding and diverse molecular structures. This characteristic also enables them to create compounds with higher coordination numbers, which indicate the number of atoms or ions immediately surrounding a central atom in a complex or coordination compound.

In conclusion, expanded octets arise in specific elements because they have accessible d-orbitals in their valence shells that facilitate bonding. This allows them to accommodate more than eight electrons and form more than four bonds, marking a significant exception to the octet rule and playing a crucial role in the bonding and molecular structures of these elements.
