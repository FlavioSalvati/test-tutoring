An exothermic reaction is characterized by the release of heat into its surroundings, while an endothermic reaction is defined by its absorption of heat from the environment.

To elaborate, an exothermic reaction is a type of chemical reaction that releases energy, typically in the form of light or heat. This is the kind of reaction most people envision when they hear the term "reaction." Common examples include lighting a fire or the detonation of explosives. In these reactions, the energy released is usually transferred to the surroundings as heat, resulting in an increase in temperature. This occurs because the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is less than the energy released when new bonds are formed in the products.

Conversely, an endothermic reaction is a chemical process that absorbs energy from its surroundings. This energy can manifest as heat or light. A well-known example of an endothermic reaction is photosynthesis, where plants capture light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. In these reactions, the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants exceeds the energy released when new bonds are formed in the products, which is why the surroundings cool down during an endothermic reaction.

When visualizing these processes with energy diagrams, exothermic reactions display a lower energy level for the products compared to the reactants, indicating that energy has been released. In contrast, endothermic reactions show a higher energy level for the products than for the reactants, signifying that energy has been absorbed.

It's also important to note that the classification of a reaction as exothermic or endothermic can influence its spontaneity. Exothermic reactions are often spontaneous because they result in a release of energy, making them more likely to occur without any additional energy input. In contrast, endothermic reactions typically require an external source of energy to proceed, which means they may not occur spontaneously.
