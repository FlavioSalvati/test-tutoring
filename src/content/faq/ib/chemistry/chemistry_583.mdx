The melting point of alkali metals exhibits a decreasing trend as you move down the group in the periodic table.

Alkali metals are located in Group 1 of the periodic table and include the elements lithium ($\text{Li}$), sodium ($\text{Na}$), potassium ($\text{K}$), rubidium ($\text{Rb}$), caesium ($\text{Cs}$), and francium ($\text{Fr}$). A notable characteristic of this group is the progressive decrease in melting point from lithium to francium.

This trend can be attributed to the nature of metallic bonding present in alkali metals. Metallic bonding involves the delocalization of electrons among a lattice of positively charged ions. The strength of these metallic bonds is influenced by the ionic charge and the size of the ions. In the case of alkali metals, the ionic charge remains constant at +1, while the size of the ions increases as you descend the group due to the addition of electron shells with each successive element.

As the size of the ion increases, the outermost electrons are situated further away from the positively charged nucleus, resulting in a weaker attraction between them. Consequently, the strength of the metallic bond diminishes as the distance between the nucleus and the outermost electrons increases. This weakening of the bonds means that less energy is needed to overcome these interactions to melt the metal, leading to a reduction in melting point.

For instance, the melting point of lithium is $180.5$ degrees Celsius, while that of sodium is $97.8$ degrees Celsius. This downward trend continues with potassium at $63.5$ degrees Celsius, rubidium at $39.3$ degrees Celsius, and caesium at $28.5$ degrees Celsius. Francium, being the heaviest alkali metal, is radioactive and has a very short half-life, making its melting point challenging to determine; however, it is anticipated to follow the same decreasing trend.

In summary, the melting point of alkali metals decreases down the group due to the increasing ionic size, which weakens the metallic bonds and reduces the energy required to break these bonds and melt the metal.
