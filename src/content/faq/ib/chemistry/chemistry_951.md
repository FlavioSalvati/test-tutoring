During vaporization, the entropy of a substance increases as it transitions from a more ordered state to a less ordered state.

To elaborate, entropy is a quantitative measure of the disorder or randomness within a system. In the context of vaporization, this specifically pertains to the change of a substance from a liquid state to a gaseous state. In the liquid phase, the particles of the substance are relatively close together and exhibit a certain level of order. However, upon vaporization, these particles disperse and move more freely, leading to a state characterized by greater disorder and randomness. This transition results in an increase in entropy.

The increase in entropy during vaporization is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, which asserts that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. In essence, the natural inclination of any isolated system is to maximize its entropy. Thus, when a substance vaporizes, it aligns with this inherent tendency toward greater entropy.

The change in entropy during vaporization can be quantified using the formula:

$$
\Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
$$

where $\Delta S$ represents the change in entropy, $Q_{\text{rev}}$ denotes the heat absorbed or released during a reversible process, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For the vaporization process, $Q_{\text{rev}}$ corresponds to the heat of vaporization of the substance, while $T$ is the boiling point measured in Kelvin. This equation illustrates that the change in entropy is directly proportional to the heat of vaporization and inversely proportional to the boiling point.

In summary, the entropy of a substance increases during vaporization due to its transition from a more ordered liquid state to a less ordered gaseous state. This increase in entropy is a natural process that adheres to the second law of thermodynamics, and it can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
$$
