In mass spectrometry, the identification of halogens is achieved by analyzing the distinctive isotope patterns present in the spectrum.

Mass spectrometry is an advanced analytical technique that provides detailed insights into the molecular structure of compounds, including the detection of specific elements such as halogens. Halogens comprise a group of highly reactive elements: fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. These elements are well-known for their ability to readily form salts when combined with metals.

During the mass spectrometry process, a sample is ionized to generate charged particles. These ions are then separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The resulting mass spectrum exhibits a series of peaks, each corresponding to a different ion. The position and intensity of these peaks yield critical information regarding the composition and structure of the analyzed sample.

Halogens exhibit distinctive isotope patterns that can be identified in a mass spectrum. For instance, chlorine possesses two stable isotopes: $^{35}\text{Cl}$ and $^{37}\text{Cl}$. These isotopes occur in a natural abundance ratio of approximately $3:1$, which leads to a characteristic doublet peak in the mass spectrum. In this doublet, the second peak appears at a mass-to-charge ratio $2$ units higher than the first and has an intensity of about one-third that of the first peak. Similarly, bromine features two stable isotopes, $^{79}\text{Br}$ and $^{81}\text{Br}$, which are present in roughly equal abundance. This results in a doublet peak with peaks of equal intensity.
