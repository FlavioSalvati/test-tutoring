The slope of a non-linear curve is determined by calculating the derivative of the function that defines the curve.

In mathematics, the slope of a curve at a specific point is represented by the derivative of its corresponding function. The derivative is a fundamental concept in calculus that measures how a function changes in response to changes in its input. In simpler terms, it quantifies the rate of change of the function at a particular point, which corresponds to the slope of the curve at that point.

For a non-linear curve, the slope is not constant; it varies depending on the specific point on the curve. This contrasts with a linear curve, where the slope remains unchanged at all points. To determine the slope of a non-linear curve at a given point, one first needs a mathematical function that describes the curve. This function could take various forms, such as a polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, or any other type of non-linear function.

Once the function is identified, the next step is to compute its derivative. The derivative of a function can be derived using various rules and techniques from differentiation, which are essential topics in calculus. The value of the derivative at a particular point provides the slope of the curve at that location.

For instance, consider the curve defined by the function $ y = x^2 $. The derivative of this function is $ 2x $. This indicates that the slope of the curve at any point $ x $ is given by $ 2x $. Therefore, at the point $ x = 3 $, the slope of the curve is calculated as $ 2 \times 3 = 6 $.

In the context of IB Chemistry, grasping the concept of the slope of a curve can be valuable in several areas, such as reaction kinetics. Here, the rate of a chemical reaction is often represented by a curve, and the rate of change of the reaction (known as the reaction rate) can be determined by calculating the slope of that curve.
