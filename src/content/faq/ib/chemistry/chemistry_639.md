Bond enthalpies serve as a valuable tool for estimating the enthalpy change of a chemical reaction by quantifying the energy absorbed or released during the processes of bond breaking and formation.

To elaborate, every chemical reaction entails the breaking of bonds in the reactants and the formation of new bonds in the products. Each of these processes either consumes or liberates energy. The energy necessary to break a bond is referred to as bond dissociation energy or bond enthalpy, which is always a positive value since energy is absorbed during this process. Conversely, energy is released when new bonds are formed, and this release is denoted by a negative value.

To estimate the enthalpy change for a reaction, one must first obtain the bond enthalpies for all the bonds involved in the reactants and the products. The total energy absorbed from breaking the bonds in the reactants is calculated, followed by the total energy released from forming the bonds in the products. The overall enthalpy change for the reaction is determined by the difference between these two energy values.

This approach to estimating enthalpy change is commonly known as the 'mean bond enthalpy' method. It is essential to recognize that bond enthalpies are average values derived from various molecules. Consequently, the calculated enthalpy change should be viewed as an estimate rather than an exact figure.

The formula used to compute the enthalpy change, denoted as $\Delta H$, is given by:

$$
\Delta H = \Sigma (\text{bond enthalpies of bonds broken}) - \Sigma (\text{bond enthalpies of bonds formed}).
$$

If the value of $\Delta H$ is negative, the reaction is classified as exothermic, indicating that it releases heat. Conversely, if $\Delta H$ is positive, the reaction is termed endothermic, signifying that it absorbs heat.

In summary, bond enthalpies are instrumental in estimating the enthalpy change of a reaction. By analyzing the energy changes associated with bond breaking and formation, we can effectively predict whether a reaction will absorb or release energy overall.
