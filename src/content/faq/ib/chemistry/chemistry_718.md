Ozonolysis is a chemical reaction in which ozone ($\text{O}_3$) breaks down unsaturated bonds found in organic compounds, particularly alkenes and alkynes.

This reaction is significant in organic chemistry for the degradation of unsaturated compounds. The term "ozonolysis" is derived from the Greek words "ozo," meaning "to smell," and "lysis," meaning "loosening." This nomenclature reflects the distinctive odor of ozone and its ability to break or "loosen" double or triple bonds in organic molecules.

The ozonolysis process consists of two primary steps. In the first step, ozone adds to the unsaturated bond, resulting in the formation of an ozonide intermediate. The second step involves the cleavage of the ozonide by a reducing agent, such as zinc in acetic acid, or by a non-reducing agent like water. This cleavage produces carbonyl compounds. The specific type of carbonyl compound generated—whether aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, or even carbon dioxide—depends on the original structure of the alkene or alkyne and the conditions used during the work-up.

Ozonolysis serves as a valuable tool in organic chemistry, particularly for identifying unknown compounds. By breaking complex molecules into simpler carbonyl compounds, chemists can infer the original structure of the molecule. This method is especially useful for the structural elucidation of natural products and the synthesis of small, intricate molecules.

Safety considerations are paramount when conducting ozonolysis, as both ozone and the ozonides produced during the reaction can be hazardous and potentially explosive. Consequently, these reactions should be performed under controlled conditions, and proper care must be taken when handling ozonides. Despite these risks, ozonolysis remains a widely employed method in organic chemistry due to its effectiveness and utility.
