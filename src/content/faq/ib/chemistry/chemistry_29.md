Raman spectroscopy and infrared (IR) spectroscopy are both analytical techniques employed to investigate vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes within a system. While both methods rely on the interaction of light with matter, they fundamentally differ in the type of light-matter interaction they measure.

Infrared spectroscopy is predicated on the absorption of light. When infrared light encounters a molecule, it can be absorbed if the frequency of the light aligns with the vibrational frequencies of the molecule. This absorption results in a transition from a lower energy state to a higher energy state, with the energy difference corresponding to the energy of the absorbed light. The outcome is an absorption spectrum, which can be analyzed to identify the types of bonds present in the molecule, thereby revealing details about the molecule's structure.

In contrast, Raman spectroscopy focuses on the scattering of light. When light interacts with a molecule, the majority of it is scattered at the same frequency as the incident lightâ€”a phenomenon referred to as Rayleigh scattering. However, a small portion of the light is scattered at different frequencies due to interactions with the vibrational and rotational modes of the molecule. This phenomenon is known as Raman scattering. By analyzing the frequencies of the scattered light, we can generate a Raman spectrum that provides insights into the vibrational modes of the molecule.

Another significant distinction is that infrared spectroscopy is particularly effective for studying molecules that possess a permanent dipole moment. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy can be applied to a broader range of molecules, as it does not depend on the presence of a dipole moment. This characteristic renders Raman spectroscopy a more versatile technique, capable of analyzing a wider variety of molecular structures.

In summary, while both techniques yield valuable information about the structure and composition of molecules, they operate through different mechanisms: infrared spectroscopy utilizes the absorption of light, whereas Raman spectroscopy relies on the scattering of light.
