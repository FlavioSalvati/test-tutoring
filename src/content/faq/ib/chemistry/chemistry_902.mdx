Crystal field theory (CFT) provides an explanation for the color observed in transition metal complexes through the absorption of light, which triggers electronic transitions.

CFT is a theoretical model that describes how the degeneracy of electron orbital states, particularly the $d$ or $f$ orbitals, is disrupted by a static electric field generated by a surrounding charge distribution. This charge distribution is created by ligandsâ€”ions or molecules that coordinate to the central metal ion in the complex. The ligands generate an electric field that alters the energy levels of the $d$ orbitals of the transition metal ion.

In an isolated transition metal atom, the five $d$ orbitals are degenerate, meaning they all possess the same energy. However, when ligands approach the metal ion, they induce a splitting of these five $d$ orbitals into two distinct energy levels. This splitting phenomenon is responsible for the color observed in transition metal complexes.

When white light, which encompasses the entire color spectrum, strikes a transition metal complex, specific wavelengths of light are absorbed. The absorbed wavelengths correspond to the energy difference between the two sets of split $d$ orbitals. The light that is not absorbed reaches our eyes, imparting a particular color to the complex. For example, if a complex absorbs light in the red region of the spectrum, it will appear green, which is the complementary color to red.

The degree of splitting, and consequently the color perceived, is influenced by several factors, including the nature of the metal ion, the types of ligands that are coordinated to it, and the geometry of the complex. For instance, strong-field ligands, such as cyanide ($\text{CN}^-$), induce significant splitting of the $d$ orbitals, resulting in complexes that often appear blue or green. Conversely, complexes with weak-field ligands like iodide ($\text{I}^-$) typically exhibit colors in the red or orange range due to their smaller splitting effect.

In conclusion, the color of transition metal complexes arises directly from the splitting of $d$ orbitals induced by surrounding ligands, as elucidated by crystal field theory. This orbital splitting leads to the absorption of specific wavelengths of light, while the unabsorbed light determines the observed color of the complex.
