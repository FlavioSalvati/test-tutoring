Zinc is often regarded as atypical among transition metals because it does not form ions with incomplete d-orbitals.

Positioned in the d-block of the periodic table, zinc is associated with transition metals. However, its classification as a non-typical transition metal stems from its unique electron configuration and the characteristics of its ions. Transition metals are defined primarily by their ability to form ions that possess incomplete d-orbitals, enabling them to display variable oxidation states, create colored compounds, and serve as catalysts in various chemical reactions.

In contrast, zinc does not demonstrate these properties. Its electron configuration is given by $$[Ar] 3d^{10} 4s^{2}$$. When zinc forms ions, it loses the two electrons from the 4s subshell, resulting in the formation of the ion $$\text{Zn}^{2+}$$ with an electron configuration of $$[Ar] 3d^{10}$$. This configuration indicates that zinc ions have a completely filled 3d-orbital, which precludes the presence of an incomplete d-orbital. Consequently, zinc exhibits only one oxidation state, +2, unlike other transition metals that can exist in multiple oxidation states.

Moreover, zinc compounds do not exhibit color. This lack of coloration is due to the fully occupied d-orbitals, which prevents d-d electronic transitions that would otherwise absorb visible light and produce colored compounds. This characteristic stands in stark contrast to other transition metals, which often form colored compounds as a result of such d-d transitions.

Additionally, zinc's role as a catalyst is different from that of typical transition metals. While it can participate in certain catalytic reactions, it does not act as a catalytic surface in the conventional sense. Instead, zinc frequently functions as a structural component in enzymes, facilitating reactions through its involvement in biological processes.

In summary, although zinc is situated in the d-block of the periodic table, it does not exhibit the defining features of transition metals, such as forming ions with incomplete d-orbitals, displaying variable oxidation states, producing colored compounds, or acting as catalysts in chemical reactions. Therefore, it is classified as a non-typical transition metal.
