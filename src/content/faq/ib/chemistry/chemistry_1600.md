Fluorine does not exhibit a positive oxidation state due to its position as the element with the highest electronegativity in the periodic table.

With an atomic number of $9$, fluorine is recognized as the most electronegative element, a property that quantifies its ability to attract electrons. The concept of electronegativity indicates that the higher the value, the greater the atom's affinity for bonding electrons. Fluorine has an electronegativity value of $4.0$ on the Pauling scale, marking it as the element with the strongest electron-attracting capability. Consequently, fluorine tends to gain electrons to form negative ions rather than lose them to create positive ions.

The electronic configuration of fluorine is given by $1s^2 2s^2 2p^5$, indicating that it possesses seven electrons in its outermost shell. To achieve a stable electron configuration, following the octet rule, fluorine requires just one additional electron to complete its outer shell of eight electrons. This characteristic renders fluorine highly reactive, as it readily accepts an electron to attain stability. Upon gaining an electron, fluorine forms a negative ion, represented as $F^-$, and achieves an oxidation state of $-1$.

In contrast, for fluorine to attain a positive oxidation state, it would need to lose electrons. However, this process is energetically unfavorable. The energy necessary to remove an electron from fluorine is significantly high due to its elevated electronegativity and the stability provided by a complete outer shell achieved through electron gain. Therefore, fluorine does not form positive oxidation states.

Additionally, the concept of oxidation states serves as a framework for tracking electron distribution in chemical reactions. In this context, fluorine consistently holds an oxidation state of $-1$ in its compounds. This is due to its inherent tendency to attract electrons more strongly than any other element, resulting in the acquisition of electrons and the formation of a negative oxidation state, rather than the loss of electrons to yield a positive oxidation state.
