Atomic and ionic radii vary based on the electron configurations of atoms, primarily due to changes in electron shielding and the effective nuclear charge.

The atomic radius refers to the size of an atom, which is influenced by its electron configuration. An atom with more electron shells will have a larger atomic radius. This is because the electrons in the outermost shells are situated farther from the nucleus and are shielded by the inner shell electrons from the positive charge of the protons in the nucleus. This shielding effect diminishes the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electrons, allowing them to be held less tightly and occupy a larger volume, thereby increasing the atomic radius.

In contrast, the ionic radius pertains to the size of an ion—an atom or a group of atoms that has gained or lost electrons. When an atom loses an electron to form a positive ion, or cation, its electron configuration changes to reflect fewer electron shells. This reduction in electron shielding, combined with an increase in the effective nuclear charge felt by the remaining electrons, results in these electrons being held more tightly by the nucleus. Consequently, the ionic radius decreases. Conversely, when an atom gains an electron to create a negative ion, or anion, its electron configuration adjusts to include an additional electron shell. This addition increases electron shielding and decreases the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electrons, which allows them to be held less tightly and occupy a larger volume, thus increasing the ionic radius.

In summary, the electron configuration of an atom or ion is a key determinant of its atomic or ionic radius. The number of electron shells—altered by the gain or loss of electrons—affects both the degree of electron shielding and the effective nuclear charge, ultimately influencing the size of the atom or ion. Grasping these concepts is essential for predicting the properties of atoms and ions, as well as for understanding trends within the periodic table.
