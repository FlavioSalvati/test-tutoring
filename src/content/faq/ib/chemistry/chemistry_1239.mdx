The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of molecular energies in a gas or liquid at a specific temperature, illustrating the proportion of molecules with energies equal to or greater than the activation energy.

This distribution is a statistical representation of the kinetic energies of particles within a system. On a graph of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the y-axis represents the number of particles, while the x-axis represents their respective energies. The curve depicts the likelihood of finding particles with a given energy level.

Activation energy, denoted as $E_a$, is the minimum energy required for a chemical reaction to proceed. It represents the energy barrier that reactant molecules must overcome to transform into products.

The connection between the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and activation energy becomes evident when examining the area under the curve to the right of the activation energy threshold. This area quantifies the fraction of molecules that possess energy levels equal to or exceeding $E_a$. These molecules are the ones capable of participating in the reaction.

As the temperature increases, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve flattens and broadens. This broadening indicates that a larger proportion of molecules achieve higher kinetic energies. As a result, more molecules surpass the activation energy threshold, leading to an increased reaction rate.

In summary, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution visually represents how temperature influences the number of molecules that can successfully overcome the activation energy barrier. It elucidates why raising the temperature accelerates chemical reactions: it effectively increases the number of molecules with sufficient energy to react.

In conclusion, the relationship between the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and activation energy is fundamentally interconnected. The distribution curve serves as a statistical depiction of particle energies within a system, while the activation energy defines the minimum energy required for reactions to occur. The area under the curve to the right of the activation energy corresponds to the fraction of molecules capable of reacting, and this fraction rises with increasing temperature.
