Exceptions in electron configurations arise from the enhanced stability associated with half-filled or fully-filled sublevels.

Typically, the electron configurations of atoms are predicted using the Aufbau principle, which states that electrons occupy atomic orbitals starting from the lowest available energy levels and progressively fill higher ones. However, certain elements deviate from this principle, resulting in exceptions in their electron configurations. This deviation is primarily due to the increased stability associated with having half-filled or fully-filled sublevels.

For example, consider chromium, which has an atomic number of $24$. According to the Aufbau principle, its electron configuration would be expected to be $[Ar] \, 4s^2 \, 3d^4$. However, the actual configuration is $[Ar] \, 4s^1 \, 3d^5$. By promoting one electron from the $4s$ orbital to the $3d$ orbital, chromium achieves a half-filled $3d$ sublevel, which contributes to its greater stability.

Similarly, copper, with an atomic number of $29$, is expected to have the electron configuration $[Ar] \, 4s^2 \, 3d^9$. In reality, its configuration is $[Ar] \, 4s^1 \, 3d^{10}$. By transferring one electron from the $4s$ orbital to the $3d$ orbital, copper attains a fully-filled $3d$ sublevel, enhancing its stability.

The increased stability of half-filled and fully-filled sublevels can be explained through the concept of exchange energy, which is a principle in quantum mechanics. Exchange energy refers to the energy associated with the exchange of identical particles. In the context of electrons in an atom, the exchange energy is minimized—and thus stability is maximized—when electrons occupy different orbitals with parallel spins. Consequently, half-filled sublevels (where each orbital contains one electron) and fully-filled sublevels (where each orbital contains two electrons with opposite spins) exhibit lower exchange energy, leading to increased stability.

In summary, certain elements exhibit unusual electron configurations because half-filled or fully-filled sublevels provide additional stability. Although the Aufbau principle suggests a specific order for filling electrons, elements like chromium and copper modify their configurations to attain this enhanced stability. This unique arrangement is primarily a result of exchange energy, rendering these configurations more energetically favorable.
