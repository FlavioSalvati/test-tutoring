Carbon tetrachloride (CCl$_4$) is classified as a non-polar molecule, despite the presence of polar bonds within its structure. This non-polarity arises because the polar bonds are symmetrically arranged, effectively canceling out the individual bond dipoles.

The structure of carbon tetrachloride consists of a single carbon atom bonded to four chlorine atoms. The carbon-chlorine bonds are polar due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon and chlorine. Chlorine, being more electronegative, attracts the shared electrons in each bond more effectively than carbon does. This attraction leads to a partial negative charge on the chlorine atoms and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom, thereby creating dipoles across each bond.

Nevertheless, the overall polarity of a molecule is influenced not only by the polarity of its individual bonds but also by its geometric shape. In the case of carbon tetrachloride, the molecule adopts a tetrahedral geometry. This tetrahedral arrangement means that the four carbon-chlorine bonds are symmetrically distributed around the carbon atom, with bond angles measuring approximately $109.5^\circ$. This symmetry is essential, as it allows the dipoles from the individual bonds to cancel each other out.

To visualize this, consider each bond as an arrow directed from the carbon atom toward the corresponding chlorine atom, indicating the direction of the dipole. In a tetrahedral molecule such as carbon tetrachloride, these arrows are oriented in opposite directions and possess equal length, which results in their effective cancellation. Consequently, the molecule exhibits a net dipole moment of zero, confirming its non-polar nature.

In summary, while the carbon-chlorine bonds in carbon tetrachloride are indeed polar, the molecule itself is non-polar due to its symmetrical tetrahedral shape. This case exemplifies how molecular geometry can significantly affect overall polarity, even in the presence of polar bonds. For a more thorough understanding of how molecular shapes, such as tetrahedral configurations, influence polarity, further reading on the topic is recommended. Additionally, exploring the interactions that occur during bond formation can provide deeper insights into why certain molecular arrangements lead to non-polar characteristics.
