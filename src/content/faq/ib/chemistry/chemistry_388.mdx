The electron configuration of an atom describes the distribution of its electrons across various atomic orbitals. This arrangement is governed by three fundamental principles: the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule. These principles guide the systematic 'building up' of atoms by progressively adding electrons to the most energetically favorable orbitals.

The **Aufbau principle** asserts that electrons fill the lowest energy levels first. Consequently, the $1s$ orbital, being closest to the nucleus and possessing the lowest energy, is filled before the $2s$ orbital, and this pattern continues with higher orbitals. The term "Aufbau" is derived from German, meaning "building up," which aptly describes the process of electron addition.

The **Pauli exclusion principle** states that each atomic orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons, and these electrons must possess opposite spins. This restriction arises from the quantum mechanical properties of electrons, which are classified as fermions and thus follow the exclusion principle. As a result, no two electrons in an atom can share the same set of quantum numbers.

**Hund's rule** dictates that electrons will first occupy all available degenerate orbitals—those with the same energy—singly before they begin to pair up. This behavior is due to the repulsive forces between negatively charged electrons, making it energetically more favorable for them to occupy separate orbitals whenever possible.

Typically, the electron configuration is expressed as a series of numbers and letters that denote the energy levels, orbitals, and the number of electrons in each orbital. For instance, the electron configuration of oxygen, which has an atomic number of $8$, is represented as $1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$. This notation indicates that there are two electrons in the $1s$ orbital, two in the $2s$ orbital, and four in the $2p$ orbital.

Understanding electron configuration is essential in the field of chemistry, as it elucidates the chemical behavior of atoms, including their bonding tendencies and reactivity. Furthermore, it underpins the organization of the periodic table, where elements within the same group exhibit similar electron configurations and, thus, analogous chemical properties.
