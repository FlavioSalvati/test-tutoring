In mass spectrometry, esters generate a range of fragments resulting from the cleavage of various bonds within the molecule. The most prevalent fragments include the parent ion, alkyl cations, acylium ions, and alkoxy radicals.

The **parent ion** represents the original ionized molecule and is typically the most prominent peak in the mass spectrum. This peak corresponds to the molecular mass of the ester.

Another significant fragment is the **alkyl cation**, which forms when the ester loses a molecule of carboxylic acid during ionization. The resulting cation retains the alkyl group of the ester. For instance, in the case of ethyl acetate, the alkyl cation corresponds to the ethyl group, denoted as $C_2H_5^+$.

Esters also frequently yield **acylium ions**. These ions are produced when the ester loses an alcohol molecule during ionization. The acylium ion encompasses the acyl group of the ester. For example, if the ester is ethyl acetate, the acylium ion would be represented by the acetyl group, $CH_3CO^+$.

Additionally, esters can generate **alkoxy radicals**. These radicals arise when the ester loses an acylium ion during ionization. The resulting radical includes the alkoxy group of the ester. Taking ethyl acetate as an example, the alkoxy radical corresponds to the ethoxy group, $C_2H_5O^{\cdot}$.

In summary, the common fragments produced by esters in mass spectrometry are the parent ion, alkyl cations, acylium ions, and alkoxy radicals. These fragments result from the cleavage of different bonds in the ester molecule during ionization, and their detection can aid in elucidating the structure of the original ester.
