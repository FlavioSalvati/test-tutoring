A dative covalent bond, also known as a coordinate bond, is a specific type of covalent bond in which both electrons involved in the bond are supplied by a single atom.

In a standard covalent bond, each of the two participating atoms contributes one electron. In contrast, a dative covalent bond occurs when one atom donates both electrons to the bond. This situation typically arises when one atom possesses a lone pair of electrons, while the other atom lacks sufficient electrons to achieve a stable electronic configuration.

The atom that donates the electron pair is referred to as the donor atom, while the atom that accepts the electrons is known as the acceptor atom. Dative covalent bonds are conventionally represented by an arrow that points from the donor atom to the acceptor atom.

A classic example of a molecule featuring a dative covalent bond is ammonia, denoted as $NH_3$. In this molecule, the nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons available for donation. When a hydrogen ion, represented as $H^+$, approaches the ammonia molecule, the nitrogen atom can donate its lone pair, forming a bond with the hydrogen ion and resulting in the creation of the ammonium ion, $NH_4^+$.

Grasping the concept of dative covalent bonding is essential in chemistry, as it aids in understanding the structure and behavior of numerous molecules and ions. This concept is particularly significant in the study of transition metal complexes and various organic compounds.
