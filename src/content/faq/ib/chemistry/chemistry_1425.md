Titration is a key technique in stoichiometric calculations, employed to determine the concentration of an unknown solution.

In the titration process, a solution with a known concentration, referred to as the titrant, is used to analyze an unknown solution, known as the analyte. The equivalence point marks the moment when the reaction between the two solutions is complete. The volume of titrant required to reach this equivalence point is critical for stoichiometric calculations aimed at finding the concentration of the analyte.

The titration begins with the addition of a small quantity of a strong acid or base to the analyte. This step is essential for establishing a pH that is either significantly high or low, ensuring the reaction proceeds to completion. A pH indicator is also incorporated into the analyte; this indicator changes color in response to pH variations, signaling that the reaction has reached completion.

Subsequently, the titrant is added to the analyte in small, carefully measured increments. It is crucial to monitor the volume of titrant added. When the pH indicator changes color, it signifies that the equivalence point has been reached. At this juncture, the moles of titrant can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Moles of titrant} = \text{Volume of titrant (in liters)} \times \text{Concentration of titrant (in mol/L)}
$$

The stoichiometry of the chemical reaction is then applied to determine the moles of analyte. For instance, in a 1:1 reaction, the moles of analyte are equal to the moles of titrant. In a 2:1 reaction, the moles of analyte would be half the moles of titrant.

Finally, the concentration of the analyte can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Concentration of analyte} = \frac{\text{Moles of analyte}}{\text{Volume of analyte (in liters)}}
$$

Through this systematic process, titration serves as a fundamental technique in analytical chemistry, allowing the precise determination of the concentration of unknown solutions. This method is widely utilized in both academic and industrial settings.
