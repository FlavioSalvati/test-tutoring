Inhibitors significantly influence the rate expressions in biochemistry by decreasing the reaction rate, primarily through the obstruction or modification of the enzyme's active site.

In the realm of biochemistry, inhibitors are vital for regulating the speed of biochemical reactions. They achieve this by interacting with the enzymes responsible for catalyzing these reactions. Enzymes are specialized proteins that accelerate biochemical reactions by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. Each enzyme has a specific region called the active site, where substrate molecules bind and undergo chemical transformations.

Inhibitors reduce the activity of enzymes in two principal ways: competitive inhibition and non-competitive inhibition. 

1. **Competitive Inhibition**: Competitive inhibitors are molecules that closely resemble the substrate's structure. They can occupy the active site of the enzyme, thereby preventing the substrate from binding. As a result, the reaction rate diminishes because fewer substrate molecules can interact with the enzyme. Notably, the impact of competitive inhibitors can be mitigated by increasing the substrate concentration, which enhances the likelihood of substrate binding.

2. **Non-Competitive Inhibition**: In contrast, non-competitive inhibitors bind to a different region of the enzyme. This binding induces a conformational change in the enzyme, altering the shape of the active site and inhibiting the substrate's ability to bind effectively. Consequently, the reaction rate is reduced, and unlike competitive inhibitors, this effect cannot be reversed by simply increasing the substrate concentration.

In terms of rate expressions, the introduction of an inhibitor alters the rate equation of the reaction. For a reaction facilitated by an enzyme without an inhibitor, the rate equation typically takes the form:

$$
\text{rate} = k[\text{enzyme}][\text{substrate}]
$$

where $k$ denotes the rate constant. However, when an inhibitor is present, the rate equation becomes more intricate, reflecting the diminished activity of the enzyme.

In summary, inhibitors are essential in modulating the rates of biochemical reactions. They influence these rates by interacting with the enzymes that catalyze the reactions, either by obstructing the active site or by modifying its structure, ultimately leading to a reduction in the reaction rate.
