The atomic radius refers to the size of a neutral atom, whereas the ionic radius pertains to the size of an ion.

The term **atomic radius** describes the size of an atom. It is typically measured from the center of the nucleus to the outer boundary of the surrounding electron cloud. This boundary is not a fixed point; rather, it represents a fuzzy region where the probability of finding an electron decreases rapidly. The atomic radius can vary based on the atom's state and its interactions with other atoms or ions.

In contrast, the **ionic radius** refers to the size of an ion, which can be defined as an atom or a group of atoms that has gained or lost one or more electrons, resulting in a net charge. When an atom loses an electron, it becomes a positively charged cation, and its radius generally decreases. This reduction occurs because the electron cloud contracts due to the increased attraction between the remaining electrons and the nucleus, which now has a higher positive charge. Conversely, when an atom gains an electron and becomes a negatively charged anion, its radius typically increases. The addition of the electron leads to greater electron-electron repulsion within the cloud, causing it to expand.

It is noteworthy that the atomic and ionic radii of an element can differ significantly. For instance, the atomic radius of chlorine is smaller than its ionic radius. When chlorine gains an electron to form a chloride ion, the additional electron increases electron-electron repulsion, leading to an expansion of the electron cloud. As a result, the ionic radius becomes larger than the atomic radius.

In summary, while both atomic and ionic radii refer to the sizes of atoms and ions, they are influenced by distinct factors. The atomic radius is determined by the electron cloud surrounding a neutral atom, while the ionic radius is affected by the gain or loss of electrons and the resulting change in charge.
