Enthalpy change is fundamentally linked to the energy required to break chemical bonds and the energy released when new bonds are formed during a reaction.

In any chemical reaction, the bonds within the reactants are broken, and new bonds are created in the products. The enthalpy change of a reaction, represented by $\Delta H$, is defined as the difference between the energy absorbed to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when new bonds are formed in the products.

When a bond is broken, energy is absorbed from the surroundings, which characterizes this process as endothermic. The energy needed to break a bond is referred to as bond dissociation energy or bond enthalpy, and it is always expressed as a positive value. This positive value indicates the minimum energy required to separate a molecule into its individual atoms.

Conversely, when a bond is formed, energy is released into the surroundings, making this an exothermic process. The energy released during the formation of new bonds is also called bond enthalpy, but this time, it is expressed as a negative value since energy is being given off.

To calculate the overall enthalpy change of a reaction ($\Delta H$), one subtracts the total energy released during bond formation in the products from the total energy absorbed during bond breaking in the reactants. If the energy required to break the bonds exceeds the energy released when new bonds are formed, the reaction is classified as endothermic, resulting in a positive $\Delta H$. In contrast, if the energy released during bond formation is greater than the energy required to break the bonds, the reaction is exothermic, leading to a negative $\Delta H$.

In summary, the enthalpy change in a chemical reaction serves as a measure of the energy difference associated with bond breaking and bond forming. This concept provides critical insights into the energy transformations that occur during a reaction and can help predict whether a reaction is likely to proceed spontaneously. Understanding the interplay between enthalpy change and the processes of bond breaking and forming is essential in the study of chemical reactions, particularly in the context of IB Chemistry.
