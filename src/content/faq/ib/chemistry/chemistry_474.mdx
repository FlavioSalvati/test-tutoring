Adding an inert gas to a system at constant volume does not alter the position of equilibrium in a chemical reaction.

In a chemical reaction, the equilibrium position is defined by the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions. When an inert gas is introduced into the system at constant volume, it increases the total pressure. However, this addition does not affect the partial pressures of the reactants or products, which are the crucial factors influencing the equilibrium position.

The equilibrium constant, denoted as $K$, for a reaction is expressed as the ratio of the concentrations (or partial pressures) of the products to those of the reactants, each raised to the power of their respective stoichiometric coefficients. Since the introduction of an inert gas does not change the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products, the value of $K$ remains unchanged, and consequently, there is no shift in the equilibrium position.

This phenomenon can be explained using Le Chatelier's Principle, which states that if a system at equilibrium experiences a change, the system will adjust itself to counteract that change. In this scenario, while adding an inert gas increases the total pressure, the volume remains constant, preventing the system from responding by expanding. The only potential response would be to shift the equilibrium position. However, since the inert gas does not participate in the reaction, it has no effect on the relative rates of the forward and reverse reactions, and thus, it does not induce a shift in the equilibrium.

In summary, while the addition of an inert gas at constant volume raises the total pressure of the system, it does not alter the partial pressures or concentrations of the reactants or products, and as a result, it does not impact the equilibrium position. This principle is fundamental in physical chemistry and is vital for understanding the behavior of gases and the concepts of chemical equilibrium.
