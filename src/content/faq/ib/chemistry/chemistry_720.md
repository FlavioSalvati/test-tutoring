Aldehydes undergo a reaction with Tollens' reagent, leading to the formation of a silver mirror and a carboxylic acid.

Tollens' reagent, commonly referred to as the silver mirror test, is a chemical solution utilized to detect the presence of aldehydes. This reagent consists of a solution of silver nitrate ($\text{AgNO}_3$) and ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$). When an aldehyde is introduced into this solution, it participates in an oxidation reaction, facilitated by Tollens' reagent, which serves as an oxidizing agent.

During this reaction, the aldehyde is oxidized to form a carboxylic acid, while the silver ions present in Tollens' reagent are reduced to metallic silver. The reduction of silver ions to silver metal results in the formation of the characteristic 'silver mirror' on the inner surface of the test tube, providing a clear visual indication of the presence of an aldehyde. The overall reaction can be summarized by the following equation:

$$
\text{RCHO} + 2[\text{Ag(NH}_3)_2]^+ + 3\text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{RCOO}^- + 2\text{Ag} + 4\text{NH}_3 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In this equation, $\text{RCHO}$ represents the aldehyde, while $\text{RCOO}^-$ denotes the carboxylic acid produced.

It is crucial to highlight that this reaction is specific to aldehydes; ketones, which are another category of carbonyl compounds, do not react with Tollens' reagent. This lack of reactivity is due to the fact that ketones are not easily oxidized. Consequently, the Tollens' reagent test serves as a useful method for distinguishing between aldehydes and ketones.

In practical terms, the test is simple to perform. A small quantity of the aldehyde is added to the Tollens' reagent in a test tube, which is then gently heated in a water bath. If an aldehyde is present, a silver mirror will develop on the inner walls of the test tube within a few minutes.

In summary, the reaction between aldehydes and Tollens' reagent is an important concept in organic chemistry. It not only aids in the identification of aldehydes but also visually illustrates an oxidation-reduction reaction.
