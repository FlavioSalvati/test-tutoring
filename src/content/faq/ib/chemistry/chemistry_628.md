Instantaneous dipoles in non-polar molecules arise from the random, fleeting uneven distribution of electrons surrounding the atoms.

To elaborate, all atoms and molecules—regardless of whether they are polar or non-polar—are made up of charged particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus of the atom, while the electrons orbit the nucleus in a cloud-like arrangement. In non-polar molecules, the electrons are typically shared equally between atoms. However, these electrons are in constant motion. This rapid and random movement results in moments when the distribution of electrons around the atoms may be temporarily uneven.

At any given moment, it is possible for there to be a greater concentration of electrons on one side of the atom or molecule compared to the other, thereby creating a temporary dipole, often referred to as an "instantaneous dipole." This dipole exists only for a brief period, as the electrons continue to move. Nevertheless, due to the sheer number of electrons and their swift motion, these instantaneous dipoles are perpetually being formed and dissolved.

Furthermore, these instantaneous dipoles can induce dipoles in adjacent atoms or molecules, resulting in attractive forces known as London dispersion forces or van der Waals forces. While these forces are the weakest type of intermolecular interaction, they can become significant in larger molecules or long-chain hydrocarbons, where the likelihood of forming instantaneous dipoles is increased due to a greater number of electrons.

In summary, instantaneous dipoles in non-polar molecules are the result of the random, fleeting uneven distribution of electrons around the atoms. This phenomenon is a natural consequence of the continuous and rapid movement of electrons. Although these dipoles are temporary, they occur frequently because of the high number of electrons and their quick motion. They can also induce dipoles in neighboring atoms or molecules, leading to the weak intermolecular forces known as London dispersion forces.
