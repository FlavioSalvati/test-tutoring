At equilibrium, the change in Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) is equal to zero.

To elaborate, the Gibbs free energy change is a measure of the maximum reversible work that a system can perform when the temperature and pressure remain constant. This is expressed by the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

where $\Delta H$ represents the change in enthalpy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\Delta S$ denotes the change in entropy.

At equilibrium, the system reaches a state of maximum stability, meaning that no further work can be accomplished. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy change at this point is zero ($\Delta G = 0$). This principle is a core tenet of thermodynamics and holds true for all systems at equilibrium, irrespective of the specific values of $\Delta H$, $T$, and $\Delta S$.

This principle can also be examined through the lens of the reaction quotient $Q$ and the standard Gibbs free energy change $\Delta G^\circ$. The relationship among these variables is expressed by the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + RT \ln Q
$$

where $R$ is the gas constant and $\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm. At equilibrium, the reaction quotient $Q$ becomes equal to the equilibrium constant $K$, transforming the equation into:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + RT \ln K
$$

Since we know that $\Delta G = 0$ at equilibrium, we can rearrange this equation to derive:

$$
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K
$$

This equation reveals that the standard Gibbs free energy change $\Delta G^\circ$ is negative when the equilibrium constant $K$ is greater than 1, indicating that the reaction is favored towards products. Conversely, $\Delta G^\circ$ is positive when the equilibrium constant $K$ is less than 1, suggesting that the reaction is favored towards reactants.

In conclusion, the Gibbs free energy change at equilibrium is zero, signifying that the system is in a state of maximum stability. In contrast, the standard Gibbs free energy change $\Delta G^\circ$ offers insight into the direction the system is likely to move when it is not at equilibrium.
