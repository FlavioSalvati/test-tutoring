The modern periodic table organizes elements in order of increasing atomic number, grouping them based on similar chemical properties.

Often referred to as the long form of the periodic table, this table presents a systematic arrangement of chemical elements. The organization is primarily based on the atomic number, which represents the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. This number increases from left to right across the table. As a result, elements with analogous properties are aligned vertically in columns known as groups or families.

The periodic table is divided into several distinct blocks. The **s-block** comprises groups 1 and 2, which include hydrogen and helium. The **p-block** consists of groups 13 to 18. The **d-block** contains the transition metals, which span groups 3 to 12. Finally, the **f-block**, positioned at the bottom of the table, encompasses the lanthanides and actinides.

Each horizontal row in the periodic table is termed a **period**. As you progress from left to right within a period, the atomic number increases. The elements in a given period exhibit trends in their properties, known as periodic trends. For instance, the atomic radius typically decreases from left to right across a period, while ionization energy generally increases.

The groups or families in the periodic table consist of columns of elements that share comparable chemical properties. This similarity arises from having the same number of valence electronsâ€”those electrons located in the outermost shell of an atom that participate in chemical reactions. For example, all elements in group 1, known as alkali metals, possess one valence electron, leading to similar reactivity patterns.

The modern periodic table serves as an invaluable resource in the field of chemistry. It not only aids scientists in understanding the relationships among various elements but also enables the prediction of properties for newly discovered elements. Mastery of the periodic table is essential and will be a key concept throughout your IB Chemistry studies.
