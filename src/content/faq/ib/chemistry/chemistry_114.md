Transition metals, located in groups 3 to 12 of the periodic table, are distinct in their ability to form multiple stable ions. This characteristic arises from their unique electron configurations, particularly the presence of d-orbitals. These d-orbitals can hold up to ten electrons, which can be lost or gained in various combinations, leading to different oxidation states and thus different ions.

The oxidation state of an atom is an indicator of its degree of oxidation. It is defined as the hypothetical charge an atom would possess if all its bonds were considered to be 100% ionic. Transition metals frequently exhibit several oxidation states due to the relatively small energy differences between the 3d and 4s orbitals. This allows for the removal of electrons from either the 4s or 3d orbital, resulting in various oxidation states.

For example, iron ($\text{Fe}$) can exist in either the +2 or +3 oxidation state. This stems from its electron configuration, which includes two 4s electrons and six 3d electrons. If iron loses its two 4s electrons, it forms a +2 ion ($\text{Fe}^{2+}$). If it loses these two 4s electrons along with one 3d electron, it forms a +3 ion ($\text{Fe}^{3+}$).

Similarly, copper ($\text{Cu}$) can exist in +1 or +2 oxidation states. Copper has one 4s electron and ten 3d electrons. If it loses the 4s electron, it forms a +1 ion ($\text{Cu}^{+}$). If it loses this 4s electron and one 3d electron, it results in a +2 ion ($\text{Cu}^{2+}$).

In summary, transition metals are versatile in their oxidation states due to their ability to utilize d-orbitals for electron loss or gain. For instance, iron can form $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ or $\text{Fe}^{3+}$ ions, while copper can form $\text{Cu}^{+}$ or $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ ions.
