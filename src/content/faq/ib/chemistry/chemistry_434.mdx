Increasing pressure can promote the spontaneity of chemical reactions by shifting the equilibrium toward the side that contains fewer gas molecules.

This behavior is explained by Le Chatelier's Principle, which states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium will adjust to counteract that change. Specifically, when pressure is increased, the equilibrium shifts in a direction that reduces the total pressure. This is achieved by favoring the side of the reaction that has fewer gas molecules, as a smaller number of gas molecules will exert less pressure.

For instance, consider the following reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia:

$$
\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g)
$$

In this reaction, there are four moles of gas on the reactant side (one mole of nitrogen and three moles of hydrogen) and two moles of gas on the product side (two moles of ammonia). If the pressure is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the right, toward the side with fewer gas molecules, thereby decreasing the pressure. This shift favors the formation of ammonia, making the reaction more spontaneous.

It is crucial to note that this principle applies only to reactions where there is a change in the number of moles of gas. If the number of gas moles is the same on both sides of the reaction, an increase in pressure will not affect the position of equilibrium.

Moreover, the influence of pressure on the spontaneity of reactions is particularly significant for reactions involving gases, as gases are considerably more compressible than solids or liquids. Consequently, a change in pressure can have a substantial impact on the volume of a gas, and hence on the position of equilibrium.

In summary, increasing pressure can enhance the spontaneity of chemical reactions by shifting the equilibrium toward the side with fewer gas molecules, in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle. However, this effect is most pronounced in reactions involving gases where there is a change in the number of moles of gas.
