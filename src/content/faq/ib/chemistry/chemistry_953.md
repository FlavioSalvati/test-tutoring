Entropy typically decreases in combustion reactions because these reactions result in fewer gas molecules than were present among the reactants.

In a combustion reaction, a substance reacts with oxygen, producing heat and light energy. This process often leads to the formation of fewer gas molecules compared to those present in the reactants. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy of an isolated system tends to increase. However, in the context of combustion reactions, we frequently observe the opposite effect. Entropy, which quantifies the disorder or randomness of a system, decreases when there is a reduction in the number of gas molecules.

To illustrate this, consider the combustion of propane ($\text{C}_3\text{H}_8$) in oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) to produce carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:

$$
\text{C}_3\text{H}_8(g) + 5\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_2(g) + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}(g).
$$

In this reaction, we start with a total of six gas molecules (one molecule of propane and five molecules of oxygen) and end up with seven gas molecules (three molecules of carbon dioxide and four molecules of water). While the total number of gas molecules has actually increased, the overall entropy can still decrease. This occurs because the reactants exhibit a higher degree of disorder (greater entropy) compared to the products.

Additionally, the decrease in entropy during combustion reactions can be linked to the release of energy. When a substance undergoes combustion, it releases energy in the form of heat and light. This energy release contributes to the stability of the reaction products, making them more ordered and less random than the reactants, which further results in a decrease in entropy.

In summary, although the second law of thermodynamics posits that entropy tends to increase within a system, combustion reactions often result in a decrease in entropy. This phenomenon arises from the formation of fewer gas molecules and the release of energy, both of which contribute to a more ordered and less random system.
