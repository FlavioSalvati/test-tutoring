Uncertainty in measurements can be quantified by determining the range of possible values and expressing it in the form of ± value.

More specifically, uncertainty provides a means of measuring the doubt associated with a given measurement result. In any scientific experiment, every measurement comes with a certain degree of uncertainty. This inherent uncertainty arises because all measurements are susceptible to some form of error, making it essential to acknowledge this factor when analyzing results.

There are two primary types of uncertainties encountered in measurements: random and systematic. 

1. **Random Uncertainties**: These arise from unpredictable statistical variations. They can often be minimized by taking the average of a large number of observations. 

2. **Systematic Uncertainties**: In contrast, these uncertainties are predictable and are typically either constant or proportional to the true value. They usually stem from flaws in the measurement instrument or the observational method.

To compute the uncertainty associated with a measurement, the first step is to identify the type of uncertainty involved. For random uncertainties, you can calculate the standard deviation of your measurements. The standard deviation quantifies the extent to which individual data points deviate from the mean. This can be computed using the following statistical formula:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

where $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation, $N$ is the number of data points, $x_i$ are the individual measurements, and $\bar{x}$ is the mean of those measurements. 

For systematic uncertainties, you can estimate the uncertainty based on the precision of the measuring instrument. For instance, if you are using a ruler marked in millimeters, the uncertainty might be expressed as ± $0.5$ mm. This is because the last digit must be estimated.

Once you have calculated the uncertainty, it is typically expressed as a ± value. For example, if you measure the length of a table as $2.00$ m with an uncertainty of $0.01$ m, you would report this measurement as:

$$
2.00 \pm 0.01 \text{ m}
$$

This notation implies that the true length of the table is likely to fall within the range of $1.99$ m to $2.01$ m.

In conclusion, it is crucial to consider uncertainty in your measurements, as it provides a range of potential values that could represent the true value. Understanding and quantifying uncertainty is a vital aspect of scientific measurement and analysis.
