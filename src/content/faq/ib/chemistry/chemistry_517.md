In infrared (IR) spectroscopy, the presence of a carboxylic acid is typically indicated by two significant peaks: a strong peak near $1700 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ and a broad peak in the range of $2500$ to $3300 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$.

IR spectroscopy is a valuable analytical technique in organic chemistry that enables the identification of various functional groups within a molecule. When analyzing carboxylic acids, there are two primary peaks of interest. The first is a strong, sharp peak around $1700 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group ($\text{C}=\text{O}$). This peak serves as a definitive marker for the presence of a carbonyl group, a fundamental feature of carboxylic acids.

The second peak of importance is a broad peak found between $2500$ and $3300 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$. This peak arises from the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group ($\text{O-H}$). It is characteristically broad and strong due to the hydrogen bonding that is prevalent in carboxylic acids. Although this broad peak can sometimes overlap with the C-H stretching vibrations present in the same spectral region, its notable intensity and width generally make it easily identifiable.

It is crucial to remember that while these peaks are characteristic of carboxylic acids, they can also be observed in other compounds that contain both carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the entire IR spectrum alongside other relevant information to accurately identify a compound.

In summary, the identification of a strong peak around $1700 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ and a broad peak between $2500$ and $3300 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ in an IR spectrum suggests the possible presence of a carboxylic acid. However, it is always important to consider the complete spectrum and additional data before reaching a final conclusion.
