D-orbitals in transition metals are key to understanding their distinctive chemical properties, such as variable oxidation states and the formation of colored compounds.

Transition metals are located in the d-block of the periodic table, encompassing groups $3$ to $12$. These elements are characterized by the presence of d-orbitals in their outermost energy levels. The involvement of d-orbitals significantly influences the chemical behavior of transition metals, particularly their ability to exhibit various oxidation states and produce colored compounds.

The d-orbitals can hold up to ten electrons, which enables transition metals to manifest multiple oxidation states. This versatility arises from the relatively small energy difference between the $4s$ and $3d$ orbitals, allowing electrons to be easily removed from either orbital during oxidation. For instance, iron can exist in both +2 and +3 oxidation states, resulting from the removal of electrons from the $4s$ and $3d$ orbitals, respectively.

Another remarkable characteristic of transition metals, attributed to the presence of d-orbitals, is their capacity to form colored compounds. This phenomenon is primarily due to d-d transitions, where an electron is excited from a lower energy d-orbital to a higher energy d-orbital. The energy required for this transition corresponds to specific wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum, leading to the absorption of certain colors and the reflection of complementary colors. For example, the blue hue of copper(II) sulfate arises from the absorption of red light during the d-d transition.

Moreover, the existence of d-orbitals in transition metals also enhances their role as effective catalysts. The d-orbitals provide sites for reactant molecules to attach, facilitating the breaking and forming of bonds during chemical reactions. A prime example is nickel, which is employed as a catalyst in the hydrogenation of alkenes due to the accessibility of its d-orbitals.

In summary, the d-orbitals in transition metals are essential to their chemical behavior. They account for the variability in oxidation states, the formation of colored compounds, and the catalytic properties of these elements.
