When considering the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB DP) in India, it's important to evaluate not just the tuition fees but also the additional costs associated with this rigorous and globally recognized education pathway. The IB DP, typically spanning two years, prepares students for university education, particularly in international contexts.
