Choosing a topic for your Extended Essay (EE) in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program can feel overwhelming, especially with a complex issue like global warming. However, with the right approach, you can find a topic that not only interests you but also allows you to explore significant scientific, social, and economic dimensions of this global challenge. Below, I will outline some potential topic ideas for an EE on global warming, as well as advice on how to refine these ideas into focused research questions.

### 1. Understanding the Science of Global Warming

**Topic Idea:** Analyze the role of greenhouse gases in climate change.

- **Research Question Example:** "To what extent do variations in carbon dioxide levels correlate with global temperature changes over the past century?"

In this investigation, you could use historical climate data and greenhouse gas concentration records. Analyze how changes in industrial activity and deforestation have impacted carbon dioxide levels and, consequently, temperatures. 

### 2. Impacts of Global Warming

**Topic Idea:** Investigate the impact of global warming on biodiversity.

- **Research Question Example:** "How is global warming affecting the migration patterns of bird species in [specific region]?"

This topic allows you to focus on specific species and their habitats. You can gather data on migration patterns, breeding seasons, and food availability to demonstrate the direct effects of climate changes.

### 3. Global Warming and Human Health

**Topic Idea:** Explore the health implications of climate change on human populations.

- **Research Question Example:** "What is the relationship between rising temperatures and the incidence of heat-related illnesses in urban areas?"

In this investigation, you could analyze data from health organizations about heat-related illnesses and correlate it with temperature data from meteorological services.

### 4. Economic Aspects of Global Warming

**Topic Idea:** Examine the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture.

- **Research Question Example:** "How is global warming affecting crop yields of [specific crop] in [specific region]?"

You can look into agricultural data and climate projections to analyze how temperature increases and changing weather patterns affect crop growth, pest populations, and soil health.

### 5. Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies

**Topic Idea:** Evaluate the effectiveness of renewable energy sources in reducing carbon emissions.

- **Research Question Example:** "How effective are solar energy systems in reducing carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels in [specific area]?"

In this study, you can analyze data on energy production, emission reductions, and economic factors related to solar energy installations versus fossil fuel consumption.

### 6. Policy and Global Responses

**Topic Idea:** Investigate the role of international agreements in combating climate change.

- **Research Question Example:** "To what extent has the Paris Agreement influenced national policies on greenhouse gas emissions in [specific country]?"

You can analyze policy documents and emission data before and after the signing of the Paris Agreement to see if there has been any significant change in emissions or policy implementation.

### 7. Social and Cultural Perspectives

**Topic Idea:** Explore public perception of climate change and its influence on policy.

- **Research Question Example:** "How does public awareness and perception of global warming influence environmental policy in [specific region]?"

This investigation can involve surveys or interviews to assess public opinion and correlate it with local environmental policies.

### 8. Technological Innovations

**Topic Idea:** Examine the potential of carbon capture technology in mitigating global warming.

- **Research Question Example:** "What are the potential benefits and limitations of carbon capture and storage technologies in reducing atmospheric CO2 levels?"

This topic allows you to delve into scientific literature and case studies of existing carbon capture projects to evaluate their effectiveness and scalability.

### Steps to Refine Your Topic

1. **Interest and Passion:** Choose a topic that genuinely interests you. Your enthusiasm will carry you through the research and writing process.

2. **Research and Explore:** Start with broad research. Read articles, journals, and books related to your topic of interest. This will help you understand the scope of the issue and identify specific areas that intrigue you.

3. **Narrow Down:** Once you have a general idea, narrow it down to a specific aspect. A focused topic will make your research more manageable and your argument stronger.

4. **Formulate a Research Question:** Create a clear and concise research question that guides your investigation. Make sure it is specific, relevant, and feasible to answer within the word limit.

5. **Consult with Your Supervisor:** Regularly discuss your ideas with your EE supervisor. They can provide guidance on the feasibility of your topic and help refine your research question.

### Additional Tips

- **Data Availability:** Ensure that you have access to the necessary data and resources for your research. This is crucial for the success of your EE.

- **Diverse Perspectives:** Consider the interdisciplinary nature of global warming. You can include perspectives from science, economics, sociology, and policy studies.

- **Stay Updated:** Climate science is a rapidly evolving field. Stay informed about the latest research and developments in the area of global warming as they may influence your topic.

- **Plan Your Time:** The EE process requires significant time management. Create a timeline for your research, writing, and revisions to ensure you stay on track.

- **Review the Rubric:** Familiarize yourself with the assessment criteria for the EE. Understanding how your work will be evaluated will help you meet the expectations.
