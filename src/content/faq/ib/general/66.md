Choosing the right Higher Level (HL) subjects in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme is crucial for students aspiring to apply to prestigious universities like Cambridge. The decisions you make during this time can significantly impact not only your university applications but also your future academic and career paths.
