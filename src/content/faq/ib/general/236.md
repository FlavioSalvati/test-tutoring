Choosing the right topic for your International Baccalaureate (IB) Extended Essay (EE) is crucial for both your success in the project and your overall IB Diploma. The topic should ideally align with your interests, the subjects you are studying, and the goals you have for your future. When considering a topic like comparing Intel's i7 and i5 processors, there are several factors to take into account.

### Is Comparing i7 and i5 a Good Extended Essay Topic?

1. **Relevance to a Subject:**
   The first step in evaluating your topic is to ensure it fits within one of the six IB subject categories. The comparison between i7 and i5 processors would most likely fall under the category of **Sciences**, specifically **Computer Science** or possibly **Design Technology**. If you are studying one of these subjects at Higher Level (HL), then this topic can be particularly relevant.

2. **Specificity of the Research Question:**
   A successful EE needs a focused research question. Instead of a broad comparison, consider narrowing it down. For instance, you might ask:
   - "How do the architectural differences between Intel's i7 and i5 processors affect their performance in gaming applications?"
   - "What is the impact of thermal design power (TDP) on the performance of Intel i7 vs. i5 processors in high-performance computing tasks?"
   
   These questions are specific and allow for deeper analysis and exploration, which is a key element of a successful EE.

3. **Depth of Analysis:**
   A good EE should allow for extensive research and critical analysis. When comparing i7 and i5 processors, you can delve into various aspects:
   - **Technical Specifications:** Analyze the differences in clock speeds, core counts, hyper-threading capabilities, etc.
   - **Practical Applications:** Investigate how these differences manifest in real-world applications like gaming, video editing, and software development.
   - **Consumer Perspectives:** Explore how these processors are marketed and perceived by consumers.

   This depth ensures that your essay will meet the IB's assessment criteria, particularly in the areas of Analysis and Interpretation, as well as Knowledge and Understanding.

4. **Availability of Resources:**
   Before finalizing your topic, check the availability of resources. There are numerous articles, white papers, and reviews available that compare these processors. Websites like AnandTech and Tom's Hardware provide in-depth analyses and benchmarks. Additionally, Intel’s official documentation can provide you with technical specifications and architectural details.

5. **Engagement with Sources:**
   As per the IB EE requirements, it is crucial to engage critically with your sources. Instead of summarizing information, you should evaluate and analyze data from multiple sources. This could involve comparing benchmark results from different tests, analyzing data trends, and critically assessing the methodologies used in studies.

6. **Potential Pitfalls:**
   - **Broad Comparisons:** Avoid making generalizations without sufficient data. Focus on specific aspects where you can draw meaningful conclusions.
   - **Lack of Originality:** While the topic itself isn’t overly common, ensure your approach is unique. You might consider including aspects like price-to-performance ratios or energy efficiency in your analysis.

### Structuring Your Essay

Once you decide on a refined topic, structuring your EE is essential. Below is a suggested outline:

- **Introduction:**
  - Introduce the topic and provide context.
  - Clearly state your research question.
  - Outline the significance of the research.

- **Background Information:**
  - Provide a brief overview of CPU architecture, focusing on Intel.
  - Discuss the evolution of i5 and i7 processors.

- **Methodology:**
  - Explain how you will gather data (e.g., benchmarks, reviews).
  - Discuss the criteria for comparison (e.g., performance, power consumption).

- **Analysis:**
  - Present your findings in a clear and organized manner.
  - Use graphs and tables to illustrate key points.
  - Critically analyze the data and discuss its implications.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Summarize your findings.
  - Reflect on the significance of your research and any limitations.

### Engaging with Your Supervisor

Throughout your EE process, regular meetings with your supervisor are invaluable. They can provide guidance on refining your research question and feedback on your drafts. Discuss your topic choice with them early on to ensure it meets IB criteria and to gain insights into potential pitfalls.

### Additional Considerations

- **Timeline Management:** Start early and create a timeline for your research and writing. This will help you stay on track and reduce last-minute stress.
- **Adherence to Word Count:** Remember that the EE has a maximum word count of 4,000 words. Be concise and ensure every section contributes to your argument or analysis.
- **Proper Referencing:** Familiarize yourself with the required citation style (e.g., MLA, APA) and ensure that all sources are properly cited to avoid plagiarism.

### Conclusion

In summary, comparing Intel's i7 and i5 processors can be a good Extended Essay topic if approached thoughtfully and strategically. Focus on creating a specific research question, engaging critically with your sources, and structuring your essay effectively. With careful planning and guidance from your supervisor, you can develop a compelling and insightful Extended Essay that showcases your understanding and analytical skills.
