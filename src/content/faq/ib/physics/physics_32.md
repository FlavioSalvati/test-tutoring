In the context of addition and subtraction, the uncertainties associated with measurements are combined using a specific mathematical approach known as the 'sum in quadrature' rule. This method entails taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties. 

When conducting measurements in physics, it is crucial to account for the uncertainties that accompany those measurements. Uncertainties quantify the potential deviation of your measured values from the true values. When you are adding or subtracting quantities, the way uncertainties combine is particularly important.

The sum in quadrature rule can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\Delta C = \sqrt{(\Delta A)^2 + (\Delta B)^2}
$$

Here, $\Delta A$ and $\Delta B$ represent the uncertainties in the quantities $A$ and $B$, respectively. 

To illustrate this rule, consider an example where you measure the length of a table with a ruler that has an uncertainty of $\pm 1 \, \text{cm}$. If you also measure the width of the table using the same ruler, the combined uncertainty when adding these two measurements is not simply $1 \, \text{cm} + 1 \, \text{cm} = 2 \, \text{cm}$. Instead, you must calculate the combined uncertainty as follows:

$$
\Delta C = \sqrt{(1 \, \text{cm})^2 + (1 \, \text{cm})^2} = \sqrt{2} \, \text{cm} \approx 1.4 \, \text{cm}.
$$

This rule applies equally to both addition and subtraction. The reason for this is that uncertainties represent potential deviations from the true value, which can be either positive or negative. Thus, when you add or subtract quantities, the uncertainties can either accumulate or counterbalance each other, depending on whether the deviations occur in the same or opposite directions.

It is essential to recognize that this rule assumes the uncertainties are independent. This means that the uncertainty in one measurement does not influence the uncertainty in another measurement. If the uncertainties are not independent, a different method of combination may be necessary. To gain a deeper understanding of these concepts, consider exploring advanced topics related to measuring and expressing uncertainties.
