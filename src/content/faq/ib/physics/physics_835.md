The energy of a wave is inversely proportional to its wavelength. This means that as the wavelength increases, the energy of the wave decreases.

More specifically, the relationship between a wave's energy and its wavelength is described by the Planck-Einstein relation. This equation states that the energy $ E $ of a wave is given by the product of Planck's constant $ h $ and its frequency $ f $:

$$
E = hf
$$

Additionally, the frequency of a wave is inversely related to its wavelength $ \lambda $, as expressed in the equation:

$$
f = \frac{c}{\lambda}
$$

where $ c $ represents the speed of light. By substituting this expression for frequency into the energy equation, we can also express the energy of a wave in terms of its wavelength:

$$
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$

This indicates that as the wavelength $ \lambda $ of a wave increases, its frequency $ f $ decreases, leading to a corresponding decrease in energy $ E $. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength results in an increase in both frequency and energy. This relationship is particularly significant in the realm of quantum mechanics, where it is essential for describing the properties of photons and other quantum particles.

For instance, consider light waves. Light with shorter wavelengths, such as blue or violet light, has higher frequencies and consequently more energy compared to light with longer wavelengths, such as red or orange light. This explains why ultraviolet light, which has an even shorter wavelength than visible light, possesses enough energy to cause sunburn.
