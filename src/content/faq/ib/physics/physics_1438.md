The phase difference in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is defined as the difference in the positions or states of two oscillating objects at a specific moment in time.

In the realm of SHM, the concept of phase difference is of paramount importance. It signifies the spatial or temporal displacement between two oscillating objects at any given instant. This difference can be quantified in degrees or radians. To illustrate this concept, consider two pendulums swinging back and forth. If both pendulums initiate their motion simultaneously and at the same speed, they are described as being "in phase." Conversely, if one pendulum begins its swing slightly later than the other, a phase difference will emerge between them.

The phase difference can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi \Delta t}{T}
$$

where $\Delta \phi$ represents the phase difference, $\Delta t$ denotes the time difference between the two oscillations, and $T$ is the period of the oscillation. This formula is grounded in the understanding that a complete oscillation corresponds to a phase change of $2\pi$ radians.

In SHM, the phase difference is crucial for comprehending the interactions between various oscillating systems. For instance, in wave mechanics, the phase difference between two points on a wave can provide insights into the wave's speed and direction. Similarly, in acoustics, the phase difference between two sound waves can reveal information about the pitch and volume of the sound.
