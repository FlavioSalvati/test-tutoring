A capacitor stores energy in an electric field, while an inductor stores energy in a magnetic field.

In an electrical circuit, capacitors and inductors serve distinct functions due to their unique characteristics. A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores energy within an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. When a voltage is applied across these plates, an electric field is generated, allowing energy to be stored. The capacity of a capacitor to hold charge is quantified in Farads ($F$). Capacitors find applications in various areas, including noise filtering, tuning resonant circuits, and energy storage in power supplies.

Conversely, an inductor is another passive electronic component that stores energy in a magnetic field. Typically formed as a coil of wire, an inductor generates a magnetic field when an electric current flows through it, thereby storing energy within that magnetic field. The ability of an inductor to store energy is measured in Henrys ($H$). Inductors are commonly used in applications like signal filtering, energy storage in power supplies, and tuning resonant circuits.

The behavior of capacitors and inductors in a circuit also differs significantly. Capacitors resist changes in voltage and can block direct current (DC), while allowing alternating current (AC) to pass through. This is because the charge stored in the capacitor opposes voltage changes, creating a temporary battery effect.

In contrast, inductors resist changes in current. They allow DC to flow through them easily but oppose the flow of AC. This resistance to AC is due to the magnetic field established by the current, which reacts against changes in current flow.

In summary, although both capacitors and inductors are capable of storing energy and are utilized in tuning and filtering applications, they operate in fundamentally different ways and exert different influences on current and voltage within a circuit.
