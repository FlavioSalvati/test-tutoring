The unit of force in the International System of Units (SI) is the Newton, denoted by the symbol 'N'.

Named after the renowned physicist Sir Isaac Newton, who made significant contributions to classical mechanics, the Newton is the standard unit of force in physics. 

The definition of the Newton is rooted in Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

$$
F = ma
$$

where $F$ represents the force, $m$ denotes the mass of the object, and $a$ indicates the acceleration produced.

To provide a practical perspective, one Newton is approximately the force exerted by Earth's gravity on a small apple. Therefore, if you were to hold an apple in your hand, the gravitational pull you would feel acting downward on it is roughly equal to one Newton.

In physics, force is a fundamental concept that describes the push or pull experienced by an object as a result of its interaction with another object. Whenever two objects interact, a force is exerted on each one. This force can cause an object with mass to alter its velocity, which includes starting from rest, i.e., accelerating.

In summary, the Newton is the SI unit of force and is classified as a derived unit. It is defined in terms of the kilogram (the SI unit of mass), the meter (the SI unit of length), and the second (the SI unit of time). A solid understanding of the Newton and its derivation is essential for studying physics, especially when analyzing the forces acting on an object and their effects on motion.
