An object exhibits Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) when it experiences a restoring force that is both proportional to its displacement from an equilibrium position and directed toward that equilibrium.

Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a specific type of oscillatory motion characterized by a restoring force that acts on the object, which is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position. This force is always directed back toward the equilibrium point. The term 'simple' refers to the predictable and easily analyzable nature of this motion.

For an object to undergo SHM, it must satisfy the following conditions:

1. **Displacement from Equilibrium**: The object must be displaced from its equilibrium position, the point at which it naturally rests and where all forces acting on it are balanced. When the object is moved away from this position, it experiences a restoring force.

2. **Proportional Restoring Force**: The restoring force must be proportional to the displacement. This implies that the farther the object is from the equilibrium position, the stronger the force acting to return it. This relationship is mathematically expressed by the equation:

   $$ F = -kx $$

   Here, $F$ represents the restoring force, $k$ is a constant that depends on the system's properties, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium. The negative sign indicates that the force is always directed toward the equilibrium position.

3. **Direction of Restoration**: The restoring force must always act toward the equilibrium position. For instance, if the object is displaced to the left of the equilibrium, the restoring force will act to the right, and conversely. This ensures that the object oscillates back and forth around the equilibrium position.

In addition to these conditions, for an object to sustain SHM, the system must not lose energy to friction or other forms of energy dissipation. In real-world scenarios, energy loss is common, leading to a gradual decrease in motion until the object eventually comes to rest. However, in an idealized SHM system, the motion would persist indefinitely, allowing for continuous oscillation.
