The intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of its amplitude.

To elaborate, the intensity of a wave quantifies the energy it transmits per unit time across a unit area. It serves as a measure of the wave's power. In contrast, the amplitude of a wave refers to the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position. This displacement indicates the wave's strength; for sound waves, it relates to loudness, while for light waves, it corresponds to brightness.

The relationship between amplitude and intensity is quadratic. This means that if the amplitude of a wave is doubled, its intensity increases by a factor of four, since $2^2 = 4$. The reason for this is that the energy of a wave is contained in its oscillations; thus, a larger amplitude indicates more significant oscillations and, consequently, a greater amount of energy carried by the wave.

This relationship is particularly important in the contexts of sound and light waves. For sound waves, the amplitude directly influences loudness; a wave with a larger amplitude will produce a louder sound and, therefore, exhibit a higher intensity compared to a wave with a smaller amplitude. Similarly, in the case of light waves, a wave with a greater amplitude will appear brighter and possess a higher intensity than a wave with a smaller amplitude.

In conclusion, the amplitude of a wave has a profound impact on its intensity. The greater the amplitude, the higher the intensity of the wave. This is because the amplitude determines the amount of energy carried by the wave, while intensity serves as a measure of that energy. Therefore, understanding the connection between amplitude and intensity is essential for studying waves in physics.
