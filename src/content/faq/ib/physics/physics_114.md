The change in potential energy of an elevated object can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta PE = mgh
$$

In this equation, $\Delta PE$ represents the change in potential energy, $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the object above the ground.

Potential energy is defined as the energy an object possesses due to its position in relation to other objects. When discussing elevated objects, this specific type of potential energy is known as gravitational potential energy. The change in gravitational potential energy, denoted as $\Delta PE$, can be computed with the formula mentioned above.

Letâ€™s break down the components of the formula:

- The mass of the object, represented by $m$, is measured in kilograms (kg).
- The acceleration due to gravity, denoted as $g$, is approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ at the Earth's surface. This value can slightly vary based on geographical location, but for most calculations, $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ is a suitable approximation.
- The height, $h$, is the vertical distance from the ground to the object, measured in meters (m).

To calculate the change in potential energy, you need to determine these three parameters. The mass of the object can typically be measured directly. The height can be measured from the ground to the object's position. The value of $g$ is a known constant.

After obtaining these values, you can substitute them into the formula:

$$
\Delta PE = mgh
$$

The result will yield the change in potential energy in joules (J), indicating the amount of energy gained or lost by the object as a result of its change in height.

It is important to note that this formula assumes that the only force acting on the object is gravity. If additional forces, such as friction or air resistance, are present, they must be considered separately. Additionally, this formula simplifies the scenario by assuming a uniform gravitational field, which is a reasonable assumption for small height changes near the Earth's surface. For larger height variations or distances from the Earth, a more complex approach would be required.
