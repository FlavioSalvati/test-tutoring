Single-slit diffraction is a phenomenon in which light passes through a narrow slit and subsequently spreads out, resulting in an interference pattern.

In greater detail, single-slit diffraction is a key concept in wave optics, the branch of physics that studies light as a wave phenomenon. This effect occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that has dimensions comparable to its wavelength. Instead of continuing in a straight path, the wave bends around the edges of the obstacle or spreads out after traversing the slit. This bending or spreading of the wave is referred to as diffraction.

A classic example of single-slit diffraction can be observed when light passes through a narrow slit, producing a pattern of alternating light and dark bands on a screen positioned behind the slit. This pattern, known as an interference pattern, arises from the interference of light waves with one another. The central band, often referred to as the central maximum, is the brightest part of the pattern, as it is where constructive interference is most pronounced. Flanking the central maximum are alternating dark and light bands, known as minima and maxima, which correspond to regions of destructive and constructive interference, respectively.

The width of the diffraction pattern is influenced by both the wavelength of the light and the width of the slit. When the slit is made narrower or the wavelength of the light is increased, the diffraction pattern becomes wider. This relationship can be mathematically expressed by the equation:

$$
\theta = \frac{\lambda}{b}
$$

where $\theta$ represents the angle of the first minimum, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, and $b$ denotes the width of the slit.

Understanding single-slit diffraction is essential for grasping the wave nature of light. It illustrates that light does not always propagate in straight lines; rather, it can bend around obstacles and spread out, exhibiting wave-like behavior. This foundational knowledge is critical in various fields of physics and engineering, particularly in the design of optical instruments such as microscopes and telescopes.
