Atmospheric turbulence distorts the light from celestial objects, reducing the resolution of ground-based telescopes.

Atmospheric turbulence is a significant factor that affects the resolution of ground-based telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere is not a uniform medium, but rather a turbulent, ever-changing mixture of air with different densities and temperatures. This turbulence causes the light from celestial objects to scatter and refract as it passes through the atmosphere, leading to a phenomenon known as 'astronomical seeing'.

Astronomical seeing is the blurring and twinkling of astronomical objects like stars caused by the passage of their light through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. This effect can cause stars to appear larger than they actually are and can even make them seem to move or 'dance' in the sky. For ground-based telescopes, this means that the images they capture can be blurry or distorted, reducing their resolution.

The resolution of a telescope is its ability to distinguish between two close objects in the sky. The higher the resolution, the clearer and more detailed the images the telescope can produce. However, due to atmospheric turbulence, the resolution of ground-based telescopes is often limited. This is known as the 'seeing limit' and is typically around 1 arcsecond for most good observing sites on Earth.

To overcome the effects of atmospheric turbulence, astronomers use several techniques. One common method is adaptive optics, which involves using a deformable mirror to correct the distortions caused by the atmosphere in real-time. Another technique is interferometry, where the data from several telescopes is combined to effectively create a 'super telescope' with a much higher resolution.

In conclusion, while ground-based telescopes have many advantages, such as ease of access and maintenance, their resolution is significantly affected by atmospheric turbulence. This is a major challenge for astronomers and is a key factor in the ongoing development of space-based telescopes, which are not affected by the Earth's atmosphere.
