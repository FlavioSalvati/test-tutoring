Pulleys are simple machines that alter the direction of force by redirecting the tension in a rope through a different angle.

A pulley consists of a wheel mounted on an axle or shaft, typically featuring a groove around its circumference between two flanges. This groove is designed to hold a rope, cable, belt, or other flexible line. When force is applied to the rope, it causes the pulley to rotate, thereby redirecting the force in a new direction.

The change in force direction depends on the position of the pulley. When a pulley is fixed and does not move, it simply alters the direction of the force applied to the rope. For instance, if you pull downward on a rope that loops over a fixed pulley, the load on the opposite end of the rope will be lifted upward. This occurs because the tension in the rope remains consistent along its entire length; thus, pulling down on one side generates an upward force on the other side.

In a movable pulley system, the pulley is attached directly to the load. When you pull down on the rope, the load moves in the same direction as the applied force. However, the effective force is multiplied because the tension in the rope acts on the load from two directions. While this does not reduce the total amount of force needed to lift the load, it allows you to apply that force over a greater distance.

A compound pulley system, which combines both fixed and movable pulleys, can change the direction of the force multiple times. This setup provides a greater mechanical advantage, allowing you to lift heavy loads with less effort.
