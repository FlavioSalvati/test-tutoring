Sound intensity is quantified in decibels (dB) using a device known as a sound level meter.

Sound intensity, often referred to as sound power or sound pressure, measures the energy carried by sound waves per unit of time. This measurement is typically expressed in decibels (dB), which is a logarithmic unit that indicates the ratio of the sound pressure of the measured sound to a reference sound pressure. The reference sound pressure in air is commonly established at the threshold of hearing for the average human ear, defined as $0 \, \text{dB}$.

To assess sound intensity, a sound level meter is employed. This device features a microphone that captures the sound and a display that shows the sound level in decibels. The microphone converts the sound waves into an electrical signal, which is then amplified and processed to yield a dB reading on the meter.

Sound level meters can measure sound intensity across a broad spectrum of frequencies, from approximately $20 \, \text{Hz}$, the lowest frequency audible to humans, to around $20,000 \, \text{Hz}$, the highest. However, since the human ear does not have uniform sensitivity to all frequencies, sound level meters often incorporate frequency weighting filters. These filters adjust the measurements to better reflect the ear's sensitivity at different frequencies.

There are various types of sound level meters available. Basic models provide straightforward dB readings, while more advanced models can analyze sound in greater detail, offering insights into its frequency composition and temporal characteristics. Some sound level meters also have the capability to store measurements for subsequent analysis.

It is essential to understand that sound intensity is distinct from loudness, which is a subjective perception that can differ from person to person. Generally, however, sounds with higher intensity are perceived as louder.

In summary, measuring sound intensity involves capturing sound waves with a microphone, converting them into an electrical signal, and then translating that signal into a dB reading. This process is facilitated by a sound level meter, which can either provide a simple dB reading or offer a more comprehensive analysis of the sound.
