A whip produces a crack due to the tip moving at supersonic speeds, which generates a sonic boom as a result of its circular motion.

When a whip is cracked, the handler initiates a wave that travels down its length. This begins with a large, slow movement at the handle and transitions to a very fast, small movement at the tip, thanks to the whip's tapered design. This phenomenon exemplifies the conservation of momentum and energy in circular motion.

The whip functions as a flexible lever, with the handler's arm acting as the pivot point. As the whip is swung, the energy from the handler's arm is transferred to the whip, creating a wave that propagates along its length. As the whip tapers towards the tip, the amplitude of the wave decreases while its speed increases. This occurs because the energy of the wave is conserved; thus, as the mass it is moving decreases, its speed must increase to maintain this conservation.

The tip of the whip can achieve speeds exceeding the speed of sound, which is approximately $343 \, \text{m/s}$ in air at sea level. When this occurs, it produces a sonic boomâ€”the distinctive crack that we hear. This phenomenon is similar to the sound generated when a supersonic aircraft breaks the sound barrier.

The role of circular motion is crucial in this process. The handler's arm moves in a circular path, and this motion is transferred into the whip. The whip, in turn, moves in a larger circle, with the handle at the center and the wave traveling around the circumference. This circular motion facilitates the transfer of energy from the handle to the tip, enabling the tip to reach supersonic speeds.

In summary, the crack of a whip serves as a fascinating demonstration of physics in action. It illustrates the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, the effects of circular motion, and the behavior of sound waves at supersonic velocities.
