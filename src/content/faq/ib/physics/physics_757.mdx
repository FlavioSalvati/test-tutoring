At the open end of a pipe, the behavior of waves is characterized by the formation of an antinode.

To elaborate, an open pipe, such as a flute or an organ pipe, is a musical instrument that generates sound through the vibration of air columns within it. The wave dynamics at the open end of an open pipe are particularly intriguing. When a wave reaches the open end, it does not reflect back into the pipe as it would if the end were closed. Instead, the wave escapes into the surrounding air. Nevertheless, a small portion of the wave is reflected back into the pipe, leading to interference with incoming waves. This interference results in the formation of a standing wave pattern inside the pipe.

The open end of the pipe acts as a point of maximum vibration, known as an antinode. This occurs because the air at the open end is free to vibrate, resulting in a pressure variation that is maximum at the open end and minimum at the closed end. It is this pressure variation that we perceive as sound. The frequency of the sound produced is dependent on both the length of the pipe and the speed of sound in air.

In terms of wave behavior, the open end of the pipe is also a node of minimum pressure. This is due to the fact that air particles at the open end are free to move, resulting in a pressure variation that is minimum at the open end and maximum at the closed end. This pressure variation contributes to our perception of sound.

The wave behavior at the open end of the pipe is essential for determining the pitch of the sound produced. Specifically, the longer the pipe, the lower the frequency of the sound generated, and conversely, a shorter pipe produces a higher frequency. This relationship arises because the length of the pipe dictates the length of the standing wave, and the frequency of the sound is inversely proportional to the length of the standing wave.

In conclusion, the wave behavior at the open end of a pipe is characterized by the formation of an antinode, which represents a point of maximum vibration and minimum pressure. This phenomenon is crucial in determining the pitch of the sound produced by the pipe.
