Certain materials exhibit magnetization when subjected to an electric current, a phenomenon that arises from the alignment of their atomic magnetic moments.

When an electric current flows through specific materials, it can induce magnetization. This effect is attributed to a property of the atoms within the material known as the atomic magnetic moment. Each atom possesses a minuscule magnetic field, and in most materials, these fields are oriented randomly, effectively canceling one another out and resulting in no net magnetic field. However, when an external magnetic field is applied—such as that generated by an electric current—the atomic magnetic moments can align with this field. This alignment produces a net magnetic field, causing the material to become magnetized.

The capacity of a material to become magnetized in response to an external field is termed its magnetic permeability. Materials with high magnetic permeability, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, can be easily magnetized when exposed to an electric current. These are classified as ferromagnetic materials. Conversely, materials with low magnetic permeability, such as copper and aluminum, are not readily magnetized; these are referred to as diamagnetic materials.

The magnetization process is not necessarily permanent across all materials. In some cases, when the external magnetic field is removed, the atomic magnetic moments revert to their random orientations, leading to a loss of magnetization. Such materials are known as soft magnetic materials. In contrast, certain materials retain their magnetization even after the external field is removed, as their atomic magnetic moments remain aligned. These materials are categorized as hard magnetic materials.

The phenomenon of magnetization induced by electric current underpins a variety of technologies, including electric motors, transformers, and data storage devices. As such, comprehending this process is essential for the effective design and operation of these technologies.
