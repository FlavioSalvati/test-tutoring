In simple harmonic motion (SHM), frequency and period are inversely proportional to one another.

Frequency and period are two essential concepts in the study of simple harmonic motion, and they are closely interconnected. The frequency of an oscillation, denoted as $f$, refers to the number of complete cycles that occur within a specific time unit, typically measured in hertz (Hz), which is equivalent to cycles per second. Conversely, the period, denoted as $T$, represents the time required to complete one full cycle of motion, generally measured in seconds.

The relationship between frequency and period is mathematically expressed by the equation:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

This equation illustrates that as the frequency of an oscillation increases, the period decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship is a fundamental property of all oscillatory systems, not limited to those exhibiting simple harmonic motion.

To visualize this relationship, consider a pendulum swinging back and forth. If the pendulum swings rapidly, completing many cycles in a short period of time, it demonstrates a high frequency and a correspondingly short period. In contrast, if the pendulum swings more slowly, taking a longer time to complete each cycle, it exhibits a low frequency and a longer period.

In the context of simple harmonic motion, the interplay between frequency and period is particularly significant. The motion in SHM is sinusoidal, meaning it follows a smooth, repeating pattern that can be mathematically described using sine or cosine functions. The frequency and period of the motion directly influence the shape of this sinusoidal wave. A high frequency (and thus a short period) produces a tightly packed sine wave, characterized by many oscillations occurring within a brief time interval. In contrast, a low frequency (and therefore a long period) results in a more spread-out sine wave, with fewer oscillations taking place over the same duration.

In summary, grasping the relationship between frequency and period is vital for understanding the behavior of systems that exhibit simple harmonic motion. This inverse relationship is a fundamental aspect of all oscillatory systems and is essential for accurately describing and predicting their dynamics.
