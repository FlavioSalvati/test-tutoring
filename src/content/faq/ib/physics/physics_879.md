The boundary behavior of light waves pertains to their reflection, refraction, or transmission when they interact with a boundary separating two different media.

When light waves reach a boundary between two distinct media, they can be reflected, refracted, or transmitted. These phenomena are governed by the fundamental laws of reflection and refraction, which are essential concepts in optics.

**Reflection** occurs when light waves bounce off a boundary, resulting in a change of direction without altering their speed or frequency. According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming light wave and the normal (a perpendicular line to the surface at the boundary), is equal to the angle of reflection (the angle between the reflected wave and the normal). This principle explains why we can see our reflection in a mirrorâ€”light waves emitted from our body strike the mirror and are reflected back to our eyes.

**Refraction**, in contrast, involves a change in the direction of light waves as they transition from one medium to another. This bending occurs due to a change in the speed of light in different media. The law of refraction, commonly known as Snell's law, quantifies the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction and the indices of refraction of the two media. For instance, a straw appears to be bent when placed in a glass of water because the light waves are refracted as they move from the water to the air.

**Transmission** refers to the passage of light waves through a boundary without being reflected or refracted. This phenomenon typically occurs when the two media have similar indices of refraction. An example of this is light waves transmitting through a pane of glass, which allows us to see clearly through it.

In summary, the boundary behavior of light waves involves their reflection, refraction, or transmission when they encounter a boundary between two different media. This behavior is dictated by the laws of reflection and refraction, which are fundamental to the study of optics.
