Power is determined by dividing the total amount of work performed by the total time taken to accomplish that work.

In the field of physics, power is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. Essentially, it quantifies how quickly work can be completed. The unit of power is the Watt (W), which is equivalent to one Joule per second, expressed mathematically as:

$$
1 \, \text{W} = 1 \, \text{J/s}
$$ 

This relationship highlights the direct link between energy and time in the context of power.
