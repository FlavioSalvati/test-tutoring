The conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that asserts the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time.

To elaborate, this principle is derived from Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This implies that the forces exerted between two objects are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Consequently, any change in momentum experienced by one object is balanced by an equal and opposite change in momentum of the other object. As a result, the total momentum of the entire system remains unchanged.

In physics, momentum is defined as a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude and direction. It is calculated as the product of an object's mass and its velocity, represented mathematically as:

$$
p = mv
$$

where $p$ is momentum, $m$ is mass, and $v$ is velocity. In a closed system—one that is not influenced by external forces—the total momentum before an event (such as a collision or explosion) must equal the total momentum after the event. This holds true regardless of the specific interactions between the objects within the system.

For instance, consider two ice skaters who push off each other in opposite directions. Prior to their push, their combined momentum is zero, since they are stationary. After they push off, one skater moves in one direction while the other skater moves in the opposite direction. Although each skater now possesses momentum, the total momentum of the system (the two skaters) remains zero. This is because the momentum of one skater is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the momentum of the other skater.

The conservation of momentum serves as a powerful analytical tool in physics. It is extensively used to study collisions, explosions, and the motion of rockets. Additionally, it plays a fundamental role in the exploration of atomic and subatomic particles in quantum mechanics. Mastering the principle of conservation of momentum is essential for solving a wide range of problems in the field of physics.
