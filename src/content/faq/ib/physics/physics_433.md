Centripetal force is the force that enables an object to maintain its circular motion.

To elaborate, centripetal force is a key concept in physics, particularly in the study of circular motion. This force acts on an object moving in a circular trajectory and is directed towards the center of that path. It is essential for keeping an object in circular motion, as it continuously alters the object's direction.

The term 'centripetal' is derived from the Latin words 'centrum', meaning center, and 'petere', meaning to seek. Therefore, centripetal force can be interpreted as a 'center-seeking' force. In the absence of this force, an object in motion would follow a straight line due to inertia, as described by Newton's first law of motion.

The magnitude of the centripetal force acting on an object with mass $m$, moving at a speed $v$, along a circular path with radius $r$, is expressed by the formula:

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$

This equation indicates that the centripetal force increases with the square of the speed. Consequently, if the speed is doubled, the centripetal force quadruples. Additionally, the formula shows that the force is inversely proportional to the radius; thus, a larger radius requires less force to maintain circular motion.

Centripetal force can arise from various sources depending on the context. For instance, the tension in a string supplies the centripetal force for a tetherball moving in a circular path, while the friction between a car's tires and the road provides the necessary centripetal force for a vehicle making a turn. In the case of the Earth orbiting the Sun, gravitational force serves as the centripetal force.

In summary, grasping the concept of centripetal force is essential for understanding circular motion. It is the force that allows an object to move along a circular path, continually changing its direction of motion.
