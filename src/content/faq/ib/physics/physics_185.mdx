In wave phenomena, the energy of a wave is directly proportional to the square of its amplitude.

To elaborate, the amplitude of a wave is defined as the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position. This value serves as a measure of the wave's intensity: for sound waves, it corresponds to loudness, while for light waves, it relates to brightness. Conversely, the energy of a wave quantifies its capacity to perform work. In wave dynamics, this energy is typically propagated through the medium in which the wave is traveling.

The relationship between amplitude and energy in wave phenomena is indeed direct, but it is not a straightforward linear correlation. Instead, the energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
E \propto A^2
$$

where $E$ represents energy and $A$ denotes amplitude. This indicates that if the amplitude of a wave is doubled, its energy increases by a factor of four. Similarly, if the amplitude is tripled, the energy increases by a factor of nine, and so forth. This principle is fundamental in wave physics and applies universally to all types of waves, including sound, light, and water waves.

This relationship can be further understood by examining the kinetic and potential energy of the particles in the medium through which the wave propagates. As the amplitude of the wave increases, the maximum displacement of the particles from their equilibrium position also rises. This change results in an increase in both kinetic energy (due to the heightened speed of the particles) and potential energy (due to the greater height or distance the particles are displaced). Consequently, since the total energy of the wave is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the particles, an increase in amplitude leads to an increase in the overall energy of the wave.

In conclusion, grasping the relationship between amplitude and energy in wave phenomena is essential for understanding how waves transfer energy. This understanding is also crucial for analyzing the behavior of waves in various media and for exploring the effects of wave interference and superposition.
