Batteries can bulge after excessive use due to a phenomenon known as outgassing, which involves the accumulation of gases within the battery casing.

Outgassing is particularly common in lithium-ion batteries, which are widely utilized in various electronic devices. This process occurs when a battery is overcharged, overheated, or subjected to excessive usage, leading to the breakdown of the electrolyte inside the battery. As the electrolyte decomposes, it generates gas, resulting in pressure build-up within the sealed casing, ultimately causing the battery to expand or "bulge."

The electrolyte in a battery serves as a medium that facilitates the flow of electrical charge between the cathode and anode. In lithium-ion batteries, the electrolyte typically consists of a mixture of organic solvents and lithium salts. When the battery experiences overcharging or overheating, these solvents may decompose, releasing gases such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, and in some instances, flammable gases like hydrogen.

Battery casings are designed to be airtight to prevent electrolyte leakage; however, they are not built to withstand the pressure that can arise from the gases generated during outgassing. Consequently, the casing may start to expand or "bulge" to accommodate the increased pressure. In severe situations, this pressure build-up can lead to the casing rupturing or even exploding.

It is crucial to recognize that bulging batteries indicate a failing battery and can pose significant safety risks. The gases released during outgassing are not only potentially flammable but can also result in battery failure, leading to a loss of power. Moreover, a bulging battery can inflict physical damage on the device it powers, as the expanding casing may warp or break various components. Therefore, if you observe any signs of a bulging battery, it is advisable to cease using it immediately and dispose of it safely.

In summary, battery bulging is a consequence of outgassing, a process where gases are generated within the battery due to overcharging, overheating, or excessive use. This serves as an indicator of a failing battery and can present safety hazards.
