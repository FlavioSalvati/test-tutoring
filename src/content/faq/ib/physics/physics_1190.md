Astronauts in orbit experience what is commonly referred to as "weightlessness," but this is a result of their continuous free fall towards Earth.

To clarify, the notion of weightlessness in space is often misunderstood. Astronauts are not truly weightless; rather, they appear so because they are perpetually falling towards the Earth. This phenomenon occurs because an orbit is fundamentally a continuous fall towards the planet.

When an object is in orbit, it travels forward at a high speed while simultaneously falling towards the Earth. However, because the Earth is curved, the object keeps missing it. This interplay of forward motion and gravitational pull creates an orbit. Essentially, the object is falling towards the planet but is also moving forward rapidly enough that it never actually collides with it. This is the same scenario for astronauts in spaceâ€”they are in free fall towards the Earth, yet their high forward velocity enables them to avoid hitting the planet.

This ongoing free fall induces a sensation of weightlessness. In a state of free fall, you do not perceive your own weight because gravity is the only force acting upon you, pulling you downward at the same rate as everything else around you. As a result, you do not feel any opposing forces, which is typically what we associate with the sensation of weight.

Consequently, astronauts in orbit appear to be weightless. They are in a persistent state of free fall, which means they do not feel the force of their own weight. It is important to note, however, that gravity is still exerting its influence on them; they simply do not feel it because they are in free fall.

In summary, the sensation of weightlessness experienced by astronauts in space does not arise from the absence of gravity, but rather from their state of continuous free fall. Understanding this concept is crucial for grasping how orbits function and why astronauts seem to defy gravity while in space.
