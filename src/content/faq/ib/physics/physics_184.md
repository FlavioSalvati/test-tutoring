In a closed pipe, waves interact to form standing waves through the superposition of incident and reflected waves.

To elaborate, when a wave is generated within a closed pipe, it travels down the length of the pipe. Upon reaching the closed end, the wave is reflected back. This reflected wave then travels back toward the source and encounters the next incident wave. The interaction between the incident and reflected waves is known as interference. The nature of this interference depends on the phase difference between the two waves. If the waves align in phase, constructive interference occurs, resulting in an increase in amplitude. Conversely, if the waves are out of phase, destructive interference takes place, leading to a decrease in amplitude or potentially complete cancellation of the wave.

The interference of waves in a closed pipe gives rise to standing waves, which are characterized by nodes and antinodes. Nodes are points of total destructive interference, where the displacement of the medium is consistently zero. In contrast, antinodes are points of maximum displacement due to constructive interference. In a closed pipe, there is always a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end.

The fundamental frequency, also known as the first harmonic, occurs when there is a single node-antinode pair along the length of the pipe. This situation arises when the length of the pipe is equal to one-quarter of the wavelength of the wave, expressed mathematically as:

$$ L = \frac{1}{4} \lambda $$

where $L$ is the length of the pipe and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. Higher harmonics, or overtones, occur when multiple node-antinode pairs exist within the pipe. These correspond to frequencies that are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency.

The phenomenon of wave interference in a closed pipe is not only intriguing from a theoretical standpoint but also has practical applications in the realm of music. For instance, the notes produced by wind instruments such as the clarinet or flute are determined by the interference of sound waves within the instrument's pipe.
