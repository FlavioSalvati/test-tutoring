Objects in space can move indefinitely due to the absence of friction and other resistive forces.

This phenomenon is explained by Newton's First Law of Motion, commonly referred to as the Law of Inertia. According to this law, an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving in a straight line at a constant speed, unless acted upon by an external force. On Earth, we frequently observe objects coming to a stop due to forces such as friction and air resistance. However, in the vacuum of space, these forces are nearly nonexistent.

When an object is launched into space and escapes Earth's gravitational influence, it will maintain its straight-line motion at a constant speed. This occurs because there are no significant forces acting to slow it down, alter its direction, or accelerate it. This principle is a direct application of Newton's First Law.

While gravity does play a significant role in space, it does not prevent objects from moving indefinitely. Instead, gravity alters their trajectory. For instance, the Moon does not fall into the Earth because it moves sideways at a sufficient speed. This sideways motion, combined with the gravitational pull of the Earth, results in the Moon continuously "missing" the Earth. This concept perfectly illustrates the nature of an orbit, which we will explore further in our notes on this topic.
