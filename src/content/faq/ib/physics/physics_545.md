A vector in a plane can be represented both graphically as an arrow that indicates direction and magnitude, and numerically as a pair of coordinates.

To elaborate, a vector is a mathematical entity characterized by two key properties: magnitude (length) and direction. In a two-dimensional space, or plane, a vector is often depicted visually as an arrow. The length of this arrow corresponds to the vector's magnitude, while the arrow's orientation indicates its direction. The starting point of the arrow is referred to as the tail, and the endpoint is known as the head.

Alternatively, a vector in a plane can be expressed using a pair of coordinates, commonly in the Cartesian coordinate system. In this system, the first coordinate (the $x$-coordinate) represents the horizontal component of the vector, and the second coordinate (the $y$-coordinate) represents the vertical component. For instance, the vector $(3, 2)$ illustrates a movement of $3$ units to the right and $2$ units upward from the origin.

When graphically representing vectors, it is essential to maintain a consistent scale so that the lengths of the arrows accurately reflect the magnitudes of the vectors. Additionally, the direction of the vector should be clearly indicated, either through the orientation of the arrow or by specifying an angle measurement.

In the field of physics, vectors are employed to represent quantities that possess both magnitude and direction, such as velocity, force, and displacement. Mastering the representation of vectors in a plane is vital for addressing physics problems that involve these quantities. For example, if a force is applied at an angle, the vector representation allows one to decompose the force into its horizontal and vertical components, simplifying the problem-solving process.

In summary, a vector in a plane can be represented either graphically as an arrow that conveys direction and magnitude, or numerically as a pair of coordinates. Both representations offer crucial insights into the vector and can be effectively utilized to tackle problems in physics.
