A Geiger counter, also known as a Geiger-Müller counter, is an instrument designed to detect and measure ionizing radiation. It consists of a gas-filled tube, usually filled with a noble gas such as argon or neon, with a central wire anode. The tube is sealed and features a thin window that permits radiation to enter. Inside the tube, the gas is maintained at low pressure, allowing ionizing particles to pass through.

When ionizing radiation enters the tube, it ionizes the gas atoms by displacing their electrons. This process produces positive ions and free electrons. The free electrons are drawn towards the anode, and as they move closer, they gain energy. If they acquire sufficient energy, they can ionize additional gas atoms, resulting in a cascade of ionization known as a Townsend avalanche. This avalanche generates a significant number of electrons that reach the anode, producing a measurable pulse of current.

The magnitude of the current pulse is independent of the energy of the radiation that initiated it. Consequently, a Geiger counter can effectively measure the count rate of radiation—i.e., the number of detected particles per unit time—but it cannot determine the energy of the radiation. To measure energy, other types of detectors are required.

Geiger counters are widely used for radiation detection due to their affordability, durability, and ease of use. They can detect alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, with the highest sensitivity to beta particles and the lowest sensitivity to gamma rays. The thin window at the end of the tube allows alpha particles to enter; however, it must be handled with care to prevent damage.

In summary, a Geiger counter detects radiation by measuring the current pulse generated when ionizing radiation triggers a Townsend avalanche within a gas-filled tube. It serves as a straightforward and efficient tool for assessing the presence and intensity of radiation, but it does not provide information about the energy of the radiation detected.
