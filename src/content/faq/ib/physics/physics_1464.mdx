In simple harmonic motion (SHM), energy continuously transforms between potential energy and kinetic energy.

In SHM, the total energy of the system remains constant; however, it oscillates between kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion, and potential energy, which is the energy stored in the system due to its position or state. This oscillatory behavior is fundamental to the nature of SHM.

When the object reaches its maximum displacement from the equilibrium position—whether at the peak of a swing or the extreme of an oscillation—the velocity of the object is zero. Consequently, the kinetic energy at this point is also zero. In contrast, the potential energy is at its maximum since the object is farthest from its equilibrium position. As the object moves back toward the equilibrium position, the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases, resulting in the transformation of potential energy into kinetic energy.

At the equilibrium position, the object attains its maximum velocity, which means the kinetic energy is at its peak. At this moment, the potential energy is zero because the object is precisely at its equilibrium point. As the object continues to move beyond the equilibrium position, the kinetic energy begins to decrease, and the potential energy increases again. This marks a reverse transformation, with kinetic energy converting back into potential energy.

The continuous interchange between potential and kinetic energy is what fuels the oscillation in SHM. The rate of these energy transformations is influenced by the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation; higher frequencies and larger amplitudes lead to more rapid energy transformations.

In summary, in simple harmonic motion, the energy within the system is perpetually shifting between kinetic and potential forms. This dynamic transformation drives the oscillation, with potential energy reaching its maximum at the extremes of the motion and kinetic energy peaking at the equilibrium position. The speed of these transformations is contingent upon the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation.
