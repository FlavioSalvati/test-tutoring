Centripetal acceleration arises from the interplay of the radius of a circular path and the speed of an object moving along that path. The mathematical expression for centripetal acceleration is given by the formula:

$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

where $a$ represents the centripetal acceleration, $v$ is the speed of the object, and $r$ is the radius of the circular path. 

Centripetal acceleration is a unique form of acceleration that occurs when an object travels in a circular trajectory. It is always directed toward the center of the circle and arises due to the continuous change in the direction of the object's velocity. The term 'centripetal' is derived from the Latin words 'centrum,' meaning 'center,' and 'petere,' meaning 'to seek,' which aptly describes the inward direction of this acceleration.

To delve deeper into this concept, consider an object moving along a circular path at a constant speed. Although the object's speed remains constant, its velocity is constantly changing due to the continuous change in direction. This variation in velocity produces an acceleration directed toward the circle's center.

To quantify this acceleration, we can analyze the change in velocity as the object moves a small distance along the circle. When the object moves from one point to another on the circular path, the change in velocity can be defined as the difference between the initial and final velocities. Dividing this change in velocity by the time interval over which the movement occurs provides the acceleration.

However, since the object is in circular motion, we can also relate the change in velocity to the change in the object's position on the circle, which depends on both the radius and the angle through which the object moves. By integrating these relationships, we derive the formula for centripetal acceleration:

$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

This formula indicates that centripetal acceleration is directly proportional to the square of the object's speed and inversely proportional to the radius of the circular path. Consequently, if the speed of the object doubles, the centripetal acceleration increases by a factor of four, whereas if the radius doubles, the centripetal acceleration is halved.
