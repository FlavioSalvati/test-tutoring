The charge-discharge cycle plays a significant role in determining the lifespan of a battery, as each cycle gradually diminishes the battery's capacity.

The charge-discharge cycle refers to the process of charging a battery and subsequently discharging it to power a device. This cycle is essential for assessing a battery's longevity. With each completed charge-discharge cycle, the battery experiences a slight reduction in its overall capacity. This decline is a result of the chemical reactions that occur within the battery during both charging and discharging.

When a battery is charged, energy is stored via a chemical reaction. This stored energy is released when the battery discharges, powering the connected device. However, each time this cycle is repeated, the efficiency of these chemical reactions diminishes slightly. This inefficiency arises because the materials inside the battery degrade over time, diminishing their ability to store and release energy. Such degradation is an inherent consequence of the chemical processes and cannot be entirely avoided.

The rate at which a battery's capacity declines per cycle depends on the battery type and its usage. For instance, lithium-ion batteries, commonly found in smartphones and laptops, typically lose approximately $20\%$ of their capacity after $1000$ charge-discharge cycles. However, if a battery is often discharged completely before being recharged, it may experience a more rapid loss of capacity. This phenomenon, known as deep discharge, can be particularly detrimental to a battery's overall lifespan.

Conversely, if a battery is only partially discharged before recharging, it generally endures more charge-discharge cycles. Partial discharges impose less stress on the battery's materials compared to deep discharges. Nevertheless, even with partial discharges, a battery will still gradually lose capacity over time.

In summary, the charge-discharge cycle is a critical factor influencing a battery's lifespan. Each cycle results in a minor decrease in the battery's capacity, and this cumulative effect over time ultimately necessitates battery replacement. Therefore, comprehending the charge-discharge cycle and its impact on battery life is essential for maximizing the longevity of your devices.
