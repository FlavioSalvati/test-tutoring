The frequency of a wave plays a crucial role in determining its penetration depth, primarily by influencing its absorption and attenuation within a medium.

To elaborate, the penetration depth of a wave refers to the distance it can travel into a medium before its intensity diminishes significantly. This depth is predominantly influenced by the frequency of the wave and the intrinsic properties of the medium it traverses. Generally, waves with higher frequencies carry more energy, making them more susceptible to absorption by the medium, which consequently decreases their penetration depth.

This phenomenon occurs because higher frequency waves possess shorter wavelengths. When a wave encounters a medium, it interacts with the particles within that medium. A wave with a shorter wavelength (higher frequency) will engage with more particles over a given distance, resulting in increased absorption and reduced penetration.

This principle is observable in various fields of physics. For instance, higher frequency waves, such as X-rays and gamma rays, can penetrate materials that lower frequency waves, like visible light and radio waves, cannot. The enhanced energy of higher frequency waves enables them to overcome the material's absorption more effectively.

Similarly, in the realm of acoustics, lower frequency sound waves can penetrate materials more deeply than higher frequency sound waves. This explains why you can hear bass sounds from loud music even from a considerable distance or behind barriers; the low frequency sound waves are capable of penetrating walls and traveling farther.

Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that the relationship between frequency and penetration depth is not always straightforward. The properties of the medium, such as its density and composition, significantly influence this relationship. Some materials exhibit 'resonant frequencies' at which they absorb energy more efficiently, further decreasing the penetration depth at those specific frequencies.

In summary, a wave's penetration depth tends to decrease as its frequency increases. Higher frequency waves carry more energy and are absorbed more readily by the materials they pass through, limiting their travel distance. However, the characteristics of the material also play a vital role in determining how deeply a wave can penetrate, including specific frequencies where a material may absorb energy more effectively.
