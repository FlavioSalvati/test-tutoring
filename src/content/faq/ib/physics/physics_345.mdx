Certain elements beyond uranium are created artificially because they do not occur naturally on Earth due to their inherent instability.

The elements that exist beyond uranium are collectively referred to as transuranium elements. These elements are not found in nature primarily because they possess a high degree of instability, which results in very short half-lives—the time required for half of the atoms in a sample to decay. Consequently, even if these elements were produced naturally, they would decay into lighter elements before we could detect them.

The synthesis of transuranium elements occurs in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, which provide the necessary conditions for atomic nuclei to combine and form heavier elements. This process is known as nuclear fusion. In the context of a particle accelerator, ions—atoms or molecules that carry a net electric charge due to the loss or gain of one or more electrons—are accelerated to high velocities and subsequently collided with a target material. The energy generated from these collisions can overcome the repulsive forces between atomic nuclei, allowing them to merge and create a heavier element.

The first artificially created element was neptunium, synthesized in 1940 by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Since that groundbreaking achievement, scientists have successfully created even heavier elements, with the most recent additions to the periodic table being elements 113 through 118, which were officially named in 2016.

The creation of these elements extends beyond mere scientific curiosity; it has practical applications as well. For instance, plutonium-239, a transuranium element, is utilized as fuel in nuclear reactors and in the production of nuclear weapons. Other artificially created elements have specific uses: americium-241 is found in smoke detectors, while californium-252 is employed in cancer treatment.

In summary, the synthesis of elements beyond uranium represents a captivating field of research that intertwines fundamental physics with practical applications. It enhances our understanding of the universe and the nature of matter while providing valuable materials for a variety of uses.
