Waves refract at different angles due to variations in the speed of the wave as it transitions between media, which alters both its direction and wavelength.

Refraction is a fundamental principle in wave theory that describes how the direction of a wave changes when it moves from one medium to another. The underlying principle of this phenomenon is that waves travel at different speeds depending on the medium they are in. When a wave encounters a new medium, its speed changes, which consequently affects its direction and wavelength.

The angle of refraction, defined as the direction in which the wave bends, is determined by Snell's Law. This law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence ($\theta_1$) to the sine of the angle of refraction ($\theta_2$) is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the wave in the two different media ($v_1$ and $v_2$):

$$
\frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\sin(\theta_2)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}
$$

In simpler terms, the angle at which the wave enters the new medium (the angle of incidence) and the speeds of the wave in both media will determine the angle at which the wave refracts.

The change in the wave's speed is influenced by the properties of the medium. For instance, light waves travel faster in air than they do in water or glass. Therefore, when a light wave passes from air into water or glass, it experiences a reduction in speed, resulting in refraction or bending. The extent of this bending, or the angle of refraction, varies depending on the characteristics of the medium.

Additionally, the wavelength of the wave changes as it enters a new medium. This change occurs because the speed of the wave and its wavelength are directly related. As the wave's speed decreases, its wavelength also shortens. This alteration in wavelength contributes to the change in direction of the wave, leading to refraction.

In summary, the refraction of waves at different angles arises from changes in both the speed and wavelength of the wave as it transitions between media. This phenomenon is governed by the properties of the medium and the angle at which the wave enters the new medium.
