Newton's First Law of Motion asserts that an object will remain either at rest or in uniform motion along a straight path unless acted upon by a net external force. 

This principle, often referred to as the law of inertia, is foundational in our comprehension of motion. Essentially, it states that if the net force acting on an object is zero, the object will continue in its current state of motion. This could mean that the object is either stationary or moving in a straight line at a constant speed. The term 'net force' refers to the vector sum of all forces applied to the object. Therefore, when the net force equals zero, there will be no change in the object's motion.

The concept of 'inertia' is central to this law. Inertia is the inherent property of an object that opposes changes in its motion. An object with greater mass possesses more inertia, meaning more force is required to alter its motion. This explains why it is significantly more challenging to push a heavy car compared to a bicycle.

Additionally, this law highlights that motion is relative. For example, if you are in a car traveling at a constant speed, you may not perceive any forces acting on you. You can toss a ball into the air, and it will fall back down to your hand, just as it would if the car were stationary. This phenomenon occurs because there is no net force acting on you or the ball during that time.

Newton's First Law of Motion is a cornerstone of classical physics. It elucidates the relationship between forces and motion and serves as the foundation for the subsequent two laws of motion. This straightforward yet powerful law governs the motion of objects, influencing our daily experiences and the broader workings of the universe.
