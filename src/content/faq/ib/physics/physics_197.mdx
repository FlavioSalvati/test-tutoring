The direction of an electric field is dictated by the nature of the source charge that generates it.

To elaborate, an electric field is a region surrounding a charged particle where it can exert a force on other charged particles. By convention in physics, the direction of the electric field is oriented away from positively charged particles and towards negatively charged particles. This convention is used to represent the direction in which a positive test charge would move if it were placed within the field.

Electric field lines are used to illustrate both the strength and direction of the electric field. The density of these lines indicates the strength of the electric field at a given point: the closer the lines are together, the stronger the electric field. The direction of the electric field is represented by the orientation of these lines. For a positive charge, electric field lines radiate outward, suggesting that a positive test charge would be repelled away from the source charge. Conversely, for a negative charge, the field lines converge inward, indicating that a positive test charge would be attracted toward the negative charge.

It is crucial to understand that the electric field exists independently of a test charge; it is an inherent property of the charged object that creates it. The direction of the electric field at any point in space reflects the direction of the electric force that would act on a positive test charge placed at that location.

In summary, the direction of an electric field is determined by the charge of the source particle: it points away from positive charges and towards negative charges, illustrating the force that a positive test charge would experience in the field.
