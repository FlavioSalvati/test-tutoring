Waves exhibit a phenomenon known as diffraction when they pass through a slit, causing them to spread out.

Diffraction is a fundamental property of various types of waves, including light, sound, and water waves. It describes the behavior of waves as they encounter obstacles or pass through openings, such as a slit. The extent of diffraction depends on the relationship between the size of the slit and the wavelength of the wave. If the slit is significantly larger than the wavelength, the wave will experience minimal spreading. Conversely, if the slit is comparable to or smaller than the wavelength, the wave will spread out considerably.

The underlying principle of diffraction is explained by Huygens' Principle, which posits that every point on a wavefront serves as a source of secondary wavelets. These wavelets propagate in all directions at the same speed as the original wave. When a wave encounters a slit, the wavefront is effectively reduced to the width of the slit. The points along this narrow wavefront subsequently act as sources of new waves, which radiate outward in a semi-circular or semi-spherical pattern, depending on whether the wave is two-dimensional or three-dimensional.

The resulting pattern of the diffracted wave can be analyzed using the principle of superposition. This principle states that the total displacement of the wave at any given point is the sum of the displacements of the individual waves. This interaction can lead to constructive or destructive interference, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark fringes for light waves, or regions of loud and quiet sound for sound waves.

Understanding diffraction is essential in numerous fields of physics and engineering, including the design of optical and audio equipment, the exploration of wave behavior in natural phenomena, and even the detection of distant celestial bodies in astronomy. It serves as a compelling illustration of the wave nature of light and sound, making it a key topic in the IB Physics curriculum.
