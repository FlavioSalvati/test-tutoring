Waves exhibit a behavior known as diffraction when they pass through a narrow slit, causing them to spread out.

Diffraction is a fundamental property of various types of waves, including light, sound, and water waves. It refers to the bending and spreading of waves as they encounter obstacles or pass through narrow openings, such as slits. This effect becomes particularly prominent when the dimensions of the obstacle or opening are similar to the wavelength of the wave.

The underlying principle of diffraction can be understood through Huygens' Principle, which posits that every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets. These wavelets propagate in all directions, and the new wavefront is formed as the envelope of these wavelets. When a wave traverses a narrow slit, its wavefront becomes confined to the width of the slit. According to Huygens' Principle, each point along this narrow wavefront generates secondary wavelets that spread out in every direction. Consequently, the wave diffracts as it passes through the slit.

The extent of diffraction, or the degree of spreading, is influenced by both the wavelength of the wave and the width of the slit. If the slit width is significantly larger than the wavelength, the diffraction will be minimal, and the wave will propagate in a straight line. Conversely, if the slit width is comparable to or smaller than the wavelength, substantial diffraction occurs, resulting in significant spreading of the wave.

This phenomenon is not limited to physical waves such as sound and water waves; it is also observable in light waves. This explains the appearance of alternating light and dark bands—known as interference patterns—when light passes through a narrow slit. Understanding this principle is essential in the study of wave optics, and it has a wide range of applications in fields such as astronomy, telecommunications, and medical imaging.
