The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant, provided that no external forces act upon it.

More specifically, the law of conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that arises from Newton's third law of motion. This law asserts that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the context of momentum, this implies that the total momentum before an event must equal the total momentum after the event, assuming no external forces are at play.

Momentum, represented by the symbol $p$, is a vector quantity defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. In a closed system, the total momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of all individual objects within that system. For instance, if two objects collide, the total momentum before the collision will equal the total momentum after the collision. This principle holds true for both elastic and inelastic collisions.

The law of conservation of momentum is applicable in various scenarios in physics, such as collisions, explosions, and particle interactions. It also plays a vital role in fields like fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativistic mechanics.

To illustrate this concept, consider a game of pool. When the cue ball strikes another ball, the total momentum of the two balls before the collision (the moving cue ball and the stationary target ball) is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This principle explains why the balls move away from each other post-collision.

In summary, the law of conservation of momentum is a foundational concept in physics that describes the constancy of total momentum in a closed system, provided that no external forces are acting on it. It directly follows from Newton's third law of motion and is relevant across a wide array of physical phenomena.
