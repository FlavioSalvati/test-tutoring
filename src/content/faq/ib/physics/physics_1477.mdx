At the extremes of motion in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), the object's velocity is zero, and its potential energy is at its maximum.

In SHM, the motion of the object is sinusoidal over time and exhibits a single resonant frequency. The extremes of motion, referred to as the amplitude, represent the furthest distances from the equilibrium position that the object achieves. At these points, the object momentarily halts before reversing its direction. This is due to the fact that the object's velocity is zero at the extremes of its motion.

Additionally, the potential energy of the object reaches its maximum at these extreme points. This phenomenon occurs because potential energy and kinetic energy are inversely related in SHM. When the object is at the equilibrium position, its velocity—and consequently its kinetic energy—is at its maximum. Conversely, when the object is at the extremes, its velocity (and thus kinetic energy) is zero, resulting in maximum potential energy.

The interplay between velocity, potential energy, and position in SHM is a fundamental characteristic of this type of motion. It is crucial to recognize that both velocity and potential energy fluctuate continuously as the object oscillates back and forth. However, the total energy of the system, which is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy, remains constant. This constancy is a direct consequence of the principle of conservation of energy.

In summary, at the extremes of motion in SHM, the object comes to a momentary stop, and its potential energy reaches a peak. This behavior is a direct result of the sinusoidal nature of the motion and the conservation of energy principle. A thorough understanding of these concepts is essential for a comprehensive grasp of SHM and its applications in physics.
