Waves undergo a phase change during reflection due to the reversal of their propagation direction. This phenomenon is intricately linked to the principles of reflection, which govern the behavior of waves as they encounter a boundary.

When a wave is reflected, its direction of propagation is altered. This alteration leads to a phase change in the wave. The phase of a wave indicates its position within a cycle of motion and is typically measured in degrees or radians. Upon reflection, the wave effectively 'turns around' and begins to propagate in the opposite direction. This reversal corresponds to a phase change of $180$ degrees or $\pi$ radians.
