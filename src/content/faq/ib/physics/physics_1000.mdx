Rechargeable batteries gradually lose capacity over time due to chemical reactions that degrade their components.

For instance, lithium-ion batteries operate through a series of charge and discharge cycles. During the charging phase, lithium ions migrate from the positive electrode to the negative electrode via an electrolyte. Conversely, during the discharge phase, these ions return to the positive electrode, releasing energy in the process. However, this cycle is not perfectly efficient; with each iteration, a small quantity of lithium ions fails to complete the return journey, leading to a reduction in the overall capacity of the battery.

The decline in battery capacity, commonly referred to as battery wear, is primarily driven by two chemical processes: the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and lithium plating. The SEI layer is a protective film that develops on the surface of the negative electrode during the initial charge cycles. While this layer stabilizes the battery, it also consumes lithium ions, thereby decreasing the number of ions available for energy storage. Over time, as the SEI layer thickens, it consumes an even greater amount of lithium ions, further diminishing the battery's capacity.

Lithium plating is another significant contributor to battery wear. This phenomenon occurs when lithium ions deposit onto the negative electrode during charging, forming a metallic layer of lithium. This issue is especially pronounced when the battery is charged rapidly or at low temperatures. Similar to the SEI layer, lithium plating consumes lithium ions, exacerbating the loss of capacity.

In addition to these chemical processes, various physical factors can also accelerate battery wear. For example, elevated temperatures can hasten chemical reactions, resulting in quicker degradation. Furthermore, overcharging or excessively discharging a battery can inflict physical damage on its components, leading to a reduction in capacity.

In summary, the loss of capacity in rechargeable batteries is a multifaceted issue involving both chemical reactions and physical influences. While some degree of wear is unavoidable, a deeper understanding of these processes can aid in the development of strategies to prolong the lifespan of rechargeable batteries.
