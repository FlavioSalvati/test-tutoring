Power and voltage in electrical transmission are closely related, as power is defined as the product of voltage and current in accordance with Ohm's Law.

More specifically, the power $ P $ in an electrical system can be represented by the equation:

$$
P = V \times I
$$

where $ V $ denotes voltage and $ I $ denotes current. This equation illustrates that if either the voltage or the current increases while the other remains constant, the overall power will also increase. Conversely, a decrease in either voltage or current, while keeping the other constant, will lead to a decrease in power.

In the context of power transmission, high voltage is employed to transmit electricity over long distances. This approach is advantageous because, for a given amount of power, a higher voltage allows for a lower current, as derived from the formula $ P = V \times I $. Maintaining lower current levels is desirable in power transmission since it helps to minimize power loss due to resistance in the transmission lines. The power loss $ P_{\text{loss}} $ can be expressed by the formula:

$$
P_{\text{loss}} = I^2 \times R
$$

where $ R $ represents the resistance of the transmission lines. This highlights that power loss increases with the square of the current. Therefore, by utilizing high voltage, the current can be kept low, effectively reducing power losses.

However, it is important to note that high voltage also introduces safety concerns and necessitates more robust insulation. To manage these issues, transformers are employed at both ends of the transmission line. These transformers serve two critical functions: they step up the voltage for transmission and step it down for safe usage. This is why you often encounter large transformer stations near power plants and smaller transformers in residential areas.

In summary, the relationship between power and voltage in transmission is fundamental to achieving efficient and safe power distribution. Understanding this relationship is essential for optimizing electrical systems.
