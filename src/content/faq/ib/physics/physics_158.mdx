The fundamental frequency is defined as the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform, while harmonics are integer multiples of this fundamental frequency.

More specifically, every periodic waveform, such as a musical note or a radio signal, can be characterized by its fundamental frequency and its harmonics. The fundamental frequency, often referred to as the first harmonic, represents the lowest frequency component of the waveform. It is the frequency at which the entire wave vibrates, making it the most prominent frequency that we perceive as the pitch of the sound.

Conversely, harmonics are frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. For instance, if the fundamental frequency is denoted by $f$, the second harmonic would be $2f$, the third harmonic would be $3f$, and so on. These harmonics play a vital role in shaping the timbre or quality of the sound, enabling us to differentiate between various musical instruments playing the same note.

The interplay between the fundamental frequency and harmonics is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, particularly within the realms of acoustics, signal processing, and telecommunications. This relationship is grounded in the principle of superposition, which asserts that the total vibration at any point is the sum of the vibrations produced by the individual waves.

In the musical context, the combination of the fundamental frequency and its harmonics gives rise to what is known as the harmonic series. This series is responsible for the richness and complexity found in musical sounds. When a musician plays a note, they do not produce just a single frequency; instead, they generate a complete series of frequencies comprising the fundamental and its harmonics. The relative intensities of these frequencies determine the overall character and uniqueness of the sound.

In summary, the fundamental frequency and harmonics are intrinsically connected. The fundamental frequency serves as the foundation upon which the harmonics are built, and together they generate the complex waveforms we encounter in our daily lives. Grasping this relationship is essential for understanding the physics of waves and vibrations.
