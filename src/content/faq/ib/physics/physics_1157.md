Mass has a direct impact on the gravitational attraction between objects; specifically, the larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull.

To elaborate, the gravitational attraction between two objects is governed by the universal law of gravitation, which was articulated by Sir Isaac Newton. This law asserts that every particle of matter in the universe exerts an attractive force on every other particle. This force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship can be succinctly expressed with the formula:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the gravitational force between the objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, $r$ is the distance between the centers of the objects, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.

This means that if the mass of either object increases, the gravitational attraction between them will also increase. For instance, if you were to double the mass of one object, the gravitational force between the two would also double. Likewise, if you were to double the masses of both objects, the gravitational force would quadruple. This illustrates the direct proportionality between mass and gravitational force.

However, it is essential to recognize that while mass significantly influences the strength of gravitational force, the effects of this force are not always readily apparent. This is largely due to the fact that the gravitational constant $G$ is exceedingly small, making the gravitational force between small masses or distant objects quite minimal. For example, the gravitational force between two $1 \, \text{kg}$ objects that are $1 \, \text{m}$ apart is approximately $6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N}$, a force that is virtually imperceptible.

In conclusion, mass is a critical factor in determining the strength of gravitational attraction between objects. The greater the mass of the objects, the stronger the gravitational pull they exert on one another. Nevertheless, due to the small magnitude of the gravitational constant, the effects of this force are often negligible unless the masses involved are substantial, such as those of planets or stars.
