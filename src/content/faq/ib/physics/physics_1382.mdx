Research on fusion as an energy source is primarily centered on developing it into a viable and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

Fusion energy, the same process that powers the sun and other stars, is being explored as a potential source of safe, carbon-free, and virtually limitless energy. The primary challenge is to create and sustain the conditions necessary for fusion to occur, which involve extremely high temperatures and pressures.

One of the most promising and extensively studied approaches to achieving these conditions is through a device known as a tokamak. This doughnut-shaped machine utilizes magnetic fields to confine and control the hot plasma where fusion takes place. The largest and most advanced tokamak currently under construction is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. This international collaboration, involving 35 countries, aims to demonstrate that fusion can be achieved at a scale and in a format that is replicable for commercial power generation.

Another method under investigation is inertial confinement fusion (ICF), which uses high-energy lasers to compress and heat small pellets of fusion fuel. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the United States is the leading research facility for this approach.

In addition to these large-scale projects, several smaller private companies are exploring alternative methods. For instance, Tri Alpha Energy is developing a field-reversed configuration (FRC), a plasma confinement method where the plasma itself generates the magnetic field. Another company, First Light Fusion, is researching a technique known as projectile fusion, which involves using a high-speed projectile to compress and heat the fusion fuel.

Beyond the technical challenges, researchers are also examining the materials that could be employed in a fusion reactor. These materials must endure the extreme conditions present within the reactor and should not become radioactive themselves.

Finally, ongoing research is being conducted on the fusion fuels. The most commonly proposed fuel is a mixture of two isotopes of hydrogen: deuterium, which can be extracted from seawater, and tritium, which can be produced from lithium. However, other potential fuels, such as helium-3 or boron, are also being explored.
