In Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position, yet it acts in the opposite direction. To fully understand SHM, it is crucial to recognize that this type of periodic motion involves a restoring force that consistently acts towards the equilibrium position, opposing any displacement.

More specifically, Simple Harmonic Motion can be described by the relationship where the restoring force $F$ is directly proportional to the displacement $x$. This relationship is mathematically expressed by the equation:

$$
F = -kx
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the restoring force, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The negative sign in the equation denotes that the force is always directed towards the equilibrium position, counteracting the displacement.

Additionally, according to Newton's second law of motion, the force can also be expressed as the product of mass and acceleration, which is represented by the equation:

$$
F = ma
$$

By equating the two expressions for force, we arrive at the equation:

$$
ma = -kx
$$

Rearranging this equation to solve for acceleration yields:

$$
a = -\frac{k}{m} x
$$

This equation illustrates that the acceleration $a$ in SHM is directly proportional to the displacement $x$, but in the opposite direction, as indicated by the negative sign.

Further exploration of this concept enhances our understanding of how displacement and acceleration interact within the framework of SHM. When the object reaches its maximum displacement—whether positive or negative—the acceleration is also at its peak but directed oppositely. This occurs because the object experiences the greatest restoring force pulling it back toward the equilibrium position. Conversely, when the object is at the equilibrium position, the acceleration is zero since there is no restoring force acting on it.

In summary, in Simple Harmonic Motion, the acceleration of the object is always directed toward the equilibrium position, and its magnitude is proportional to the displacement from that position. This fundamental relationship underpins the oscillatory nature of SHM and is essential for understanding the dynamics of systems that exhibit such motion.
