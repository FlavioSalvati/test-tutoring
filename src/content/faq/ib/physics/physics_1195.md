Discrete energy in atomic physics refers to the specific, quantized energy levels that electrons can occupy within an atom.

In greater detail, the concept of discrete energy is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, which is the branch of physics that focuses on phenomena occurring at very small scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. According to quantum mechanics, the energy of an electron within an atom is quantized, which means it can only assume certain specific values. These values correspond to different energy levels or "shells" within the atom. For a more comprehensive understanding of these ideas, further exploration of quantum mechanics is recommended.

This notion marks a significant departure from classical physics, which posits that electrons should be able to exist at any energy level. However, experiments such as the photoelectric effect and atomic emission spectra have provided compelling evidence for the existence of discrete energy levels. For instance, when atoms are heated or otherwise excited, they emit light at specific wavelengths. These wavelengths correspond to the energy differences between the discrete levels, acting as a unique "fingerprint" for each type of atom. The atomic emission spectrum is a classic experiment that supports the quantization of energy.

The concept of discrete energy also elucidates the stability of atoms. According to classical physics, electrons orbiting the nucleus are expected to continuously lose energy and spiral into the nucleus, leading to the collapse of the atom. In contrast, quantum mechanics asserts that an electron in a defined energy level is stable and will not lose energy unless disturbed.

Energy levels are often represented as concentric circles around the nucleus in diagrams, but it is essential to recognize that this is a simplification. In reality, these energy levels correspond to various shapes of electron clouds, known as "orbitals," which are regions of space where an electron is likely to be found. These orbitals exhibit different shapes and orientations depending on the energy level and other quantum numbers. The diversity of these orbitals, encountered in physics, further illustrates the myriad ways energy can manifest.

In summary, discrete energy in atomic physics pertains to the specific, quantized energy levels that electrons can occupy within an atom. This concept is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and is supported by experimental evidence. A more advanced understanding of how these energy levels contribute to the Bohr model can be achieved by studying quantum mechanics in depth.
