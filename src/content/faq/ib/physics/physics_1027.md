When connecting batteries, the configuration—series or parallel—affects voltage and capacity in distinct ways, which in turn impacts battery life.

In a **series connection**, batteries are linked end-to-end. This arrangement increases the total voltage while keeping the capacity (measured in ampere-hours) constant. As a result, the device operates at a higher voltage, but the overall battery life does not extend. For example, if two $1.5\, \text{V}$ AA batteries are connected in series, the total voltage becomes $3\, \text{V}$, while the capacity remains equivalent to that of a single battery. In a series circuit, the current—correlated with capacity—remains the same throughout. Thus, the battery life in a series configuration is determined by the individual battery with the lowest capacity.

Conversely, in a **parallel connection**, batteries are connected side by side. This setup increases the total capacity while maintaining the same voltage. Consequently, the device operates at the same voltage, but the overall battery life is extended. For instance, if two $1.5\, \text{V}$ AA batteries are connected in parallel, the total voltage remains $1.5\, \text{V}$, while the total capacity is the sum of the capacities of the two batteries. In a parallel circuit, all components share the same voltage, which means the total battery life is determined by the combined capacity of all the batteries.

While connecting batteries in parallel can theoretically enhance battery life, it is crucial to ensure that the batteries are identical in terms of voltage, capacity, and internal resistance. Differences among batteries can lead to one battery discharging into another, potentially causing overheating and failure. Therefore, it is advisable to use batteries of the same type and specifications when connecting in parallel to ensure both safety and efficiency.

In summary, the choice between series and parallel connections significantly influences battery life based on whether you aim to increase voltage or capacity. Series connections are advantageous when a higher operating voltage is required, while parallel connections can prolong battery life by augmenting capacity. However, caution is necessary when connecting batteries in parallel to mitigate potential issues.
