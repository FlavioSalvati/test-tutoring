The period of an oscillation refers to the duration required for one complete cycle, while frequency indicates the number of cycles that occur within a specified unit of time.

In the realm of oscillations, period and frequency are two essential concepts that are interrelated yet distinctly different. The period, commonly represented by the symbol $T$, is the time taken for a single complete cycle of oscillation. For instance, this could be the time it takes for a pendulum to swing back and forth once or the duration for a wave to traverse one full wavelength. The period is measured in time units, such as seconds.

Conversely, frequency, denoted by the symbol $f$, quantifies the number of cycles of oscillation that take place in a given time frame. In essence, frequency reflects how frequently the oscillation repeats itself within a specified period. The unit of frequency is Hertz (Hz), where $1 \text{ Hz} = 1 \text{ cycle per second}$.

Despite their differences, period and frequency are inversely related. This means that as the frequency of an oscillation increases, the period decreases, and vice versa. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T} \quad \text{or} \quad T = \frac{1}{f}.
$$

Comprehending the distinction between period and frequency is vital in various branches of physics. For example, in wave mechanics, the frequency of a wave is directly related to its energy, with higher frequencies corresponding to greater energy levels. Additionally, the period of a wave correlates with its wavelength, where longer periods are associated with longer wavelengths. Similarly, in the analysis of simple harmonic motion, such as the oscillation of a spring or a pendulum, the period and frequency provide critical insights into the system's characteristics, including parameters like stiffness or length.
