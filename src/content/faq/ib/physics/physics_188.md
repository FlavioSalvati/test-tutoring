Waves undergo refraction at the interface between two different media, resulting in a change of direction due to a variation in wave speed.

When a wave transitions from one medium to another, its speed alters, which in turn causes the wave to change its trajectory. This phenomenon is referred to as refraction. The extent of refraction, or the degree to which the wave's direction alters, is influenced by the difference in wave speed in the two media.

To illustrate this concept, consider a wave traveling from a medium where it moves quickly, such as air, into a medium where it moves more slowly, like water. Upon reaching the boundary between these two media, the portion of the wave that first enters the water slows down while the remainder continues at its original speed. This differential speed causes the wave to bend toward the normal line, which is defined as a line perpendicular to the boundary at the point of incidence.

The change in direction can be quantitatively described using Snell's Law. This law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence ($i$) to the sine of the angle of refraction ($r$) is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the wave in the two media. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

$$ 
\frac{\sin(i)}{\sin(r)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} 
$$

Here, $v_1$ is the velocity of the wave in the initial medium, while $v_2$ is the velocity in the second medium.

Refraction is a fundamental principle in physics, underpinning numerous natural phenomena and technological applications. For instance, it explains why objects appear displaced when viewed through water, how rainbows form, and the functioning of lenses in glasses and cameras. A thorough understanding of refraction and its dependence on the properties of different media is essential across various fields of physics, including optics and wave theory.
