The amplitude of an oscillating system does not influence the period in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), as the period is determined solely by the mass of the object and the strength of the restoring force.

In SHM, the period is defined as the time required for the system to complete one full cycle of motion. This period is a characteristic of the system's properties, specifically the mass of the moving object and the intensity of the restoring force. The restoring force is the force that acts to return the object to its equilibrium position. In SHM, this force is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position; however, it remains independent of the amplitude of the motion.

The amplitude represents the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position and serves as an indicator of the system's energy. Despite its significance in defining the energy levels, the amplitude does not influence the time taken for the object to complete a full cycle. This lack of effect arises because the increase in energy associated with a larger amplitude is counterbalanced by an increase in the object's speed. As the object moves further from the equilibrium position, both the restoring force and the resulting acceleration increase, causing the object to move faster. Consequently, although the object has a greater distance to cover with larger amplitudes, it also travels at a higher speed, ensuring that the time for one complete cycle remains unchanged.

This principle is a fundamental characteristic of SHM, distinguishing it from other forms of oscillatory motion. In contrast, certain types of motion exhibit a dependence of the period on the amplitude. For instance, in the case of a pendulum, if the amplitude is large (i.e., the pendulum is released from a significant angle), the period will be slightly longer compared to when the amplitude is small. This deviation occurs because the restoring force is not strictly proportional to the displacement in these cases, unlike in SHM. However, for small amplitudes, the period of a pendulum can be approximated as independent of the amplitude, making its motion resemble that of SHM.

In summary, the amplitude does not influence the period in SHM since the period is governed by the mass and restoring force, rather than the system's energy. The increase in speed that accompanies a larger amplitude effectively balances the greater distance to be traveled, resulting in a constant period.
