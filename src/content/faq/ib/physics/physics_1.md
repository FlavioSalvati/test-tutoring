The uncertainty associated with a measurement is influenced by both the precision of the measuring instrument and potential human error.

More specifically, the uncertainty of a measurement represents a range within which the true value is expected to fall. It reflects the level of confidence a scientist has in the measurement results. There are two primary types of uncertainties that can impact a measurement: systematic and random uncertainties.

**Systematic uncertainties** are consistent and predictable errors typically caused by the measuring instrument itself. For instance, if a ruler is slightly bent or a stopwatch is consistently slow, these would introduce systematic uncertainties. Fortunately, these errors can often be corrected through calibration of the instrument.

In contrast, **random uncertainties** are unpredictable and arise from factors that are challenging to control. These may include human errors in reading an instrument or natural variations in the quantity being measured. Random uncertainties can be minimized by taking multiple measurements and calculating an average.

To determine the uncertainty of a measurement, begin by assessing the precision of the measuring instrument. This precision is generally indicated by the smallest division on the instrument's scale. For example, if you are using a ruler with divisions in millimeters, the precision of your measurement would be Â±$0.5 \, \text{mm}$.

Next, consider potential sources of human error. This might involve uncertainties in reading the scale or inconsistencies in how the measurement is conducted. For instance, when timing an event with a stopwatch, your reaction time in starting and stopping the watch can introduce uncertainty.

If you take multiple measurements, you can also compute the standard deviation of your results. The standard deviation provides insight into the variability of your measurements and can serve as a useful estimate of the uncertainty.

Always remember to report your measurements alongside their associated uncertainties. This practice ensures a comprehensive understanding of the reliability of your results.
