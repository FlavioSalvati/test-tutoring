In a pendulum, energy continuously transforms between potential energy and kinetic energy as it swings back and forth. 

This transformation serves as a classic illustration of the conservation of mechanical energy principle. According to this principle, the total mechanical energy in a closed system remains constant, provided there are no external forces, such as friction or air resistance, acting on it. In the case of a pendulum, the two forms of mechanical energy at play are potential energy and kinetic energy.

When the pendulum reaches the highest point of its swing, it possesses maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. This occurs because it is at its highest elevation above the ground and is momentarily stationary. The gravitational potential energy ($PE$) can be calculated using the formula:

$$
PE = mgh
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the pendulum, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height above the ground.

As the pendulum begins its descent, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Kinetic energy ($KE$), which is the energy of motion, is defined as:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

where $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the velocity of the pendulum. As the pendulum falls, it accelerates, resulting in an increase in its kinetic energy while its height—and therefore its potential energy—decreases.

At the lowest point of its swing, the pendulum achieves maximum kinetic energy and zero potential energy. At this stage, it is moving at its highest speed and is at its lowest height above the ground. The kinetic energy is maximized because the pendulum is moving the fastest, while the potential energy is minimized since it is at the lowest point of the swing.

As the pendulum swings back upward, the process reverses. Kinetic energy is transformed back into potential energy. The pendulum decelerates, which decreases its kinetic energy, while its height above the ground increases, thereby increasing its potential energy. This cyclical exchange of energy continues as the pendulum swings back and forth.
