Satellites utilize gravity for slingshot maneuvers by leveraging the gravitational pull of a planet or moon to increase their speed.

This technique, commonly referred to as a gravity assist or gravitational slingshot, involves a spacecraft using the gravity of a celestial body to modify its velocity and trajectory. This method is frequently employed in space exploration to conserve fuel, extend the operational lifespan of spacecraft, and navigate complex trajectories.

The underlying principle of a gravity assist is relatively straightforward. As a spacecraft approaches a planet, it enters the planet's gravitational field, resulting in an acceleration toward the planet. This acceleration increases the spacecraft's velocity. If the spacecraft successfully exits the gravitational field on the opposite side, it retains this enhanced speed. This process is analogous to the operation of a slingshot, where the planet acts as the slinger and the spacecraft is akin to the stone being launched.

In addition to gaining speed, the spacecraft's trajectory can also be altered during this maneuver. The angle at which the spacecraft approaches the planet and the planet's own motion influence the spacecraft's exit path. This capability enables intricate maneuvers necessary for reaching the outer planets of our solar system.

The gravity assist technique was first employed in the 1960s during NASA's Mariner 10 mission to Mercury. Since then, it has been instrumental in numerous significant missions, including the Voyager missions to the outer planets and the New Horizons mission to Pluto.

It is essential to understand that although gravity assists can yield substantial boosts, they necessitate highly precise navigation. The spacecraft must approach the planet at an optimal angle and speed to achieve the desired outcome. This requires meticulous planning and exacting control of the spacecraft. Despite the challenges involved, gravity assists remain an indispensable tool in the field of space exploration.
