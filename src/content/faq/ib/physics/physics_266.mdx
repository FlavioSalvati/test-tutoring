Nuclear fusion is regarded as a promising future energy source due to its potential to provide limitless and clean energy.

Nuclear fusion, the process that fuels the sun and other stars, involves the merging of small atomic nuclei to create a larger nucleus, releasing an immense amount of energy in the process. This stands in contrast to nuclear fission, which is currently utilized in nuclear power plants and involves splitting large atomic nuclei into smaller ones. Fusion presents several advantages over fission that make it an appealing option for future energy generation.

Firstly, fusion has the potential to deliver virtually limitless energy. The primary fuels for fusion are isotopes of hydrogen, namely deuterium and tritium, which are abundant in nature. Deuterium can be extracted from seawater, while tritium can be produced from lithium, a resource that is also widely available. In fact, it is estimated that the fusion of just one liter of seawater could generate the same amount of energy as burning $300$ liters of petrol.

Secondly, fusion is a clean energy source. Unlike fossil fuels, fusion does not emit greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Additionally, unlike fission, fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste. The primary by-product of fusion is helium, which is an inert and non-toxic gas. Any radioactive materials that may be produced during the fusion process have short half-lives, meaning they decay to safe levels within a few years.

Thirdly, fusion is inherently safe. Sustaining a fusion reaction is challenging, and if any issues arise, the reaction simply ceases. This is in stark contrast to fission, where a malfunction could lead to catastrophic events such as nuclear meltdowns, exemplified by the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima.

However, the journey to harnessing fusion energy is fraught with challenges. The foremost obstacle is achieving the extreme conditions necessary for fusion to occur. This involves heating a plasma to temperatures exceeding $100$ million degrees Celsius and maintaining these conditions long enough for fusion to take place. Despite these challenges, significant strides have been made in recent years, and many scientists and engineers around the globe are optimistic that fusion can become a viable energy source within the next few decades.
