Wavelength plays a crucial role in the phenomenon of diffraction, which is the bending of waves when they encounter an obstacle or pass through a slit. Specifically, shorter wavelengths diffract less, while longer wavelengths diffract more.

To elaborate, diffraction is a wave phenomenon that occurs when a wave interacts with an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. When this interaction takes place, the wave bends around the obstacle or spreads out after passing through the slit, resulting in a diffraction pattern. The extent of this diffraction, or how much the wave spreads out, is directly related to the wavelength of the wave.

When a wave with a longer wavelength encounters an obstacle or a slit, it bends more significantly and spreads out to a greater extent than a wave with a shorter wavelength. This is because the longer wavelength is closer in size to the obstacle or slit, leading to greater interaction. Consequently, longer wavelengths produce wider diffraction patterns. In contrast, shorter wavelengths, being comparatively smaller than the obstacle or slit, interact less and thus diffract less, resulting in narrower diffraction patterns.

This principle is observable in everyday experiences. For instance, lower frequency sounds, characterized by longer wavelengths, can be heard more easily around corners and through doors than higher frequency sounds. The longer wavelengths of these lower frequency sounds allow them to diffract more effectively around obstacles, enhancing their audibility.

In the realm of light, which also behaves as a wave, different colors correspond to different wavelengths. For example, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light, and therefore it diffracts to a greater extent. This phenomenon is evident when white light, which contains all colors, passes through a prism. The red light, having a longer wavelength, bends more than the blue light, resulting in the formation of a spectrum or rainbow effect.

In summary, diffraction occurs when waves bend around obstacles or pass through slits, and the degree of spreading is determined by the wavelength. Longer wavelengths diffract more, producing wider patterns due to their size being closer to that of the obstacles or slits, while shorter wavelengths create narrower patterns because they interact less. This principle influences various phenomena, from the ability to hear sounds around corners to the separation of light into its constituent colors when passing through a prism.
