The strength of the electric field diminishes with increasing distance from the charge, adhering to an inverse square law.

The electric field strength, also referred to as intensity, quantifies the force experienced by a positive test charge when placed within the field. This intensity is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge generating the field and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from that charge. This relationship is articulated by Coulomb's Law, which asserts that the force between two charges is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them. 

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$ 
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} 
$$ 

where $F$ represents the force between the charges, $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the two charges, and $r$ is the distance between them.
