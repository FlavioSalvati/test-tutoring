The gravitational constant, commonly represented as $ G $, can be measured in the laboratory using a torsion balance, as exemplified in the Cavendish experiment.

The Cavendish experiment, conducted by Henry Cavendish in 1798, is the most widely recognized method for determining the gravitational constant. This experiment employs a torsion balance, which consists of a horizontal bar suspended from a thin wire, with small lead spheres attached to each end. When larger lead spheres are positioned near the smaller ones, the gravitational attraction between them causes the bar to twist, resulting in a corresponding twist of the wire. The degree of this twist is directly proportional to the gravitational force exerted between the spheres.

The gravitational force can be calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is mathematically expressed as:

$$
F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

where $ F $ represents the gravitational force, $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two particles, $ r $ is the distance between their centers, and $ G $ is the gravitational constant.

To calculate the value of $ G $, researchers measure the amount of twist in the wire, the distance between the spheres, and the masses of the spheres involved. This experiment is highly sensitive and requires meticulous control of environmental conditions, such as temperature and air currents, as these factors can significantly influence the results.

The Cavendish experiment is considered a classic demonstration in physics and is frequently replicated in laboratory settings to measure the gravitational constant. However, it is important to note that the value of $ G $ is one of the least accurately known fundamental constants, primarily due to the challenges associated with precise measurement. Nonetheless, the Cavendish experiment offers a valuable approximation and serves as a captivating illustration of the principles governing gravitational attraction.
