Nuclear reactors derive their energy from the process of nuclear fission, primarily involving heavy elements such as uranium or plutonium.

In a nuclear reactor, energy is harnessed through nuclear fission, a reaction in which the nucleus of a heavy atom—commonly uranium-235 or plutonium-239—is split into two or more smaller nuclei, accompanied by the release of several neutrons. This splitting process releases a substantial amount of energy, which serves as the primary power source for the reactor.

The fission process initiates when a neutron collides with the nucleus of a heavy atom, rendering it unstable and causing it to split. The smaller nuclei produced from this reaction, referred to as fission products, are highly radioactive. The neutrons released during the fission process can further induce additional fissions, leading to a self-sustaining chain reaction. In a nuclear reactor, this chain reaction is meticulously controlled to maintain a consistent rate of fission, thereby ensuring a stable output of energy.

The energy released during fission is predominantly in the form of kinetic energy from the fission products and neutrons. As these particles collide with surrounding atoms, their kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. This thermal energy heats water, producing steam that drives a turbine connected to an electricity generator.

The fuel utilized in nuclear reactors typically consists of solid pellets, often composed of uranium dioxide. These pellets are arranged into fuel rods, which are then assembled into larger groups known as fuel assemblies. The reactor core, where the fission reactions occur, contains multiple fuel assemblies.

In conclusion, nuclear reactors rely on the nuclear fission of heavy elements, primarily uranium or plutonium, as their energy source. The energy released during the fission process is transformed into thermal energy, which is subsequently used to generate electricity.
