The critical angle in wave refraction is influenced by the refractive indices of two media and the angle of incidence.

To elaborate, the critical angle is defined as the angle of incidence that leads to the refracted wave being directed at an angle of $90^\circ$ relative to the normal. At this angle, total internal reflection occurs, causing the wave to be reflected back into the original medium instead of being refracted into the second medium. It is important to note that the critical angle can only be achieved when light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index.

The refractive index of a medium quantifies the reduction in the speed of light as it enters that medium from a vacuum. It is calculated as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the medium, expressed mathematically as:

$$
n = \frac{c}{v}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum and $v$ is the speed of light in the medium. A higher refractive index indicates that light travels more slowly in that medium, resulting in greater refraction, or bending, as it transitions into or out of the medium.

The angle of incidence is defined as the angle between the incoming wave and the normal line at the boundary point of incidence. The normal is an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the boundary surface. Notably, the angle of incidence is measured from the normal and not from the boundary itself.

The critical angle can be mathematically expressed using the formula:

$$
\theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)
$$

where $n_1$ represents the refractive index of the first medium and $n_2$ denotes the refractive index of the second medium. This formula illustrates that the critical angle is dependent on the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. If the refractive index of the second medium is greater than that of the first medium, the critical angle becomes undefined, indicating that total internal reflection cannot occur.

In conclusion, the critical angle in wave refraction is determined by the refractive indices of the two media and the angle of incidence. This angle marks the threshold for total internal reflection and can only be realized when light transitions from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index.
