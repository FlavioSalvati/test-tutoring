The efficiency of a machine is defined by comparing its useful output energy or power to the total input energy or power.

More specifically, efficiency quantifies how effectively a machine converts input energy into useful work. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The formula for calculating efficiency can be represented as:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful Output Energy or Power}}{\text{Total Input Energy or Power}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

For example, if a machine receives $100$ joules of energy and successfully converts $80$ joules into useful work, the efficiency of that machine would be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{80}{100} \right) \times 100\% = 80\%
$$

This indicates that $20\%$ of the input energy is wasted, often in the form of heat due to friction or sound.

It is crucial to understand that no machine can achieve $100\%$ efficiency due to the laws of thermodynamics. Specifically, the second law of thermodynamics states that energy tends to disperse and become more disordered over time. Consequently, some energy will invariably be lost to the environment as heat, sound, or other forms of energy.

In practical applications, improving a machine's efficiency involves minimizing energy waste. This can be accomplished through various methods, such as using lubrication to reduce friction, implementing insulation to decrease heat loss, or designing the machine to operate at its optimal speed.

Understanding machine efficiency is vital in the field of physics. It enables us to make informed choices regarding energy use and conservation, and it aids engineers in designing more efficient machines and systems. For instance, a car engine with an efficiency of $25\%$ utilizes only a quarter of the energy from fuel to propel the vehicle, while the remainder is lost as heat. If engineers can enhance the engine's efficiency, the car will consume less fuel, which is not only cost-effective but also more environmentally friendly.

In summary, machine efficiency measures how effectively a machine converts input energy into useful work, expressed as a percentage. It is calculated by dividing the useful output by the total input and then multiplying the result by $100\%$. Due to the principles of thermodynamics, no machine can achieve $100\%$ efficiency, as some energy will always be lost. Enhancing efficiency involves reducing waste, which can be achieved through improved lubrication, better design, and other strategies that save energy and costs.
