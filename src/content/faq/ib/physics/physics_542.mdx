A scalar product, also known as the dot product, yields a scalar quantity, whereas a vector product, referred to as the cross product, results in a vector quantity.

The scalar product is a binary operation that takes two vectors and returns a scalar. This operation is commutative, meaning that the order of the vectors does not affect the outcome. The scalar product of two vectors can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}| \cos(\theta)
$$

where $|\mathbf{A}|$ and $|\mathbf{B}|$ are the magnitudes of the vectors, and $\theta$ is the angle between them. In physics, this operation is commonly used to calculate work done, where both force and displacement are represented as vectors, resulting in work being expressed as a scalar value.

Conversely, the vector product, or cross product, is another type of binary operation that takes two vectors and returns a vector. Unlike the scalar product, the vector product is not commutative; the order of the vectors does indeed influence the result. The vector product of two vectors can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}| \sin(\theta) \, \mathbf{n}
$$

where $\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the two vectors, and $\theta$ is the angle between them. The direction of the resultant vector is determined using the right-hand rule. This operation is frequently employed in physics to compute torque, where both the force and displacement are vectors, resulting in torque also being a vector quantity.

In summary, the scalar product (dot product) combines two vectors to produce a single numerical value, focusing on their magnitudes and the angle between them. This can be thought of as measuring how much one vector influences the direction of another. In contrast, the vector product (cross product) generates a new vector that illustrates how the two vectors interact in three-dimensional space, which is essential for determining directions like torque in physics.
