The wavelength of a wave has a significant impact on its ability to diffract, with longer wavelengths exhibiting greater diffraction compared to shorter wavelengths.

Diffraction is the phenomenon in which waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through an aperture. This behavior is a fundamental characteristic of various types of waves, including light, sound, and water waves. The extent of diffraction, which describes how much a wave spreads, is directly related to the wavelength of the wave and inversely related to the dimensions of the obstacle or aperture.

As the wavelength increases, the tendency of the wave to diffract also increases. This occurs because diffraction arises from the interference of the wave with itself. When a wave encounters an obstacle or a gap, it divides into several secondary waves. These secondary waves then interfere with one another, forming a pattern of constructive and destructive interference. The longer the wavelength, the greater the separation between these secondary waves, leading to a more pronounced degree of diffraction.

To illustrate this concept, consider a wave passing through a gap. If the wavelength is much smaller than the width of the gap, the wave will pass through with minimal diffraction. Conversely, if the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the width of the gap, the wave will exhibit significant diffraction. This principle explains why low-frequency (long wavelength) sounds can be heard around corners, while high-frequency (short wavelength) light typically cannot.

In the context of light, this principle clarifies why different colors of light diffract to varying degrees when passing through a prism. For instance, red light, which has a longer wavelength than blue light, diffracts more and is thus bent more by the prism. This results in the familiar spectrum of colors produced by a prism.

In summary, the wavelength of a wave is crucial in determining its diffraction behavior. Longer wavelengths lead to greater diffraction, allowing waves to bend around obstacles and spread out after passing through gaps. This principle is fundamental to our understanding of wave behavior and has important implications in various fields, from acoustics to optics.
