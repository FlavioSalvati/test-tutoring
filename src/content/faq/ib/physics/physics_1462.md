The equation for Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is derived from two fundamental principles: Newton's second law of motion and Hooke's law.

To begin, we reference Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration, expressed as:

$$F = ma$$

In the context of SHM, the force acting on the object is the restoring force. This force always acts in the opposite direction to the displacement of the object and is directly proportional to that displacement. This relationship is defined by Hooke's law, which can be written as:

$$F = -kx$$

Here, $k$ represents the spring constant, and $x$ denotes the displacement from the equilibrium position.

By combining Newton's second law and Hooke's law, we arrive at the equation:

$$ma = -kx$$

Rearranging this equation, we can express acceleration $a$ as:

$$a = -\frac{k}{m} x$$

This formulation reveals that the acceleration of the object is directly proportional to its displacement and is always directed towards the equilibrium position, which is a hallmark of SHM.

Additionally, we recognize that acceleration can also be represented as the second derivative of position with respect to time:

$$a = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$

Substituting this expression into our earlier equation gives us:

$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{k}{m} x$$

This resulting equation is a second-order differential equation. The solution to this equation provides the relationship for SHM:

$$x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$$

In this equation, $A$ signifies the amplitude of the motion, $\omega$ represents the angular frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase constant.

The angular frequency $\omega$ is related to the mass of the object and the spring constant by the equation:

$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$

This relationship indicates that the frequency of the oscillation is influenced by both the stiffness of the spring and the mass of the object. The phase constant $\phi$ determines the initial position of the oscillating object.

In summary, by employing Newton's second law and Hooke's law, we derive the equation for Simple Harmonic Motion. This equation illustrates how the motion depends on the mass of the object and the spring's stiffness, with the resulting oscillatory behavior characterized by its amplitude, angular frequency, and phase constant.
