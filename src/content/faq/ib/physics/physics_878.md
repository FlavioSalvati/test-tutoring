Wave speed and refraction are intricately connected; a change in wave speed when transitioning into a new medium results in refraction.

Refraction is the phenomenon observed when a wave, such as light or sound, alters its direction upon passing from one medium to another. This directional change is a consequence of the variation in the wave's speed. The relationship between wave speed and refraction is described by Snell's Law, which asserts that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence ($\theta_i$) to the sine of the angle of refraction ($\theta_r$) is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the wave in the two different media. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\sin(\theta_i)}{\sin(\theta_r)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}
$$

where $v_1$ and $v_2$ represent the wave speeds in the first and second media, respectively.

When a wave enters a new medium at an angle, the change in speed leads to a deviation in direction. If the wave slows down, it bends toward the normal line (the imaginary line that is perpendicular to the boundary between the two media). Conversely, if the wave accelerates, it bends away from the normal. This bending effect is what we refer to as refraction.

The extent of refraction is influenced by the difference in wave speeds between the two media. The greater the disparity, the more significant the refraction. For instance, light waves travel slower in water than in air, which causes objects submerged in water to appear distorted or displaced when viewed from above the water's surface.

In summary, wave speed and refraction are fundamentally linked. A change in wave speed as it transitions from one medium to another results in a directional change of the wave, known as refraction. The degree of this directional change is directly proportional to the difference in wave speeds between the two media. Understanding this relationship is essential in various fields of physics, including optics and wave theory.
