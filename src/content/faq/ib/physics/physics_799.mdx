Sound waves experience refraction in air as a result of variations in temperature, pressure, and humidity, which all influence the speed of sound.

Similar to light waves, sound waves can refract, meaning they change direction when transitioning between different conditions within the same medium—in this case, air. Although the medium remains air, fluctuations in its properties can alter the speed of sound, leading to refraction.

When sound waves move from an area with one temperature to an area with a different temperature, their speed changes accordingly. The speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, represented mathematically as:

$$
v \propto \sqrt{T}
$$

where $v$ is the speed of sound and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Thus, an increase in temperature results in a higher speed of sound, while a decrease in temperature leads to a lower speed. This variation in speed causes the sound waves to bend or refract.

In addition, changes in air pressure also contribute to the refraction of sound waves. The speed of sound is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure, expressed as:

$$
v \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{P}}
$$

where $P$ is the air pressure. Therefore, an increase in pressure results in a decrease in the speed of sound, and vice versa. This change in speed again leads to the bending of sound waves.

Lastly, humidity plays a significant role in influencing the speed of sound, thereby causing refraction. The speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the humidity, which can be represented as:

$$
v \propto \sqrt{H}
$$

where $H$ is the humidity level. Consequently, an increase in humidity results in an increase in the speed of sound, while a decrease in humidity leads to a reduction in speed. This alteration in speed further contributes to the bending of sound waves.

In summary, sound waves are refracted in air due to changes in temperature, pressure, and humidity. These factors affect the speed of sound—causing it to either increase or decrease—and this variation in speed leads to the bending or refraction of sound waves. This intriguing phenomenon is an essential aspect of wave behavior and a fundamental concept in the study of physics.
