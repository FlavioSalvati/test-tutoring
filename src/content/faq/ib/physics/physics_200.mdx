An electric field induces the movement of free electrons within a conductor, resulting in the formation of an electric current.

When an electric field is applied to a conductor, it exerts a force on the free electrons that are present. These free electrons, which possess a negative charge, are repelled by the negative terminal of the electric field and attracted toward the positive terminal. This movement of electrons constitutes the flow of electric current.

The strength of the electric field directly influences the force exerted on the electrons. A stronger electric field leads to a greater force, resulting in a higher velocity of electron movement. This explains why an increase in voltage, which enhances the electric field strength, corresponds to a higher current. However, the motion of electrons is not a straightforward path from the negative to the positive terminal. Instead, electrons travel in a random, zigzag pattern due to collisions with the atoms in the conductor, a phenomenon known as drift velocity.

The drift velocity of the electrons is directly proportional to the electric field strength. This relationship is encapsulated in Ohm's law, which states that the current $I$ flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage $V$ across those points, and inversely proportional to the resistance $R$ of the conductor. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

The resistance in this context is influenced by various factors, including the material of the conductor, its length, and its temperature.

In addition to facilitating movement, the electric field also provides energy to the electrons. During their collisions with the atoms of the conductor, this energy is transferred, leading to increased atomic vibrations. This rise in atomic motion is perceived as an increase in the temperature of the conductor, which explains why conductors heat up when an electric current flows through them.

In summary, an electric field influences free electrons in a conductor by prompting their movement (creating an electric current), determining their speed (through the strength of the field), and supplying energy that can raise the conductor's temperature. Understanding these effects is essential for a range of applications in physics and engineering, from the design of electronic circuits to the study of plasma behavior in fusion reactors.
