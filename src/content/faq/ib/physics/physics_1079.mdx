Iron is commonly utilized in electromagnets because of its exceptional magnetic permeability, which significantly enhances the magnetic field generated by electric currents.

As a ferromagnetic material, iron exhibits a strong attraction to magnetic fields and can itself become magnetized. This characteristic makes iron an ideal choice for electromagnets. The high magnetic permeability of iron enables it to intensify the magnetic field produced by the electric current. This occurs because magnetic field lines prefer to travel through the iron core rather than through air, owing to iron's lower magnetic reluctance, which is the opposition to the magnetic field.

When an electric current flows through a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core, the resulting magnetic field magnetizes the iron. This magnetization of the iron core further amplifies the magnetic field generated by the coil, resulting in a significant increase in overall magnetic field strength. This is the reason why iron cores are frequently employed in electromagnetsâ€”to maximize the strength of the magnetic field they create.

Moreover, iron possesses a high magnetic saturation level, which means it can be magnetized to a substantial extent before reaching a point where further increases in magnetizing force do not correlate with increased magnetization. This property allows electromagnets with iron cores to produce exceptionally strong magnetic fields.

However, it is crucial to consider that iron also has a considerable magnetic hysteresis, meaning it tends to retain its magnetization even after the magnetizing force is removed. This can pose a disadvantage in applications that require a rapid response to changes in magnetizing force. Nevertheless, for many applications, the benefits of using iron in electromagnets far outweigh this drawback.

In summary, the primary reason for using iron in electromagnets is its high magnetic permeability, which enables it to enhance the magnetic field produced by electric currents. Additionally, its high magnetic saturation level facilitates the generation of very strong magnetic fields.
