Wavefronts and rays play a crucial role in understanding the propagation and behavior of light in various media.

**Wavefronts** are defined as surfaces where the phase of a light or sound wave remains constant. In simpler terms, every point on a wavefront shares the same phase of the wave cycle. This concept is essential for grasping how waves propagate through space. For example, when light emanates from a point source, it spreads out in all directions, forming spherical wavefronts. However, if the light source is sufficiently distant, the wavefronts appear essentially flat and parallel, a condition referred to as plane waves. The shape of wavefronts can alter when waves traverse lenses or reflect off mirrors, which serves as the foundation for geometrical optics.

Conversely, **rays** are lines that are perpendicular to the wavefronts, indicating the direction in which the wave is traveling. Rays are often depicted in diagrams to illustrate the path of light. They simplify complex wave behaviors into more manageable geometric problems. For instance, when light passes through a lens, it bends. By drawing rays, we can easily trace the path of light, thereby determining the image produced by the lens.

The relationship between wavefronts and rays is deeply interconnected. The direction of the rays indicates the direction of energy propagation at every point on the wavefront. This relationship is encapsulated in Huygens' Principle, which asserts that every point on a wavefront can be regarded as a source of secondary spherical wavelets that emanate forward at the speed of light. The new wavefront is formed as the tangential surface to all these secondary wavelets.

In summary, wavefronts and rays are fundamental concepts in the study of waves, particularly light. They provide valuable frameworks for visualizing and analyzing wave propagation, the interaction of waves with different media, and the formation of images by lenses and mirrors. A solid understanding of these concepts is essential for advancing in fields such as optics, acoustics, and even quantum mechanics.
