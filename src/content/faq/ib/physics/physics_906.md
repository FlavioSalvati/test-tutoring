The speed of a wave varies when it transitions between different media due to the distinct physical properties of those media, such as density and elasticity.

More specifically, the propagation speed of a wave is influenced by the medium through which it travels. Waves are disturbances that move through a medium, and the properties of that medium play a crucial role in determining the speed of this disturbance. Two primary characteristics that affect wave speed are the medium's density and its elasticity.

**Density** is defined as the mass per unit volume of a medium. Generally, waves travel more slowly in denser media. This is because, in denser materials, the particles are packed more closely together, leading to more frequent interactions. This increased interaction tends to slow the propagation of the wave. For example, sound waves travel more slowly in water (which is denser) compared to air (which is less dense).

**Elasticity**, on the other hand, measures a medium's ability to return to its original shape after being disturbed. Media with high elasticity, such as steel, allow waves to travel faster because the particles can quickly revert to their initial positions after being disturbed, facilitating rapid wave movement. Conversely, in less elastic materials like rubber, waves propagate more slowly because the particles take longer to return to their original positions.

When a wave moves from one medium to another, it encounters changes in these physical properties. This transition can result in an increase or decrease in wave speed, depending on how the properties of the new medium compare to those of the original medium. For instance, light waves bend (or refract) when they transition from air to water; this change in speed associated with the different media alters the direction in which the wave travels.

In conclusion, the speed of a wave is not an inherent property of the wave itself; rather, it is determined by the characteristics of the medium through which it is traveling. When these characteristics change, as they do during a transition between different media, the speed of the wave adjusts accordingly.
