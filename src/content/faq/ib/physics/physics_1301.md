Up and down quarks are the lightest among all quarks, which are fundamental particles that combine to form protons and neutrons.

Quarks are elementary particles and serve as fundamental constituents of matter. They represent the smallest known entities in the universe and belong to a class of particles referred to as 'fermions'. Fermions adhere to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.

Among the six types of quarks, which also include charm, strange, top, and bottom quarks, up and down quarks are the lightest and most stable. The up quark carries an electric charge of $+\frac{2}{3}$, whereas the down quark has a charge of $-\frac{1}{3}$. This contrasts with the electron, which possesses a full negative charge of $-1$.

According to the Standard Model of particle physics, protons and neutrons—the building blocks of atomic nuclei—are composed of up and down quarks. A proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark, resulting in a total charge of $+1$. Conversely, a neutron is made up of one up quark and two down quarks, yielding a total charge of $0$.

Quarks are never found in isolation; they always exist in combinations of two or three, forming particles known as mesons and baryons, respectively. This behavior is attributed to a property of quarks called 'color charge'. Despite its name, 'color charge' has no relation to visual color but serves as a useful categorization for quarks. A quark can possess one of three colors: red, green, or blue, while an antiquark can have corresponding anti-colors: anti-red, anti-green, or anti-blue. For a particle to be stable, it must be 'colorless', meaning that the combination of quarks must result in a neutral color charge.

The discovery and exploration of quarks have significantly enhanced our understanding of the fundamental structure of matter. This captivating field of study continues to evolve as physicists delve deeper into the subatomic realm.
