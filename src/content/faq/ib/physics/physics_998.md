In a zinc-carbon cell, zinc undergoes oxidation to form zinc ions and electrons, while manganese dioxide is reduced to form manganese ions.

A zinc-carbon cell, commonly referred to as a Leclanch√© cell, is a type of primary cell (or non-rechargeable battery) that utilizes zinc and manganese dioxide as its electrodes. The chemical reactions that take place within this cell are fundamental to its operation and serve as a classic example of redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions.

The anode of the cell is composed of zinc. When the cell is in operation, the zinc anode undergoes oxidation, which entails the loss of electrons. This process can be represented by the following half-equation:

$$
\text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-
$$

In this reaction, zinc atoms at the anode convert into zinc ions ($\text{Zn}^{2+}$) and enter the electrolyte, leaving behind two electrons within the metallic structure.

The cathode of the cell consists of a carbon rod surrounded by a mixture of manganese dioxide and carbon powder. Manganese dioxide serves as a depolarizer, accepting electrons from the carbon rod and undergoing reduction in the process. The corresponding reduction half-equation is:

$$
\text{MnO}_2(s) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) + e^- \rightarrow \text{MnO(OH)}(s) + \text{OH}^-(aq)
$$

This reaction results in the formation of manganese hydroxide and hydroxide ions.

The overall reaction occurring in the cell can be summarized as follows:

$$
\text{Zn}(s) + 2\text{MnO}_2(s) + 2\text{NH}_4\text{Cl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn(NH}_3)_2\text{Cl}_2(aq) + \text{Mn}_2\text{O}_3(s)
$$

This equation illustrates that zinc and manganese dioxide react with ammonium chloride in the electrolyte to produce a complex zinc-ammonium ion, manganese(III) oxide, and water.

Electrons generated at the anode travel through the external circuit to the cathode, supplying the electrical energy necessary to power the device connected to the battery. Meanwhile, the flow of ions in the electrolyte completes the circuit, enabling the cell to function continuously until one or both of the reactants are depleted. 

Although the zinc-carbon cell is a reliable and cost-effective power source, it has largely been replaced by alkaline batteries, which provide superior performance and an extended shelf life.
