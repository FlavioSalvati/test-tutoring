Total internal reflection is a fascinating optical phenomenon that occurs when light traveling through a denser medium strikes the boundary of a less dense medium at an angle greater than a specific threshold known as the critical angle.

In more technical terms, total internal reflection happens when a propagating wave encounters a medium boundary at an angle larger than the critical angle relative to the normal line (the perpendicular line to the surface at the point of incidence). If the refractive index of the second medium is lower than that of the first, and the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, the wave is unable to transmit through the boundary and is instead completely reflected back into the denser medium.

The critical angle is defined as the minimum angle of incidence at which total internal reflection occurs. At this angle, the refracted light travels along the boundary, making an angle of $90^\circ$ with respect to the normal. When the angle of incidence surpasses this critical angle, the light cannot escape into the second medium; rather, it reflects entirely back into the first medium. The critical angle can be calculated using Snell's law by setting the angle of refraction to $90^\circ$.

Total internal reflection is not limited to visible light; it can also occur with other types of waves, such as sound waves and radio waves. This principle is essential in various applications, including optical fibers and prisms. In optical fibers, for example, light signals are transmitted with minimal loss due to total internal reflection, allowing for efficient data transmission over long distances. Similarly, prisms utilize total internal reflection to reflect light or to disperse it into its constituent spectral colors.

In summary, total internal reflection arises from the interplay between the angle of incidence, the refractive indices of the two media involved, and the critical angle. When light transitions from a denser medium to a less dense medium at an angle greater than the critical angle, it is entirely reflected back into the denser medium. This phenomenon is fundamental to the operation of many optical devices and technologies.
