We do not perceive the Earth's circular motion around the Sun primarily due to the principle of inertia and the absence of acceleration.

The Earth's orbit around the Sun exemplifies uniform circular motion, which occurs when an object travels along a circular path at a constant speed. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object in motion remains in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This phenomenon is known as the principle of inertia. Since the Earth's speed and direction remain constant, there is no change in velocity, leading to the absence of acceleration. Consequently, we do not feel the motion of the Earth.

Additionally, we do not sense the Earth's movement because we, along with all objects on its surface, are moving together with it. This situation is akin to being in a car that is traveling at a constant speed along a straight road; you do not feel the motion unless the car accelerates, decelerates, or changes direction. Similarly, if the Earth were to suddenly increase or decrease its speed or alter its trajectory, we would become aware of it.

Another factor contributing to our lack of awareness of the Earth's motion is the absence of a fixed reference point. When you are in a moving vehicle, you can observe trees and buildings passing by, which provides a sense of motion. However, in the case of the Earth's movement, we lack a stable reference point against which we can gauge our motion.

Finally, the gravitational pull of the Earth keeps us anchored to its surface, preventing us from being thrown into space due to the Earth's motion. This gravitational force is exceptionally strong, surpassing the centrifugal force generated by the Earth's rotation. As a result, we experience the force of gravity much more acutely than any effects of the Earth's motion.
