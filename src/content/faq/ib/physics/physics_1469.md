In Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), the displacement of an object varies sinusoidally over time.

To elaborate, SHM is a specific type of periodic motion characterized by a restoring force that is directly proportional to the displacement from an equilibrium position. Key features of SHM include its amplitude, frequency, and phase. The displacement as a function of time can be modeled using either a sine or cosine function, depending on the initial conditions of the system.

The equation that describes displacement in SHM is given by:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
$$

where:
- $ x(t) $ is the displacement at time $ t $,
- $ A $ is the amplitude (the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position),
- $ \omega $ is the angular frequency,
- $ t $ is the time, and
- $ \phi $ is the phase constant.

The angular frequency $ \omega $ relates to the period of oscillation $ T $ through the equation:

$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}
$$

The phase constant $ \phi $ is determined by the initial conditions of the motion.

In SHM, the displacement $ x $ oscillates between $ -A $ and $ +A $. At the points of maximum displacement (either $ +A $ or $ -A $), the velocity of the object is zero. As the object moves toward the equilibrium position, its velocity increases. At the equilibrium position, the velocity reaches its maximum value while the displacement is zero. As the object continues past the equilibrium point toward the opposite extreme, the velocity decreases until it again reaches zero at the maximum displacement. This oscillatory process continuously repeats.

The graph depicting displacement versus time for SHM takes the form of a sinusoidal curve. The displacement is positive for half of the oscillation period and negative for the other half. The maximum and minimum displacement values correspond to the peaks and troughs of the sinusoidal curve, respectively. The period of the motion is defined as the time required to complete one full cycle, which aligns with the period of the sinusoidal function.

In summary, Simple Harmonic Motion is characterized by sinusoidal variations in displacement over time. The displacement achieves maximum values at the extremes of the motion and is zero at the equilibrium position. The velocity is zero at the extremes and reaches its peak at the equilibrium position. The displacement as a function of time can be expressed using either a sine or cosine function, contingent upon the initial conditions of the motion.
