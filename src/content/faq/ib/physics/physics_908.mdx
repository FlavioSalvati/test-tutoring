Charges behave differently in a uniform electric field based on their polarity: positive charges move in the direction of the electric field, while negative charges move in the opposite direction.

In a uniform electric field, the force acting on a charge remains constant throughout the field. This constancy arises because the electric field strength, defined as the force exerted on a unit positive charge, is uniform across all points. The direction of the force—and consequently the motion of the charge—depends on the type of charge involved. Specifically, a positive charge will move along the direction of the electric field, whereas a negative charge will move against it.

To analyze the motion of charges in a uniform electric field, we can apply Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration. In the context of an electric field, the force acting on a charge is given by the equation:

$$
F = qE,
$$

where $F$ is the force, $q$ is the charge, and $E$ is the electric field strength. Consequently, the acceleration ($a$) of the charge can be expressed as:

$$
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{qE}{m},
$$

where $m$ represents the mass of the charge. This indicates that the charge experiences constant acceleration in the direction of the net force.

The trajectory of the charge can be determined using the equations of motion. For a positive charge, the initial velocity is typically aligned with the electric field direction. As the charge accelerates, both its velocity and displacement in the direction of the field increase. Conversely, for a negative charge, the initial velocity is generally directed opposite to the field. As this charge accelerates, its velocity and displacement also increase, but in the direction opposite to the electric field.

It is essential to recognize that the motion of charges in a uniform electric field represents an idealized scenario. In real-world situations, additional forces—such as gravity or magnetic fields—may influence the charge's motion, and the electric field may not be perfectly uniform. Nevertheless, a solid grasp of the fundamental principles governing charge motion in a uniform electric field lays the groundwork for understanding more intricate phenomena.
