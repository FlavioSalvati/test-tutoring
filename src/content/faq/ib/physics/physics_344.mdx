The strong nuclear force effectively overcomes electrostatic repulsion within atomic nuclei by binding protons and neutrons together at very short distances.

The strong nuclear force, often referred to as the strong force, is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is essential for maintaining the integrity of the atomic nucleus, where protons and neutrons are packed closely together. Since protons carry a positive charge, they naturally repel each other due to the electrostatic force, commonly known as the Coulomb force. Despite this repulsion, protons remain confined within the nucleus owing to the strong nuclear force.

Remarkably, the strong nuclear force is approximately 100 times stronger than the electrostatic force when measured at the scale of the nucleus. This force acts between all nucleons—both protons and neutrons—regardless of their charge. It is fundamentally attractive and grows stronger as nucleons approach one another, up to a certain limit. This property enables it to effectively counteract the electrostatic repulsion between protons, thereby ensuring the nucleus remains intact.

However, the strong nuclear force has a very short range, functioning effectively only over distances on the order of a few femtometers ($1 \, \text{fm} = 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$), which is roughly the size of an atomic nucleus. Beyond this short range, the strength of the strong force diminishes rapidly and becomes negligible. This limitation explains why we do not experience the strong force in our everyday lives.

The delicate balance between the strong nuclear force and the electrostatic force is crucial for the stability of the nucleus. If the strong force were slightly weaker, or if the electrostatic force were slightly stronger, protons would not be able to remain together in the nucleus, potentially leading to atomic disintegration. Conversely, if the strong force were excessively strong or the electrostatic force too weak, protons and neutrons would cluster too tightly, resulting in the formation of very heavy elements and causing instability within the atomic structure.

In summary, the strong nuclear force plays a vital role in counteracting the electrostatic repulsion experienced by protons within the nucleus. This force is fundamental to the stability of atoms and, by extension, the matter that constitutes our universe.
