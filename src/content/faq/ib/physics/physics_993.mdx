Primary cells are designed for single use and cannot be recharged, while secondary cells are rechargeable and can be utilized multiple times.

Both primary and secondary cells are types of electrochemical cells that generate electrical energy. The primary distinction between the two lies in their capacity for reusability. Primary cells, often referred to as disposable batteries, are intended for one-time use; once the chemical reactions that produce electrical energy are completed, these cells cannot be recharged. Common examples of primary cells include alkaline batteries and button cells.

In contrast, secondary cells are engineered to be recharged and used repeatedly. The chemical reactions occurring within these cells are reversible, which means that when the energy is depleted, they can be recharged. This recharging process is accomplished by applying an external electrical power source, which drives the chemical reaction in the opposite direction, effectively restoring the cell's charge. Notable examples of secondary cells include lead-acid batteries (commonly used in vehicles) and lithium-ion batteries (frequently found in mobile phones and laptops).
