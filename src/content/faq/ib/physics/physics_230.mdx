A fuel cell generates electricity through a chemical reaction involving a fuel source and an oxidant.

Fuel cells operate by converting chemical energy into electrical energy via a series of reactions. The process begins with the introduction of a fuel source, typically hydrogen, and an oxidant, usually oxygen, into the cell. These two substances are kept separate, each entering a different side of the cell. A fuel cell comprises two electrodes: an anode (negative) and a cathode (positive), which are separated by an electrolyte.

At the anode, a catalyst facilitates the oxidation of the fuel, causing it to split into positive ions and negative electrons. For hydrogen fuel, this results in the formation of hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons. The electrolyte is specifically designed to allow positive ions to pass through while blocking electrons, which compels the electrons to flow through an external circuit to reach the cathode. This movement of electrons generates an electric current that can be utilized to perform work, such as powering a motor or illuminating a bulb.

Meanwhile, at the cathode, the oxidant is reduced by accepting the electrons that have traveled through the external circuit. In the case of oxygen, it combines with the electrons and the hydrogen ions that have passed through the electrolyte to produce water, which is the only by-product of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell.

The overall reaction in a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell can be summarized as the combination of hydrogen and oxygen to form water, a process that releases energy. However, unlike a typical combustion reaction that releases energy as heat and light, this energy is harnessed as electrical energy. This characteristic makes fuel cells a highly efficient and environmentally friendly method of generating electricity, as they can operate at higher efficiencies than traditional combustion engines, with water being their sole by-product.

Central to the operation of a fuel cell is the electrolyte. Different types of fuel cells utilize various electrolytes, and the choice of electrolyte can influence the cell's efficiency, operating temperature, and fuel compatibility. Despite these variations, all fuel cells adhere to the same fundamental principle of separating a fuel source from an oxidant to generate an electric current.
