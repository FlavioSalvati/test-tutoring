Weightlessness in space is a phenomenon caused by the continuous free-fall towards Earth, which creates the sensation of zero gravity.

To understand this better, it's crucial to recognize that gravity is still present in space, even aboard the International Space Station (ISS). While the force of gravity diminishes with distance, it does not vanish entirely. In fact, astronauts on the ISS experience approximately $90\%$ of Earth's gravitational pull. So, why do they seem to float?

The key lies in the concept of free-fall. When an object is in free-fall, it is descending towards Earth due to gravity, but it is also traveling forward at a speed sufficient to keep missing the planet. This is precisely what occurs with the ISS and its crew. They are in a state of free-fall towards Earth while moving forward at an impressive speed of about $28,000$ kilometers per hour. This forward motion ensures they do not collide with the Earth as they fall.

This continuous descent is what generates the sensation of weightlessness. In free-fall, individuals do not perceive the force of gravity acting upon them. Instead, they feel as though they are floating. This experience is similar to the feeling you get when cresting a hill on a roller coaster or jumping off a diving board. Gravity is still at work, but because you and everything around you are falling at the same rate, its effects are not felt.

In summary, weightlessness in space is not due to the absence of gravity. Rather, it results from being in a state of continuous free-fall. This is a common misconception; understanding the underlying physics clarifies why astronauts appear to float. They are not beyond Earth's gravitational influence; instead, they are falling towards it in such a manner that they experience a sensation of weightlessness.
