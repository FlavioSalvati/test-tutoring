The time period of a mass-spring system is significantly influenced by both the mass of the object and the spring constant.

In a mass-spring system, commonly known as a simple harmonic oscillator, the time period $T$ is primarily determined by two key factors: the mass of the object attached to the spring, denoted as $m$, and the spring constant, represented by $k$. The spring constant $k$ quantifies the stiffness of the spring; it indicates the amount of force required to stretch or compress the spring by a specific distance. Meanwhile, the mass $m$ of the object influences the extent to which the spring can be stretched or compressed. 

In summary, both the mass of the object and the spring constant play crucial roles in defining the dynamics of the system.
