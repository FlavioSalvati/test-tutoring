Traveling waves encounter boundaries, resulting in changes to their direction, and potentially their speed and amplitude, through a process known as reflection.

When a traveling wave meets a boundary—such as the end of a string or a transition between different media—it cannot simply vanish. Instead, it undergoes reflection, a fundamental concept in wave physics essential for understanding various phenomena, including echoes, optical reflections, and the behavior of electromagnetic waves.

The nature of the wave's reflection at a boundary is influenced by the characteristics of both the wave and the boundary itself. For instance, if the boundary is fixed, the wave will reflect back along the path it traveled, but it will undergo an inversion. This means that peaks will transform into troughs and vice versa. The rationale behind this inversion is that a fixed boundary cannot move, compelling the wave to 'flip over' to maintain its motion.

Conversely, if the boundary is free or less rigid, the wave will still reflect, but it will not invert. This happens because the boundary can move, allowing the wave to continue its trajectory without flipping. In this case, while the speed and wavelength of the wave remain unchanged, the amplitude may vary based on the boundary's properties.

Additionally, waves can experience partial reflection and partial transmission at a boundary. This phenomenon occurs when some of the wave energy is reflected back, while the remainder is transmitted into the new medium. The extent of reflection and transmission is determined by the impedance mismatch between the two media. If the impedance of the second medium is greater, a larger portion of the wave will be reflected and less will be transmitted. Conversely, if the impedance of the second medium is lower, more of the wave will be transmitted and less will be reflected.

In summary, the reflection of traveling waves at boundaries is a nuanced process that depends on the characteristics of both the wave and the boundary. This process involves alterations in direction, and potentially in speed and amplitude, leading to the simultaneous occurrence of both reflection and transmission of the wave.
