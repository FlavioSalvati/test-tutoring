Thermal power plants utilize a process known as the Rankine cycle to convert heat into electricity.

The Rankine cycle is a thermodynamic process that transforms heat into mechanical work, which is subsequently harnessed to generate electricity. This cycle serves as the foundational principle for thermal power plants, which rely on various heat sources, such as coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy, to produce electrical power.

The process commences with the heating of a working fluid, typically water, within a boiler. The chosen heat source—whether it be coal, gas, or nuclear fuel—raises the temperature of the water until it transforms into high-pressure steam. This high-pressure steam is then directed into a turbine. The kinetic energy of the steam causes the turbine blades to rotate, which in turn drives a generator. The generator converts this mechanical energy into electrical energy, thus producing electricity.

After the steam has passed through the turbine, it is condensed back into water within a condenser. This condensed water is then pumped back into the boiler, allowing the cycle to restart. This system is classified as a closed-loop system, meaning that the water is continuously recycled.

The efficiency of a thermal power plant is influenced by the temperature difference between the heat source and the cooling source. A larger temperature gradient results in higher efficiency for the power plant. However, practical limitations exist since the materials used in the power plant can only withstand certain temperature thresholds.

It is important to note that the Rankine cycle does not achieve 100% efficiency. Some energy is invariably lost during the process, primarily in the form of waste heat. This waste heat is typically discharged into the environment, often as hot water or steam. Consequently, thermal power plants are frequently situated near bodies of water, which serve as cooling sources.

In summary, thermal power plants convert heat into electricity by heating water to create steam, which drives a turbine connected to a generator. The steam is subsequently condensed back into water and returned to the boiler, thereby establishing a closed-loop system.
