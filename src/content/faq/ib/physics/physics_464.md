Fission and fusion are two distinct types of nuclear reactions that release energy through the interactions of atomic particles within a nucleus. 

**Fission** refers to the splitting of a heavy nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei. This process typically involves isotopes such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239. When these isotopes absorb a neutron, they undergo a nuclear reaction that results in the formation of two or more smaller nuclei, accompanied by the release of several free neutrons and a substantial amount of energy. This mechanism is harnessed in nuclear power plants and atomic bombs.

In contrast, **fusion** is the process in which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus. The energy release or absorption during fusion depends on the masses of the nuclei involved. Fusion power refers to the energy generated from nuclear fusion processes. Unlike nuclear fission, fusion has not yet been developed into a commercially viable energy source, although it remains a long-term objective of scientific research due to its potential for providing virtually unlimited and clean energy. Fusion is the process responsible for the energy emitted by the sun and other stars, where hydrogen atoms fuse to create helium.

When considering energy production, fusion is generally more efficient than fission. A fusion reaction can release approximately three to four times more energy than a fission reaction. However, achieving the extreme conditions necessary for nuclear fusion—such as extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures—poses significant challenges. This difficulty is the primary reason fusion power has not yet become a practical energy source.

In conclusion, while both fission and fusion are nuclear reactions capable of releasing vast amounts of energy, they are fundamentally different processes. Fission involves the division of a heavy nucleus and is currently implemented in nuclear power plants, whereas fusion involves the amalgamation of light nuclei and is the process that fuels stars.
