Work is performed by external forces in electric fields when they move a charge against the direction of the field.

To elaborate, the concept of work done by external forces in electric fields is a key principle in electromagnetism. An electric field is defined as a region surrounding a charged particle where it exerts an electric force on other charged particles. When an external force displaces a charge within this field, it performs work.

The amount of work done can be expressed using the formula:

$$
W = F d \cos \theta
$$

In this equation, $W$ represents the work done, $F$ is the force applied, $d$ is the distance over which the force acts, and $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the direction of motion. When considering electric fields, the force can be described by the equation:

$$
F = qE
$$

where $q$ is the charge and $E$ is the electric field strength. Grasping this relationship is crucial for understanding how charges behave within electric fields.

When an external force moves a charge against the direction of the electric field—specifically, from a region of lower potential to a region of higher potential—it performs positive work. This scenario occurs because the angle $\theta$ in the work formula is $180$ degrees, and since $\cos(180^\circ) = -1$, the work done is positive. This positive work results in an increase in the potential energy of the charge.

Conversely, if the external force moves the charge in the same direction as the electric field—from a region of higher potential to a region of lower potential—it performs negative work. In this case, $\theta$ is $0$ degrees, and $\cos(0^\circ) = 1$, leading to negative work done. This negative work corresponds to a decrease in the charge's potential energy.

In summary, the work done by external forces in electric fields depends on the direction in which the charge is moved. If the charge is displaced against the electric field, the work done is positive, resulting in an increase in potential energy. If the charge moves with the electric field, the work done is negative, leading to a decrease in potential energy. A deeper understanding of these principles can illuminate the nature of potential energy changes within electric fields. Furthermore, comprehending the calculations of electric field strength and effects, as discussed in other resources, is essential for analyzing the work performed by external forces.
