When adding perpendicular vectors, the Pythagorean theorem is utilized to determine the magnitude of the resultant vector. This theorem states that the magnitude of the resultant vector is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the individual vectors.

To elaborate, when two vectors are perpendicular, their magnitudes cannot simply be added together, as they do not point in the same direction. Instead, the Pythagorean theorem—a mathematical principle applicable to right-angled triangles—provides the correct approach.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, in any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In the context of vector addition, the hypotenuse represents the resultant vector, while the other two sides correspond to the individual vectors being combined.

To apply the Pythagorean theorem to vectors, follow these steps:

1. Square the magnitudes of the individual vectors.
2. Add these squares together.
3. Take the square root of the sum to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.

Mathematically, if vector $\mathbf{A}$ has a magnitude of $|\mathbf{A}|$ and vector $\mathbf{B}$ has a magnitude of $|\mathbf{B}|$, the magnitude of the resultant vector $\mathbf{R}$ can be expressed as:

$$
|\mathbf{R}| = \sqrt{|\mathbf{A}|^2 + |\mathbf{B}|^2}
$$

To determine the direction of the resultant vector, trigonometric functions are employed. The tangent of the angle $\theta$ that the resultant vector makes with one of the individual vectors can be found using the following relationship:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{|\mathbf{B}|}{|\mathbf{A}|}
$$

You can then use the arctangent function to calculate the angle:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{|\mathbf{B}|}{|\mathbf{A}|}\right)
$$

It is important to note that this method exclusively applies to vectors that are perpendicular to each other. If the vectors in question are not perpendicular, a different approach will be necessary to compute the resultant vector.
