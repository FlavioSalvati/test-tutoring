To determine the total work done by multiple forces acting on an object, you need to sum the work done by each individual force.

In physics, work is defined as the product of the applied force and the distance over which that force acts. When multiple forces are involved, the work done by each force must be calculated separately before summing them to obtain the total work. This is possible because work is a scalar quantity; it has magnitude but no direction, allowing for straightforward addition.

The formula used to calculate the work done by a single force is given by:

$$
W = Fd \cos \theta
$$

where:
- $W$ represents the work done,
- $F$ is the magnitude of the force applied,
- $d$ is the distance over which the force is applied, and
- $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the force and the direction of motion.

If the force is applied in the same direction as the motion, the angle $\theta$ is $0^\circ$, and consequently, $\cos \theta = 1$. Thus, the work done simplifies to the product of the force and the distance:

$$
W = Fd
$$

Conversely, if the force is applied in the opposite direction to the motion, the angle $\theta$ is $180^\circ$, resulting in $\cos \theta = -1$. In this case, the work done becomes the negative product of the force and the distance:

$$
W = -Fd
$$

When multiple forces act on an object, you must calculate the work done by each force individually. For each force, you need to determine its magnitude, the distance over which it acts, and the angle between the force and the direction of motion. After computing the work for each force, you can sum these values to find the total work done.

It's important to keep in mind that the total work done on an object can be positive, negative, or zero:
- **Positive work** occurs when the force is in the same direction as the motion.
- **Negative work** occurs when the force acts in the opposite direction to the motion.
- **Zero work** occurs when the force is applied perpendicular to the direction of motion.
