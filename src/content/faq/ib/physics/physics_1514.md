Coherent light in single-slit diffraction produces a clear and well-defined diffraction pattern.

In the phenomenon of single-slit diffraction, light waves traverse a narrow slit and subsequently spread out, forming an interference pattern on a screen. This pattern is characterized by a central bright fringe, known as the maximum, which is flanked by alternating dark and bright fringes, referred to as minima and maxima. The clarity and definition of this interference pattern are significantly influenced by the coherence of the light source employed.

Coherent light refers to light waves that are in phase with one another. This means that the waves share the same frequency and wavelength, and the phase difference between them remains constant over time. Common examples of coherent light sources include lasers and monochromatic light. When coherent light is utilized in single-slit diffraction, it yields a distinctly defined and clear diffraction pattern. This clarity arises because the waves interfere both constructively and destructively in a predictable and consistent manner, resulting in sharp bright and dark fringes.

In contrast, when a non-coherent light source is used, the diffraction pattern may appear blurry or less distinct. This blurriness occurs because the waves are not in phase, resulting in a phase difference that varies over time. Consequently, the interference of the waves is less predictable and consistent, leading to a muddled interference pattern.

Moreover, the application of coherent light in single-slit diffraction facilitates more precise measurements and calculations. The positions and intensities of the fringes within the diffraction pattern can be utilized to determine various properties, such as the width of the slit and the wavelength of the light. The accuracy of these calculations is contingent upon the clarity and definition of the diffraction pattern, which is directly related to the coherence of the light source.

In conclusion, coherent light is essential in single-slit diffraction, as it significantly impacts the clarity and definition of the resulting diffraction pattern and enhances the accuracy of measurements and calculations derived from this pattern.
