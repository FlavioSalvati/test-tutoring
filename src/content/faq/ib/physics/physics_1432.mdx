Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is defined by oscillations around a stable equilibrium position, characterized by a constant amplitude and period.

To elaborate, simple harmonic motion is a specific type of periodic motion where the restoring force acting on an object is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position. This relationship ensures that the object is always drawn back toward the equilibrium point, with the restoring force increasing in strength as the object moves further away from this point. The motion itself is sinusoidal with respect to time and is characterized by a single resonant frequency.

The primary features of SHM include:

1. **Constant Amplitude**: This is the maximum distance the object moves from the equilibrium position.
2. **Constant Period**: This refers to the time required for the object to complete one full cycle of motion.
3. **Constant Frequency**: The frequency, defined as the number of cycles per unit time, remains constant and is the reciprocal of the period.

In SHM, the object's velocity varies throughout its motion; it reaches its maximum at the equilibrium position and is zero at the extremes of its oscillation. Similarly, the acceleration also varies: it is zero when the object is at the equilibrium position and achieves its maximum value at the extremes. The acceleration always acts toward the equilibrium position, which accounts for the oscillatory nature of the motion.

Energy conservation is a key aspect of SHM, with energy oscillating between potential and kinetic forms. When the object is at the extremes of its motion, all energy is potential. Conversely, at the equilibrium position, all energy is kinetic.

Common examples of SHM include the motion of a simple pendulum (at small angles), a mass attached to a spring, and the vibrations of a tuning fork. Each of these systems demonstrates the fundamental characteristics of SHM: a restoring force proportional to displacement, consistent amplitude and period, and conservation of energy.

In summary, simple harmonic motion is a vital concept in physics, distinguished by its constant amplitude and period, as well as the sinusoidal pattern of its oscillations. It serves as a model for a variety of physical systems, ranging from pendulums to atomic vibrations.
