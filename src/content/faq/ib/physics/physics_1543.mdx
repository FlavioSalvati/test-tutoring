The amplitude of the diffraction pattern exhibits variations, being greatest at the central maximum and diminishing towards the fringes.

In a diffraction pattern, the amplitude of the light waves fluctuates due to the phenomenon of interference, which is the fundamental principle underlying diffraction. When a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength, it bends around the obstacle, generating a new wavefront. This process is referred to as diffraction.

The resulting diffraction pattern is characterized by a series of bright and dark fringes. The bright fringes, or maxima, occur where the waves interfere constructively, meaning the crests and troughs of the waves align. This alignment results in an increased amplitude, which corresponds to a higher intensity of light. The central maximum is the brightest spot in the diffraction pattern, exhibiting the highest amplitude.

Conversely, the dark fringes, or minima, arise in regions where the waves interfere destructively. In these areas, the crest of one wave aligns with the trough of another, effectively canceling each other out. This results in a reduced amplitude, which corresponds to a lower intensity of light or even a complete absence of light.

As one moves away from the central maximum towards the edges of the diffraction pattern, the amplitude decreases. This decrease occurs because the path difference between the waves increases, leading to enhanced destructive interference and, consequently, a lower amplitude. The intensity of the fringes also diminishes, causing them to fade towards the edges of the pattern.

In summary, the amplitude within the diffraction pattern is not uniform but varies due to the interference of light waves. It reaches its peak at the central maximum and decreases towards the fringes, reflecting the changing intensity of light across the pattern. A thorough understanding of this concept is essential for interpreting diffraction patterns and appreciating the wave nature of light.
