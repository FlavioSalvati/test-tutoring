Forced frequency and natural frequency are two important concepts in the study of oscillatory systems, each with distinct characteristics.

**Forced Frequency** is defined as the frequency at which an external force is applied to a system. This could range from a simple push on a swing to an electrical signal in a circuit. The system will react to this applied frequency, but its response may be inefficient if the forced frequency differs from its natural frequency. For instance, if you push a swing at a frequency that does not match its natural frequency, the swing will not reach its maximum height. This inefficiency arises because the system is unable to effectively absorb and store the energy from the external force.

In contrast, **Natural Frequency** is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if it were free from external forces. This frequency is determined by the system's inherent physical properties, such as its mass and stiffness. For example, the natural frequency of a guitar string is influenced by its length, tension, and the material from which it is made. When the string is plucked, it vibrates at its natural frequency, producing a specific pitch.

The phenomenon of **Resonance** occurs when the forced frequency matches the natural frequency of a system, leading to a significant increase in response amplitude. This is the reason a glass can shatter when a singer hits the correct note or why a bridge might collapse if soldiers march in step across it. In these scenarios, the energy from the external force is absorbed and stored more effectively, resulting in amplified oscillations.

However, while resonance can be beneficial, it can also have destructive consequences, as illustrated by the previous examples. Engineers must consider resonance when designing structures to ensure that they can withstand specific conditions without failure. To mitigate the risks associated with resonance, they often employ **Damping** techniques. Damping involves dissipating energy to reduce oscillations. A common example is car suspension systems, which utilize shock absorbers to dampen oscillations and promote a smoother ride.

In summary, forced frequency refers to the frequency of an externally applied force, while natural frequency is intrinsic to a system's physical characteristics. The interaction between these two frequencies can result in resonance, which can be advantageous in some cases and hazardous in others.
