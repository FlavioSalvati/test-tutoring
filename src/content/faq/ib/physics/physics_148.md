In transverse waves, the direction of polarization is always perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

To elaborate, transverse waves are characterized by oscillations or vibrations that occur at right angles to the direction the wave travels. This is distinct from longitudinal waves, where the oscillations occur in the same direction as the wave's travel. Examples of transverse waves include light waves, radio waves, and seismic S-waves.

Polarization is an important property of waves that describes the orientation of their oscillations. For transverse waves, this can be visualized as the direction in which the wave "wiggles." When the direction of oscillation remains fixed, the wave is referred to as linearly polarized. Conversely, if the direction of oscillation changes or rotates, the wave is classified as circularly or elliptically polarized.

The key relationship between polarization and wave direction in transverse waves is that polarization is always perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. This means that if you observe a transverse wave moving toward you, the polarization represents the direction in which the wave is "wiggling" from side to side.

For instance, consider a light wave traveling from a distant star to your eye. The direction of wave propagation is from the star to your eye, while the polarization corresponds to the direction in which the electric field of the light wave oscillates. This oscillation could be oriented vertically (up and down), horizontally (left and right), or at any angle in between, but it will always remain at right angles to the line of travel from the star to your eye.

This relationship is a fundamental characteristic of transverse waves and arises directly from their generation and propagation mechanisms. It serves as the basis for various technologies and scientific methods, such as polarized sunglasses, which function by blocking light waves that are polarized in a specific direction, and polarimetry, a technique used to measure and analyze the polarization of light.
