Bohr's model significantly advanced our understanding of atomic structure by introducing the concept of quantized energy levels for electrons within atoms.

Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, proposed his atomic model in 1913, marking a major advancement over earlier models developed by J.J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford. Bohr's model was groundbreaking because it introduced the idea that electrons exist only in specific energy states, or levels. Electrons can transition between these states by absorbing or emitting energy.

Prior to Bohr's model, Rutherford's atomic theory had a critical flaw. It suggested that electrons orbit the nucleus in a manner analogous to planets orbiting the sun. However, according to classical physics, such orbital motion would cause electrons to continuously lose energy, ultimately spiraling into the nucleus and resulting in the collapse of the atom. This prediction contradicted the observed stability of atoms.

Bohr addressed this issue by asserting that electrons can occupy only certain fixed orbits, or energy levels. An electron can ascend from a lower energy level to a higher one by absorbing a specific amount of energy, or it can descend from a higher energy level to a lower one by emitting a specific amount of energy. This energy is often released in the form of light, which accounts for the line spectra observed in experimental studies.

Moreover, Bohr's model successfully predicted the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom, a notable accomplishment that previous models had failed to achieve. The model indicated that the various spectral lines correspond to different transitions between energy levels of the electron in the hydrogen atom.

Nevertheless, Bohr's model has its limitations. While it effectively describes single-electron systems like hydrogen, it falls short in accurately predicting the behavior of multi-electron atoms. Despite these limitations, Bohr's model was a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum mechanics and significantly enhanced our comprehension of atomic structure.
