Shorter wavelengths provide better resolution because they can detect smaller details that longer wavelengths cannot.

In physics, the concept of resolution is closely tied to the wavelength of the wave being used. The resolution of an imaging system, such as a microscope or telescope, is essentially its ability to distinguish between two points or objects that are very close together. The shorter the wavelength of the light (or other form of electromagnetic radiation) being used, the better the resolution.

This is because when light interacts with an object, it can either be absorbed, reflected, refracted, or diffracted. Diffraction is the bending of light around the corners of an obstacle or aperture. The amount of diffraction that occurs is directly proportional to the wavelength of the light. Therefore, shorter wavelengths will diffract less and can more accurately pinpoint the location of an object, leading to a higher resolution image. For a more detailed understanding, you might find the page on helpful.

The principle of diffraction limits the resolution of an imaging system. This is known as the diffraction limit. The diffraction limit is given by the formula: Resolution = 1.22 * (wavelength / aperture diameter). From this formula, it is clear that as the wavelength decreases, the resolution improves. The concept of due to diffraction is crucial in understanding this principle in depth.
