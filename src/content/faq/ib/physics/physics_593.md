Static friction is the force that prevents an object from initiating motion, while dynamic friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object already in motion.

Static friction, often referred to as starting or limiting friction, is the force that must be overcome to set a stationary object into motion. This force acts when the object remains at rest and opposes any applied force that attempts to move it. The magnitude of static friction can vary based on the applied force, but it has a maximum threshold. This maximum limit is influenced by the characteristics of the surfaces in contact and the normal force acting between them. Once the applied force exceeds this maximum limit, the object begins to move, and static friction no longer applies.

Conversely, dynamic friction, also known as kinetic friction, is the frictional force acting on an object that is already in motion. This force opposes the direction of movement, working to slow down or halt the moving object. Unlike static friction, dynamic friction remains constant and does not change with the applied force, provided that the nature of the surfaces and the normal force remain unchanged during motion.

The primary distinction between static and dynamic friction lies in their functions and behaviors. Static friction prevents motion and adjusts according to the applied force until reaching its maximum limit, while dynamic friction consistently resists motion as long as the object is in motion.

Understanding the differences between static and dynamic friction is essential in practical applications. For example, in vehicle design, engineers must account for static friction to ensure adequate tire grip when a vehicle starts to move, as well as dynamic friction for effective braking and vehicle control while it is in motion. Similarly, in sports such as football or cricket, players must comprehend these frictional forces to adeptly control the ball.

In summary, static and dynamic friction are fundamental concepts in physics that describe the forces opposing motion. However, they operate under different conditions and exhibit distinct characteristics.
