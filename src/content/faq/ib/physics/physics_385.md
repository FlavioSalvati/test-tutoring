The momentum of a moving object is determined by the product of its mass and velocity.

Momentum, denoted by the symbol $p$, is a fundamental concept in physics. It is classified as a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude (size) and direction. The momentum of an object can be expressed using the formula:

$$
p = mv
$$

where $m$ represents the mass of the object and $v$ represents its velocity. 

In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of momentum is kilogram meter per second ($\text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}$). It is essential to note that because velocity is a vector, momentum is also a vector and shares the same directional orientation as the velocity vector.

To illustrate this concept, consider an example involving a car. If a car has a mass of $1500 \, \text{kg}$ and is traveling north at a speed of $20 \, \text{m/s}$, we can calculate its momentum by multiplying its mass by its velocity. Therefore, the momentum of the car is given by:

$$
p = 1500 \, \text{kg} \times 20 \, \text{m/s} = 30000 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \text{ north}
$$

The principle of conservation of momentum plays a critical role in physics. It asserts that the total momentum of a closed system—one that does not exchange forces with external entities—remains constant. This principle is particularly valuable for analyzing scenarios involving collisions and explosions.

In summary, grasping the concepts of momentum and its calculation is vital in physics. It aids in understanding not only the motion of individual objects but also their interactions with one another. Remember that the momentum of an object is simply the product of its mass and velocity, and it consistently points in the same direction as the velocity vector.
