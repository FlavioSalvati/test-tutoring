Magnetic fields exert forces on moving charged particles, compelling them to travel in circular or helical trajectories.

To elaborate, the interaction between magnetic fields and moving charges is a fundamental principle in physics. When a charged particle, such as an electron or a proton, traverses a magnetic field, it experiences a force known as the Lorentz force. This force is always perpendicular to both the particle's direction of motion and the direction of the magnetic field.

The magnitude of the Lorentz force can be expressed as:

$$
F = q v B \sin(\theta)
$$

where:
- $F$ is the magnitude of the force,
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $v$ is the velocity of the particle,
- $B$ is the strength of the magnetic field, and
- $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector.

If the particle moves parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field lines, it experiences no force ($F = 0$). However, when the particle moves perpendicular to the magnetic field, the force reaches its maximum value.

The direction of the Lorentz force can be determined using Fleming's left-hand rule. To apply this rule, extend your left hand such that your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger are mutually perpendicular. Position your forefinger in the direction of the magnetic field, your thumb in the direction of the positive charge's motion, and your middle finger will then point in the direction of the force acting on the particle.

The force exerted on the charged particle results in a circular or helical motion. The radius of this trajectory is influenced by the particle's mass, velocity, and the strength of the magnetic field. Specifically, a faster-moving particle or a stronger magnetic field results in a smaller radius of curvature. Conversely, a heavier particle will have a larger radius.

This principle has numerous applications, ranging from large-scale phenomena, such as the Earth's magnetic field deflecting charged particles from the sun, to smaller-scale applications, like the operation of cathode ray tubes in older television sets. A thorough understanding of how magnetic fields affect moving charges is essential in various fields, including electronics, telecommunications, and particle physics.
