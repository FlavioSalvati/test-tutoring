An object experiencing constant acceleration moves in a straight line, increasing its velocity at a uniform rate.

To elaborate, constant acceleration refers to a situation where the rate of change of an object's velocity remains steady over time. This principle is essential in physics, particularly within the realm of motion, commonly referred to as kinematics. As long as the acceleration is constant, the object will either continue to speed up (if the acceleration is positive) or slow down (if the acceleration is negative) at this consistent rate.

The motion of an object under constant acceleration can be described using the equations of motion, often called the 'suvat' equations. These equations relate the object's initial velocity ($u$), final velocity ($v$), acceleration ($a$), time taken ($t$), and distance traveled ($s$). They are derived from the definitions of velocity and acceleration and enable us to predict the future motion of the object or analyze its past motion.

For instance, the equation 

$$
v = u + at
$$

indicates that the final velocity of the object is equal to its initial velocity plus the product of its acceleration and the time taken. This equation illustrates that if the acceleration is positive, the object's velocity will increase over time, whereas a negative acceleration will cause the velocity to decrease.

Another important equation is 

$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2,
$$

which states that the distance traveled by the object is equal to the product of its initial velocity and the time taken, plus half the product of its acceleration and the square of the time taken. This means that even if the initial velocity is zero, the object will still cover a distance if there is a constant acceleration acting on it.

In a graphical representation, the velocity-time graph of an object in constant acceleration forms a straight line, where the slope of the line corresponds to the acceleration. The area beneath this graph represents the distance traveled by the object.

In summary, the motion of an object under constant acceleration is a fundamental concept in physics, with broad applications ranging from everyday experiences to advanced scientific research. A solid understanding of this concept and the associated equations of motion is essential for anyone studying physics.
