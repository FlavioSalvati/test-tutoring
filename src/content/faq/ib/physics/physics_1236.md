Nuclear reactions and chemical reactions represent two fundamentally distinct processes that occur within matter. The primary difference between these two types of reactions lies in the specific part of the atom they affect and the associated energy changes.

In a nuclear reaction, the nucleus of an atom undergoes alteration. This can happen through processes such as fusion, in which two atomic nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus, or fission, where a large nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei. Nuclear reactions are typically accompanied by substantial energy changes, often releasing energy in the form of radiation. This significant energy release occurs because the forces involved in nuclear reactions—specifically the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force—are considerably stronger than those governing chemical reactions.

Conversely, chemical reactions involve changes in the electron shells of atoms. These reactions transpire when atoms share, donate, or accept electrons in an effort to attain a stable electron configuration. The energy changes associated with chemical reactions are much smaller compared to those in nuclear reactions, as they are governed by the electromagnetic force, which is weaker than the nuclear forces.

Moreover, nuclear reactions have the capacity to transmute one element into another, as they can alter the number of protons in the nucleus—the defining characteristic of an element. In contrast, chemical reactions cannot change one element into another; they only involve alterations in the bonding between atoms without modifying the atoms themselves.

In terms of practical applications, nuclear reactions are harnessed in nuclear power plants and atomic bombs, while chemical reactions play a crucial role in a myriad of processes, from food metabolism in our bodies to the combustion of fuels in automobiles.

In summary, although both nuclear and chemical reactions involve changes in atoms, they differ significantly in the parts of the atom they affect, the forces and energy changes involved, and their respective practical applications.
