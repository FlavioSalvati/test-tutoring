Eddy currents are a phenomenon arising from electromagnetic induction, which occurs when a conductor moves within a changing magnetic field.

Electromagnetic induction is a foundational principle in physics, first described by Michael Faraday in $1831$. This principle explains how a changing magnetic field within a closed loop of wire induces an electromotive force (EMF), consequently causing an electric current to flow. This fundamental concept underpins many electrical and electronic devices, including transformers, electric generators, and induction motors.

Eddy currents represent a specific instance of electromagnetic induction. They are circulating currents that form within a conductor when it is subjected to a changing magnetic field. The term "eddy" is used to evoke the swirling motion of these currents, akin to the eddies observed in a flowing river. These currents flow in closed loops within the conductor and are oriented perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field.

The generation of eddy currents is influenced by the same factors that govern electromagnetic induction. The magnitude of the induced EMF—and, consequently, the strength of the eddy currents—is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the number of loops present. This relationship is articulated by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.

While electromagnetic induction is often a desired effect for generating electricity or transferring energy, eddy currents are typically seen as undesirable. They result in energy loss, as the currents generate heat within the conductor, leading to inefficiencies in electrical devices and potential damage if not properly managed. To mitigate the effects of eddy currents, various strategies are employed, such as laminating the core materials in transformers or selecting materials with higher resistivity.

In conclusion, eddy currents are a direct consequence of electromagnetic induction, arising when a conductor is exposed to a changing magnetic field. They exemplify a specific, often unwanted outcome of this fundamental physical principle. A comprehensive understanding of both electromagnetic induction and eddy currents is essential for the effective design and operation of numerous electrical and electronic devices.
