A pendulum demonstrates Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) due to the restoring force that acts toward its equilibrium position.

Pendulums, such as swings or grandfather clocks, serve as classic examples of systems exhibiting SHM. This type of motion is characterized by a restoring force that is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the opposite direction to that displacement. In the case of a pendulum, gravity serves as the restoring force, pulling the pendulum back toward its equilibrium position. If you're interested in learning more about the fundamentals of SHM, additional resources are available.

When a pendulum is displaced from its equilibrium position and subsequently released, it begins to swing back and forth. This oscillatory motion results from gravity acting on the pendulum, drawing it back toward the center. The gravitational force exerted on the pendulum is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position, which is a defining characteristic of SHM.

The motion of the pendulum can be mathematically represented by the equations of SHM, which can take the form of sine or cosine functions. The amplitude of the motion—defined as the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position—remains constant, along with the period, which is the time taken to complete one full cycle of motion. This constancy arises because the force of gravity is uniform, and the length of the pendulum, which influences the period of motion, does not change. A deeper understanding of these principles can provide insights into the energy transformations that underpin the pendulum's motion.

It is crucial to recognize that the assumption of SHM for a pendulum is an approximation that holds true only for small angles of displacement, typically less than about $15^\circ$. This limitation exists because the restoring force is only accurately proportional to the displacement within this small angle range. For larger angles, the relationship between force and displacement becomes non-linear, and the motion deviates from true simple harmonic behavior. Additionally, various factors can influence the pendulum's motion, particularly under non-ideal conditions.

In summary, a pendulum exhibits SHM because the force of gravity provides a restoring force that is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position, resulting in the pendulum oscillating back and forth. The motion can be described using the equations of SHM, characterized by a constant amplitude and period. However, this description is an approximation that is valid primarily for small angles of displacement.
