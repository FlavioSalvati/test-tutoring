Waves exhibit a tendency to bend around obstacles due to a phenomenon known as diffraction.

Diffraction is an essential property of all types of waves, including sound, light, and water waves. It describes the bending of waves as they encounter obstacles or the spreading of waves after passing through a narrow opening. This effect becomes particularly prominent when the size of the obstacle or the opening is comparable to the wavelength of the wave.

The principle of diffraction can be understood through Huygens' principle, which posits that every point on a wavefront can be regarded as a source of secondary wavelets. These secondary wavelets propagate outward in all directions at the same speed as the original wave. When the wave interacts with an obstacle or a gap, the wavelets at the edges continue to spread, resulting in the bending of the wave around corners.

The degree of bending, or diffraction, is influenced by both the wavelength of the wave and the dimensions of the obstacle or gap. If the wavelength is significantly smaller than the size of the obstacle or gap, the wave tends to maintain a straight path with minimal bending. Conversely, if the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the obstacle or gap, the wave exhibits considerable bending. This explains why low-frequency (long-wavelength) sound waves can be perceived around corners, while high-frequency (short-wavelength) light waves typically cannot.

In the case of light waves, diffraction leads to the emergence of light and dark patterns, known as interference patterns, when light passes through a narrow slit or around a small object. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in various scientific and technological applications, such as diffraction gratings, which are employed to separate light into its constituent colors in spectroscopy.

In summary, the bending of waves around corners is a manifestation of diffraction. This fundamental wave characteristic is integral to numerous scientific and technological advancements.
