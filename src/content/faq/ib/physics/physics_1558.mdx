Young's interference and single-slit diffraction are two fundamental phenomena in wave optics, each generating distinct light patterns due to the behavior of light waves.

**Young's Interference (Double-Slit Interference)**

Young's interference, commonly referred to as double-slit interference, occurs when coherent light waves pass through two closely spaced slits. This experiment, first conducted by Thomas Young in the early 19th century, demonstrates how light behaves as a wave. When light waves emerge from the slits, they spread out and overlap, resulting in an interference pattern characterized by alternating bright and dark fringes on a screen. 

The bright fringes, known as maxima, appear where the waves constructively interfere, meaning their amplitudes add together to create a wave of greater intensity. Conversely, the dark fringes, or minima, arise from destructive interference, where the waves cancel each other out. The interference pattern is symmetrical around a central maximum, which is the brightest point. This fascinating behavior highlights the wave nature of light and is explained in greater detail in literature on wave optics.

**Single-Slit Diffraction**

In contrast, single-slit diffraction occurs when light passes through a single slit. This scenario produces a diffraction pattern featuring a prominent central bright fringe, or maximum, flanked by a series of progressively dimmer fringes on both sides. The central maximum is notably brighter and wider than the surrounding fringes. 

This phenomenon occurs because as light waves diffract through the slit, they spread out and interfere with one another on the other side. The central maximum arises from constructive interference of the waves, while the weaker fringes result from destructive interference. Unlike the double-slit interference pattern, the single-slit diffraction pattern is asymmetrical, with the intensity of the fringes diminishing as one moves away from the central maximum. The principles of diffraction and the resulting patterns are elaborated upon in discussions of wave behavior in optics.

**Summary**

In summary, Young's interference, or double-slit interference, yields a pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes due to the interaction of light waves from two sources. In contrast, single-slit diffraction results in a bright central fringe with fainter fringes on either side, caused by the spreading and overlapping of waves from a single source. Essentially, the first phenomenon involves the mixing of light waves from two slits, while the latter involves the diffraction of waves passing through one slit. For a deeper understanding of how these patterns form from a physics standpoint, consider exploring resources that explain the propagation of light waves in detail.
