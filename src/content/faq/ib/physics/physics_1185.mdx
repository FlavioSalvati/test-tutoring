The gravitational force acting on an object depends on three key factors: its mass, the mass of another object, and the distance separating them.

Gravitational force is a fundamental interaction that attracts two objects toward one another. It is governed by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which asserts that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
$$

where:
- $ F $ is the gravitational force between the objects,
- $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two objects,
- $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two objects, and
- $ G $ is the gravitational constant.

The first factor influencing gravitational force is the mass of the object itself. The greater the mass, the stronger the gravitational force it experiences. This implies that if one object has twice the mass of another, it will experience double the gravitational force.

The second factor is the mass of the other object involved in the interaction. The gravitational force experienced by an object is directly proportional to the mass of the other object. Therefore, if the mass of the other object is doubled, the gravitational force acting on the first object will also double.

The third factor is the distance between the two objects. The gravitational force diminishes with the square of the distance. Specifically, if the distance is doubled, the gravitational force reduces to a quarter of its original value. Conversely, if the distance is halved, the gravitational force increases fourfold.

In summary, the gravitational force on an object is influenced by its mass, the mass of another object, and the distance between them. This relationship is encapsulated in Newton's law of universal gravitation, which provides a formula to calculate the gravitational force. Understanding these factors is essential in physics, as it enables us to predict the motion of objects under the influence of gravity.
