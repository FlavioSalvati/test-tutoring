The potential energy in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) can be calculated using the formula 

$$
PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2,
$$

where $PE$ represents potential energy, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

In SHM, potential energy (PE) is the energy stored in the system due to its position or configuration. It is one of the two forms of energy in SHM, the other being kinetic energy. The potential energy is directly proportional to the square of the displacement from the equilibrium position, meaning that as the displacement increases, the potential energy increases significantly.

The spring constant $k$ is a measure of the stiffness of the spring. It is defined as the force required to compress or extend the spring by a unit length. The spring constant is always a positive value, as a force must be applied to change the length of the spring. Conversely, the displacement $x$ represents the distance the object has moved from its equilibrium position and can take on both positive and negative values, depending on the direction of the movement.

Potential energy reaches its maximum at the extreme positions of the motion, where the displacement is at its peak, and it is at a minimum (zero) when the object is at the equilibrium position. This relationship holds because the displacement from the equilibrium position is greatest at the extremes and zero at equilibrium. Consequently, since potential energy is proportional to the square of the displacement, it attains its highest value at the extremes of the motion and is zero at the equilibrium position.

In SHM, the total energy of the system, which is the sum of kinetic and potential energies, remains constant. This conservation of energy means that when potential energy is at its maximum, kinetic energy is at its minimum (zero), and vice versa. As the object oscillates, energy is continuously transferred between kinetic and potential forms.

In summary, the potential energy in SHM is calculated using the formula 

$$
PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2.
$$ 

It is directly proportional to the square of the displacement from the equilibrium position, fluctuating between a maximum value at the extreme positions and a minimum value at the equilibrium position.
