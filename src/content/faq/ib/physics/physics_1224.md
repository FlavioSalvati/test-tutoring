Electrons transition between energy levels when they absorb or emit energy, typically in the form of light or heat.

To elaborate, electrons reside in specific energy levels around an atom's nucleus. These energy levels, also referred to as shells or orbits, are not random; they are defined by the quantum mechanical model of the atom. Each energy level can accommodate a certain number of electrons and is associated with a distinct amount of energy.

When an electron absorbs energy, it can "jump" from a lower energy level to a higher one. This phenomenon is known as excitation. The energy absorbed is precisely equal to the difference in energy between the two levels. Various sources, such as light (in the form of photons), heat, or collisions with other particles, can provide this energy.

For instance, when an atom is exposed to light of a specific frequency, the energy of the light can be absorbed by an electron. If the energy of the photon matches the energy difference between the electron's current level and a higher level, the electron will absorb the energy and transition to the higher level. This selective absorption explains why atoms can absorb light of certain frequencies while remaining transparent to othersâ€”the energy of the light must correspond to an energy difference between the levels.

Conversely, when an electron "falls" from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits energy. This energy is typically released in the form of light, and the frequency of this emitted light corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels. This principle underlies various forms of light emission, including the glow of neon lights and the vibrant colors seen in fireworks.

In summary, the movement of electrons between energy levels is a fundamental process in both physics and chemistry. It is driven by the absorption or emission of energy and plays a crucial role in producing the colors and forms of light we observe in our surroundings.
