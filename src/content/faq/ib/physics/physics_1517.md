Diffraction and interference are two fundamental phenomena associated with waves, each with distinct characteristics.

**Diffraction** refers to the bending of waves as they encounter obstacles or pass through narrow openings. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced when the size of the obstacle or aperture is comparable to the wavelength of the wave. When waves diffract, they can spread into regions that would otherwise be in the geometrical shadow of the obstacle or aperture. This behavior can be observed in various types of waves, including light, sound, and water waves. For instance, when light passes through a narrow slit and is projected onto a screen, a pattern of alternating light and dark bands emerges. This pattern is a direct result of the diffraction of light.

$$
\text{Diffraction occurs significantly when } d \approx \lambda,
$$

where $d$ is the width of the slit or obstacle and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the wave.

**Interference**, in contrast, involves the superposition of two or more overlapping waves, leading to the formation of a new wave. When waves meet, they interact with each other. If the waves are in phase—meaning their peaks and troughs align—they interfere constructively, resulting in a wave with a greater amplitude. Conversely, if the waves are out of phase—where the peak of one wave coincides with the trough of another—they interfere destructively, producing a wave with a reduced amplitude or potentially canceling each other out completely. This phenomenon is also observable in light, sound, and water waves. A classic example is the double-slit experiment with light, where an interference pattern of alternating light and dark bands appears on a screen. This pattern is created by the constructive and destructive interference of light waves.

$$
\text{Constructive interference occurs when } \Delta \phi = 2n\pi,
$$
$$
\text{Destructive interference occurs when } \Delta \phi = (2n+1)\pi,
$$

where $\Delta \phi$ represents the phase difference between the waves and $n$ is an integer.

In summary, while diffraction and interference are both essential characteristics of wave behavior, they highlight different aspects of how waves interact. Diffraction explains how waves bend around obstacles or pass through openings, while interference illustrates how waves combine when they overlap. Understanding both phenomena is crucial for grasping the wave nature of light, sound, and other forms of waves.
