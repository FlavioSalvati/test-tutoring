Absolute uncertainty is the actual numerical uncertainty, while relative uncertainty is the ratio of absolute uncertainty to the measured value.

Absolute uncertainty is a type of error which describes how much the measured value could be above or below the actual value. It is usually given as a fixed quantity, in the same units as the measurement. For example, if you measure the length of a table with a ruler and get a result of 100 cm ± 1 cm, the ±1 cm is the absolute uncertainty. It gives you an idea of the range within which the true value lies. For a deeper understanding of how tools and measurements impact uncertainty, consider reading about .

On the other hand, relative uncertainty is a measure of the uncertainty in relation to the size of the measurement. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the measured value. For instance, if you have a measurement of 100 cm with an absolute uncertainty of 1 cm, the relative uncertainty would be 1/100 = 0.01, or 1%. This tells you how significant the uncertainty is in relation to the measurement. The difference between these two types of uncertainty is crucial in experiments and is further detailed in our exploration of .

The choice between using absolute or relative uncertainty often depends on the context. If you're comparing measurements that have the same units, absolute uncertainty can be more useful. However, if you're comparing measurements with different units or vastly different magnitudes, relative uncertainty can provide a more meaningful comparison. Additionally, understanding the difference between can further clarify why selecting the appropriate type of uncertainty is fundamental in scientific analysis.

In physics experiments, both types of uncertainties are important. Absolute uncertainty helps in understanding the precision of the instrument used for measurement. For example, a ruler with markings at every 1 cm has an absolute uncertainty of ±0.5 cm. Relative uncertainty, however, gives an idea about the reliability of the measurement. A low relative uncertainty means the measurement is quite reliable, while a high relative uncertainty indicates a less reliable measurement.

Absolute uncertainty shows the range of error in the same units as your measurement, like measuring a table to be 100 cm ± 1 cm. Relative uncertainty compares this error to the actual measurement, turning it into a percentage, for example, 1%. Absolute uncertainty helps understand an instrument's precision, while relative uncertainty tells you how reliable a measurement is.
