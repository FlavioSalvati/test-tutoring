The frequency of the $n$th harmonic can be computed by multiplying the fundamental frequency by the harmonic number $n$.

To elaborate, the fundamental frequency, also referred to as the first harmonic, is the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform. In a musical context, it corresponds to the pitch of a note, while in physics, it represents the lowest resonance frequency of a vibrating object. Conversely, the $n$th harmonic is defined as a whole number multiple of this fundamental frequency.

To determine the frequency of the $n$th harmonic, you simply multiply the fundamental frequency by the harmonic number. For instance, if the fundamental frequency is $50 \, \text{Hz}$, then the frequency of the second harmonic (where $n=2$) would be calculated as:

$$
f_2 = 2 \times 50 = 100 \, \text{Hz}
$$

Similarly, the frequency of the third harmonic (where $n=3$) would be:

$$
f_3 = 3 \times 50 = 150 \, \text{Hz}
$$

This calculation continues for higher harmonics as well.

This concept is rooted in the physics of waves and vibrations. When an object vibrates or a wave oscillates, it does so at specific frequencies known as resonant frequencies. The fundamental frequency is the lowest of these frequencies, and each harmonic represents a higher resonant frequency. These harmonics create a series, where each harmonic is a whole number multiple of the fundamental frequency.

Understanding this principle is essential in various fields such as physics, engineering, acoustics, telecommunications, and signal processing. It is also foundational to music theory, where the harmonics of a note contribute to its timbre or tone color. Consequently, mastering the calculation and application of harmonics is a vital skill across these disciplines.

In summary, the frequency of the $n$th harmonic is calculated as the product of the fundamental frequency and the harmonic number:

$$
f_n = f_1 \times n
$$

This straightforward formula allows you to determine the frequency of any harmonic, provided you know the fundamental frequency.
