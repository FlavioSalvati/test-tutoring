Momentum is conserved in a two-car collision, which means that the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

In a two-car collision, the principle of conservation of momentum asserts that the total momentum of the system—comprising both cars—prior to the collision is identical to the total momentum of the system afterward. This principle holds true for both elastic and inelastic collisions.

To grasp this concept, let's examine the momentum of each car. Momentum, denoted as $p$, is defined as the product of an object's mass $m$ and its velocity $v$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
p = mv
$$

Before the collision, each car possesses its own momentum, which is contingent upon its mass and velocity. The total momentum of the system is the vector sum of the momenta of the two cars.

During the collision, forces act between the two vehicles. According to Newton's third law, these forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Consequently, the change in momentum of one car is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the change in momentum of the other car. This results in a total change in momentum for the entire system being zero.

After the collision, while the cars may have different velocities—and thus different momenta—the total momentum of the system remains unchanged compared to before the collision. This is due to the fact that the changes in the momenta of the two cars during the collision effectively cancel each other out.

In summary, the conservation of momentum in a two-car collision arises from Newton's third law and the definition of momentum. It is a fundamental principle of physics that is applicable to all types of collisions and interactions between objects. This principle enables us to predict the motion of objects following a collision, provided we know their masses and initial velocities.
