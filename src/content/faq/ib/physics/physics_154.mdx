The boundary behavior of waves describes how waves interact when they encounter an interface between two different media.

In physics, when waves meet a boundary separating two distinct media, they can be reflected, refracted, or absorbed. This interaction is collectively referred to as the boundary behavior of waves. The specific response of the waves depends on the characteristics of both the waves themselves and the media they are interacting with.

**Reflection** occurs when a wave strikes a boundary and bounces back into the original medium. This phenomenon is akin to how light reflects off a mirror. According to the law of reflection, the angle at which the wave approaches the boundary, known as the angle of incidence, is equal to the angle at which it reflects, termed the angle of reflection.

**Refraction** takes place when a wave crosses into a new medium, resulting in a change in direction. This bending occurs because the wave alters its speed upon entering the new medium. The degree of bending, or refraction, is determined by the change in speed and is governed by Snell's law.

**Absorption** happens when a wave encounters a boundary and its energy is absorbed by the new medium. As a result, the wave may lose amplitude and may ultimately dissipate. The extent of absorption is influenced by the properties of both the wave and the new medium.

In addition to reflection, refraction, and absorption, waves can also experience **transmission**, where they continue through the new medium without altering their direction, and **diffraction**, where they spread out after passing through a narrow gap or around an obstacle.

Understanding the boundary behavior of waves is fundamental to the study of wave physics and is essential for comprehending numerous natural phenomena and technological applications. For instance, it elucidates why rainbows occur, how lenses enhance our vision, and the principles behind radar and sonar technologies. This knowledge is crucial for fields such as optics, acoustics, and telecommunications, where the behavior of light and sound plays a significant role.
