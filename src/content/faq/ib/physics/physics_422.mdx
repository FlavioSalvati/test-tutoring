Objects slide down inclined planes due to the gravitational force acting on them, which can be resolved into two distinct components.

When an object is positioned on an inclined plane, the gravitational force can be decomposed into two components: one that acts perpendicular to the surface of the plane and another that acts parallel to it. The component of gravitational force that acts perpendicular to the plane is responsible for keeping the object in contact with the surface. This perpendicular force is balanced by the normal force, which is the reaction force exerted by the surface of the inclined plane on the object.

In contrast, the component of gravitational force that acts parallel to the plane is what causes the object to slide downwards. This parallel component is unopposed, meaning there are no other forces acting in the opposite direction to counteract it. Consequently, the object experiences an acceleration down the plane. As the angle of the incline increases, the magnitude of this parallel component of gravitational force also increases, resulting in a greater acceleration and faster sliding of the object.

Friction between the object and the inclined plane can significantly influence the motion of the object as well. If the frictional force is sufficiently strong, it may counterbalance the parallel component of the gravitational force, preventing the object from sliding down the plane. Conversely, if the frictional force is inadequate to oppose this gravitational component, or if friction is absent altogether, the object will descend the plane.

In summary, objects slide down inclined planes due to the unbalanced component of gravitational force acting parallel to the plane, which causes acceleration. The steeper the incline, the larger this force becomes, leading to an increased sliding speed. Friction can either assist or impede this motion based on its strength relative to the gravitational component trying to induce movement.
