Transverse waves vibrate in a direction that is perpendicular to their direction of propagation, while longitudinal waves vibrate parallel to their direction of propagation.

Transverse waves are characterized by the movement of the medium (the material through which the wave travels) in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. This means that the particles of the medium oscillate up and down (or side to side) while the energy of the wave propagates forward. Common examples of transverse waves include light waves, radio waves, and the ripples formed on the surface of water when a stone is dropped into it.

In contrast, longitudinal waves are defined by the movement of the medium in a direction that is parallel to the direction of energy transport. In this case, the particles of the medium move back and forth along the same direction as the wave travels. Notable examples of longitudinal waves include sound waves and seismic P-waves (primary waves associated with earthquakes).

The differing movements of the medium in transverse and longitudinal waves also result in distinct wave diagrams. A transverse wave diagram features crests and troughs, which indicate the maximum displacements of the medium in the positive and negative directions, respectively. Conversely, a longitudinal wave diagram displays compressions and rarefactions, representing areas where the medium is compressed and stretched, respectively.

Regarding polarization, only transverse waves can exhibit this phenomenon. Polarization refers to the orientation of the oscillations of a wave. For transverse waves, this orientation can be vertical, horizontal, or at any angle in between. In contrast, longitudinal waves cannot be polarized, as their oscillations occur along the direction of wave propagation.

In summary, the primary distinction between transverse and longitudinal waves lies in the direction of vibration relative to the direction of wave propagation. This difference results in other defining characteristics, such as the ability of transverse waves to be polarized and the unique representations in their wave diagrams.
