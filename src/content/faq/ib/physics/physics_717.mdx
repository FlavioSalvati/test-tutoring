The principle of wave-particle duality posits that all particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.

Wave-particle duality is a core concept in quantum mechanics, the branch of physics that examines the behavior of particles at the smallest scales. This principle indicates that all entities, including both light and matter, possess characteristics of both waves and particles. This marks a significant departure from classical physics, where objects are classified either as waves (such as light or sound) or as particles (such as electrons or protons), but not as both simultaneously.

The notion of wave-particle duality emerged in the early 20th century as scientists sought to unravel the nature of light. Experimental evidence revealed that light can behave as a particle, as demonstrated by the photoelectric effect. In this phenomenon, light striking a material can cause the ejection of electrons. Conversely, light also displays wave-like behaviors, such as interference and diffraction, which are phenomena typically associated with waves.

Similarly, matter, which was traditionally understood to consist solely of particles, was found to exhibit wave-like behavior as well. This was famously illustrated by the double-slit experiment. In this experiment, electrons (considered as particles) are directed at a barrier with two slits. Rather than producing two distinct spots on the screen behind the barrier—an expectation based on particle behavior—an interference pattern emerges, indicating wave-like characteristics.

The principle of wave-particle duality is succinctly captured by the de Broglie hypothesis, proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1924. He asserted that all matter possesses a wave-like nature, with the wavelength of this wave being inversely proportional to its momentum. This revolutionary idea implies that even macroscopic objects, such as a football, have a wavelength, albeit one that is exceedingly small and practically unobservable.

In summary, wave-particle duality is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics that challenges our classical understanding of reality. It suggests that the universe is far more complex and counterintuitive than we may assume. This concept continues to captivate and perplex physicists and is fundamental to our comprehension of the universe at its most minute scales.
