Torque is a measure of the force that can induce an object to rotate around a specific axis, while force itself is defined as a push or pull exerted on an object.

Both torque and force are fundamental concepts in physics, but they pertain to different phenomena. Force is a vector quantity that quantifies the push or pull acting on an object. It is measured in newtons ($N$) and possesses both magnitude and direction. According to Newton's second law of motion, force can initiate motion or alter an object's existing motion. The effect of a force on an object is influenced by its mass and the acceleration produced by the force.

Conversely, torque, also referred to as the moment of force, is a measure of how much a force can cause an object to rotate about an axis. Like force, torque is a vector quantity, measured in newton-meters ($N \cdot m$). The value of torque depends on three key factors: the magnitude of the applied force, the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied, and the angle between the force vector and the lever arm. The primary effect of torque is to generate rotational motion.

While force is associated with linear motion, torque is linked to rotational motion. For instance, when you push a door open, you exert a force on the door. However, the door rotates about its hinges due to the torque you generate. Notably, applying the force further from the hinge requires less effort to achieve the same rotational effect, illustrating the significance of the distance factor in torque.

In summary, although both force and torque involve actions that can be described as a push or pull, they are applied in distinct contexts. Force pertains to altering the linear motion of an object, whereas torque is concerned with changing the rotational motion of an object. Understanding the differences between these two concepts is essential in the study of physics, as they form the foundation for many principles and laws that describe how objects move and interact with one another.
