The forces acting on a sliding block include gravity, friction, and any external applied force.

The first and primary force is gravity. This force pulls all objects toward the center of the Earth and acts vertically downwards. Its magnitude is calculated by multiplying the mass of the block by the acceleration due to gravity, denoted as $g$. This gravitational force is always present, regardless of whether the block is in motion.

The second force is friction. As a block slides across a surface, it encounters resistance due to the interaction between the block and the surface, which is referred to as friction. The frictional force acts parallel to the surface and opposes the motion of the block. The magnitude of the frictional force is influenced by two key factors: the characteristics of the surfaces in contact, represented by the coefficient of friction, and the normal force. The normal force is the perpendicular force exerted by the surface on the block, and in the case of a sliding block, it is equal to the weight of the block, which is the gravitational force acting on it.

Finally, there may be an applied force, which is any external force acting on the block, such as a push or a pull. The direction of this applied force can change depending on the situation. For instance, if you push the block along the surface, the applied force aligns with the direction of motion. Conversely, if you pull the block, the applied force might act at an angle relative to the surface.

In summary, a sliding block experiences three main forces: the downward force of gravity, the opposing frictional force, and any external applied force. The net force acting on the block is the vector sum of these forces. According to Newton's second law of motion, this net force is equal to the mass of the block multiplied by its acceleration. Consequently, by analyzing these forces, one can predict the motion of the block.
