Michelson interferometers harness the principle of interference to make highly accurate measurements of small distances, variations in distance, or changes in refractive index.

These optical instruments operate on a fundamental setup where a beam of light is divided into two separate paths. After reflecting back from mirrors, the beams are recombined, producing an interference pattern that arises from the wave nature of light. When the two light waves merge, they can interfere in two ways: constructive interference occurs when the waves align to produce increased brightness, while destructive interference occurs when the waves cancel each other out, resulting in diminished brightness.

The effectiveness of a Michelson interferometer in utilizing interference depends significantly on the ability to control the path length of one of the light beams with precision. By adjusting the position of one of the mirrors, the path length of that beam can be modified in relation to the other beam. This alteration changes the phase relationship between the two beams, thereby affecting the interference pattern observed. By carefully monitoring these shifts in the interference pattern, researchers can measure extremely small changes in distance, which is particularly useful in scientific research and industrial applications. Common applications include determining the thickness of thin films, assessing the flatness of optical surfaces, and detecting minute variations in length.

Moreover, Michelson interferometers can also be employed to measure changes in the refractive index of a medium. If one light path traverses a medium with a different refractive index, the speed of light in that medium will differ, thus altering the phase of the light wave. When the light waves are recombined, this change in phase results in a modified interference pattern. By analyzing these variations, one can accurately determine the refractive index of the medium in question.

In summary, Michelson interferometers utilize the principle of interference by splitting a light beam into two distinct paths, manipulating either the path length or the medium of one of the beams, and observing the resultant changes in the interference pattern. This sophisticated approach enables precise measurements of small distances, variations in distance, and changes in refractive index.
