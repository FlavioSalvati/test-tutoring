A free-body diagram (FBD) is a graphical representation that illustrates the forces acting on a specific object.

In more detail, a free-body diagram is an essential tool in physics that offers a simplified view of an object alongside the forces exerted on it. The term "free-body" refers to the diagram's depiction of the object as if it were completely isolated from its environment, removing all other objects and forces except those that are explicitly represented.

To create a free-body diagram, one must first identify all the forces acting on the object and represent them as vectors emanating from a central point, which symbolizes the object itself. The length and direction of each vector indicate the magnitude and direction of the corresponding force. Typical forces included in a free-body diagram are gravitational force, friction, tension, normal force, and applied forces.

The act of drawing a free-body diagram simplifies complex problems by concentrating solely on the forces that influence the object's motion. This focus facilitates the application of Newton's laws of motion, making it easier to solve problems related to forces and movement. For instance, when analyzing the motion of a car on an incline, the free-body diagram would illustrate the forces of gravity, friction, and any applied forces. This representation aids in calculating the net force and predicting the car's acceleration.

In addition to forces, free-body diagrams can also incorporate moments, which represent rotational forces, as well as reactions, which are the forces that objects exert on one another. While these additional components can increase the complexity of the diagram, they also enhance its accuracy and usefulness in problem-solving.

In summary, a free-body diagram is a powerful tool in physics that streamlines the analysis of forces and motion. By isolating an object and visually depicting the forces acting upon it, a free-body diagram facilitates the application of physical laws and the resolution of related problems.
