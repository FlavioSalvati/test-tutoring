Wave intensity is influenced primarily by three key factors: the amplitude of the wave, its frequency, and the medium through which it propagates.

The amplitude of a wave refers to the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position, essentially representing the wave's height. The intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of its amplitude. This relationship implies that if the amplitude is doubled, the intensity will increase by a factor of four. This occurs because the energy carried by a wave is closely associated with its amplitude; a wave with a larger amplitude transports more energy and thus exhibits a higher intensity.

Frequency, another crucial factor, denotes the number of wave cycles that pass a specific point in a unit of time. Similar to amplitude, the intensity of a wave is also directly proportional to the square of its frequency. Therefore, if the frequency is doubled, the intensity will again increase by a factor of four. This relationship holds true because the energy carried by a wave is related to its frequency; a wave with a higher frequency conveys more energy, resulting in greater intensity.

The medium through which a wave travels plays a significant role in determining its intensity as well. Different media have varying capacities to absorb, reflect, or transmit waves. For example, sound waves exhibit higher intensity when traveling through a solid medium, such as metal, compared to a gaseous medium like air. This is attributable to the greater density of solids, which provides more particles that can vibrate and transfer wave energy. Similarly, light waves demonstrate increased intensity when passing through a transparent medium, such as glass, rather than an opaque medium like wood.

In conclusion, wave intensity is influenced by its amplitude, frequency, and the medium of propagation. By understanding these factors, we can effectively predict and manipulate wave intensity in various contexts.
