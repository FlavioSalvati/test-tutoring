Frequency and period are fundamentally interconnected concepts in the study of waves and oscillations. They exhibit an inverse relationship; this means that as the frequency of a wave increases, its period—defined as the time required to complete one full cycle of the wave—decreases, and vice versa.

To elaborate, the frequency of a wave, denoted as $f$, is the number of cycles it completes in a designated period of time, typically measured in seconds. The unit of frequency is Hertz (Hz), where $1 \text{ Hz} = 1 \text{ cycle per second}$. Conversely, the period of a wave, represented as $T$, is the duration of time it takes to complete a single cycle, and it is measured in seconds.

The mathematical relationship between frequency and period can be succinctly expressed with the equations:

$$ f = \frac{1}{T} $$

and 

$$ T = \frac{1}{f}. $$

These equations indicate that knowing the frequency of a wave allows you to calculate its period, and vice versa.

For instance, if a wave has a frequency of $50 \text{ Hz}$, its period can be calculated as:

$$ T = \frac{1}{50} = 0.02 \text{ seconds}. $$

This implies that the wave completes one full cycle in $0.02$ seconds. Conversely, if a wave has a period of $0.01 \text{ seconds}$, its frequency can be determined as:

$$ f = \frac{1}{0.01} = 100 \text{ Hz}. $$

This indicates that the wave completes $100$ cycles each second.

Understanding the relationship between frequency and period is essential across various fields of physics, including the study of sound waves, light waves, and electromagnetic waves. Additionally, this relationship plays a crucial role in electronics, where the frequency and period of electrical signals significantly influence the performance of electronic devices.
