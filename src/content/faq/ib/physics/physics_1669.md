The Doppler effect is a change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the wave source.

The Doppler effect, named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, is a phenomenon that occurs when the source of a wave (such as sound or light) is moving relative to an observer. This relative motion causes a change in the observed frequency and wavelength of the wave. This effect is commonly experienced in everyday life, for example, when an ambulance with its siren on passes by. As the ambulance approaches, the pitch of the siren seems higher than when it is moving away. This is because the sound waves are compressed as the ambulance approaches, leading to a higher frequency, and stretched as it moves away, resulting in a lower frequency.

In more scientific terms, if the source of the wave is moving towards the observer, the waves are compressed, leading to a shorter wavelength and a higher frequency. This is known as a blue shift because it moves the observed colour of light towards the blue end of the spectrum. Conversely, if the source is moving away from the observer, the waves are stretched, resulting in a longer wavelength and a lower frequency, known as a red shift.

The Doppler effect is not only limited to sound and light waves, but it also applies to any kind of wave, including electromagnetic waves, water waves, and even waves of people in a stadium doing 'the wave'. The Doppler effect is a fundamental concept in wave phenomena, and it has significant applications in various fields such as astronomy, medical imaging, radar technology, and even in understanding the expansion of the universe.

In summary, the Doppler effect is a fascinating and important phenomenon in wave physics. It provides a powerful tool for scientists to understand the universe, from the motion of distant galaxies to the flow of blood in our bodies. It's a perfect example of how a simple observation can lead to profound insights.
