Altitude has a significant effect on gravitational attraction, causing it to decrease as altitude increases; the higher you go, the weaker the gravitational pull.

Gravitational attraction is the force that draws two objects toward each other. This force is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which asserts that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

$$
F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
$$

where $F$ is the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers. Therefore, as the distance between objects increases—such as when altitude increases—the force of gravitational attraction diminishes.

At sea level, the gravitational field strength on Earth is approximately $9.81 \, \text{N/kg}$. However, as one moves away from the Earth's surface, this strength decreases. The gravitational field strength, denoted as $g$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
g = \frac{GM}{r^2}
$$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the Earth, and $r$ is the distance from the center of the Earth. As $r$ increases with altitude, the value of $g$ decreases.

For instance, at an altitude of $1000 \, \text{km}$ above the Earth's surface, the gravitational field strength is approximately $98\%$ of its value at sea level. At an altitude of $10,000 \, \text{km}$, this value drops to about $25\%$. This reduction in gravitational attraction at higher altitudes is a key reason why astronauts in orbit experience weightlessness. Although they are still influenced by Earth's gravity (which is what keeps them in orbit), the force they experience is significantly weaker than that at the Earth's surface.

It is important to note, however, that this decrease in gravitational attraction with altitude is relatively small unless one is at a very high altitude. For most practical applications—such as flying in an airplane or climbing a mountain—the change in gravitational attraction due to altitude is so minor that it can often be disregarded.

In conclusion, while altitude has a pronounced effect on gravitational attraction at extreme heights, this effect is relatively negligible at the altitudes encountered in everyday life. Nevertheless, understanding this concept is crucial in physics, particularly for explaining phenomena such as satellite orbits and the sensation of weightlessness experienced by astronauts.
