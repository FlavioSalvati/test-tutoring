Momentum is transferred during collisions through the interaction of forces between the colliding objects.

In any collision, whether it involves two billiard balls or two vehicles, momentum is exchanged from one object to another. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of Newton's third law of motion, which asserts that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When two objects collide, they exert forces upon each other that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act to accelerate or decelerate the objects, resulting in changes to their velocities and, consequently, their momenta.

The total momentum of a system remains conserved during a collision, as long as no external forces are present. This principle, known as the conservation of momentum, is a fundamental tenet of physics. It implies that the total momentum of the colliding objects prior to the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This principle applies to both elastic and inelastic collisions. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Conversely, in an inelastic collision, while momentum is conserved, kinetic energy is not; some kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat or sound.

The transfer of momentum in a collision can be analyzed using vector quantities, as momentum possesses both magnitude and direction. For instance, if a moving object strikes a stationary object directly (head-on), all of its momentum is transferred to the stationary object, which then moves in the same direction as the initial object. However, if the collision is not direct, the momentum is transferred in the direction of the force exerted during the collision. This can result in the objects moving off at angles to their original trajectories.

In summary, momentum is transferred during collisions through the forces that the colliding objects exert upon one another. The total momentum of the system is conserved, remaining constant before and after the collision. The direction and magnitude of the momentum transfer depend on the nature and alignment of the collision.
