Heavy nuclei are prone to undergo fission due to their inherent instability, which arises from the strong repulsive forces between protons.

To elaborate, the nucleus of an atom consists of protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles that repel each other due to the electromagnetic force. In smaller nuclei, this repulsion is effectively counterbalanced by the strong nuclear force, a short-range interaction that attracts both protons and neutrons to one another. However, as the size of the nucleus increases, the strong nuclear force becomes less effective at holding the protons together against their electromagnetic repulsion because its range is limited.

In heavy nuclei, such as those of uranium or plutonium, the sheer number of protons leads to significant repulsive electromagnetic forces. The strong nuclear force is insufficient to maintain stability in these nuclei, resulting in instability and a tendency to break apart, a process known as fission.

Fission is a nuclear reaction in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, accompanied by the release of a substantial amount of energy. This reaction is often initiated by the absorption of a neutron, which further destabilizes the nucleus. The fragments produced from fission are typically radioactive, which can lead to a chain reaction of subsequent fissions if not properly controlled.

In summary, the inclination of heavy nuclei to undergo fission stems from the competition between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. Although the strong nuclear force is formidable, its limited range renders it unable to counteract the repulsion caused by the large number of protons in heavy nuclei. This imbalance results in an unstable nucleus that is susceptible to fission.
