The direction of the electric current influences the orientation of the magnetic field, as described by the right-hand rule.

To elaborate, the right-hand rule provides a straightforward method for determining the direction of the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire. To apply this rule, point your right thumb in the direction of the conventional current (which flows from positive to negative), and curl your fingers. Your fingers will then indicate the direction of the magnetic field lines. Consequently, if the direction of the current changes, the orientation of the magnetic field will also change accordingly.

The magnetic field lines create concentric circles around the wire, with the wire positioned at the center. The direction of the magnetic field at any given point is tangent to the circle at that location. Additionally, the strength of the magnetic field diminishes as you move further away from the wire, and it increases with the current flowing through the wire.

This principle is applicable not only to straight wires but also to circular loops of wire and solenoids. For a loop of wire carrying current, the magnetic field lines pass through the center of the loop and form loops around it. The direction of the magnetic field inside the loop can be determined again using the right-hand rule: if you curl your right hand in the direction of the current around the loop, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field within the loop.

In the case of a solenoid, which is a coil of wire, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is both strong and uniform. Its direction can similarly be determined using the right-hand rule. If you curl your fingers in the direction of the current flowing through the coils, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field inside the solenoid.

In summary, the direction of the current directly influences the orientation of the magnetic field. This fundamental principle of electromagnetism is essential in various applications, including electric motors and generators.
