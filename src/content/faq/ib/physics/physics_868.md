Diffraction occurs when waves, such as light, sound, or water waves, interact with barriers or openings, resulting in a change in direction and the spreading of the waves.

This phenomenon is a fundamental characteristic of wave behavior. When waves encounter an obstacle or a narrow opening, they do not simply reflect; instead, they bend and spread out. This bending is referred to as diffraction and arises from the interaction of the waves with the edges of the barrier.

The extent of diffraction—the degree to which the wave bends—depends on two key factors: the size of the barrier or opening and the wavelength of the wave. Specifically, if the wavelength, denoted as $\lambda$, is significantly smaller than the dimensions of the barrier or opening, the diffraction will be minimal. Conversely, if the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the size of the barrier or opening, the diffraction will be pronounced.

To illustrate this concept, consider water waves approaching a barrier with a small opening. As the waves meet the barrier, the portion of the wave that encounters the opening continues to propagate forward, while the rest of the wave is blocked. The segment that passes through the opening spreads out in a semi-circular pattern on the other side of the barrier, demonstrating the phenomenon of diffraction.

In the case of light waves, diffraction is responsible for the colorful fringe patterns observed in diffraction grating experiments. When light passes through a narrow slit or a grating, it bends and interferes, producing a series of light and dark fringes on a screen. This observable pattern is a clear demonstration of wave diffraction.

In summary, diffraction is a wave phenomenon characterized by the bending and spreading of waves as they interact with barriers or openings. This interaction leads to changes in direction and is fundamental to understanding how waves behave in various contexts.
