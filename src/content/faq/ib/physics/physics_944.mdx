Capacitors are devices that store energy by establishing an electric field between two conductive plates separated by an insulating material known as a dielectric.

A capacitor fundamentally consists of two conductive plates that are insulated from each other. When a voltage is applied across the plates, an electric field is generated in the space between them. This electric field plays a crucial role in the capacitor's ability to store energy.

The process of energy storage begins when a voltage source—such as a battery—is connected to the capacitor. The battery causes electrons to accumulate on one plate, resulting in a negative charge on that plate. Conversely, the other plate loses electrons to the battery, resulting in a positive charge. This separation of charges generates an electric field between the two plates. The strength of this electric field is directly proportional to the amount of charge stored on the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

The energy stored in a capacitor manifests as an electric field created by the separated charges. This energy can be released when the capacitor is discharged, which occurs when a conductive path is formed between the two plates. Electrons flow from the negatively charged plate to the positively charged plate, neutralizing the charges and collapsing the electric field. Consequently, the energy stored in the electric field is converted back into electrical energy.

The capacity of a capacitor to store energy is determined by its capacitance and the voltage applied across it. Capacitance is defined as the amount of charge a capacitor can store per unit of voltage. It is influenced by several factors, including the surface area of the plates, the distance between them, and the characteristics of the dielectric material. Specifically, a larger surface area and a smaller distance between the plates will result in higher capacitance, enabling the capacitor to store more energy. Additionally, a higher applied voltage increases the amount of charge the capacitor can hold, thereby enhancing its energy storage capacity.

In summary, capacitors leverage electric fields to store energy. When a voltage is applied, charges separate, creating an electric field between the capacitor's plates. This electric field retains energy until the capacitor is discharged.
