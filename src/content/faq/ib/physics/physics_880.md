In a Young's double-slit experiment, light is directed through two closely spaced slits, which act as two coherent light sources. This configuration leads to the creation of waves that spread out and overlap beyond the slits. The observed interference pattern is a direct consequence of the superposition of these two waves.

When the waves converge, they interact with each other in two primary ways: constructive interference and destructive interference. Constructive interference occurs when the crest of one wave aligns with the crest of another, resulting in a bright fringe. This happens because the amplitudes of the two waves combine, producing a resultant wave with greater amplitude. Conversely, destructive interference takes place when the crest of one wave meets the trough of another. This alignment leads to a dark fringe, as the amplitudes of the two waves effectively cancel each other out, resulting in a wave with reduced or zero amplitude.

The pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes is dictated by the difference in path lengths from the two slits to the observer's location. Specifically, if the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, the waves will arrive in phase and interfere constructively, creating a bright fringe. In contrast, if the path difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength, the waves will be out of phase and interfere destructively, leading to a dark fringe.

The Young's double-slit experiment serves as a fundamental demonstration of the wave nature of light and the principle of superposition. It provides compelling evidence for the phenomenon of interference, which can only be understood by considering light as a wave. Moreover, this experiment allows for the measurement of the wavelength of light by analyzing the interference pattern, given the known separation of the slits and the distance to the observation screen.
