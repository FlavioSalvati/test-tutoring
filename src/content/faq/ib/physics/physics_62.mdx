Speed and velocity are two fundamental concepts in physics, but they represent different aspects of motion. Speed is a scalar quantity that indicates how fast an object is moving, while velocity is a vector quantity that encompasses both speed and direction.

In physics, speed is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. It is a scalar quantity, meaning it possesses only magnitude and lacks direction. Speed is commonly measured in units such as meters per second ($\text{m/s}$), kilometers per hour ($\text{km/h}$), or miles per hour ($\text{mph}$). For example, if a car is traveling at $60 \, \text{km/h}$, this value represents its speed.

Conversely, velocity incorporates both speed and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is defined as the rate of change of displacement, which refers to the shortest distance between an object's initial and final positions. Velocity not only informs us of how fast an object is moving but also indicates the direction of that movement. For instance, if a car is moving at $60 \, \text{km/h}$ towards the north, this describes its velocity.

Understanding the distinction between speed and velocity is essential in physics. Consider a car moving in a circular path at a constant speed; even though its speed remains constant, its velocity is constantly changing due to the continuous change in direction. This scenario exemplifies circular motion, a key concept in the study of dynamics.

In summary, while speed and velocity may appear similar at first glance, they are fundamentally different concepts in physics. Speed is a scalar quantity focused solely on how fast an object is moving, while velocity is a vector quantity that encompasses both the speed and direction of an object's movement. Grasping the difference between these two concepts is crucial for understanding motion in physics.
