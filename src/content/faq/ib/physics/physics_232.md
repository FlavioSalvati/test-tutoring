The formula for centripetal force is derived from Newton's second law of motion in conjunction with the definition of acceleration.

To begin understanding this derivation, we start with Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration, expressed mathematically as:

$$
F = ma
$$

In the context of circular motion, the acceleration we refer to is known as centripetal acceleration. This acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle, and it can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

where $v$ represents the velocity of the object and $r$ denotes the radius of the circular path. This formula arises from the definition of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity. In circular motion, although the speed (the magnitude of velocity) may remain constant, the direction of the velocity changes continuously. This constant change in direction indicates that there is always an acceleration directed towards the center of the circle.

By substituting the formula for centripetal acceleration into Newton's second law, we obtain:

$$
F = m\left(\frac{v^2}{r}\right)
$$

This equation represents the formula for centripetal force, indicating that the force necessary to maintain an object in circular motion is proportional to the mass of the object, the square of its velocity, and inversely proportional to the radius of the circle.

It is crucial to understand that centripetal force is not a distinct type of force; rather, it is a term used to describe the net force or combination of forces that act towards the center of the circle to keep an object in circular motion. This force can manifest in various forms, such as tension in a string, gravitational force, friction, or other forces, depending on the specific situation. The direction of the centripetal force is always directed towards the center of the circle, which is why it is often referred to as a "center-seeking" force.

**Summary for IB Physics Students:** The formula for centripetal force, given by 

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$ 

is derived from combining Newton's second law, 

$$
F = ma,
$$ 

with the formula for centripetal acceleration, 

$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r}.
$$ 

This relationship demonstrates that the force required to keep an object moving in a circular path is dependent on its mass, the square of its speed, and the radius of the circle. Remember, centripetal force is not a new type of force; it is simply the net force acting towards the center of the circle.
