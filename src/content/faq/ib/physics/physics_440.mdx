Gravitational force is inherently attractive, pulling objects toward one another due to their mass.

In greater detail, gravitational force is a fundamental interaction that governs the motion of celestial bodies as well as objects on Earth. It is articulated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

where $F$ is the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers. Notably, this force is always attractive, meaning it consistently pulls masses together rather than pushing them apart.

The underlying reason for this attraction is rooted in the very nature of gravity. Gravity represents a curvature in space-time that is caused by mass and energy. When an object possesses mass, it distorts the surrounding space-time, creating a gravitational 'well' into which other masses fall, thereby leading to an attractive force. This concept is central to Einstein's theory of general relativity, which offers a more comprehensive understanding of gravity compared to Newton's law.

Furthermore, no known substance exhibits anti-gravity properties or negative mass that could generate a repulsive gravitational force. The existence of such phenomena would pose significant challenges to our current understanding of physics, potentially leading to scenarios where energy conservation is violated, which contradicts one of the foundational principles of the discipline.

In the realm of quantum mechanics, the yet-to-be-formulated theory of quantum gravity is also anticipated to exhibit attractive characteristics. While the precise nature of quantum gravity remains elusive, most theoretical frameworks suggest that it will align with the classical behavior of gravity and remain attractive.

In conclusion, the gravitational force is inherently attractive due to the characteristics of mass and the fabric of space-time. This fundamental property of the universe is responsible for maintaining the orbits of planets around the sun, generating tides on Earth, and even holding galaxies together.
