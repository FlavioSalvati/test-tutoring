Wave dispersion refers to the phenomenon in which waves of varying frequencies propagate at different speeds within a given medium.

To elaborate, wave dispersion is a characteristic of a system in which the phase velocity—the speed at which a particular wave phase moves—depends on the frequency of the wave. Consequently, waves with distinct frequencies (or wavelengths) will travel at different velocities. This effect is commonly observed in various contexts, such as light traveling through glass or sound waves propagating through air.

A well-known example of wave dispersion is the formation of a rainbow. When white light, which is composed of a mixture of different colors (and thus different frequencies), passes through a prism or raindrops, it is dispersed into its individual colors. This occurs because the speed of light within the medium (whether it be glass or water) varies with frequency—a phenomenon termed refractive dispersion.

Dispersion also plays a critical role in telecommunications, where signals of varying frequencies must traverse long distances without degradation of information. In optical fibers, for instance, dispersion can lead to the broadening of signal pulses, potentially resulting in information loss. To mitigate this issue, engineers must meticulously design both the fiber and the transmitted signal to minimize dispersion effects.

In the field of physics, the study of wave dispersion provides valuable insights into the characteristics of the medium through which the waves are traveling. For example, seismologists analyze the dispersion of seismic waves to gain a deeper understanding of the Earth's interior. The speed of these seismic waves varies with frequency, and by examining these variations, scientists can infer important details about the Earth's layered structure.

In summary, wave dispersion is a fundamental concept in wave physics with extensive applications, ranging from the creation of rainbows to the engineering of telecommunications systems. It describes how wave speed is influenced by frequency, resulting in the spatial and temporal spreading of waveforms.
