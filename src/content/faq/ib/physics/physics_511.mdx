The principle of parallax error in measurements refers to the apparent displacement of an object's position caused by a change in the observer's viewpoint.

Parallax error is a prevalent type of observational error that can occur across various scientific and practical applications. It arises when the perceived position or direction of an object appears to change when viewed from different angles. This apparent movement is a result of the observer's changing perspective, which alters the angle of observation.

In measurement contexts, parallax error can significantly compromise the accuracy of results. For example, when reading the scale of a measuring instrument, such as a ruler or thermometer, if the observer's eye is not positioned directly in line with the measurement mark, the reading may be inaccurate. This discrepancy occurs because the measurement mark and the scale are viewed from an angle, leading to an apparent shift in the mark's position.

To minimize parallax errors, it is essential to take measurements from a position where the line of sight is perpendicular to the measurement scale. This optimal position is often referred to as the "normal" position. In certain instruments, such as a micrometer or a vernier caliper, a mirror is employed to eliminate parallax error. When the reflection of the scale in the mirror aligns with the actual scale, it confirms that the observer's line of sight is at the correct angle, thereby ensuring accurate readings.
