Protons and neutrons exhibit distinct structural differences in their quark composition and electric charge.

Together, protons and neutrons are referred to as nucleons, the fundamental particles constituting the nucleus of an atom. Both protons and neutrons belong to a category known as baryons, which are particles made up of three quarks. However, the specific types and arrangements of these quarks differ, resulting in unique properties for each.

A proton is formed from two 'up' quarks and one 'down' quark. The combination of these quarks imparts a positive electric charge to the proton. Specifically, the 'up' quark carries a charge of $\frac{2}{3}$, while the 'down' quark has a charge of $-\frac{1}{3}$. Consequently, the overall charge of a proton is 

$$
\frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = +1.
$$

This positive charge enables protons to interact electromagnetically with electrons, which possess a negative charge.

In contrast, a neutron comprises one 'up' quark and two 'down' quarks. This specific configuration results in a neutral charge, as the individual charges of the quarks effectively cancel each other out. The charge of the 'up' quark, $\frac{2}{3}$, is offset by the combined charge of the two 'down' quarks, which is $-\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, the total charge of a neutron is 

$$
\frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = 0.
$$

Due to this neutral charge, neutrons do not engage in electromagnetic interactions; however, they do interact via the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for holding the atomic nucleus together.

The variations in quark composition and charge also contribute to a slight difference in mass between protons and neutrons. Neutrons are marginally heavier than protons, a result of the 'down' quark being slightly more massive than the 'up' quark. Nevertheless, this difference in mass is minimal and often considered negligible in various calculations.

In summary, although both protons and neutrons are composed of three quarks, their distinct types and arrangements lead to protons having a positive charge and neutrons being electrically neutral. Additionally, this variation in quark composition accounts for a slight mass difference, with neutrons being somewhat heavier than protons.
