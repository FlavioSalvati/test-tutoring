An atom undergoes alpha decay, a specific type of radioactive decay, by emitting alpha particles. 

Alpha decay involves an unstable atomic nucleus releasing an alpha particle, which is comprised of two protons and two neutrons. This phenomenon can be understood as a quantum tunneling process, wherein the alpha particle escapes from the nucleus, leading to the creation of a new atom.

The process initiates when an atom's nucleus, made up of protons and neutrons, becomes unstable, often due to an imbalance in the counts of these particles. To achieve stability, the nucleus reduces its size and energy by ejecting an alpha particle, essentially a helium nucleus containing two protons and two neutrons.

When the alpha particle is emitted, it carries a certain amount of kinetic energy, which is derived from the energy difference between the parent nucleus and the newly formed daughter nucleus. This energy is what propels the alpha particle away from the nucleus.

As a result of this emission, a new atom is formed. The original atom loses two protons during the alpha decay process, thereby altering its atomic number and identity. For instance, if a uranium-238 atom undergoes alpha decay, it emits an alpha particle and transforms into a thorium-234 atom.

It is crucial to understand that alpha decay is a random process. While it is impossible to predict the exact moment when a specific atom will decay, it is feasible to calculate the probability of decay over a given time frame. This probability is characterized by the atom's half-life, which is defined as the duration required for half of the atoms in a sample to decay.

In summary, an atom emits alpha particles through alpha decay, a type of radioactive decay that enables the atom to regain stability by decreasing its size and energy, ultimately resulting in the formation of a new atom.
