The total electromotive force (emf) of cells connected in series is determined by summing the emf of each individual cell.

When cells are arranged in series, the total emf is simply the sum of the emfs of all the cells. This occurs because the current passes sequentially through each cell, meaning the total work done by the current is the cumulative work performed by each cell.

To calculate the total emf, you add the emf values of each cell together. For instance, if you have three cells with emfs of $1.5\,V$, $2\,V$, and $3\,V$, the total emf would be calculated as:

$$
1.5\,V + 2\,V + 3\,V = 6.5\,V.
$$

It's crucial to note that this addition applies only when all the cells are connected in the same directionâ€”specifically, when the positive terminal of one cell connects to the negative terminal of the next. If one or more cells are connected in the opposite direction, their emfs will subtract from the total rather than add to it. For example, if in the earlier scenario the $2\,V$ cell were connected in reverse, the total emf would become:

$$
1.5\,V - 2\,V + 3\,V = 2.5\,V.
$$

This principle aligns with Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, which states that the sum of the emfs in any closed loop within a circuit is equal to the sum of the potential differences across that loop. In the context of cells in series, the loop corresponds to the path the current traverses through all the cells, thereby making the total emf the sum of the emfs of all the cells.

In summary, calculating the total emf of cells in series is a straightforward process involving addition (or subtraction, if some cells are reversed). This fundamental concept in physics enhances our understanding of how electrical energy is supplied within a circuit.
