The Doppler effect links to wave frequency changes through the relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.

The Doppler effect, named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, is a phenomenon that occurs when there's a change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. This effect is commonly observed with sound waves, but it also applies to any kind of wave, including light.

When the source of the wave and the observer are moving closer together, the observed frequency of the wave increases. This is because the waves are reaching the observer more frequently. Conversely, if the source and the observer are moving apart, the observed frequency of the wave decreases as the waves reach the observer less frequently. This change in frequency is what we perceive as a change in pitch for sound waves. For example, the change in pitch of a passing ambulance siren is a demonstration of the Doppler effect.

In terms of light waves, the Doppler effect is observed as a change in colour. When a light source is moving towards the observer, the light appears bluer because the frequency of the light waves is higher. This is known as blue shift. On the other hand, if the light source is moving away from the observer, the light appears redder because the frequency of the light waves is lower. This is known as red shift. Astronomers use this principle to determine whether a star or galaxy is moving towards or away from us.

The Doppler effect is a fundamental concept in wave physics. It's not only crucial for understanding wave behaviour, but also has practical applications in various fields such as astronomy, medical imaging, and radar speed detection. Understanding the Doppler effect and its link to wave frequency changes is essential for any student studying physics.
