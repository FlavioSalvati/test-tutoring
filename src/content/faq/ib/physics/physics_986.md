The heating effect is utilized in electric stoves to transform electrical energy into heat energy for cooking purposes.

In an electric stove, the heating effect of electric current is harnessed to generate heat necessary for cooking. This principle is derived from Joule's law of heating, which states that the heat produced in a conductor is directly proportional to the square of the current ($I$) passing through it, the resistance ($R$) of the conductor, and the duration ($t$) for which the current flows. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
Q = I^2 R t
$$

where $Q$ represents the heat generated.

When the electric stove is turned on, electric current flows through the heating elements, typically made of a high-resistance material such as nichrome. As the current traverses these elements, it encounters resistance. This resistance leads to the conversion of electrical energy into heat energy, a process referred to as Joule heating or resistive heating. The heat generated is then transferred to the cooking vessel placed on the stove, effectively cooking the food.

The temperature of the stove can be regulated by adjusting the amount of electric current flowing through the heating elements. This is generally accomplished using a switch or dial that modifies the resistance in the circuit. By increasing the resistance, less current flows through the heating element, resulting in a decrease in heat production. Conversely, by decreasing the resistance, more current can flow, leading to an increase in heat output.

Electric stoves are known for their high efficiency, as nearly all the electrical energy is converted into heat. However, it is important to note that heat distribution can be inconsistent, particularly in stoves with coil elements. This uneven heating occurs because certain areas of the heating element may become hotter than others, resulting in uneven cooking. To address this issue, some modern electric stoves employ ceramic or induction elements, which provide improved heat distribution.

In summary, electric stoves exploit the heating effect by utilizing the resistance of heating elements to convert electrical energy into heat energy. This heat is then employed to cook food, with temperature control achieved by adjusting the resistance in the circuit.
