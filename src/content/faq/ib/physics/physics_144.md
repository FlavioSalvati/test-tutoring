Diffraction and refraction are two fundamental wave phenomena that involve the bending and alteration of wave paths under different conditions.

**Diffraction** occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or passes through a slit. This phenomenon is characterized by the bending of waves around the edges of the obstacle or aperture, allowing them to spread into regions that would otherwise be in the geometric shadow of the obstacle. Notably, diffraction is most pronounced when the dimensions of the obstacle or the opening are comparable to the wavelength of the wave. For instance, when light passes through a narrow slit and is projected onto a screen, a pattern of alternating light and dark bands emerges. This pattern results from the interference of light waves that have been diffracted by the slit.

In contrast, **refraction** refers to the change in direction of a wave as it transitions from one medium to another, primarily due to a change in its speed. For example, when light moves from air into water, it slows down and consequently alters its path. This bending of light as it crosses the boundary between two different media is termed refraction. The extent to which the light bends, known as the angle of refraction, is determined by the speeds of light in the respective media. This relationship can be mathematically described by **Snell's Law**, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence ($\theta_i$) to the sine of the angle of refraction ($\theta_r$) is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the wave in the two media:

$$
\frac{\sin(\theta_i)}{\sin(\theta_r)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}
$$

where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the speeds of the wave in the first and second mediums, respectively.

In summary, while both diffraction and refraction involve the bending of waves, they occur under distinct circumstances. **Diffraction** takes place when waves encounter obstacles or slits, resulting in their spreading out, whereas **refraction** occurs when waves transition between different media, leading to a change in direction due to variations in wave speed.
