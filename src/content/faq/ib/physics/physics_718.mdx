Wavefronts experience alterations in speed, direction, and spacing during the process of refraction, in accordance with Snell's law.

Refraction refers to the change in direction of a wave when its speed varies as it transitions from one medium to another. This phenomenon is most commonly observed when waves, such as light, move between different materials. As wavefronts traverse from one medium to another, their speed changes, resulting in a bending effect known as refraction.

The extent of this bending is determined by the indices of refraction of the two interacting media. The index of refraction of a medium quantifies how much the speed of light (or any wave) is diminished within that medium compared to its speed in a vacuum. When a wavefront enters a medium with a higher index of refraction, it decelerates and bends towards the normal line. Conversely, when it enters a medium with a lower index of refraction, it accelerates and bends away from the normal.

The change in direction of the wavefronts is described by Snell's law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence ($\theta_i$) to the sine of the angle of refraction ($\theta_r$) is equal to the ratio of the velocities of light in the two media ($v_1$ and $v_2$), or equivalently, the ratio of their indices of refraction ($n_1$ and $n_2$):

$$
\frac{\sin(\theta_i)}{\sin(\theta_r)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}
$$

Furthermore, the spacing between wavefronts also changes during refraction. If the wavefronts slow down upon entering a new medium (indicating that the medium has a higher index of refraction), they become closer together. Conversely, if they speed up (indicating a lower index of refraction), they spread out. This alteration in spacing is directly related to the change in the speed of the wavefronts and results in a change in the wavelength of the light.

In summary, during refraction, wavefronts undergo changes in speed, direction, and spacing. These changes are dictated by the properties of the media through which the wavefronts are traveling and are quantitatively described by Snell's law.
