The work done by non-conservative forces can be calculated using the formula 

$$
W = Fd \cos \theta
$$ 

where $W$ represents the work done, $F$ denotes the magnitude of the force, $d$ is the displacement (or distance over which the force is applied), and $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector.

Non-conservative forces are characterized by their lack of path independence; that is, the work they perform depends on the specific path taken between two points, rather than solely on the initial and final positions. Common examples of non-conservative forces include friction, air resistance, and tension.

In the formula $W = Fd \cos \theta$, the term $\cos \theta$ adjusts for the direction of the force in relation to the displacement. If the force is applied in the same direction as the displacement (where $\theta = 0^\circ$), then $\cos \theta = 1$, and the work done simplifies to 

$$
W = Fd.
$$ 

Conversely, if the force is applied at a right angle to the displacement (where $\theta = 90^\circ$), then $\cos \theta = 0$, resulting in no work being done, or 

$$
W = 0.
$$ 

It is crucial to ensure that both the force and displacement are expressed in compatible units—such as Newtons for force and meters for displacement—and that the angle $\theta$ is measured in degrees. Additionally, the force $F$ should be the net force acting on the object, considering all acting forces.

For cases involving variable forces, the work done can be determined through integration of the force over the displacement. This approach entails more complex mathematics, but the underlying principle remains the same: the work done corresponds to the area under the force-displacement graph.

Keep in mind that the work done by non-conservative forces can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the relative directions of the force and displacement. Positive work occurs when the force and displacement are aligned, negative work is produced when they are opposite, and zero work arises when the force is perpendicular to the displacement.
