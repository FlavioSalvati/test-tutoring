Electron shells play a pivotal role in determining the chemical properties of atoms by influencing their interactions and bonding behavior.

Electron shells, also referred to as energy levels, are designated regions surrounding an atom's nucleus where electrons are most likely to be located. Each shell has a specific capacity for electrons: the first shell can accommodate up to $2$ electrons, the second shell can hold up to $8$, and subsequent shells can hold even more, following the formula $2n^2$, where $n$ is the shell level. The outermost shell, known as the valence shell, is particularly significant in defining an atom's chemical properties.

The valence shell is critical for understanding how an atom interacts with others. When the valence shell is not fully occupied, the atom is inclined to react with other atoms in order to achieve a full outer shell. Atoms attain maximum stability when their outermost shell contains the maximum number of electrons. For instance, hydrogen has one electron in its valence shell, which can hold two electrons. Consequently, hydrogen typically reacts with other atoms to gain one additional electron and achieve a stable configuration.

The number of electrons present in the valence shell also dictates the types of bonds an atom can form. Atoms with one or seven electrons in their outer shell are prone to form ionic bonds, characterized by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another. Conversely, atoms with four to six electrons in their outer shell generally form covalent bonds, which involve the sharing of electrons between atoms.

The periodic table is systematically organized such that elements with similar electron configurations, and therefore similar chemical properties, are grouped together. For example, all elements in Group $1$ (the alkali metals) possess one electron in their outer shell and exhibit high reactivity. In contrast, elements in Group $18$ (the noble gases) have full outer shells and are typically unreactive.

In conclusion, the electron configuration of an atom—particularly the distribution and number of electrons in its valence shell—significantly influences its chemical properties. This encompasses its reactivity, the types of bonds it can form, and its classification within the periodic table.
