Thermal efficiency in power plants is quantified as the ratio of useful output energy to the total input energy.

More specifically, thermal efficiency serves as a crucial indicator of a power plant's performance. It is a dimensionless metric that evaluates devices utilizing thermal energy, including internal combustion engines, steam turbines, steam engines, boilers, and refrigerators. In the context of power plants, thermal efficiency is defined as the ratio of useful output energy—specifically, the energy converted into electricity—to the total input energy, which corresponds to the energy content of the fuel used.

The formula for thermal efficiency, denoted as $\eta$, is given by:

$$
\eta = \left( \frac{W}{Q_h} \right) \times 100\%
$$

In this equation, $W$ represents the work done by the system (i.e., the energy output), while $Q_h$ denotes the heat energy added to the system (i.e., the energy input). The resulting value is expressed as a percentage, with higher percentages signifying greater efficiency.
