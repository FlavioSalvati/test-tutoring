The resolution of a diffraction grating is calculated using the formula R = mN, where m is the order of diffraction and N is the total number of slits.

In more detail, the resolution of a diffraction grating refers to its ability to distinguish between two closely spaced wavelengths of light. This is a crucial property in many applications, such as spectroscopy, where it is necessary to separate different wavelengths of light to analyse the composition of a substance.

The formula R = mN is derived from the grating equation, which describes how light diffracts when it passes through a grating. In this equation, m is the order of diffraction, which is an integer that represents the number of wavelengths by which the light is diffracted. N is the total number of slits in the grating. The product of m and N gives the resolution of the grating.

For example, if a grating has 1000 slits and the light is diffracted in the first order (m=1), the resolution of the grating is R = 1 * 1000 = 1000. This means that the grating can distinguish between two wavelengths that differ by 1/1000th of the wavelength.
