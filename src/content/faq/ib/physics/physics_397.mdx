In a perfectly elastic collision, the total momentum of the system remains conserved both before and after the collision.

In the realm of physics, a perfectly elastic collision is characterized by the conservation of both momentum and kinetic energy. This means that the total momentum of the system—the sum of the momenta of all individual objects involved—remains constant throughout the collision process. This principle arises directly from Newton's third law of motion, which asserts that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, let’s examine a simple scenario involving two colliding objects. Prior to the collision, each object possesses a specific momentum, calculated as the product of its mass and velocity. During the collision, these objects exert forces upon one another, leading to changes in their velocities and, consequently, their momenta. However, because the forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the resulting changes in momentum effectively cancel each other out, ensuring that the total momentum of the system remains unchanged.

In a perfectly elastic collision, not only is momentum conserved, but kinetic energy is also preserved. This is a critical distinction from inelastic collisions, where kinetic energy is not conserved and is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat or sound. In a perfectly elastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the system before the collision is equal to the total kinetic energy after the collision. This occurs because the objects 'bounce' off one another without losing any speed, as there are no energy-dissipating forces at play.

In summary, a perfectly elastic collision ensures the conservation of total momentum, meaning it remains constant before and after the event. This principle is fundamental in physics and directly stems from Newton's third law of motion. Furthermore, in a perfectly elastic collision, kinetic energy is conserved as well, setting it apart from inelastic collisions where kinetic energy is not preserved.
