Some materials heat up more rapidly when an electric current passes through them due to their higher electrical resistivity, leading to increased heat generation.

To elaborate, the heating effect of electric current is a phenomenon in which electrical energy is transformed into heat energy. This process is known as Joule heating or resistive heating. The amount of heat produced is directly proportional to the square of the current ($I^2$), the resistance ($R$), and the time ($t$) for which the current flows. This relationship is expressed by Joule's first law:

$$ H = I^2 R t $$

Materials with higher electrical resistivity tend to heat up more quickly because they resist the flow of electric current more than those with lower resistivity. This resistance results in a greater amount of energy being dissipated as heat. For instance, metals such as copper and aluminum have low resistivity and are effective conductors of electricity, which means they do not heat up as quickly. In contrast, materials like tungsten and nichrome possess high resistivity and therefore heat up more rapidly when an electric current passes through them.

The heating effect of current is harnessed in various everyday appliances. For example, in an electric kettle, the heating element is constructed from a high-resistivity material. When electric current flows through this element, it heats up quickly and transfers this heat to the water, causing it to boil. Similarly, in an incandescent light bulb, the filament is made of tungsten. The high resistivity of tungsten causes it to heat up and emit a bright glow when current is applied.

In summary, the rate at which a material heats up due to electric current is determined by its electrical resistivity. The higher the resistivity, the more the material opposes the flow of current, resulting in greater heat generation. This principle is essential to the functioning of many electrical appliances and systems.
