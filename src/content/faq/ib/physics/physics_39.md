Vectors are geometrically represented as arrows that possess both a specific direction and magnitude within a coordinate system.

A vector is defined as a mathematical entity characterized by its magnitude (length) and direction. In geometric terms, it is depicted as an arrow: the length of the arrow correlates with the magnitude of the vector, while the orientation of the arrow indicates the vector's direction. This geometric visualization is particularly useful in physics, where quantities such as force, velocity, and displacement are represented as vectors since they encompass both magnitude and direction.

The starting point of the arrow, referred to as the tail, indicates the initial point or origin of the vector, while the arrowhead points towards the terminal point of the vector. The length of the arrow is directly proportional to the magnitude of the vector; thus, a longer arrow signifies a greater magnitude. For instance, a vector that points upwards may represent an upward force.

Vectors can be combined through a method known as the head-to-tail method. This involves drawing the first vector, followed by the second vector, which is positioned so that its tail meets the head of the first vector. The resultant vector is then illustrated by drawing an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector. This geometric addition of vectors is especially valuable in physics for assessing the net effect of multiple forces acting on an object.

Additionally, vectors can be multiplied by scalars (ordinary numbers). When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, its magnitude adjusts accordingly, while its direction remains unchanged unless the scalar is negative; in that case, the direction of the vector is reversed. Geometrically, this transformation is represented by altering the length of the arrow.

In a coordinate system, the position of a vector can be expressed in terms of its components along the coordinate axes. For instance, in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, a vector can be represented by its $x$ and $y$ components. These components can be determined by constructing a right-angled triangle, with the vector serving as the hypotenuse and the axes forming the other two sides. Trigonometric functions can then be employed to calculate the lengths of these sides.

In summary, the geometric representation of vectors offers an intuitive approach to understanding and manipulating vector quantities in physics, facilitating the analysis of various physical phenomena.
