Earth's gravity draws us towards its center, which is the point where all of Earth's mass is effectively concentrated.

Gravity is a fundamental force that attracts two objects towards each other. For Earth, this attraction arises from its mass, which is distributed throughout its volume. However, due to Earth's spherical shape, the gravitational effect can be simplified as if all of its mass were concentrated at a single point at its center. This phenomenon is explained by the shell theorem, a principle in classical mechanics. According to the shell theorem, a spherically symmetric body influences external objects gravitationally as though all of its mass were located at its center.

The force of gravity can be mathematically described by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship can be expressed as:

$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$

where $F$ is the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers. This means that the closer two objects are to each other, the stronger the gravitational pull they exert on one another.

In the context of Earth and humans, the force of gravity pulls us towards the center of the Earth because that is where the majority of Earth's mass is located from our perspective on the surface. This gravitational force is what keeps us anchored to the ground and prevents us from floating off into space.

It is also important to clarify that when we refer to gravity pulling us "down," we are using shorthand to indicate that it pulls us towards the center of the Earth. If you were to dig a tunnel straight through the Earth and jump in, you would initially fall "down" towards the center. However, once you passed the center, you would begin to fall "up" towards the surface on the opposite side. This occurs because gravity consistently pulls you towards the Earth's center, regardless of your position on or within the planet.

In conclusion, Earth's gravity pulls us towards its center because that is the effective location of all of Earthâ€™s mass. This gravitational attraction is what keeps us securely on the ground and shapes our perception of "up" and "down."
