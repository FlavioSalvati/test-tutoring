Energy in wave motion is transmitted through the oscillation or vibration of particles within a medium.

To elaborate, wave motion is a disturbance that propagates through a medium, such as air, water, or even a vacuum, effectively transporting energy from one location to another. This transmission of energy occurs as particles in the medium oscillate or vibrate around a fixed point, causing adjacent particles to do the same. This phenomenon creates a ripple effect, akin to the ripples formed when a pebble is dropped into a pond.

There are two primary types of waves: transverse and longitudinal. In transverse waves, particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Examples of transverse waves include light and electromagnetic waves. Conversely, in longitudinal waves, particles oscillate parallel to the direction of wave travel. Sound waves serve as a key example of longitudinal waves.

The energy carried by a wave is directly proportional to the square of its amplitude. This relationship implies that if the amplitude of a wave is doubled, the energy it transports is quadrupled. Consequently, louder sounds, which possess larger amplitudes, carry more energy than softer sounds. Similarly, brighter light, characterized by a larger amplitude, conveys more energy than dimmer light.

Additionally, the speed of the wave influences energy transmission. The faster the wave travels, the more energy it carries. This is because the energy of a wave is also proportional to the square of its speed. Therefore, if the speed of a wave is doubled, the energy it carries increases by a factor of four.

In summary, energy in wave motion is transmitted through the oscillation of particles in a medium. The amount of energy transmitted is contingent upon both the amplitude and speed of the wave. Grasping these principles is essential in various fields, including acoustics, optics, and even quantum mechanics, where wave behavior is foundational.
