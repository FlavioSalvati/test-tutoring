When the speed of a source exceeds the wave speed in the context of the Doppler effect, a phenomenon known as a shock wave or sonic boom occurs.

The Doppler effect describes how the frequency or wavelength of a wave changes for an observer who is moving relative to the source of that wave. This effect is commonly observed across various types of waves, including sound, light, and radio waves. However, when the speed of the source surpasses the wave speed, the situation transforms dramatically.

For sound waves, when a source is traveling faster than the speed of sound, it is referred to as moving at supersonic speed. In this case, the sound waves emitted by the source cannot propagate fast enough to keep pace with the source itself. Instead of dispersing in a typical spherical pattern, the waves become compressed, forming a cone-shaped pattern behind the source. This phenomenon is known as a shock wave or sonic boom.

It's important to note that a sonic boom is not merely a singular event that occurs at the moment the source first breaches the speed of sound. Instead, it is a continuous effect that persists for as long as the source remains in supersonic motion. Consequently, a supersonic aircraft produces a sonic boom throughout its flight, rather than just at the moment it crosses the sound barrier.

This principle is also applicable to other types of waves. For instance, when a boat travels faster than the speed of the waves it generates, it creates a V-shaped wake pattern behind it. This scenario exemplifies a similar effect to a sonic boom, but involves water waves rather than sound waves.

In summary, when the speed of a source exceeds the wave speed, it results in the formation of a shock wave or sonic boom. This striking demonstration of the Doppler effect illustrates how the relative motion between the source and the observer can significantly influence the observed frequency or wavelength of a wave.
