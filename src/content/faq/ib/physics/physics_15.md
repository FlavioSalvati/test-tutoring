To subtract vector quantities, you effectively add the opposite (or negative) of the vector you wish to subtract to the original vector.

More specifically, vector subtraction follows a process akin to vector addition. Instead of adding the second vector directly, you add its negative. This principle stems from the fact that subtracting a vector is equivalent to adding its negative. For example, if you have two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ and you want to compute $\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}$, you would add $-\mathbf{B}$ to $\mathbf{A}$.

To perform this operation, the first step is to determine the negative of the vector you intend to subtract. The negative of a vector retains the same magnitude but points in the opposite direction. For instance, if vector $\mathbf{B}$ points to the right, then $-\mathbf{B}$ will point to the left. If the length of $\mathbf{B}$ is $5$ units, then $-\mathbf{B}$ will also measure $5$ units, but it will be oriented in the opposite direction.

Once you have the negative of the vector to be subtracted, you can proceed to add it to the original vector. This is accomplished by positioning the tail of the negative vector at the head of the original vector, and then drawing a new vector from the tail of the original vector to the head of the negative vector. This new vector represents the result of the subtraction.

In component form, if you have vectors $\mathbf{A} = (A_x, A_y)$ and $\mathbf{B} = (B_x, B_y)$, the subtraction $\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}$ can be calculated by subtracting the components of $\mathbf{B}$ from the components of $\mathbf{A}$, yielding a new vector given by:

$$
\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B} = (A_x - B_x, A_y - B_y).
$$

It is important to remember that vectors have both magnitude and direction. Consequently, when performing vector subtraction, you must take both of these factors into account. The magnitude of the resulting vector can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem, while the direction can be derived through trigonometric functions, typically employing the tangent function.

In summary, subtracting vector quantities involves calculating the negative of the vector to be subtracted and adding it to the original vector, while carefully considering both the magnitude and direction of the vectors involved.
