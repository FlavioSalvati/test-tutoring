The fundamental principle behind a direct current (DC) motor is the interaction between magnetic fields and electric currents, which generates rotational motion.

A DC motor functions based on the core principles of electromagnetism, particularly the law governing the interaction of magnetic fields. When an electric current flows through a wire located within a magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force is responsible for the rotational motion observed in a DC motor.

Key components of a DC motor include the stator, rotor, commutator, brushes, and a power supply. The stator is the stationary part of the motor that provides a persistent magnetic field. In contrast, the rotor—also referred to as the armature—is the rotating element of the motor. It consists of wire coils that become electromagnets when current is passed through them. The commutator and brushes work in tandem to ensure that the current direction in the rotor coils is appropriately maintained to facilitate continuous rotation.

The operation of a DC motor commences when a direct current is supplied. This current flows through the brushes to the commutator and subsequently to the rotor coils. As the current traverses the rotor coils, they become electromagnets. According to Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, the interaction between the magnetic field of the stator and that of the rotor generates a force that drives the rotor to rotate.

The commutator is essential for sustaining the rotor's rotation. It is designed as a split ring that reverses the direction of the current in the rotor coils every half rotation. This mechanism ensures that the force acting on the rotor consistently pushes it in the same direction, thereby facilitating continuous rotation.

In summary, a DC motor employs the principles of electromagnetism and the interaction of magnetic fields to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. The rotor's continuous rotation, which represents the motor's output, is achieved through the intelligent design of the commutator and brushes, which maintain the correct current direction in the rotor coils at all times.
