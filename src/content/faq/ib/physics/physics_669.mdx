The effective force acting on an inclined plane is derived from the gravitational force that influences an object placed on the incline. 

To elaborate, when an object is situated on an inclined surface, the gravitational force can be resolved into two distinct components: one that acts perpendicular to the incline and another that acts parallel to it. The effective force on the incline is specifically the component of the gravitational force that acts parallel to the surface. This parallel force is responsible for causing the object to slide down the incline. 

To summarize, the effective force is the component of gravity that drives the object's motion along the incline.
