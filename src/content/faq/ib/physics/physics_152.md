The vibrant rainbow patterns observed in oil spills are a result of the phenomenon known as thin-film interference of light.

When light strikes a thin layer of oil floating on water, it is divided into two beams: one beam is reflected off the surface of the oil, while the other penetrates the oil layer and is reflected off the surface of the water beneath. These two beams of light then recombine. Depending on the oil film's thickness and the angle at which the light strikes, they can either interfere constructively or destructively. This interference is what creates the striking rainbow pattern we see.

Thin-film interference is a classic illustration of wave interference, a fundamental principle in physics. When two or more waves converge, they can combine in two ways: they may add together, resulting in a wave of greater amplitude (constructive interference), or they may cancel each other out, producing a wave of lesser amplitude or even no wave at all (destructive interference). In the context of an oil spill, the light waves reflected from the oil and water surfaces can either enhance or diminish one another, contingent on the oil film's thickness and the angle of incidence of the incoming light.

The colors observed in an oil spill arise because different colors of light correspond to different wavelengths. When light of a specific wavelength experiences constructive interference, that color is intensified and becomes prominent. Conversely, when light of a particular wavelength undergoes destructive interference, that color is reduced or may disappear entirely. The varying thickness of the oil film across the spill leads to the amplification of different colors in different regions, resulting in the characteristic rainbow effect.

Moreover, the angle from which you observe the oil spill can significantly influence the colors that are visible. As you change your position around the spill, the angle of incidence of the light alters, thereby affecting the conditions for both constructive and destructive interference. This variability is why the colors in an oil spill can appear to shift and change as you move around it.
