The stability of a nucleus is fundamentally influenced by the interplay between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force.

An atom's nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, which are collectively referred to as nucleons. The stability of this nucleus hinges on two primary forces: the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. As the name implies, the strong nuclear force is the most powerful of the four fundamental forces of nature. It works to bind protons and neutrons together within the nucleus, but it operates over a very short rangeâ€”only over distances comparable to the size of the nucleus itself.

Conversely, the electromagnetic force acts between the protons in the nucleus, causing like charges to repel one another. This force has a significantly longer range than the strong nuclear force and tends to push the protons apart. The balance between these two forces is crucial for nuclear stability. When the strong nuclear force exceeds the electromagnetic force, the nucleus remains stable. However, if the electromagnetic force dominates, the nucleus becomes unstable and may undergo radioactive decay.

Moreover, the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is vital for its stability. Certain specific numbers of nucleons, referred to as "magic numbers," confer additional stability to the nucleus. These magic numbers include $2$, $8$, $20$, $28$, $50$, $82$, and $126$. Nuclei that contain these numbers of protons or neutrons exhibit greater stability compared to those with other configurations. This phenomenon can be attributed to the shell structure of the nucleus, which is analogous to the electron shell structure in atoms.

Additionally, the ratio of neutrons to protons is another critical factor influencing nuclear stability. For lighter elements, a neutron-to-proton ratio of $1:1$ generally leads to a stable nucleus. However, as we move to heavier elements, a greater number of neutrons are required to offset the increased electromagnetic repulsion stemming from the larger quantity of protons.

In conclusion, the stability of a nucleus is determined by the balance between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force, the overall number of protons and neutrons, and the specific ratio of neutrons to protons.
