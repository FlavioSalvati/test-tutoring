Kinetic energy and potential energy are two fundamental forms of energy in physics, each defined by different characteristics and behaviors.

**Kinetic Energy**  
Kinetic energy, commonly represented by the symbol $ K $, is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. The kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to both its mass and the square of its velocity. The formula for kinetic energy is given by:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

In this equation, $ m $ represents the mass of the object and $ v $ denotes its velocity. This relationship indicates that an object's kinetic energy increases as either its speed or mass increases. For example, a truck traveling at a high speed possesses significantly more kinetic energy than a bicycle moving at the same speed.

**Potential Energy**  
In contrast, potential energy is the energy an object holds due to its position or state, which can potentially be converted into kinetic energy. There are several types of potential energy, including gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, and chemical potential energy.

1. **Gravitational Potential Energy**  
   Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object has due to its height above the ground. The formula for gravitational potential energy is expressed as:

   $$
   U = mgh
   $$

   Here, $ m $ is the mass of the object, $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $ h $ is the height of the object relative to the ground. This formula shows that an object's gravitational potential energy increases with both its height and mass.

2. **Elastic Potential Energy**  
   Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an object when it is either stretched or compressed. A common example includes a stretched spring or a drawn bow, both of which store elastic potential energy. This energy is released when the object returns to its original shape.

3. **Chemical Potential Energy**  
   Chemical potential energy is the energy stored within the bonds of chemical compounds. This energy is released during a chemical reaction, often manifesting as heat or light. For instance, the energy stored in gasoline molecules is released when gasoline is combusted in an engine.

In summary, kinetic and potential energy are interrelated concepts in physics. Potential energy can be transformed into kinetic energy and vice versa, illustrating the principle known as the conservation of energy. This fundamental concept underscores the dynamic interplay between these two forms of energy in various physical systems.
