When the width of a slit is comparable to the wavelength of an incoming wave, a phenomenon known as diffraction occurs, leading to the spreading of the wave.

In the realm of physics, when a wave encounters a barrier with a slit that is roughly the same size as its wavelength, diffraction becomes significant. This concept is foundational in wave theory and is particularly important in the study of both light and sound waves.

Diffraction refers to the process by which a wave spreads out as it passes through an aperture or around an obstacle. When the slit width is comparable to the wavelength of the wave, the behavior of the wave changes; it does not simply travel through the slit in a straight line. Instead, the wave spreads out in a distinct pattern, which can be predicted based on wave theory principles.

The resulting diffraction pattern is influenced by the relationship between the size of the slit and the wavelength of the wave. If the slit is much larger than the wavelength, the wave will generally pass through with minimal disturbance. Conversely, if the slit is similar in size to the wavelength, the wave will spread out considerably. This spreading manifests as a pattern of alternating light and dark bands, known as a diffraction pattern, observable on a screen placed behind the slit.

To understand diffraction more thoroughly, it is essential to grasp the underlying principles. One key explanation involves Huygens' principle, which posits that every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets. These wavelets then interfere with one another, giving rise to the characteristic diffraction pattern.
