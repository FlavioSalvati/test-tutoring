Pushing an object is generally easier than pulling it, primarily due to the effective application of force and the role of friction.

When you push an object, the force is applied in the direction of its motion. This alignment allows the force to be used more effectively to move the object forward. In contrast, pulling an object involves a force that is not entirely directed along the path of motion. A portion of the force is used to lift the object slightly, which does not contribute to its forward movement. Consequently, this makes pulling less efficient compared to pushing.

Friction, the force that opposes motion, also significantly influences this dynamic. When pushing, the frictional force between the object and the surface helps stabilize the object, facilitating its movement. A deeper understanding of this relationship can shed light on the subtleties of the interaction between force and motion. Conversely, when pulling, the frictional force can cause the object to tip or become unstable, making it more challenging to move.

Additionally, the concept of normal force is crucial in this context. The normal force is the force exerted by a surface that supports the weight of an object resting on it, acting perpendicular to the surface. When pushing an object, you exert a downward force that increases the normal force, thereby enhancing the frictional force. This added friction can help prevent the object from sliding or slipping. In contrast, when pulling an object, the upward force you apply reduces the normal force and, consequently, the frictional force, increasing the likelihood of the object sliding or slipping.

This interplay between pushing, pulling, friction, and normal force is essential to understanding how and why objects move (or remain stationary) under various forces.
