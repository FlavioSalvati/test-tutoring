A mass-spring system demonstrates Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) due to the restoring force that is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position.

In a mass-spring system, when a mass is displaced from its equilibrium position, it experiences a restoring force aimed at returning the mass to its original position. This restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement but acts in the opposite direction. This relationship is mathematically described by Hooke's Law, which states that the force $F$ exerted by a spring is equal to the negative product of the spring constant $k$ and the displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position:

$$
F = -kx
$$

The negative sign indicates that the force acts as a restoring force, meaning it opposes the direction of the displacement. This characteristic is fundamental to Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM). In SHM, the restoring force on an object is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position but acts in the opposite direction.

When the mass is displaced and then released, it begins to oscillate around the equilibrium position. This motion is periodic, meaning it repeats at regular time intervals. The mass moves back and forth due to the restoring force provided by the spring. At the equilibrium position, the velocity of the mass reaches its maximum, while at the extreme positions, the velocity is at its minimum, specifically zero. Conversely, the acceleration of the mass is zero at the equilibrium position and reaches its maximum at the extreme positions.

In a mass-spring system oscillating in SHM, energy is conserved; it continually transforms between potential energy, which is stored in the spring when it is either compressed or extended, and kinetic energy associated with the moving mass. The total energy of the system remains constant, provided there are no energy losses due to friction or other non-conservative forces.

In summary, a mass-spring system exhibits Simple Harmonic Motion because the restoring force from the spring, which is proportional to the displacement, causes the mass to oscillate around an equilibrium position in a periodic manner.
