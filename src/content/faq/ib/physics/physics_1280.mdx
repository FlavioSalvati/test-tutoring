The double-slit experiment has profoundly influenced atomic theory by illustrating the wave-particle duality of both light and matter.

Originally conducted by Thomas Young in $1801$, the double-slit experiment aimed to demonstrate the wave nature of light. In this experiment, light is directed through two closely spaced slits, creating a pattern of alternating light and dark bands on a screen positioned behind the slits. This pattern is a clear indication of interference, a characteristic phenomenon of waves. Young's experiment significantly bolstered the wave theory of light, which was widely accepted at that time.

The true impact of the double-slit experiment on atomic theory emerged in the early $20^{th}$ century, as scientists began to delve into the quantum realm. They found that not only light but also particles such as electrons, when passed through a double-slit apparatus, produced an interference pattern akin to that of light waves. This discovery was startling, as particles were conventionally thought to exhibit solely particle-like properties, devoid of any wave-like characteristics. This phenomenon, termed wave-particle duality, became a foundational aspect of quantum mechanics—a theory that offers a fundamental understanding of nature at the atomic and subatomic levels.

Moreover, the double-slit experiment played a crucial role in the formulation of the uncertainty principle by Werner Heisenberg. This principle asserts that one cannot simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. This concept directly challenges the predictability inherent in classical physics. The experiment illustrated that when an attempt is made to observe which slit a particle traverses (thereby determining its position), the interference pattern vanishes. This highlights that the act of measurement itself influences the outcome.

In summary, the double-slit experiment has had a monumental impact on atomic theory. It has reshaped our classical understanding of particles and waves, paving the way for the development of quantum mechanics—a theory that has revolutionized our comprehension of the microscopic world. Additionally, it introduced the concepts of wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle, both of which are essential to our current understanding of atomic and subatomic particles.
