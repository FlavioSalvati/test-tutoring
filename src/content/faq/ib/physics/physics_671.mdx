Impulse is fundamentally tied to the change in an object's velocity, defined as the product of force and the duration of time over which that force acts.

In physics, impulse quantifies the cumulative effect of a force exerted on a body over a specific time interval. It is mathematically represented as the product of force and the time period during which the force is applied. The unit of impulse is the Newton-second (N.s), which is equivalent to a kilogram-meter per second ($\text{kg.m/s}$). Interestingly, this unit is also used for momentum, highlighting the intrinsic relationship between impulse and changes in velocity.

The impulse-momentum theorem states that the impulse experienced by an object is equal to the change in its momentum. Momentum itself is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. Therefore, provided the mass of the object remains constant—an assumption commonly made in physics problems—the change in momentum is directly proportional to the change in velocity.

Consequently, when a force is applied to an object over a given time frame, it results in a change in the object's velocity. A larger impulse correlates with a greater change in velocity. This principle explains why, for instance, a cricket player moves their hand backward while catching a ball. By extending the time over which the force acts, the player effectively reduces the change in the ball's velocity (and thus the impulse), making the catch less jarring and more manageable.

In conclusion, impulse is a crucial concept in understanding the influence of forces on the motion of objects. It establishes a clear connection between the force applied to an object, the duration of that force, and the resulting change in velocity. This relationship is vital across various fields of physics, from fundamental mechanics to more complex phenomena such as collisions and explosions.
