Interference patterns arise when waves from two or more coherent sources overlap and interact with one another.

Interference is a fundamental concept in physics, especially in the study of waves. It describes the phenomenon where two or more waves superimpose to create a resultant wave that may have a greater, lower, or unchanged amplitude. This superposition leads to the formation of a complex pattern characterized by nodes (points of no displacement) and antinodes (points of maximum displacement), collectively known as an interference pattern.

To observe interference patterns, at least two coherent sources of waves are required. Coherent sources are defined as those that maintain a constant phase difference and have identical frequencies. Common examples of such sources include two slits in a barrier illuminated by monochromatic light, as demonstrated in Young's double-slit experiment, two loudspeakers emitting sound at the same frequency, or two vibrating tuning forks.

When waves from these coherent sources overlap, they interact in two main ways: constructively or destructively. Constructive interference occurs when waves combine to form a wave with greater amplitude, while destructive interference happens when waves cancel each other out. The resulting pattern of constructive and destructive interference is what we refer to as an interference pattern.

For light waves, these interference patterns manifest as a series of bright and dark fringes on a screen. The bright fringes correspond to regions of constructive interference, where the waves combine to produce a higher intensity of light. Conversely, the dark fringes indicate areas of destructive interference, where the waves cancel each other, resulting in no light being observed.

In the context of sound, the interference pattern can be perceived as alternating loud and quiet regions. The loud areas correspond to constructive interference, where sound waves combine to create a higher intensity of sound. In contrast, the quiet regions result from destructive interference, where sound waves cancel one another, leading to silence.

In summary, observing interference patterns involves establishing coherent sources of waves, allowing these waves to overlap and interact, and then analyzing the resultant pattern of constructive and destructive interference.
