The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon that plays a critical role in warming the Earth's surface. It is named after the way a greenhouse functions: sunlight enters through glass panels, warming the plants and air inside. Similarly, the Earth's atmosphere permits sunlight, or solar radiation, to penetrate and warm the surface of the planet. This heat is then radiated back towards space as thermal radiation, specifically in the form of infrared radiation.

However, not all of this thermal radiation escapes into space. Certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, absorb this thermal radiation. Key greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), nitrous oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$), and water vapor ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). Once these gases absorb the thermal energy, they re-emit it in all directions. A portion of this re-emitted radiation is directed back towards the Earth's surface, resulting in additional warming. This process is what constitutes the greenhouse effect.

The greenhouse effect is essential for sustaining life on Earth. In its absence, the average temperature of the planet would plummet to approximately $-18^\circ \text{C}$, which is far too cold to support most living organisms. However, human activities—such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation—have led to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This rise in greenhouse gas levels intensifies the greenhouse effect, contributing to global warming and climate change.

In conclusion, the greenhouse effect significantly influences thermal radiation. The Earth's surface absorbs solar radiation, warms up, and subsequently re-emits this energy as thermal radiation. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere capture this thermal radiation and re-emit it in all directions, further warming the Earth's surface. While this process is vital for maintaining the planet's temperature, human actions are amplifying the concentration of greenhouse gases, thus enhancing the greenhouse effect and driving global warming.
