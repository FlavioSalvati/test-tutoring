Gravitational force is a universal attraction that occurs between masses, while electromagnetic force encompasses both attraction and repulsion between charged particles.

The gravitational force is a fundamental interaction that exists between all objects possessing mass. This force is always attractive, meaning it consistently acts to pull objects closer together. It is described by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle in the universe exerts an attractive force on every other particle. This force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

where $F$ is the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers. Despite its universal presence, gravity is the weakest among the four fundamental forces and its effects become significant primarily on a large scale, such as the interactions between celestial bodies.

In contrast, the electromagnetic force is another fundamental interaction that operates between charged particles. This force can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the nature of the charges involved: like charges repel each other, whereas unlike charges attract. The electromagnetic force is significantly stronger than gravity, approximately $10^{36}$ times more powerful. It governs interactions at the atomic level, effectively holding atoms and molecules together, and also underpins macroscopic forces such as friction and tension.

Moreover, these two forces operate over different ranges. The gravitational force acts over infinite distances, maintaining the orbits of planets around stars and contributing to the large-scale structure of the universe. While the electromagnetic force also has an infinite range, it is typically confined to smaller scales because positive and negative charges in the universe tend to balance out, resulting in a net electromagnetic force of zero over vast distances.

Finally, the two forces are described by different theories in modern physics. Gravitational interactions are explained by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which conceptualizes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. On the other hand, the electromagnetic force is described by quantum electrodynamics (QED), a quantum field theory that depicts it as the result of photon exchanges between charged particles. These distinctions in theoretical frameworks highlight the fundamentally different characteristics of gravitational and electromagnetic forces.
