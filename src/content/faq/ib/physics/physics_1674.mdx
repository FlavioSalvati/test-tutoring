The Doppler effect is a significant phenomenon in physics that illustrates how the frequency and wavelength of a wave are altered when there is relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. This effect is most commonly associated with sound waves, but it also applies to light waves and other types of waves. The changes in frequency and wavelength are responsible for the characteristic shift in pitch that occurs, for instance, when a vehicle with a siren passes by.

When the source and the observer are moving toward each other, the observer perceives a higher frequency (or a shorter wavelength) than the actual frequency of the wave. This occurs because the relative motion reduces the distance between the observer and each successive wavefront, allowing the waves to reach the observer more frequently. As a result, the observer hears a higher pitch for sound waves, or experiences a blue shift for light waves, where the light shifts toward the blue end of the spectrum.

Conversely, when the source and the observer are moving away from each other, the observer perceives a lower frequency (or a longer wavelength) than the actual frequency of the wave. In this case, the relative motion increases the distance between the observer and each successive wavefront, causing the waves to reach the observer less frequently. This results in a lower pitch for sound waves, or a red shift for light waves, where the light shifts toward the red end of the spectrum.

The magnitude of the Doppler effect is influenced by the relative speed of the source and the observer. The greater the relative speed, the more pronounced the change in perceived frequency and wavelength. Additionally, the direction of motion plays a crucial role; if the source and observer are moving at right angles to each other, there is no Doppler effect, as the distance between the observer and each successive wavefront remains constant.

In conclusion, the relative motion between the source and the observer significantly affects the Doppler effect by altering the perceived frequency and wavelength of the wave. This alteration results from the variation in distance between the observer and each successive wavefront due to their relative motion.
