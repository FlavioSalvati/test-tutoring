Wavelength and frequency exhibit an inverse relationship; as the frequency of a wave increases, its wavelength decreases.

In physics, particularly in the study of waves, the relationship between wavelength and frequency is a fundamental principle. Wavelength, denoted by the Greek letter lambda ($\lambda$), represents the distance between two successive points in a wave that are in the same phase. This could refer to the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs. Frequency, represented by the symbol $f$, is defined as the number of waves that pass a specific point in a unit of time, typically measured in seconds (also known as Hertz, Hz).

The connection between wavelength and frequency is described by the wave equation:

$$
v = f \lambda
$$

In this equation, $v$ represents the speed of the wave. It indicates that the speed of a wave is equal to the product of its frequency and wavelength. Therefore, if the speed of the wave is constant—such as for light in a vacuum—an increase in frequency will lead to a decrease in wavelength, and vice versa. This relationship is referred to as an inverse relationship.

To visualize this concept, consider a wave on a string. If you shake the end of the string more rapidly (thereby increasing the frequency), the waves become closer together, resulting in a shorter wavelength. Conversely, if you shake the string more slowly, the waves will spread apart, leading to a longer wavelength. This simple demonstration illustrates the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength.

In the context of light waves, this relationship helps explain the various colors we perceive. Light with a high frequency (and thus a short wavelength) appears blue or violet, while light with a low frequency (and a long wavelength) appears red. This is why we observe a spectrum of colors in a rainbow, ranging from red at one end (long wavelength, low frequency) to violet at the other end (short wavelength, high frequency).

Grasping the relationship between wavelength and frequency is essential in numerous areas of physics, including quantum mechanics and electromagnetic theory. This understanding enables us to comprehend and predict the behavior of waves across a range of phenomena, from light and sound to radio waves and microwaves.
