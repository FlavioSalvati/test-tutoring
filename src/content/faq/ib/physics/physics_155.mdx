The frequency of a wave plays a crucial role in determining its diffraction properties. Specifically, higher frequency waves exhibit less diffraction compared to lower frequency waves.

To elaborate, diffraction is the phenomenon where waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through an opening. This effect becomes particularly pronounced when the wavelength of the wave is similar to the dimensions of the obstacle or the gap. Since frequency and wavelength are inversely related, waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, while those with lower frequencies have longer wavelengths. Consequently, waves with higher frequencies, and thus shorter wavelengths, will diffract less than those with lower frequencies and longer wavelengths.

The extent of diffraction is influenced by the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the obstacle or gap. When the wavelength is significantly smaller than the size of the obstacle or gap, the wave tends to travel in a straight line with minimal diffraction. Conversely, if the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the size of the obstacle or gap, the wave will diffract more, spreading out after passing through the opening or around the obstacle.

To illustrate this concept, consider light waves, which belong to the electromagnetic spectrum and possess much higher frequencies—hence shorter wavelengths—compared to sound waves. When light waves encounter a small obstacle or gap, they do not undergo significant diffraction and predominantly continue in a straight path, resulting in sharp-edged shadows. In contrast, sound waves, characterized by their lower frequencies and longer wavelengths, diffract more readily when they encounter an obstacle or gap. This is why sounds can still be heard even when they originate from behind an obstruction.

In summary, the frequency of a wave has a significant impact on its diffraction behavior. Higher frequency waves, associated with shorter wavelengths, diffract less than lower frequency waves, which have longer wavelengths. This fundamental principle is essential for understanding various physical phenomena, including the behavior of light and sound waves.
