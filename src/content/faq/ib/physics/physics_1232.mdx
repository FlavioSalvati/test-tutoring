Not all isotopes of an element undergo radioactive decay; some isotopes are stable and do not possess excess nuclear energy.

Isotopes are distinct forms of the same element that contain the same number of protons but differ in the number of neutrons. The stability of an isotope is determined by the ratio of protons to neutrons in its nucleus. When an isotope has an imbalance—specifically, too many or too few neutrons relative to protons—it becomes unstable and will undergo radioactive decay in an effort to reach a more stable configuration. This decay process involves the emission of radiation in various forms, including alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays.

Conversely, not all isotopes are unstable. Some isotopes maintain a precise balance of protons and neutrons, rendering them stable. These stable isotopes do not possess excess nuclear energy that requires release, and therefore, they do not undergo radioactive decay. For instance, isotopes such as carbon-12 and oxygen-16 are examples of stable nuclei that remain unchanged over time.

The stability of an isotope is also influenced by the nuclear forces that bind protons and neutrons together within the nucleus. The strong nuclear force, which is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the nucleus, is immensely powerful but operates effectively only over short distances. If a nucleus becomes too large, the strong nuclear force may be insufficient to hold it together, resulting in instability.

In summary, whether an isotope undergoes decay is contingent upon its nuclear stability, which is influenced by the balance of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, as well as the strength of the nuclear forces at play. Stable isotopes do not decay because they lack excess nuclear energy to release, while unstable isotopes seek stability through radioactive decay.
