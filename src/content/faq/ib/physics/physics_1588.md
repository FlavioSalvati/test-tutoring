The formula for interference fringes arises from the path difference between two interfering waves and their respective wavelengths. This concept is closely linked to the principle of superposition, which is essential for understanding wave interference phenomena.

In a double-slit experiment, light from a single source is divided into two beams as it passes through two closely spaced slits. These beams then interfere with one another, resulting in a pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes on a screen. This interference pattern can be further analyzed in related studies. The position of these fringes is influenced by the path difference between the two beams, which depends on the wavelength of the light and the angle at which it strikes the screen.

To calculate the path difference between the two beams, we can use basic geometry. Let the distance between the slits be denoted as $d$, the distance from the slits to the screen as $L$, and the angle between the central fringe (which is directly opposite the slits) and the fringe in question as $\theta$. The path difference, denoted as $\Delta x$, can be expressed as:

$$
\Delta x = d \sin \theta.
$$

This equation captures the additional distance that one beam travels compared to the other, which corresponds to the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with base $d$ and angle $\theta$.

For constructive interference, which produces bright fringes, the path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength $\lambda$. This occurs when the two beams are in phase, causing their peaks and troughs to align and resulting in increased brightness. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:

$$
d \sin \theta = m \lambda,
$$

where $m$ is an integer representing the order of the fringe. 

Conversely, for destructive interference, which results in dark fringes, the path difference needs to be a half-integer multiple of the wavelength. This situation arises when the two beams are out of phase, leading to the cancellation of their peaks and troughs, and consequently, a reduction in light intensity. This condition can be expressed as:

$$
d \sin \theta = \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right) \lambda.
$$

From these relationships, we can derive the formulas for the position of the $m$th bright fringe and the $m$th dark fringe on the screen. The position of the $m$th bright fringe is given by:

$$
y = L \tan \theta = \frac{Lm \lambda}{d},
$$

while the position of the $m$th dark fringe is expressed as:

$$
y = L \tan \theta = \frac{L\left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right) \lambda}{d}.
$$

These formulas enable us to predict the locations of the interference fringes based on the wavelength of the light, the slit separation, and the distance to the screen. A deeper understanding of how these fringes are formed can be achieved by studying interference patterns, which are intricately related to these concepts.

### Summary
The formula for interference fringes in a double-slit experiment is based on the path difference between two light beams and their wavelengths. By applying basic geometric principles and considering the alignment of waves, we can determine the locations of bright and dark fringes on a screen. This framework aids in predicting and comprehending the intricate patterns generated by light interference.
