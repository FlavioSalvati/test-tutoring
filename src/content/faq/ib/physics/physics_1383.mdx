Heat is transferred by conduction through the direct contact and vibration of molecules within a substance.

Conduction is one of the three primary methods of heat transfer, alongside convection and radiation. It refers to the process by which heat energy is transmitted within a body or between bodies that are in direct contact, without any movement of the material itself. This mode of heat transfer is most efficient in solids, especially metals, due to their tightly packed molecular structure.

The conduction process begins when one end of a substance is heated. The molecules at this end absorb kinetic energy and begin to vibrate more vigorously. These vibrations are then transmitted to adjacent molecules, continuing along the material and effectively transferring heat energy from the heated end to the cooler end. This phenomenon is often described as a "domino effect."

It is crucial to understand that during conduction, heat energy is conveyed from one molecule to another within the substance; however, the molecules themselves do not move along with the energy. This characteristic distinctly separates conduction from convection, where heated molecules move and carry heat energy with them.

The rate of conduction is influenced by several factors. First, the type of material plays a significant role: metals are excellent conductors of heat because they possess free electrons that can move rapidly, facilitating energy transfer from the hot end to the cool end of the substance. In contrast, materials such as wood or plastic are poor conductors (or good insulators) because they lack these free electrons. Second, the temperature difference between the two ends of the substance affects conduction; the larger the temperature difference, the faster the rate of heat transfer. Lastly, the dimensions of the substance also matter: shorter and wider materials typically conduct heat more efficiently.

In summary, conduction is a heat transfer process that occurs through the direct contact and vibrational energy of molecules within a substance. It is particularly effective in solids, especially metals, and is influenced by factors such as the type of material, the temperature gradient, and the dimensions of the substance.
