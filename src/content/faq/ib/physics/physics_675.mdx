Force influences rotational motion by inducing a change in angular velocity, resulting in either rotational acceleration or deceleration.

To elaborate, the impact of force on rotational motion is described by Newton's second law of motion. This law asserts that the rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the force applied, acting in the direction of that force. In the realm of rotational motion, this principle is frequently articulated using the concepts of torque and angular momentum. Torque serves as the rotational equivalent of force, defined as the product of the applied force and the perpendicular distance from the point of application to the axis of rotation. Conversely, angular momentum represents the rotational counterpart of linear momentum.

When a force is applied to a rotating body, it generates torque, which alters the body's angular momentum, leading to either acceleration or deceleration. The direction of the change in angular velocity is contingent upon the direction of the applied force. If the force is applied in the same direction as the body's rotation, it results in an increase in speed, or acceleration. Conversely, if the force opposes the direction of rotation, it causes the body to slow down, or decelerate.

The extent of the change in angular velocity is determined by both the magnitude of the applied force and the moment of inertia of the object. The moment of inertia quantifies the object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion, depending on the mass of the object and how that mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. A body with a larger moment of inertia requires a greater force to achieve a change in its angular velocity compared to a body with a smaller moment of inertia.

In conclusion, force affects rotational motion by inducing a change in angular velocity, resulting in either rotational acceleration or deceleration. The direction and magnitude of this change are influenced by the direction and magnitude of the applied force, as well as the moment of inertia of the body.
