The phase difference in wave interference is a critical factor that dictates whether the resultant wave exhibits constructive or destructive interference.

In interference phenomena, two or more waves combine to produce a resultant wave that may have greater, lesser, or unchanged amplitude. This superposition typically occurs when the waves are coherent, meaning they maintain a constant phase difference and share the same frequency. The phase difference between these waves is fundamental in determining the characteristics of the resultant wave.

When the phase difference is an integer multiple of a complete cycle, such as $0$, $2\pi$, $4\pi$, and so forth, the waves are described as being "in phase." In this scenario, the crests and troughs of the waves align perfectly, resulting in constructive interference. Consequently, the amplitude of the resultant wave is the sum of the individual wave amplitudes. This phenomenon accounts for the appearance of bright fringes in the interference pattern of light.

Conversely, when the phase difference corresponds to an odd multiple of a half cycle, such as $\pi$, $3\pi$, $5\pi$, etc., the waves are considered "out of phase." In this case, the crest of one wave coincides with the trough of another, leading to destructive interference. The amplitude of the resultant wave is then the difference between the amplitudes of the individual waves, resulting in dark fringes within the light interference pattern.

Additionally, the phase difference influences the spatial arrangement of these bright and dark fringes in the interference pattern. A larger phase difference shifts the position of the fringes further from the center of the pattern. This alternating pattern of bright and dark fringes is a hallmark of wave interference.

In conclusion, the phase difference in wave interference is crucial, as it determines whether the interference is constructive or destructive, while also affecting the positioning of the fringes in the interference pattern. Grasping this concept is essential for interpreting and predicting the outcomes of wave interference experiments, such as Young's double-slit experiment.
