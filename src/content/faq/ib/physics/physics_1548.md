The first diffraction minimum marks the point at which destructive interference occurs, leading to a noticeable decrease in light intensity.

In the field of wave optics, diffraction is a fundamental phenomenon. It describes the bending and spreading of waves as they encounter an obstacle or pass through a gap. This effect becomes particularly pronounced when the dimensions of the obstacle or gap are comparable to the wavelength of the wave. When light waves travel through a narrow slit, they expand and interact with one another, resulting in a distinctive pattern of alternating bright and dark bands on a screen, known as a diffraction pattern.

The bright bands, referred to as maxima, arise from constructive interference, where the waves combine to produce a resultant wave with greater amplitude. Conversely, the dark bands, called minima, occur due to destructive interference, where the waves cancel each other out, yielding a resultant wave with reduced or zero amplitude. The first diffraction minimum is the initial point where this destructive interference takes place, resulting in a significant drop in light intensity.

The position of the first diffraction minimum is particularly important because it allows us to calculate the width of the slit through which the light is passing. According to the formula for single-slit diffraction, the angle to the first minimum, denoted as $\theta$, is given by the relationship:

$$ \sin(\theta) = \frac{\lambda}{d} $$

Here, $\lambda$ represents the wavelength of the light, and $d$ is the width of the slit. By measuring the angle to the first minimum, we can accurately determine the width of the slit.

Moreover, the first diffraction minimum offers valuable insights into the wave nature of light. The ability of light to interfere with itself, producing a diffraction pattern, serves as compelling evidence of its wave-like characteristics. This behavior stands in contrast to the particle model of light, which fails to explain such phenomena. Consequently, the first diffraction minimum is essential for deepening our understanding of light's dual nature as both a wave and a particle.
