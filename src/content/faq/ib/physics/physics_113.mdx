The conservation of energy in the context of projectile motion refers to the principle that the total energy of the projectile remains constant throughout its flight.

In physics, the conservation of energy is a fundamental concept that asserts the total energy of an isolated system remains unchanged, regardless of any internal changes that may occur. This principle is particularly relevant for projectiles—objects thrown into the air or space that are primarily influenced by gravitational forces and, to a lesser extent, air resistance.

When a projectile is launched, it possesses both kinetic energy, due to its motion, and potential energy, due to its height above the ground. The kinetic energy is maximized at the moment of launch, when the projectile's speed is greatest. As the projectile ascends, its kinetic energy decreases as it slows down under the influence of gravity. In contrast, the potential energy starts at zero at the launch point and increases as the projectile rises. At the peak of its trajectory, the kinetic energy reaches zero, while the potential energy is at its maximum.

As the projectile begins to descend, the process reverses: the potential energy decreases as the height diminishes, while the kinetic energy increases as the speed picks up. At any point in the flight, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy equals the total mechanical energy of the projectile. This total energy remains constant throughout the motion, illustrating the principle of energy conservation.

It is important to note that this idealized model assumes the absence of air resistance and any forces other than gravity. In reality, air resistance can perform work on the projectile, converting some of its mechanical energy into thermal energy, which dissipates into the surrounding environment. This interaction can result in a decrease in the total mechanical energy of the projectile over time. However, if we consider thermal energy as part of the system, the overall total energy—including both mechanical and thermal energy—remains conserved.

In summary, the conservation of energy in the motion of a projectile exemplifies the broader principle of energy conservation, which states that the total energy of a system remains constant if no net work is performed by external forces.
