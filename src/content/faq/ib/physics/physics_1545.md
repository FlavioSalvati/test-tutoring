In single-slit diffraction, the phase difference between waves emanating from different sections of the slit is influenced by the path difference among these waves.

To elaborate, single-slit diffraction occurs when light passes through a narrow slit, causing the light to spread out and form a pattern of alternating light and dark fringes on a screen. This interference pattern arises from the superposition of light waves originating from various points along the slit. The phase difference between these waves is determined by the path difference, which represents the difference in the distance each wave travels from the slit to the screen.

The path difference is influenced by several factors, including the position of the fringe on the screen, the wavelength of the light, and the width of the slit. When the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, constructive interference occurs, resulting in a bright fringe. Conversely, when the path difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength, destructive interference takes place, leading to a dark fringe.

The phase difference quantifies how far one wave is ahead or behind another in its cycle, and it can be expressed in degrees or radians. It is directly related to the path difference: a path difference of one wavelength corresponds to a phase difference of $360$ degrees or $2\pi$ radians. Consequently, the phase difference between waves from different parts of the slit during single-slit diffraction can vary from $0$ to $360$ degrees or from $0$ to $2\pi$ radians, depending on their position on the screen.
