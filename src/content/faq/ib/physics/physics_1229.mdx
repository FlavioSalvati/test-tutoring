Carbon-14 is a vital tool in archaeological dating, enabling scientists to ascertain the age of ancient organic materials.

Carbon-14, also known as radiocarbon, is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon. It is produced in the atmosphere when cosmic rays interact with nitrogen-14. This isotope is then absorbed by living organisms. Upon the death of an organism, it ceases to absorb carbon-14, and the isotope begins to decay at a known rate, referred to as its half-life. The half-life of carbon-14 is approximately $5,730$ years, making it particularly suitable for dating organic materials that are up to around $50,000$ years old.

The technique of utilizing carbon-14 for dating purposes is known as radiocarbon dating. In this process, scientists measure the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a sample to estimate the time of death of the organism from which the material originated. This is feasible because the amount of carbon-12 in a sample remains relatively constant after death, while the quantity of carbon-14 diminishes over time due to radioactive decay. By comparing the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a sample with the ratio present in the atmosphere, scientists can calculate the elapsed time since the organism's death.

Radiocarbon dating serves as an invaluable resource for archaeologists, as it provides a systematic method for determining the age of organic materials uncovered at archaeological sites. Common materials analyzed include wood, bone, shell, and peat. By dating these items, archaeologists can construct a chronological framework of human activity and cultural evolution.

However, it is crucial to recognize that radiocarbon dating has its limitations. It can only be applied to organic materials and is less accurate for items older than approximately $50,000$ years due to the diminishing levels of carbon-14. Furthermore, factors such as sample contamination or fluctuations in atmospheric carbon-14 concentration over time can impact the accuracy of the dating results. Despite these challenges, carbon-14 remains an essential instrument in the archaeological toolkit.
