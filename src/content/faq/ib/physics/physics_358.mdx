Uncertainty in tabulated data can be effectively represented using error bars or by appending a ± symbol next to the data value.

In physics, as well as in any scientific experiment, there is always a degree of uncertainty associated with the measurements obtained. This uncertainty can stem from various factors, including the precision of the measuring instrument, the observer's ability to accurately read the instrument, or the inherent variability of the quantity being measured. Accurately representing this uncertainty is essential for providing a comprehensive and accurate portrayal of the results.

A common method for illustrating uncertainty in tabulated data is through the use of error bars. Error bars are graphical representations that indicate the variability of the data and are often employed in graphs to signify the error or uncertainty associated with a reported measurement. They provide a visual indication of the precision of a measurement, or conversely, how much the true (error-free) value might deviate from the reported value. Typically, error bars represent a specific measure of uncertainty, such as one standard deviation, one standard error, or a particular confidence interval (e.g., a 95% confidence interval). These quantities are derived from the data and subsequently depicted as error bars in the graph.

Alternatively, uncertainty can also be conveyed by including a ± symbol next to the data value in the table. This approach is particularly useful when the uncertainty is consistent across all measurements or when drawing error bars is impractical. For instance, if you measure the length of a table with a ruler and obtain a value of $1.00 \, \text{m}$, you could represent this in a table as $1.00 \pm 0.01 \, \text{m}$, where the $ \pm 0.01 \, \text{m}$ denotes the uncertainty in the measurement.

In conclusion, representing uncertainty in tabulated data is crucial in the field of physics, as it provides a more accurate and complete understanding of the results. The choice between using error bars or the ± symbol depends on the nature of the data and the context in which it is presented.
