A coil rotating within a magnetic field generates a torque due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the electric current flowing through it.

When a current-carrying coil is situated in a magnetic field, it experiences a force resulting from this interaction. This force can be determined using Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, which states that the force acts perpendicular to both the direction of the current and the magnetic field. As a consequence, this force induces rotation in the coil. This principle is essential to the functioning of electric motors.
