The natural frequency of an oscillator is influenced by both the mass of the system and the stiffness of the spring.

The natural frequency, often referred to as the resonant frequency, is a crucial characteristic of oscillatory systems, such as mass-spring systems. It represents the frequency at which the system tends to oscillate naturally when there are no external driving or damping forces acting on it. The natural frequency of such a system is primarily determined by two factors: the mass of the object and the stiffness of the spring.

The mass of the object, typically denoted as $m$, plays a significant role in this relationship. As the mass increases, the system tends to oscillate more slowly, resulting in a lower natural frequency. This phenomenon occurs because a heavier mass requires more force to change its motion, in accordance with Newton's second law of motion. Consequently, for a given force, a larger mass will experience a smaller acceleration, leading to slower oscillations.

Conversely, the stiffness of the spring, commonly represented by the spring constant $k$, also affects the natural frequency. A stiffer spring, characterized by a larger spring constant, will cause the system to oscillate more rapidly, resulting in a higher natural frequency. This is due to the fact that a stiffer spring generates a greater restoring force for a given displacement, which causes the mass to accelerate more and thus oscillate faster.

The relationship between the natural frequency, mass, and spring constant can be expressed by the formula:

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},
$$

where $f$ represents the natural frequency, $k$ is the spring constant, and $m$ is the mass. This equation illustrates that the natural frequency is directly proportional to the square root of the spring stiffness and inversely proportional to the square root of the mass.

In conclusion, the natural frequency of an oscillator is a fundamental property determined by both the mass of the object and the stiffness of the spring. An increase in mass will lower the natural frequency, while a stiffer spring will elevate it.
