When two objects possess equal and opposite momentum, they will collide and come to a stop, assuming an elastic collision.

In physics, momentum is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. When two objects have equal and opposite momentum, their magnitudes are identical, but their directions are opposite. This situation is commonly observed in head-on collisions, where two objects approach each other with the same speed but in opposite directions.

According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force. In the case of two objects with equal and opposite momentum, the total momentum before the collision is zero. Consequently, the total momentum after the collision must also equal zero. This outcome can only occur if both objects come to a complete stop after the collision.

However, this analysis assumes an elastic collision, where kinetic energy is conserved along with momentum. In an elastic collision, the two objects will bounce off each other. On the other hand, if the collision is inelastic—where kinetic energy is not conserved—the two objects may stick together and continue moving in the direction of the object with greater mass. The mass of the objects plays a critical role in determining the outcome of collisions, as it affects the change in momentum and the final velocities of the involved objects.

It is important to note that this scenario presumes no external forces are acting on the system. If external forces such as gravity or friction are present, they could significantly influence the results of the collision. Additionally, the effects of acceleration on the objects, as discussed in the relevant notes, must be taken into account when analyzing real-world collisions.

**IB Physics Tutor Summary**: When two objects have equal and opposite momentum and collide, they typically come to a stop if the collision is elastic, as both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. In the case of an inelastic collision, the objects may stick together and move as a single entity. External forces, such as gravity or friction, could alter these outcomes, and this analysis assumes there are no external forces acting on the system.
