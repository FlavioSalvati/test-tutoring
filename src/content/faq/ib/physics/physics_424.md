Impulse is calculated by multiplying the change in momentum by the duration of time over which this change occurs.

Impulse, often represented by the letter $J$, is a crucial concept in physics. It is defined as the change in momentum of an object when a force is applied over a specific time interval. In mathematical terms, impulse can be expressed as the integral of a force $F$ over the time interval $\Delta t$ during which it acts:

$$
J = F \Delta t.
$$

Momentum, in contrast, is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. It is a vector quantity, meaning it possesses both magnitude and direction. The change in momentum, commonly denoted by the Greek letter delta ($\Delta$), is calculated by subtracting the initial momentum from the final momentum:

$$
\Delta p = p_{\text{final}} - p_{\text{initial}}.
$$

To calculate impulse from a change in momentum, you need to know the time over which the change occurred. You then multiply the change in momentum by this time to obtain the impulse. For example, consider a $1 \, \text{kg}$ object that changes its velocity from $5 \, \text{m/s}$ to $10 \, \text{m/s}$ over a period of $2 \, \text{s}$. The change in momentum can be calculated as follows:

$$
\Delta p = (1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 10 \, \text{m/s}) - (1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 5 \, \text{m/s}) = 5 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
$$

Thus, the impulse can be determined by multiplying the change in momentum by the time interval:

$$
J = 5 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \cdot 2 \, \text{s} = 10 \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}.
$$

It is important to remember that both impulse and momentum are vector quantities, which means they have direction as well as magnitude. When calculating impulse, be mindful of the direction of the forces involved. If the force acts in the opposite direction to the object's motion, it will decrease the object's momentum, resulting in a negative impulse. Conversely, if the force acts in the same direction as the object's motion, it will increase the object's momentum, yielding a positive impulse.
