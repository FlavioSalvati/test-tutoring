Thompson's plum pudding model was ultimately disproven as it could not adequately explain the outcomes of Rutherford's gold foil experiment.

J.J. Thomson's plum pudding model represented a significant advancement in our comprehension of atomic structure. Proposed in $1904$, this model posited that atoms were made up of negatively charged electrons embedded within a 'pudding' of positive charge, akin to plums scattered throughout a pudding. This concept was based on the scientific knowledge of the time, which included the discovery of the electron and the understanding that atoms were electrically neutral, meaning they contained equal amounts of positive and negative charge.

However, the plum pudding model fell short when confronted with the results of an experiment conducted by Ernest Rutherford and his team in $1909$. Known as the gold foil experiment, it involved firing alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. According to the plum pudding model, the alpha particles should have traversed the positive 'pudding' without any significant deflection. Contrary to this expectation, Rutherford observed that some alpha particles were deflected at large angles, with a few even rebounding directly back. These findings indicated that the positive charge, along with most of the atom's mass, was concentrated within a small, dense nucleus, thereby contradicting the plum pudding model.

In $1911$, Rutherford proposed a new nuclear model of the atom that replaced the plum pudding model. This model described the atom as consisting of a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. This revised model successfully accounted for the observations from the gold foil experiment, as the deflection of the alpha particles could be explained by their interaction with the concentrated positive charge residing in the nucleus.

In conclusion, Thomson's plum pudding model was rendered obsolete because it could not explain the results of Rutherford's gold foil experiment. This pivotal experiment demonstrated that the atom's positive charge and most of its mass were concentrated in a small central nucleus, directly contradicting the notion of a uniformly distributed 'pudding' of positive charge. This breakthrough led to the establishment of Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom, which remains a foundational concept in modern atomic theory.
