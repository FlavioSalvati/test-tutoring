Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a specific type of oscillatory motion characterized by a restoring force that is proportional to the displacement from a central equilibrium position.

In more detail, SHM is a unique form of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement measured from the equilibrium position—the point at which the object is at rest and experiences no net force. The motion occurs along a straight line and is oscillatory, meaning the object moves back and forth along the same path.

A defining feature of SHM is that the restoring force, which drives the motion, is always directed toward the equilibrium position. This force can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
F = -kx,
$$

where $F$ represents the restoring force, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The negative sign indicates that the force always acts in the opposite direction to the displacement, striving to restore the object to its equilibrium state.

During SHM, the object's velocity and acceleration vary as it oscillates. The object reaches its maximum speed as it passes through the equilibrium position and slows down as it approaches the extremes of its motion. The acceleration is greatest at the extremes and is zero at the equilibrium position. This is due to the fact that the restoring force—and consequently the acceleration—is maximized when the object is farthest from the equilibrium position.

Examples of simple harmonic motion include the swinging of a simple pendulum (for small angular displacements), the oscillation of a mass attached to a spring, and the vibrations of a molecule around its equilibrium position. In each of these instances, the system inherently tends to return to its equilibrium position, with the restoring force being proportional to the displacement from that position.

The mathematical representation of SHM employs sine and cosine functions, which effectively describe the displacement, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time. These functions are ideal for modeling smooth, periodic oscillations, which are characteristic of simple harmonic motion.
