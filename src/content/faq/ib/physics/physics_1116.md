Riders experience a sensation of being pressed into their seats while on rotating fair rides, which can be attributed to the effects of centrifugal force.

To elaborate, when a ride begins to rotate, the riders inside are set into motion. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant speed and in a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This principle is commonly referred to as the law of inertia. As the ride spins, the riders naturally want to continue moving in a straight path. However, the seats, which are securely attached to the ride, exert a force on the riders that compels them to follow a circular trajectory.

This force exerted by the seats is known as centripetal force, which is always directed towards the center of the circular path. In accordance with Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, the riders exert an equal force on the seats in the opposite direction, away from the center of the circle. This outward force is referred to as centrifugal force, and it is the reason riders feel as though they are being pressed against their seats.

The strength of the centrifugal force is influenced by three key factors: the mass of the rider, the speed of the ride, and the radius of the circular path. Specifically, greater speeds or larger radii result in an increased centrifugal force, thereby intensifying the sensation of being pushed back into the seat.

It is crucial to recognize that centrifugal force is a 'fictitious' or 'pseudo' force. It does not exist in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference. Instead, it appears to exist when viewed from a rotating (accelerating) frame of reference, such as the seats of a spinning fair ride. In reality, riders are attempting to maintain a straight-line motion due to inertia, while the seats continuously direct them towards the center of the circle through centripetal force. This interplay creates the illusion of an outward force (centrifugal force) acting on the riders.
