The resolving power of a microscope, commonly referred to as its resolution, is defined as its ability to distinguish between two closely spaced points. This characteristic is crucial in microscopy, as it directly impacts the level of detail observable in specimens. The two primary factors that influence a microscope's resolving power are the wavelength of light employed and the numerical aperture of the objective lens.

The wavelength of light utilized in microscopy plays a pivotal role in determining resolving power. Shorter wavelengths are capable of resolving finer details because they can interact with smaller structures. This phenomenon is attributable to the wave nature of light; shorter wavelengths can effectively 'fit' into smaller spaces, enabling them to illuminate and interact with minute structures. Consequently, microscopes that utilize shorter wavelengths, such as electron microscopes, exhibit higher resolving power compared to those that rely on longer wavelengths, like visible light microscopes. A deeper understanding of the properties of light can provide valuable insights into how these wavelengths influence microscope resolution.

In addition to wavelength, the numerical aperture of the objective lens significantly affects resolving power. The numerical aperture (NA) quantifies the lens's ability to gather light and resolve fine details at a fixed object distance. Lenses with a higher numerical aperture are capable of capturing more light, thus revealing greater detail in the specimen. The numerical aperture is influenced by the refractive index of the medium through which light travels, as well as the angle at which light enters the lens. Therefore, lenses designed with a high numerical aperture can greatly enhance a microscope's resolving power. The principles of light behavior as it passes through the objective lens are also relevant, further elucidating the factors that affect a microscope's resolution.

In summary, the resolving power of a microscope is determined by both the wavelength of light used and the numerical aperture of the objective lens. By understanding these critical factors, one can optimize microscope design for specific applications, thereby achieving the highest possible resolution.
