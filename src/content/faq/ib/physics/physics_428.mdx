A phase change during wave reflection occurs when a wave reverses its direction upon encountering a boundary.

When a wave meets a boundary, such as the end of a string or a transition between different media, it cannot simply vanish. Instead, it reflects back into the medium from which it originated. This reflection involves a change in direction, which corresponds to a phase change. The phase of a wave indicates its position within the oscillation cycle. When a wave reflects, it effectively turns around, which can be understood as a shift of half a cycle or $180^\circ$. This is why we observe a phase change during wave reflection.

The specifics of this phase change depend on the characteristics of the boundary. If the wave reflects off a boundary that is fixed or denser than the medium through which the wave is traveling, the reflected wave experiences a phase change of $180^\circ$, often referred to as a "phase flip." In this case, the peaks of the wave become troughs, and the troughs become peaks, resulting in what is known as an "inverted" reflection.

Conversely, if the wave reflects off a boundary that is free or less dense than the medium it is traveling in, the reflected wave does not undergo a phase change. The peaks remain peaks, and the troughs remain troughs after reflection. This type of reflection is commonly referred to as an "upright" reflection.

In summary, the phase change that occurs during wave reflection is a result of the wave's change in direction upon interacting with a boundary. Whether the wave experiences a phase flip or no phase change at all depends on the nature of the boundary. Understanding this concept is essential for grasping wave behavior in various physical contexts, ranging from light reflecting off mirrors to sound echoing in a room.
