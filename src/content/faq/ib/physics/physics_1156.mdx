The gravitational force between two individuals is effectively negligible due to their relatively small masses and the considerable distance separating them.

According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship is mathematically expressed by the equation:

$$
F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
$$

In this equation, $ F $ represents the gravitational attraction between the two objects, $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the respective masses, $ r $ is the distance between the centers of the two masses, and $ G $ is the gravitational constant.

When considering two individuals, their masses ($ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $) are relatively small, especially when compared to the masses of celestial bodies such as planets or stars. Consequently, the product of their masses ($ m_1 \cdot m_2 $) is also small. Furthermore, the distance separating them ($ r $) is substantial when compared to the distances between astronomical objects. Since the gravitational force diminishes rapidly as distance increases—due to the $ r^2 $ term in the denominator of the gravitational equation—the gravitational attraction between two people is exceedingly small.

For instance, let’s examine two individuals, each with a mass of $70 \, \text{kg}$, standing $1 \, \text{m}$ apart. Using the gravitational constant $ G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N(m/kg)}^2 $, we can calculate the gravitational force between them as follows:

$$
F = G \cdot \frac{70 \, \text{kg} \cdot 70 \, \text{kg}}{(1 \, \text{m})^2} = 3.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N}
$$

This force is so minuscule that it can be considered negligible.

In contrast, the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on one of these individuals (with a mass of $70 \, \text{kg}$) can be calculated using the same gravitational constant $ G $:

$$
F = G \cdot \frac{70 \, \text{kg} \cdot 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}}{(6.371 \times 10^{6} \, \text{m})^2} = 686 \, \text{N}
$$

This gravitational force is many orders of magnitude greater than the force between the two individuals, which explains why we can easily perceive the Earth's gravity, while the gravitational attraction of another person is imperceptible.

In summary, the gravitational force between two individuals is negligible due to their small masses and the relatively large distance between them, resulting in an extremely small force as indicated by Newton's law of universal gravitation.
