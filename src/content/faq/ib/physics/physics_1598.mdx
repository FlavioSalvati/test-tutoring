Interference and diffraction are two fundamental phenomena in wave physics, particularly in optics, that arise from the interaction of waves. Although they both involve waves, they occur under different circumstances and yield distinct results.

**Interference** is the process in which two or more waves superpose to create a resultant wave. This resultant wave can have a greater, lower, or unchanged amplitude compared to the individual waves. Interference occurs when waves from different sources coincide. The interaction can be constructive, where the waves amplify each other, resulting in a larger amplitude, or destructive, where the waves cancel each other out, leading to a smaller amplitude or even complete cancellation. A classic demonstration of interference is the double-slit experiment, where light waves passing through two closely spaced slits overlap and create a pattern of alternating bright and dark bands on a screen due to their interference.

In contrast, **diffraction** refers to the bending of waves around obstacles or the spreading of waves as they pass through openings. This phenomenon occurs when a wave encounters a barrier or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. When this happens, the wave bends around the obstacle or spreads out after passing through the opening, resulting in a pattern of alternating bright and dark regions. This effect arises because different parts of the wave interfere with each other after being diffracted. A common example of diffraction is observed when light passes through a small aperture, such as a pinhole, producing a circular spreading pattern.

In summary, while both interference and diffraction involve wave interactions, they are distinct phenomena. Interference focuses on the superposition of waves from different sources, whereas diffraction pertains to the bending and spreading of waves when they encounter obstacles or openings. Understanding these concepts is essential in wave physics, as they form the foundation for many optical systems and technologies.
