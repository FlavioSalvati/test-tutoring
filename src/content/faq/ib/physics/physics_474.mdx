Nuclear binding energy refers to the energy necessary to disassemble an atomic nucleus into its fundamental components: protons and neutrons.

To elaborate, the nucleus of an atom consists of protons and neutrons, which are collectively referred to as nucleons. These nucleons are held together by the strong nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Although this force is immensely powerful, it acts over very short distances. The energy required to overcome this strong force and separate the nucleus into its individual nucleons is known as the nuclear binding energy.

Understanding nuclear binding energy is essential in the fields of nuclear physics and chemistry, especially when examining nuclear reactions such as fission and fusion. In nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This principle underlies the operation of nuclear power plants and the destructive power of atomic bombs. Conversely, nuclear fusion involves the merging of two light nuclei to create a heavier nucleus, also releasing energy. This process is responsible for the energy produced by the Sun and other stars.

Nuclear binding energy can also be understood as the energy equivalent of the mass defect of the nucleus. The mass defect is defined as the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the total mass of its individual nucleons. According to Einstein's renowned equation, $E=mc^2$, this mass difference can be converted into energy, which represents the nuclear binding energy.

The values of nuclear binding energy vary among different elements and isotopes and are typically expressed in units of electron volts (eV) per nucleon. Iron-56 has the highest nuclear binding energy per nucleon, making it the most stable element and the ultimate product of nuclear fusion in stars. Elements that are either heavier or lighter than iron-56 can release energy through fission or fusion as they approach this optimal point of stability.
