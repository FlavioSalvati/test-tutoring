During wave propagation, the behavior of wavefronts differs significantly between reflection and refraction. In reflection, wavefronts maintain their shape while changing direction, whereas in refraction, they alter both their shape and direction.

In the case of reflection, wavefronts encounter a surface and bounce back, preserving their original shape but altering their direction. This phenomenon is described by the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. For example, when a plane wavefront (represented as a straight line) strikes a flat mirror, it reflects back as a plane wavefront. Conversely, if it interacts with a curved mirror, the reflected wavefront will adapt to the mirror's curvature, resulting in a concave or convex shape.

Refraction, in contrast, involves changes in both direction and shape of the wavefronts. This occurs when waves transition from one medium to another with a different refractive index, causing them to bend and alter their speed. The process of refraction is governed by Snell's law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of light in the two media, which can also be expressed as the inverse ratio of their refractive indices.

For instance, when a plane wavefront travels from air into water, it experiences a decrease in speed and bends toward the normal line (the line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence). This bending results in a change in shape, causing the wavefront to become curved. The degree of this curvature is influenced by the angle at which the wavefront strikes the surface and the difference in refractive indices between the two media.

In summary, the behavior of wavefronts during reflection and refraction is dictated by their respective laws. Reflection involves a change in direction while maintaining the shape of the wavefront, whereas refraction involves alterations in both direction and shape due to the variations in wave speed as it transitions between different media.
