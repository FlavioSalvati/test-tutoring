The strength of an electric field is defined as the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed within that field.

More specifically, the electric field is a region surrounding a charged particle or object, where it exerts a force on other charged particles or objects. The strength of this electric field quantifies the force that would act on a unit positive charge located within it. Importantly, the electric field is a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude (or strength) and direction.

The strength of an electric field, denoted by $E$, is calculated using the formula:

$$
E = \frac{F}{q}
$$

where $F$ represents the force experienced by a small test charge $q$ due to the electric field. In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of electric field strength is expressed in newtons per coulomb (N/C) or volts per meter (V/m).

The direction of the electric field at any given point is defined as the direction of the electric force that would act on a positive test charge placed at that location. In diagrams representing electric fields, the lines illustrate the direction a positive test charge would move if situated within the field.

The strength of the electric field is directly proportional to the amount of charge on the object that generates the field and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of that charge. This relationship is encapsulated in Coulomb's Law.

In summary, the strength of an electric field is a measure of the electric force per unit charge that a positive test charge would experience if it were placed within the field. This concept is fundamental to the study of electromagnetism and is essential for understanding the behavior and interactions of charged particles.
