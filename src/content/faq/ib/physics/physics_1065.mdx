A galvanometer is an instrument designed to detect electric current by measuring the deflection of a needle within a magnetic field created by the current itself.

This sensitive device operates on the principle of electromagnetic deflection. When an electric current flows through a coil situated in a magnetic field, it generates a torque or rotational force that causes the coil—attached to a needle—to deflect. The extent of this deflection is directly proportional to the amount of current flowing through the coil.

The structure of a galvanometer includes a coil of wire wound around a soft iron core, which is suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet. As current passes through the coil, it generates a magnetic field that interacts with the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, resulting in the rotation of the coil and the attached pointer. The stronger the current, the more significant the magnetic field produced by the coil, leading to a greater deflection of the pointer.

The galvanometer's scale is meticulously calibrated so that the pointer's deflection directly indicates the magnitude of the current. Furthermore, the direction of the current can be easily determined by observing the needle's movement: a deflection to the right signifies current flow in one direction, while a deflection to the left indicates flow in the opposite direction.

To enhance the sensitivity of the galvanometer, a high resistance is often placed in series with the coil. This configuration enables the galvanometer to detect extremely small currents. Additionally, the coil is typically wound with many turns of wire, which amplifies the magnetic field generated for a given current.

In summary, a galvanometer detects electric current by utilizing the principle of electromagnetic deflection. The current flowing through the coil generates a magnetic field that interacts with the field of a permanent magnet, resulting in the deflection of a pointer. This deflection not only reflects the magnitude of the current but also indicates its direction.
