Thin films exhibit vibrant interference patterns, a captivating result of light wave interference.

When light waves encounter a thin film—such as a soap bubble or an oil slick—they divide into two components. One segment reflects off the top surface of the film, while the other penetrates the film and reflects off the bottom surface. These two reflected waves subsequently recombine, and the nature of their interaction depends on their phase relationship. This interaction can lead to either constructive or destructive interference.

The phase relationship between the two waves is influenced by the film's thickness and the wavelength of the light. If the thickness of the film corresponds to an integer multiple of the wavelength, the two waves will be in phase, resulting in constructive interference and producing a bright spot. Conversely, if the film's thickness represents a half-integer multiple of the wavelength, the waves will be out of phase, leading to destructive interference and resulting in a dark spot.

The color of the resulting interference pattern is determined by the wavelength of the light involved. Different wavelengths correspond to distinct colors, with shorter wavelengths appearing blue and longer wavelengths appearing red. When white light—composed of all visible wavelengths—strikes a thin film, various wavelengths interfere constructively at different film thicknesses. This variation creates a colorful pattern, as different regions of the film reflect different colors.

The phenomenon of thin film interference beautifully illustrates the wave nature of light. It demonstrates that light waves can interfere with one another, yielding patterns of both constructive and destructive interference. This principle is fundamental in physics, and grasping it enhances our understanding of numerous phenomena, from the vivid colors of butterfly wings to the functioning of lasers and fiber optic cables.
