In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the energy is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude.

To elaborate, simple harmonic motion is a specific type of periodic motion characterized by a restoring force that is directly proportional to the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position. This concept is fundamental in physics, as it describes the behavior of various systems, including pendulums and springs. For a foundational understanding of SHM, including the forces at play and the characteristics of the motion, further resources are available.

The total energy of a system undergoing SHM is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE). The kinetic energy reaches its maximum at the equilibrium position, while the potential energy is at its peak when the object is at its maximum displacement, specifically at the amplitude. The potential energy can be expressed using the formula:

$$
PE = \frac{1}{2} k A^2
$$

where $k$ represents the spring constant and $A$ is the amplitude. This equation illustrates that the potential energy is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude. For a more comprehensive understanding of energy conservation in SHM, additional resources may be beneficial.

Similarly, the kinetic energy in SHM is given by the formula:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
$$

where $m$ denotes the mass of the object and $v$ represents its velocity. At the equilibrium position, the velocity is at its maximum, calculated as $v = A \omega$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency. By substituting this expression into the kinetic energy formula, we obtain:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m (A \omega)^2
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} m A^2 \omega^2
$$

This formula indicates that the kinetic energy is also directly proportional to the square of the amplitude. For those interested in the various types of waves and their parameters in SHM, further exploration of related resources is recommended.

Consequently, in simple harmonic motion, both potential and kinetic energy are directly proportional to the square of the amplitude. This relationship implies that if the amplitude of the motion is doubled, the energy within the system will increase by a factor of four. Understanding this connection between amplitude and energy is a crucial aspect of SHM and is essential for grasping the behavior of oscillatory systems. For those wishing to delve deeper into the conservation of energy within these systems, further reading is encouraged.
