The relationship between wavelength and diffraction is such that longer wavelengths exhibit greater diffraction than shorter wavelengths. 

In wave phenomena, diffraction refers to the bending of waves around obstacles or the spreading of waves after they pass through an aperture. This effect becomes particularly pronounced when the dimensions of the obstacle or aperture are comparable to the wavelength of the wave. The correlation between wavelength and diffraction is direct; as the wavelength increases, so does the degree of diffraction. In contrast, shorter wavelengths exhibit less diffraction.

To illustrate this concept, consider light as a wave. When light encounters a barrier with a narrow opening, it does not simply travel in a straight line; instead, it spreads out or "diffracts." This spreading is noticeable when light passes through a small slit or hole. The extent of this diffraction is influenced by the wavelength of the light. For instance, red light, which has a longer wavelength compared to blue light, undergoes more diffraction. This phenomenon explains why red light is bent more significantly than blue light in a rainbow.

This principle is not limited to light; it also applies to other types of waves. For example, in the case of sound waves, lower-pitched sounds, which correspond to longer wavelengths, can diffract around obstacles more effectively than higher-pitched sounds, which have shorter wavelengths. This is why you can hear the bass notes of music from around a corner, whereas higher-pitched sounds may not be as audible.

In summary, the relationship between wavelength and diffraction is a fundamental aspect of wave physics. It elucidates why different types of waves behave differently when encountering obstacles or gaps. A solid understanding of this relationship allows for the prediction and explanation of wave behavior in various scenarios, from the vibrant colors of a rainbow to the sounds that reach us from around corners.
