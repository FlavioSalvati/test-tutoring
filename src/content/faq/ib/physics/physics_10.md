Vectors can be decomposed into components by breaking them down into parts that align with the coordinate axes.

More precisely, resolving a vector into its components entails decomposing it into two or more vectors that, when added together, equal the original vector. These component vectors typically align with the coordinate axesâ€”specifically, the $x$ and $y$ axes in two-dimensional space, or the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes in three-dimensional space. This process of vector resolution is crucial in physics, as it enables us to analyze complex vector quantities by examining their simpler components individually.

To resolve a vector into its components, you first need to determine the vector's magnitude (length) and the angle it forms with the coordinate axes. The magnitude of the component along a given axis can be calculated using trigonometric principles derived from right-angled triangles. Specifically, the component along the $x$-axis is found by multiplying the vector's magnitude by the cosine of the angle, while the component along the $y$-axis is obtained by multiplying the magnitude by the sine of the angle.

For instance, consider a vector $\mathbf{A}$ with a magnitude of $10$ units, which makes an angle of $30^\circ$ with the $x$-axis. The $x$-component ($A_x$) of the vector can be calculated as follows:

$$
A_x = 10 \cdot \cos(30^\circ) \approx 8.66 \text{ units}.
$$

Similarly, the $y$-component ($A_y$) of the vector is given by:

$$
A_y = 10 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 5 \text{ units}.
$$

Thus, the vector $\mathbf{A}$ can be resolved into two components: approximately $8.66$ units along the $x$-axis and $5$ units along the $y$-axis.

In physics, resolving vectors into their components is particularly advantageous when analyzing forces, velocities, and other vector quantities. For example, if a force is applied at an angle, it can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components. This decomposition facilitates the analysis of the effect of the force in each direction individually, thereby simplifying the problem-solving process.
