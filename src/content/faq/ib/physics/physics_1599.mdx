The distance between the slits in a double-slit experiment significantly influences the spacing of the resulting interference pattern.

In a double-slit experiment, light is directed through two closely spaced slits, which produces an interference pattern of alternating light and dark bands on a screen. This pattern arises from the wave nature of light, where waves can interfere either constructively—resulting in brighter regions—or destructively—leading to dark spots. The spacing of these bands, known as fringes, is directly dependent on the distance between the slits.

The distance between the slits, commonly denoted as $d$, is inversely proportional to the fringe spacing. This implies that as the distance $d$ between the slits increases, the fringe spacing, denoted as $w$, decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is captured by the equation:

$$
\lambda = \frac{wD}{d}
$$

where $\lambda$ represents the wavelength of the light, $D$ is the distance from the slits to the screen, and $d$ is the distance between the slits.

This inverse relationship can be understood by considering the path difference between the light waves passing through each slit. When the slits are positioned closer together, the path difference becomes smaller, meaning the light waves travel shorter distances to achieve constructive or destructive interference. This results in a larger fringe spacing. Conversely, when the slits are farther apart, the path difference increases, necessitating that the light waves travel greater distances to interfere, which leads to a smaller fringe spacing.
