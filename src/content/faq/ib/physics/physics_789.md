The speed of sound increases as the temperature rises.

To elaborate, the speed of sound in a medium—such as air, water, or any solid material—is directly proportional to the square root of its temperature. This relationship can be expressed mathematically by the equation:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}
$$

In this equation, $v$ represents the speed of sound, $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature of the medium, and $M$ is the molar mass of the gas.
