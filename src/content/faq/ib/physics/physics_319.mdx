Nuclear binding energy is defined as the energy required to disassemble a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. 

This concept is essential in nuclear physics, as it represents the energy that holds the nucleus of an atom together. Specifically, nuclear binding energy is equal to the amount of work needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons (protons and neutrons). It is also referred to as the mass defect of the nucleus, which is the difference between the total mass of the nucleus and the sum of the masses of its separate nucleons.

Understanding nuclear binding energy is vital for comprehending nuclear reactions, such as nuclear fission and fusion. In nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This energy release arises from the difference in nuclear binding energy between the original heavy nucleus and the resultant lighter nuclei. Similarly, in nuclear fusion, two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, also releasing energy. Again, this energy is derived from the difference in nuclear binding energy between the initial light nuclei and the resulting heavy nucleus.

The concept of nuclear binding energy is also crucial in evaluating the stability of atomic nuclei. Generally, nuclei with a high binding energy per nucleon are more stable than those with a low binding energy per nucleon. This explains why heavy elements like uranium and plutonium tend to be unstable and undergo radioactive decay, whereas lighter elements such as hydrogen and helium are typically stable.

Moreover, nuclear binding energy plays a significant role in the process of stellar nucleosynthesis, which is the formation of elements within stars. During this process, lighter elements fuse to create heavier elements, releasing energy in the process. The energy released comes from the difference in nuclear binding energy between the initial light elements and the final heavier elements, providing the energy that powers stars and enables them to shine.

In summary, nuclear binding energy is a fundamental principle in nuclear physics, with far-reaching implications for nuclear reactions, the stability of atomic nuclei, and the process of stellar nucleosynthesis.
