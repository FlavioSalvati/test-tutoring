The forces acting on a car as it turns on a flat road include friction, gravity, and centripetal force.

When a car navigates a turn on a flat surface, several forces are at work. The first is the force of gravity, which pulls the car downward toward the Earth. This gravitational force is constant and acts vertically downward. It is counterbalanced by the normal force, which is exerted by the road surface to support the weight of the car. Together, these two forces ensure that the car remains at a constant vertical position while it turns.

The second significant force is friction, specifically static friction, between the car's tires and the road surface. This frictional force is crucial as it prevents the car from sliding outward during the turn. It provides the necessary centripetal force required for the car's circular motion, acting toward the center of the circular path. The magnitude of this frictional force depends on various factors, including the type of tires, the condition of the road, and the speed of the car. If the car travels too quickly, the available frictional force may be insufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force, potentially causing the car to skid. Understanding these interactions is vital for comprehending how these forces work together.

The third force is the centripetal force, which is the net force that enables the car to follow a circular path. This force is always directed toward the center of the circle. In the context of a car turning on a flat road, the frictional force supplies the centripetal force. The equation for centripetal force is given by 

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the car, $v$ is its velocity, and $r$ is the radius of the turn. For a more comprehensive understanding of this force, further exploration of the underlying concepts is recommended.

As a car turns on a flat road, it experiences gravitational forces pulling it down, which are balanced by the upward force from the road. The friction between the tires and the road prevents the car from sliding out, directing its force toward the center of the turn and facilitating the necessary centripetal force for circular motion. If the car exceeds a certain speed, it may skid due to inadequate friction. These dynamics are governed by the laws of motion, which elucidate the necessity of a force to alter the state of motion. Additionally, a deeper understanding of these principles can illuminate how cars maintain control while turning at higher speeds.
