Waves experience a reduction in speed when they encounter boundaries, which is primarily due to a change in the medium affecting their velocity and direction.

When a wave meets a boundary, it transitions from one medium to another. This change can occur between different states of matter, such as from air to water, or even within the same state of matter when there is a variation in properties like density or temperature. The speed of a wave is determined by the characteristics of the medium, including its density and elasticity. Consequently, a change in the medium results in a change in the wave's speed.

The deceleration of waves at boundaries stems from their interaction with the new medium. As the wave enters this new environment, it interacts with the particles of the medium. If the new medium is denser or less elastic than the previous one, the wave will require more time to move the particles and propagate through it, leading to a decrease in speed. This phenomenon is referred to as refraction, which describes the change in direction of a wave as a result of its altered speed.

Additionally, the angle at which the wave strikes the boundary significantly influences its speed. When a wave approaches the boundary at an angle, different parts of the wave front enter the new medium at different times. This difference in timing causes the wave to change direction—known as refraction—and can also contribute to a reduction in speed.

Moreover, part of the wave can be reflected back into the original medium at the boundary, meaning that some of the wave's energy is redirected rather than transmitted. This reflection also plays a role in the overall slowing of the wave at the boundary.

In summary, the slowing of waves at boundaries is a multifaceted process that involves changes in the medium, refraction, and reflection. A comprehensive understanding of this process is essential for explaining various phenomena in physics, such as the bending of light as it passes through a lens or the echo of sound in a room.
