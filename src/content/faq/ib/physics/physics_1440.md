Angular frequency in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) refers to the rate at which an object oscillates, measured in radians per unit time.

To elaborate, Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a specific type of periodic motion characterized by a restoring force that is directly proportional to the object's displacement from its equilibrium position. This concept is fundamental in physics, as it describes the behavior of various systems including pendulums, springs, and other oscillatory systems. One of the key parameters in SHM is the angular frequency, commonly represented by the Greek letter $\omega$.

Angular frequency quantifies the speed of oscillation and is expressed in radians per second (rad/s). It indicates how rapidly the object oscillates back and forth; a higher angular frequency implies a faster oscillation.

The angular frequency is inversely related to the period of the motion, denoted as $T$, which is the time required to complete one full cycle of oscillation. The relationship between angular frequency and period is described by the formula:

$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}
$$

This indicates that angular frequency $\omega$ is equal to $2\pi$, the number of radians in one complete cycle, divided by the period $T$. Thus, knowing either the period or the angular frequency allows you to calculate the other.

In the context of a spring-mass system, the angular frequency can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
$$

where $k$ represents the spring constant and $m$ is the mass of the object. For a simple pendulum, the angular frequency is given by:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $L$ is the length of the pendulum.

In summary, a solid understanding of angular frequency is essential for analyzing systems that exhibit Simple Harmonic Motion. It offers critical insights into the speed of oscillation and is directly connected to other significant parameters, such as the period, spring constant, mass, and length of the pendulum.
