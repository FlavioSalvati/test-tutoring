To calculate the average velocity from a distance-time graph, you divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

A distance-time graph visually represents an object's motion, with time plotted on the horizontal axis and distance on the vertical axis. The slope of the line on this graph indicates the object's velocity. If the line is straight, it signifies constant velocity; if the line is curved, it indicates that the velocity is changing.

To find the average velocity, start by determining the total distance traveled and the total time taken. The total distance traveled is represented by the vertical distance between the starting and ending points on the graph, while the total time taken is represented by the horizontal distance between these same points.

Once you have these two values, you can calculate the average velocity using the formula:

$$
\text{Average Velocity} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}.
$$

This calculation provides the average speed of the object over the entire time interval depicted on the graph.

It's important to remember that velocity is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude (speed) and direction. If the object changes direction during the time period represented on the graph, you must account for this change when calculating the average velocity.

In summary, to compute the average velocity from a distance-time graph, identify the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the distance by the time. If the object changes direction, ensure to incorporate this into your average velocity calculation.
