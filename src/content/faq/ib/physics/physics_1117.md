Angular velocity is defined as the rate of change of angular displacement, while linear velocity represents the rate of change of linear displacement. These two concepts are fundamental in physics, particularly in the analysis of motion, and they differ significantly in their characteristics, measurement, and application.

Angular velocity, represented by the symbol $\omega$, quantifies how quickly an object rotates around a fixed point. It is measured in radians per second (rad/s) and is particularly relevant in scenarios involving rotational motion, such as the spinning of a wheel or the orbit of a planet.

In contrast, linear velocity, commonly denoted by the symbol $v$, describes how quickly an object moves along a straight path. This velocity is typically measured in meters per second (m/s) and is applicable in contexts such as the movement of a car on a highway or a person walking across a room.

The relationship between angular velocity and linear velocity is expressed through the equation:

$$
v = r\omega
$$

In this formula, $v$ represents linear velocity, $r$ is the radius of the circular path, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity. This equation illustrates that the linear velocity of an object traveling along a circular route is directly proportional to both the radius of that path and the angular velocity of the object.

In conclusion, while both angular and linear velocity pertain to the concept of speed, they apply to different types of motion. Angular velocity focuses on the rate of rotation around a central point, whereas linear velocity pertains to movement along a straight trajectory. Understanding the distinction between these two forms of velocity is essential in physics, as it enables us to accurately describe and predict the behavior of moving objects.
