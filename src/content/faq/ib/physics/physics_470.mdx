Neutron bombardment induces radioactivity by converting stable nuclei into radioactive isotopes through a phenomenon known as neutron activation.

Neutron bombardment is a fundamental process in nuclear physics that involves the interaction between a nucleus and a neutron. When a stable nucleus absorbs a neutron, it can transform into a radioactive isotope. This transformation is referred to as neutron activation.

During neutron activation, the absorption of a neutron makes the nucleus unstable. To regain stability, the nucleus undergoes a transformation that typically results in the emission of gamma radiation and the formation of a new radioactive isotope. This newly created isotope will continue to decay, emitting radiation until it reaches a stable state. The type and energy of the radiation emitted during this decay process are characteristic of the specific isotope, enabling its identification.

The processes of neutron bombardment and neutron activation have numerous practical applications. For instance, in nuclear reactors, these processes are harnessed to produce energy. A controlled chain reaction is initiated in a reactor where uranium or plutonium nuclei absorb neutrons, become unstable, and subsequently undergo fissionâ€”a process that releases a significant amount of energy along with additional neutrons. These extra neutrons can then be absorbed by other nuclei, perpetuating the chain reaction.

Moreover, neutron bombardment plays a crucial role in the production of medical isotopes, which are vital for various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. One notable example is technetium-99m, an isotope widely used in medical imaging. Technetium-99m is produced through the neutron bombardment of molybdenum-98.

In conclusion, neutron bombardment leads to radioactivity by transforming stable nuclei into radioactive isotopes via neutron activation. This process is essential in nuclear physics and has extensive applications, ranging from energy generation in nuclear reactors to the production of medical isotopes.
