Torque is generated in a current-carrying loop placed within a magnetic field due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the electric current flowing through the loop.

When a loop carrying an electric current is situated in a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts a force on the current. This force, known as the Lorentz force, acts perpendicular to both the direction of the current and the magnetic field. The resulting forces on different sides of the loop create a rotational effect or torque, which causes the loop to rotate.

The magnitude of the torque can be influenced by several factors:

1. **Current ($I$)**: The torque is directly proportional to the current flowing through the loop. A higher current results in a stronger force exerted by the magnetic field, thereby increasing the torque.
   
2. **Area ($A$)**: The torque is also directly proportional to the area of the loop. A larger loop provides a greater area for the magnetic field to act upon, which leads to an increase in torque.

3. **Angle ($\theta$)**: The angle between the plane of the loop and the magnetic field significantly affects the torque. The torque reaches its maximum value when the plane of the loop is perpendicular to the magnetic field.

The direction of the torque can be determined using Fleming's left-hand rule. To apply this rule, extend your thumb in the direction of the current and your index finger in the direction of the magnetic field. Your middle finger, when extended, will then point in the direction of the force exerted on the loop, indicating the direction in which the loop tends to rotate.

In summary, the torque experienced by a current-carrying loop in a magnetic field is a consequence of the Lorentz force acting on the current within the loop. This force, being perpendicular to the current and the magnetic field, produces a turning effect that can induce rotation in the loop. The magnitude and direction of this torque depend on the current, the area of the loop, the strength and orientation of the magnetic field, and the angle between the plane of the loop and the magnetic field.
