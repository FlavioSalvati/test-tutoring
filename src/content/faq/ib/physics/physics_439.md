In the framework of general relativity, gravity has the ability to bend light, causing it to travel along a curved trajectory instead of a straight line.

Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity fundamentally redefines gravity—not as a conventional force, but as a curvature of space-time induced by mass and energy. This curvature influences the motion of objects within it, including light. This perspective represents a significant shift from Newtonian physics, which posits that light, being massless, is unaffected by gravitational forces.

When light traverses the vicinity of a massive object, the space-time surrounding that object is warped due to its gravitational influence. As a result, the light follows a curved path—a phenomenon referred to as gravitational lensing. This effect has been documented in numerous astronomical observations, where the light emitted from distant stars or galaxies is distorted as it passes near a massive object, causing the light source to appear altered or displaced from its actual position.

Furthermore, the bending of light due to gravity can also give rise to an effect known as gravitational redshift. This phenomenon occurs when light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation are emitted from a source located within a strong gravitational field. The gravitational field reduces the energy of the emitted light, resulting in a shift towards the red end of the spectrum. Gravitational redshift has been validated through various experiments and is critical in technologies such as GPS, which must account for the redshift effects caused by the Earth's gravitational field.

In extreme conditions, such as those near a black hole, the curvature of space-time can become so severe that not even light can escape, resulting in the formation of an event horizon. This event horizon marks the boundary surrounding a black hole, beyond which nothing—neither matter nor light—can escape the gravitational pull.

To summarize, general relativity predicts that gravity can influence light by causing it to follow a curved trajectory, leading to observable phenomena such as gravitational lensing and gravitational redshift. These predictions have been substantiated by a multitude of experiments and observations, providing robust support for Einstein's revolutionary theory.
