Interference fringes in light waves arise from the superposition of two or more coherent light waves.

Interference is a fundamental principle in wave physics, applicable not only to light—an electromagnetic wave—but also to various other types of waves. When two or more waves encounter each other, they interact, leading to the phenomenon known as superposition. This interaction can either amplify or diminish the resulting wave, depending on the phase difference between the waves. When this superposition occurs with light waves, it leads to the formation of distinct interference fringes.

The double-slit experiment provides a clear illustration of how interference fringes are formed. In this experiment, a coherent light source illuminates two closely spaced slits. The light waves emanating from these slits overlap and interfere with one another. If the waves are in phase—meaning their peaks and troughs align—they undergo constructive interference, creating a bright fringe. Conversely, if the waves are out of phase—where a peak coincides with a trough—they experience destructive interference, resulting in a dark fringe. The overall pattern of these alternating bright and dark regions is referred to as an interference pattern.

A crucial aspect of interference fringe formation is the coherence of the light source. Coherent light waves maintain a constant phase difference, which is essential for producing a stable interference pattern. In the double-slit experiment, the light source is effectively split into two coherent waves as they pass through the slits. As these waves propagate and interact, they generate a characteristic interference pattern of fringes.

The position and spacing of the interference fringes are influenced by several factors, including the wavelength of the light, the separation between the slits, and the distance from the slits to the observation screen. By analyzing the resulting interference pattern, one can deduce these parameters, thereby demonstrating the utility of interference in physics.

In summary, interference fringes in light waves offer a captivating illustration of the wave nature of light. They result from the superposition of coherent light waves, leading to a distinctive pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes.
