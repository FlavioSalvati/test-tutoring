Lasers are effectively employed in single-slit experiments to produce and analyze diffraction and interference patterns.

In a single-slit experiment, a laser beam is directed at a narrow slit. The laser light is monochromatic and coherent, making it ideal for this setup, as it ensures that the light waves are in phase and possess the same wavelength. When the laser light passes through the slit, it undergoes diffraction, spreading out to create a pattern that can be projected onto a screen.

The pattern observed on the screen arises from the superposition of the light waves, which interfere with one another. At the center of the pattern, constructive interference occurs, leading to the formation of a bright central maximum. On either side of this central maximum, alternating dark and bright fringes appear. The dark fringes result from destructive interference, where the waves cancel each other out, while the bright fringes are produced by constructive interference.

The width of the central maximum and the spacing between the fringes can be utilized to calculate the wavelength of the laser light. This is accomplished using the formula for single-slit diffraction, which relates the wavelength of the light, the width of the slit, and the angle corresponding to the position of the fringes on the screen. By measuring the distance from the central maximum to the first dark fringe and knowing the distance from the slit to the screen, one can calculate the angle. This angle is then used to determine the wavelength of the laser light.

Beyond determining the wavelength, single-slit experiments using lasers also provide insight into the principles of wave-particle duality. This fundamental concept in quantum mechanics asserts that particles, such as photons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. The diffraction and interference patterns observed in the single-slit experiment illustrate the wave-like nature of light, while the detection of individual photons on the screen highlights its particle-like nature.
