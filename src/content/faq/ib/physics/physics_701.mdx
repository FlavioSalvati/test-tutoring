A satellite in orbit maintains a constant velocity due to the delicate balance between gravitational forces and its forward momentum.

To elaborate, a satellite orbiting the Earth is essentially in a state of continuous free fall. It is perpetually drawn towards the Earth by the force of gravity; however, it possesses sufficient forward momentum to keep missing the Earth. This phenomenon is what constitutes an orbit. Thus, we can think of the satellite as falling around the Earth, which is why it sustains a constant velocity.

The orbital velocity of a satellite is influenced by two primary factors: its altitude and the mass of the planet it orbits. Specifically, as altitude increases, the required orbital speed decreases. Conversely, a more massive planet necessitates a higher orbital speed. This relationship is governed by the inverse square law of gravity, which states that the gravitational force diminishes with the square of the distance from the gravitational source.

The satellite's velocity remains constant because the forces acting on it are in equilibrium. The gravitational force of the Earth pulls the satellite toward it, while the satellite's forward momentum attempts to propel it in a straight line. The interplay of these two forces results in the curved trajectory we recognize as an orbit.

In an ideal scenario—such as a perfect vacuum, devoid of any external forces—the satellite would sustain this constant velocity indefinitely. However, in the real world, additional factors like atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure can gradually cause the satellite's orbit to decay over time. For most practical purposes, particularly in your physics studies, it is reasonable to consider the orbital velocity of a satellite as constant.

It is essential to note that this description simplifies a complex physical phenomenon. In practice, orbits can be elliptical rather than perfectly circular, and the gravitational influence of other celestial bodies may also affect the satellite's path. Nonetheless, the fundamental principle remains: a satellite in orbit achieves a constant velocity through the balance of gravitational pull and its forward momentum.
