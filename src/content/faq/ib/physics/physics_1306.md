Atomic orbitals represent the probabilities of locating electrons, distinguishing them from Bohr orbits, which depict fixed circular paths.

Niels Bohr's atomic model, introduced in 1913, marked a crucial advancement in our comprehension of atomic structure. In this model, electrons are envisioned as moving in fixed circular orbits around the nucleus, akin to planets revolving around the sun. Each of these orbits corresponds to a specific energy level, and electrons can 'jump' between these levels by absorbing or emitting energy. While Bohr's model successfully explained the hydrogen spectrum, it had significant limitations. It struggled to accurately predict the spectra of atoms with more than one electron and failed to elucidate the chemical behavior of atoms.

In contrast, the concept of atomic orbitals originated from the quantum mechanical model of the atom developed during the 1920s and 1930s. This modern framework perceives electrons not as particles traveling in defined paths, but rather as 'clouds' of negative charge. An atomic orbital can be defined as a region of space around the nucleus where there is a high probability of finding an electron. The shape of an orbital may be spherical, dumbbell-shaped, or even more complex, depending on the energy level and sublevel of the electron.

Unlike Bohr orbits, atomic orbitals do not denote fixed trajectories for electrons. Instead, they provide a statistical description of an electron's location. An electron can be found anywhere within the orbital, but it is most likely to be located in the regions of highest electron density. This model not only accounts for the spectra of multi-electron atoms but also explains the shapes of molecules and the formation of chemical bonds.

In summary, while both Bohr orbits and atomic orbitals aim to describe the arrangement of electrons in an atom, they represent fundamentally different perspectives on electron behavior. Bohr's model treats the electron as a particle moving along a defined path, whereas the quantum mechanical model conceptualizes it as a probability cloud. This paradigm shift from fixed orbits to probabilistic orbitals was a pivotal development in the evolution of our understanding of atomic structure.
