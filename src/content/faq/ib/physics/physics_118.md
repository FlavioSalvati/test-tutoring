The formula for the time period of a pendulum is derived using the principles of simple harmonic motion (SHM) and the acceleration due to gravity.

A pendulum is a classic example of SHM, where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and acts in the opposite direction to that displacement. In the case of a pendulum, this restoring force arises from the gravitational component acting along the arc of the pendulum's swing.

Consider a simple pendulum consisting of a small bob of mass $m$ attached to a light, inextensible string of length $l$. When the bob is displaced from its equilibrium position and then released, it begins to oscillate back and forth. The displacement $x$ of the bob from its equilibrium position can be expressed as:

$$
x = l\theta
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle the string makes with the vertical.

The restoring force acting on the bob is given by $-mg \sin \theta$, where $g$ represents the acceleration due to gravity. According to Newton's second law, this force can also be expressed as the mass times the acceleration of the bob, leading to the equation:

$$
-mg \sin \theta = m \left(\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\right).
$$

For small angles, we can approximate $\sin \theta$ by $\theta$, simplifying our equation to:

$$
-mg\theta = m \left(\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\right).
$$

By substituting $x = l\theta$, we rewrite the equation as:

$$
-\frac{mg}{l} x = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}.
$$

This equation is a standard form of the differential equation describing SHM, and its solution leads to the determination of the time period of the pendulum.

The time period $T$ of the pendulum can be expressed as:

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}.
$$

This formula indicates that the time period of a simple pendulum is directly proportional to the square root of its length $l$ and inversely proportional to the square root of the acceleration due to gravity $g$. It is important to note that this formula is an approximation valid under the assumption of small oscillations and an ideal, frictionless environment. In practical scenarios, factors such as air resistance, as well as the size and shape of the bob, can influence the time period.

**Summary for IB Physics Tutor**: To derive the formula for a pendulum's time period, we utilize the concepts of simple harmonic motion and gravity. A pendulum oscillates due to a restoring force that is proportional to its displacement. Assuming small angles and neglecting air resistance, we arrive at the formula:

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}},
$$

where $T$ is the time period, $l$ is the length of the string, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This relationship shows that the time period of the pendulum is connected to its length and the gravitational force acting on it.
