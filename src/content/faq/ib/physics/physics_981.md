The materials most suitable for managing the heating effect are those with high thermal conductivity, particularly metals such as copper and aluminum.

Thermal conductivity quantifies a material's ability to conduct heat. It is defined as the amount of heat (measured in watts) that is transferred through a square meter of material, one meter thick, for each degree of temperature difference (in degrees Celsius). A material with higher thermal conductivity is more effective at conducting heat, making it better equipped to manage the heating effect.

Metals are generally excellent conductors of heat due to the presence of a sea of delocalized electrons. These electrons move freely, allowing for the rapid transfer of kinetic energy (heat) throughout the material. Among metals, copper and aluminum stand out for their exceptional thermal conductivity. Specifically, copper has a thermal conductivity of approximately $400 \, \text{W/mK}$, while aluminum has a thermal conductivity of around $205 \, \text{W/mK}$. This high thermal conductivity enables these metals to quickly absorb and distribute heat, thereby preventing localized overheating and potential damage.

However, it is crucial to recognize that effectively managing the heating effect involves more than just thermal conductivity. Other factors, such as specific heat capacity and melting point, also significantly contribute. Specific heat capacity defines the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a material by one degree Celsius. For example, materials with high specific heat capacities, such as water, can absorb substantial amounts of heat without experiencing a significant increase in temperature. The melting point, on the other hand, is the temperature at which a material transitions from a solid to a liquid state. Materials with high melting points, like tungsten, can endure elevated temperatures without melting.

In summary, the most effective materials for handling the heating effect possess high thermal conductivity, high specific heat capacity, and high melting points. These characteristics enable them to efficiently absorb, distribute, and withstand heat.
