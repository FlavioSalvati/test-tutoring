Planets maintain their orbits around the Sun due to the delicate balance between gravitational attraction and their own inertia.

The orbits of planets in the solar system are governed by two fundamental physical principles: gravity and inertia. The Sun, being the most massive object in our solar system, exerts a significant gravitational force on all the surrounding planets, pulling them inward. Conversely, each planet possesses inertia, which is the natural tendency of an object to continue moving in a straight line at a constant speed unless influenced by an external force.

This interplay between the Sun's gravitational pull, which draws the planets closer, and the planets' inertia, which propels them forward in a straight path, results in elliptical orbits around the Sun. This phenomenon is encapsulated in Kepler's First Law of Planetary Motion.

The speed at which a planet travels along its orbit, known as its orbital speed, is also crucial in this dynamic. If a planet's orbital speed exceeds a certain threshold, its inertia will overpower the Sun's gravitational pull, causing it to drift away into space. Conversely, if the orbital speed is insufficient, the Sun's gravity will dominate, pulling the planet inward and potentially leading it to spiral into the Sun.

Fortunately, all the planets in our solar system possess precisely the right orbital speeds to maintain what is referred to as a "stable orbit." In this state, the gravitational pull of the Sun is perfectly balanced by the inertia of the planet, allowing it to move in a consistent orbit without either spiraling inward or drifting outwards.

In summary, the intricate balance between gravitational attraction and inertia, along with the correct orbital speeds, enables planets to sustain their orbits around the Sun. This celestial choreography exemplifies the fundamental laws of physics that govern our universe.
