Vector addition is commutative, meaning that the order in which vectors are added does not affect the resulting vector.

To elaborate, the commutative property allows us to change the sequence of operations without altering the outcome. For instance, in basic arithmetic, when we add the numbers $2$ and $3$, we can perform the operation in either order: $2 + 3$ or $3 + 2$. In both cases, the result is $5$. This characteristic is what makes addition of numbers commutative.

In the context of vectors, however, we deal with quantities that possess both magnitude (size) and direction. When adding vectors, we combine these two elements. The crucial point to understand is that the sequence in which we add vectors does not change the resultant vector. The resultant vector is simply the sum of the individual vectors, independent of the order in which they are combined.

For example, let us consider two vectors, $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. When we add $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$, we arrive at a resultant vector $\mathbf{R}$. Conversely, if we first add $\mathbf{B}$ to $\mathbf{A}$, we again obtain the same resultant vector $\mathbf{R}$. This consistency arises from the vector addition process, which entails placing the tail of the second vector at the head of the first vector and then drawing a new vector from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector. This method remains unchanged regardless of the order of addition.

Thus, vector addition is commutative because the sequence in which vectors are added does not alter the resultant vector. This fundamental property of vectors is essential for solving problems in physics that involve vector quantities.
