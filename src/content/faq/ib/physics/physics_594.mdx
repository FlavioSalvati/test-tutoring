The equations of motion are formulated based on the principles of calculus and Newton's laws of motion.

More specifically, these equations describe the relationships between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time. They are essential for understanding motion in physics and are derived from Newton's laws through the application of calculus.

The first equation of motion is given by 

$$
v = u + at,
$$

where $v$ represents the final velocity, $u$ is the initial velocity, $a$ denotes acceleration, and $t$ is the time. This equation originates from the definition of acceleration, which is defined as the rate of change of velocity over time. The change in velocity can be expressed as $v - u$, while the time interval is $t$. Thus, we can write acceleration as 

$$
a = \frac{v - u}{t}.
$$ 

Rearranging this equation leads us to the first equation of motion.

The second equation of motion is 

$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2,
$$ 

where $s$ represents the displacement. This equation is derived from the definition of velocity, which is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. We can express the velocity as 

$$
v = \frac{s}{t}.
$$ 

By substituting the first equation of motion into this expression, we obtain the second equation of motion.

The third equation of motion is 

$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as.
$$ 

This equation is derived by eliminating the time variable $t$ from the first two equations. The result is a direct relationship between the squares of the velocities, the acceleration, and the displacement.

These equations are invaluable in the field of physics because they enable us to predict the future state of a moving object, provided we know its current state and the forces acting upon it. Additionally, they serve as foundational concepts for more advanced areas of study in physics, including energy and momentum.
