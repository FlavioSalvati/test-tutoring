A stone remains tethered when it is twirled in a circle on a string due to the centripetal force acting upon it.

When the stone is swung in a circular motion, it continuously changes direction, indicating that it is undergoing acceleration. This acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle and is attributed to a force known as the centripetal force. The tension in the string serves as the source of this centripetal force, pulling the stone inward and preventing it from flying off in a straight line.

Due to its inertia, the stone naturally tends to move in a straight path. However, the string counteracts this tendency. The tension within the string acts as the centripetal force, directing the stone toward the circle's center. This force is always perpendicular to the stone's velocity and is responsible for the change in its direction, which constitutes an acceleration. According to Newton's second law of motion, an acceleration occurs as a result of a force; in this scenario, the force in question is the tension in the string.

The magnitude of the centripetal force can be expressed by the equation:

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$

where $m$ represents the mass of the stone, $v$ denotes its velocity, and $r$ indicates the radius of the circle. This equation illustrates that the centripetal force increases with the square of the velocity and decreases with an increase in the radius. Consequently, if the stone is twirled more quickly or if the length of the string is reduced, the tension in the string must rise to generate the requisite centripetal force.

In summary, the stone does not fly off when twirled in a circle on a string because the tension in the string provides the essential centripetal force that keeps the stone in circular motion. This exemplifies Newton's second law of motion, which asserts that an acceleration is the result of an applied force.
