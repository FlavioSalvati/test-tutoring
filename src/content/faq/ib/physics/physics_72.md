Elastic collisions conserve both momentum and kinetic energy, whereas inelastic collisions conserve momentum but not kinetic energy.

In physics, collisions are classified into two main categories: elastic and inelastic. The fundamental distinction between these types of collisions lies in the conservation laws governing them. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This implies that the total momentum and total kinetic energy before the collision are equal to the total momentum and total kinetic energy after the collision. Elastic collisions are commonly observed in interactions involving atomic and subatomic particles, where the forces during the collision are conservative.

Conversely, in an inelastic collision, only momentum is conserved while kinetic energy is not. In this case, the total kinetic energy of the system before the collision exceeds the total kinetic energy after the collision. The kinetic energy that is "lost" is typically transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, or energy associated with deformation. Inelastic collisions are prevalent in everyday life; for instance, when a ball strikes the ground and does not rebound to its original height, or when two cars collide and sustain dents.

It is crucial to recognize that the conservation of momentum applies to both types of collisions. Momentum, a vector quantity, is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. The total momentum of a closed system—one that does not interact with external forces—remains constant, regardless of the nature of the collisions occurring within it.

In summary, the key distinction between elastic and inelastic collisions is the conservation of kinetic energy. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, meaning the total values before and after the collision remain unchanged. In contrast, in an inelastic collision, while momentum is conserved, kinetic energy is not, with some of it being transformed into other forms of energy.
