Quarks are regarded as fundamental particles because they cannot be further divided into smaller constituents.

As one of the essential building blocks of matter, quarks, along with leptons, represent the smallest known particles in the universe. Their classification as fundamental particles stems from our current understanding of particle physics, which is encapsulated in the Standard Model. The Standard Model is a comprehensive theory that describes three of the four known fundamental forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Additionally, it categorizes all known elementary particles.

Quarks possess a unique characteristic in that they carry a fractional electric charge, unlike leptons and other particles, which carry an integer electric charge. Furthermore, quarks are involved in all four fundamental interactions: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. This involvement makes them integral to the structure and behavior of matter.

There are six distinct types of quarks, commonly referred to as "flavours": up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. The up and down quarks combine to form protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms. The other four flavours of quarks are typically produced in high-energy environments, such as particle accelerators.

It is important to note that quarks are never found in isolation; they always exist in combinations of two or three, forming particles known as hadrons. This phenomenon is attributed to a property known as colour confinement, which dictates that quarks cannot exist independently in nature. This confinement is yet another reason why quarks are considered fundamental: they are the smallest particles we can observe, as they cannot be isolated.

In summary, quarks are classified as fundamental particles due to their status as the smallest known particles, their participation in all four fundamental interactions, and their inability to be broken down into smaller entities. This classification is based on our contemporary understanding of particle physics, as outlined in the Standard Model.
