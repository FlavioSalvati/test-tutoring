Wave reflection is the process by which waves bounce back after striking a barrier or an interface between two different media.

More specifically, wave reflection is a key concept in physics, especially in the study of wave behavior. This phenomenon occurs when a wave encounters a medium that does not absorb its energy, resulting in the wave being reflected back into the original medium. Reflection can occur with various types of waves, including sound, light, water, and seismic waves.

The law of reflection describes this phenomenon, stating that the angle of incidence, which is the angle at which the incoming wave strikes the barrier, is equal to the angle of reflection, the angle at which the wave is reflected. This law is applicable to both plane and spherical waves. It is important to note that these angles are measured relative to the normal lineâ€”an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence.

Reflection can be categorized as either specular (mirror-like) or diffuse, depending on the characteristics of the interface. In specular reflection, each incident ray is reflected such that the angle of the reflected ray is equal to the angle of the incident ray relative to the normal. This type of reflection is commonly observed on smooth, shiny surfaces, such as mirrors or calm bodies of water. Conversely, diffuse reflection occurs when an incident ray is scattered and reflected in multiple directions, which typically happens when the reflecting surface is rough or uneven.

The phenomenon of wave reflection is not only a captivating aspect of physics but also has numerous practical applications. For example, technologies such as radar and sonar utilize wave reflection to detect objects by emitting waves and analyzing the reflected signals. In the medical field, ultrasound machines leverage reflected sound waves to create internal images of the body. In seismology, the reflection of seismic waves is employed to map the Earth's interior.

In summary, wave reflection is a fundamental concept in physics that describes how waves bounce back when encountering a barrier. Governed by the law of reflection, this phenomenon can manifest as either specular or diffuse reflection, depending on the properties of the reflecting surface.
