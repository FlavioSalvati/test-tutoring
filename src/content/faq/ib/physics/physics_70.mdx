The principle of conservation of energy asserts that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or transformed from one form to another.

This principle is a cornerstone of physics, grounded in the observation that the total energy within an isolated system remains constant over time. It is often referred to as the first law of thermodynamics. This law indicates that energy can change forms—such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy in a falling object—or be transferred between objects, as seen when one billiard ball strikes another. However, energy cannot simply emerge from nothing or vanish into nothingness.

The conservation of energy applies across all branches of physics, including mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. It serves as a powerful framework for solving problems and understanding various natural phenomena. For instance, during a roller coaster ride, the conservation of energy principle can be employed to calculate the maximum speed of the roller coaster at the lowest point of the track, based on its initial height.

In more intricate systems, such as a gas within a heated cylinder, the conservation of energy encompasses not only mechanical energy but also thermal energy. The increase in thermal energy of the gas equals the heat added to the system minus the work performed by the gas on the piston.

In the realm of quantum mechanics, the conservation of energy is expressed slightly differently due to the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena. Nonetheless, the fundamental principle remains unchanged: the total energy of a closed system—including both particle energy and field energy—stays constant.

It is crucial to understand that the conservation of energy is not an absolute fact but rather a well-supported hypothesis. This principle has been rigorously tested and confirmed through countless experiments and observations, with no reliable violations of energy conservation detected to date. However, like all scientific principles, it remains open to revision in light of new evidence.
