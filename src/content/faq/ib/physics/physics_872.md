Waves exhibit bending when they enter a different medium, a phenomenon known as refraction, which occurs due to a change in their speed.

Refraction is a fundamental principle of wave behavior that arises when a wave transitions from one medium to another, resulting in alterations to both its speed and direction. This bending effect is most commonly associated with light waves, but it also applies to other types of waves, including sound and water waves.

The underlying principle of refraction is that waves propagate at varying speeds depending on the medium through which they travel. For example, light travels faster in air than it does in water or glass. When a wave, such as a light wave, strikes a new medium at an angle (rather than perpendicularly), one side of the wave will decelerate before the other side. This differential slowing causes the wave to change direction, which we perceive as bending.

The extent of this bending, or the angle of refraction, is influenced by both the change in speed and the angle at which the wave encounters the new medium. This relationship is mathematically described by Snell's Law, a key equation in optics. Snell's Law states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence (the angle at which the wave strikes the new medium) to the sine of the angle of refraction (the angle at which the wave bends) is equal to the ratio of the speeds of light in the two media:

$$
\frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\sin(\theta_2)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}
$$

where $\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence, $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction, $v_1$ is the speed of light in the first medium, and $v_2$ is the speed of light in the second medium.

In essence, the greater the difference in speed between the two media, the more pronounced the bending of the wave. Similarly, the more oblique the angle at which the wave strikes the new medium, the greater the deviation from its original path. This is why a straw appears to bend when it is submerged in a glass of water, or why the sun appears distorted when observed underwater.

Understanding refraction is essential across various fields of physics and engineering, including the design of lenses and optical instruments, the analysis of seismic waves in geophysics, and the propagation of radio signals.
