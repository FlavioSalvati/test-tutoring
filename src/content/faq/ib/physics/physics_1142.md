Satellites in geostationary orbits maintain a fixed position over a specific location on Earth because their orbital period coincides with the Earth's rotational period.

Geostationary orbits are a specialized subset of geosynchronous orbits, meaning that they have the same orbital period as the Earth's rotation. This period is approximately $24$ hours. Satellites positioned in these orbits are located directly above the equator at an altitude of approximately $35,786$ kilometers. At this altitude, the gravitational force exerted by the Earth balances the centripetal force needed for the satellite to sustain its circular orbit. This equilibrium of forces enables the satellite to maintain a constant speed and direction, effectively 'hovering' over the same point on the Earth's surface.

To understand why geostationary satellites remain fixed over one location, it is essential to grasp the relationship between their orbital speed and the Earth's rotation. The Earth completes one full rotation every $24$ hours, and satellites in geostationary orbit also complete one orbit in the same duration. Consequently, as the Earth rotates, the satellite travels along its orbit at the same rate, consistently remaining above the same point on the Earth's surface.

This characteristic is particularly advantageous for communication and weather monitoring applications. For instance, a satellite in geostationary orbit can establish a continuous link between communication stations on the ground, facilitating uninterrupted transmission of television signals, telephone calls, and internet data. Likewise, weather satellites in geostationary orbit can continuously observe the same region of the Earth's surface, providing real-time weather data and aiding in the tracking of storm development and other weather phenomena.

In summary, satellites in geostationary orbits remain over a fixed location on Earth due to their specific altitude and orbital speed, which are synchronized with the Earth's rotational speed. This unique positioning makes them invaluable tools for both communication and weather monitoring.
