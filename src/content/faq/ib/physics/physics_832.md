Waves interact with boundaries through three primary processes: reflection, transmission, and absorption. The specific nature of these interactions depends on the properties of the boundary material.

When a wave encounters a boundary, it can either be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed. **Reflection** occurs when a wave bounces back into the medium from which it originated. This phenomenon is commonly observed when light strikes a mirror or when sound waves reflect off a wall. According to the law of reflection, the angle at which the wave strikes the boundary, known as the incident angle, is equal to the angle at which it is reflected, referred to as the reflected angle. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\theta_i = \theta_r
$$

where $\theta_i$ is the incident angle and $\theta_r$ is the reflected angle.

**Transmission**, in contrast, occurs when a wave passes through the boundary and enters a different medium. This process often involves **refraction**, which is the bending of the wave as it changes speed upon entering the new medium. The degree of refraction is determined by the difference in wave speeds between the two media, as described by Snell's law. For instance, when light transitions from air into water, it slows down and bends towards the normal line (the perpendicular line to the boundary). Snell's law can be formulated as:

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

The third interaction mechanism is **absorption**, which occurs when the wave's energy is absorbed by the boundary material, often resulting in a conversion of that energy into heat. The extent of absorption is influenced by the characteristics of the boundary material; for example, dark and rough surfaces generally absorb more light than light and smooth surfaces.

In many practical scenarios, boundaries induce a combination of reflection, transmission, and absorption. The specific proportions of these interactions depend on various factors, including the wave's frequency, the angle of incidence, and the properties of the boundary material, such as its density and surface texture. For example, when light strikes a piece of glass, some of it is reflected, some is transmitted and refracted, and a minor portion is absorbed.

In summary, the interaction of waves at boundaries is a complex phenomenon encompassing reflection, transmission, and absorption. Grasping these interactions is essential for understanding various fields of physics, including optics, acoustics, and electromagnetic theory.
