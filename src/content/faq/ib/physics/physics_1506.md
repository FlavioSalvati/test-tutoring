The angle of diffraction can be determined using Bragg's Law, which establishes a relationship between the wavelength of light, the angle of incidence, and the spacing between diffracting planes.

Bragg's Law, named after the British scientists William Henry Bragg and his son William Lawrence Bragg, is a cornerstone of diffraction and crystallography. The law is expressed mathematically as:

$$ n\lambda = 2d \sin \theta $$

In this equation:
- $n$ is the order of diffraction (a positive integer),
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident wave,
- $d$ is the distance between the diffracting planes (often corresponding to atomic layers in a crystal),
- $\theta$ is both the angle of incidence and the angle of diffraction.

To find the angle of diffraction, you can rearrange the equation to isolate $\theta$:

$$ \theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{n\lambda}{2d}\right) $$

This calculation requires knowledge of the order of diffraction, the wavelength of the incident wave, and the spacing between the diffracting planes.

The order of diffraction, $n$, is a positive integer that indicates how many wavelengths fit into the path difference, essentially representing the number of 'bounces' the wave experiences off the diffracting planes. In many introductory diffraction problems, it is common to assume $n = 1$.

The wavelength of the incident wave, $\lambda$, is typically provided in the problem or can be derived from the type of wave. For instance, visible light has wavelengths ranging from approximately $400$ to $700$ nanometers.

The distance between the diffracting planes, $d$, is usually specified in the problem statement or can be inferred from the material's properties. In the context of a crystal lattice, $d$ represents the spacing between atomic layers.

Once these values are obtained, you can substitute them into the rearranged Bragg's Law equation to calculate the angle of diffraction. Be sure to use the arcsin function on your calculator and check that it is set to return results in degrees (rather than radians) if the question specifies the angle in degrees.

**Summary for IB Physics Students:**
To compute the angle of diffraction, use Bragg's Law, which requires the order of diffraction ($n$), the wavelength ($\lambda$), and the distance between planes ($d$). Rearrange the law to solve for the angle, given by:

$$ \theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{n\lambda}{2d}\right) $$

It is crucial to know these three values to determine the angle, which is typically expressed in degrees. Ensure your calculator is set up correctly for the calculation!
