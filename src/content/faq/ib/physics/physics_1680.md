Yes, the Doppler effect can occur with transverse waves.

The Doppler effect is a phenomenon that is observed in both transverse and longitudinal waves. It is not limited to sound waves, which are longitudinal, but also applies to light waves, which are transverse. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.

Transverse waves are waves in which the direction of displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Examples of transverse waves include light waves, radio waves, and waves on a string or spring. When the source of these waves moves relative to an observer, or vice versa, the observed frequency of the waves changes. This is the Doppler effect.

For instance, consider a light source moving away from an observer. The light waves emitted by the source will appear to the observer to have a longer wavelength, or lower frequency, than they would if the source were stationary. This is known as redshift. Conversely, if the light source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength will be shorter, or the frequency higher, than if the source were stationary. This is known as blueshift. Both redshift and blueshift are examples of the Doppler effect with transverse waves.

The Doppler effect with transverse waves can be observed in everyday life. For example, when an ambulance with a flashing light drives past, the frequency of the light appears to change. As the ambulance approaches, the light appears bluer, and as it recedes, the light appears redder. This is due to the Doppler effect.

In summary, the Doppler effect is a universal phenomenon that applies to all types of waves, including transverse waves. It is a fundamental concept in wave physics and has wide-ranging applications, from astronomy to medical imaging.
