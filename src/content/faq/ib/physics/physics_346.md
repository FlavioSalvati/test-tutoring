Carbon-14 dating methods play a crucial role in archaeology, enabling scientists to accurately determine the age of ancient artifacts and fossils.

Also referred to as radiocarbon dating, carbon-14 dating is utilized by archaeologists and geologists to ascertain the age of organic materials. This method relies on the properties of the radioactive isotope carbon-14, which naturally exists in the atmosphere and is absorbed by living organisms. Upon the death of an organism, the absorption of carbon-14 ceases, and the isotope begins to decay at a known rate. By measuring the remaining amount of carbon-14 in a sample, scientists can estimate the time of the organism's death, thereby determining the age of the artifact or fossil.

This dating method is particularly significant in archaeology because it can effectively date artifacts and fossils that are up to $50,000$ years old. This timeframe encompasses a substantial portion of human history and prehistory, enabling archaeologists to construct a comprehensive timeline of human development and civilization. Additionally, carbon-14 dating can be applied to a diverse array of organic materials, including wood, bone, shell, and peat, which are frequently encountered at archaeological sites.

Moreover, carbon-14 dating boasts a relatively high level of accuracy, with a margin of error typically limited to a few hundred years. This precision is essential in archaeology, where even minor discrepancies in dates can significantly impact our understanding of historical events and cultures.

However, it is important to recognize that carbon-14 dating is not without its limitations. Factors such as sample contamination, fluctuations in atmospheric carbon-14 concentration over time, and decreased accuracy for very old samples can all influence the reliability of the results. Despite these challenges, carbon-14 dating remains an indispensable tool in archaeology, offering valuable insights into our past.
