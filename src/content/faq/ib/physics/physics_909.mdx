Two like charges repel each other, leading to a distortion in their electric fields as they push away from one another.

To understand this interaction more clearly, we can refer to Coulomb's Law and the concept of electric fields. Coulomb's Law states that the force $ F $ between two point charges $ q_1 $ and $ q_2 $ is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $ r $ between them. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
$$

where $ k $ is Coulomb's constant. Since like charges possess the same sign, they will exert a repulsive force on each other. Consequently, the larger the magnitudes of the charges and the closer they are in proximity, the stronger the repulsive force they will experience.

This repulsive force also affects the shape and direction of the electric fields surrounding the charges. An electric field is defined as the region around a charged particle where it exerts a force on other charged particles. The electric field is represented by field lines that indicate the direction a positive test charge would move if placed within the field. For a single isolated charge, the electric field radiates outward for positive charges and inward for negative charges, creating a symmetrical pattern.

However, when two like charges are positioned near one another, their electric fields interact in a complex way. The field lines between the charges push against each other, disrupting the usual symmetrical arrangement. As a result, the electric field lines bend or warp away from each other between the charges, reflecting the repulsive interaction.

In summary, the presence of one like charge affects the electric field of another like charge, resulting in a noticeable alteration of the field lines. This distortion visually represents the direction and relative strength of the electric field. Therefore, the electric fields of two like charges engage in mutual distortion and repulsion, illustrating the fundamental principle that like charges repel each other.
