A car consumes more fuel when climbing a hill due to the increased work required to counteract gravitational forces.

When a car travels on a flat surface, the engine primarily works to overcome friction and air resistance. However, once the car begins to ascend a hill, it must also exert energy to overcome the force of gravity. This added effort requires additional energy, resulting in higher fuel consumption.

The gravitational force acting on the car can be expressed with the equation:

$$
F = m \cdot g,
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the car and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. On a flat surface, this gravitational force is balanced by the normal force exerted by the ground, which means it does not affect the car's motion. In contrast, when the car climbs a hill, gravity exerts a downward and backward force that opposes the motion. Consequently, the engine must generate extra force to counteract gravity and maintain upward movement.

The work performed by the engine to elevate the car up the hill can be calculated using the formula:

$$
W = F \cdot d,
$$

where $F$ represents the total force required and $d$ is the distance traveled. The total force is the sum of the forces needed to overcome friction, air resistance, and gravity. As the incline of the hill increases, the component of gravitational force acting against the carâ€™s ascent also rises, leading to an increase in the total force required. As a result, the work done by the engine also escalates.

This additional work demands more energy, which is supplied by burning additional fuel. The efficiency of the engine is a crucial factor in this process. Since no engine operates at 100% efficiency, some energy from the fuel is inevitably lost as heat. Consequently, the engine must burn even more fuel to generate the required energy for climbing the hill.

In summary, a car requires increased fuel consumption to climb a hill because the engine must perform more work to counter the additional gravitational force acting against its motion. This extra work necessitates more energy, which is derived from burning additional fuel.
