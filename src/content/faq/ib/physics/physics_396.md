The area under a force-distance graph represents the work done by a force on an object.

In physics, work is defined as the amount of energy transferred by a force acting over a distance. When you create a graph with force plotted on the y-axis and distance on the x-axis, the area beneath the curve of this graph corresponds to the total work done. This relationship arises because work is mathematically expressed as the product of force and the distance over which it acts, which can be visualized as the area of a rectangle on a graph. However, since force may vary with distance, the graph may not always form a rectangle; nevertheless, the underlying principle remains unchanged.

The concept of work is fundamental in physics as it connects the ideas of force, energy, and motion. When a force acts on an object to move it a certain distance, it is said to perform work on that object. This work leads to a change in the object's energy. If the force acts in the same direction as the motion, it performs positive work, increasing the object's energy. Conversely, if the force opposes the direction of motion, it performs negative work, resulting in a decrease in the object's energy.

In the context of a force-distance graph, it is often assumed that the force remains constant over the distance. However, in practical situations, the force can vary. For instance, when you push a box across a rough floor, the required force changes as the box slows down due to friction. In such scenarios, the graph of force versus distance will not be a straight line but rather a curve. The area under this curve, which can be calculated using integral calculus, represents the total work done, accounting for the varying force.

In summary, the area under a force-distance graph serves as both a visual and mathematical representation of the work done by a force. It is an invaluable tool in physics, enabling us to calculate and comprehend the energy changes that occur when forces act on objects.
