The observed frequency, as determined by the Doppler formula, is calculated by multiplying the source frequency by the ratio of the speed of sound to the sum or difference of the speed of sound and the speed of either the observer or the source.

The Doppler effect is a well-known physical phenomenon that describes how the frequency of a wave changes based on the relative motion between the observer and the source of the wave. This effect is commonly experienced when a vehicle emitting a siren or horn approaches, passes by, and then recedes from an observer. During the approach, the observed frequency is higher than the emitted frequency; at the moment of passing, the frequencies are equal; and during the recession, the observed frequency is lower.

The relationship for calculating the observed frequency is given by the Doppler formula:

$$
f' = f \frac{v + v_o}{v + v_s}
$$

where:
- $f'$ is the observed frequency,
- $f$ is the source frequency,
- $v$ is the speed of sound in the medium,
- $v_o$ is the speed of the observer relative to the medium (positive when the observer is moving toward the source),
- $v_s$ is the speed of the source relative to the medium (positive when the source is moving away from the observer).

If the observer moves toward the source, the observed frequency increases. Conversely, if the observer moves away from the source, the observed frequency decreases. Similarly, if the source moves toward the observer, the observed frequency increases, whereas if the source moves away, the observed frequency decreases.

The Doppler formula enables the calculation of the observed frequency based on the speeds of both the observer and the source. It is crucial to understand that these speeds are measured relative to the medium through which the wave travels, rather than to each other. This formula is an essential tool for comprehending wave phenomena and has numerous applications across various fields of physics, including acoustics, optics, and astrophysics.
