The magnetic field pattern surrounding a straight conductor is circular, with the conductor positioned at the center.

When an electric current flows through a straight conductor, it generates a magnetic field around it. This magnetic field is organized in a specific manner, forming concentric circles around the conductor, which serves as the center point. The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand grip rule. To apply this rule, grip the conductor with your right hand such that your thumb points in the direction of the current; your fingers will then curl in the direction of the magnetic field.

The strength of the magnetic field is directly proportional to the current flowing through the conductor. This implies that an increase in current results in a stronger magnetic field, while a decrease in current leads to a weaker magnetic field. Additionally, the strength of the magnetic field diminishes with increasing distance from the conductor, as the magnetic field lines become more dispersed at greater distances.

You can visualize the magnetic field pattern through a simple experiment involving a straight conductor, a compass, and a power source. When the current is activated, the compass needle, which aligns itself with the magnetic field, will move. This movement indicates that a magnetic field has been established. By moving the compass around the conductor, you can trace the circular magnetic field lines.

In summary, the magnetic field pattern around a straight conductor is circular, with the conductor at the center. The strength and direction of the magnetic field depend on the current flowing through the conductor. This fundamental concept is essential for understanding various phenomena in electromagnetism and is crucial in the design of many electrical devices.
