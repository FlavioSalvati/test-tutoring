Increasing the angle of incline enhances the component of weight acting parallel to the slope, as it increases the gravitational force that acts in that direction.

In physics, the weight of an object is defined as the force exerted on it due to gravity, which always acts vertically downward. When an object is placed on an inclined plane, this weight can be resolved into two distinct components: one that acts perpendicular to the plane (the normal force) and another that acts parallel to the plane (the component of weight). Understanding this decomposition of forces is essential for grasping the dynamics at play.

The component of weight acting parallel to the inclined plane is expressed mathematically as $W \sin \theta$, where $W$ represents the weight of the object and $\theta$ is the angle of incline. As the angle of incline increases, the value of $\sin \theta$ also increases, since the sine function rises as the angle progresses from $0$ to $90$ degrees. Consequently, the parallel component of weight also rises. This principle highlights why an unbalanced force, such as the component of weight acting down an incline, leads to motion.

This phenomenon explains why you feel heavier when walking up a steep hill compared to traversing flat ground. The component of your weight that acts parallel to the slope is greater on steeper inclines, necessitating that you exert more force to overcome it. Moreover, this concept elucidates why climbing an incline requires more energy, correlating with an increase in the gravitational potential energy associated with your weight.

Conversely, the component of weight that acts perpendicular to the incline is given by $W \cos \theta$. As the angle of incline increases, the value of $\cos \theta$ decreases, as the cosine function diminishes from $0$ to $90$ degrees. Therefore, the perpendicular component of weight decreases when the angle of incline rises.

This is why objects appear lighter when you lift them straight up compared to when you slide them up an inclined plane. The component of their weight that you need to counteract is smaller when lifting them vertically. Understanding this breakdown of forces into their components can clarify how weight and other forces interact.

In summary, as the angle of an incline increases, the component of weight acting down the slope increases because the sine value (used in its calculation) grows. This increase makes objects feel heavier on steep inclines. Simultaneously, the weight component acting into the slope decreases, as the cosine value (used for this calculation) declines.
