Diffraction limits the resolution of optical systems by causing light waves to spread out and interfere with one another, which ultimately reduces the sharpness of images.

Diffraction is a fundamental characteristic of light, which exhibits both particle-like and wave-like behavior. When light encounters a small aperture or travels around an object, it spreads out and interferes with itself, resulting in a pattern of alternating light and dark regions. This phenomenon is referred to as diffraction. In imaging systems such as microscopes, telescopes, and cameras, diffraction can hinder the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects, a limitation known as resolution.

The resolution of an optical system is influenced by the wavelength of light used and the size of the aperture through which the light passes. Specifically, a smaller aperture leads to increased diffraction and consequently lower resolution. This relationship is mathematically described by the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two points are considered resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern from one point aligns with the first minimum of the diffraction pattern from the other point.

In simpler terms, if the diffraction patterns of two points overlap excessively, they become indistinguishable and appear as a single blurred point. This is why images can become less sharp and more blurred when you zoom in beyond the diffraction limit.

Importantly, while diffraction imposes a limit on resolution, it does not imply that finer details are entirely invisible. Advanced techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy and the use of shorter wavelength light, can help to bypass the diffraction limit and enhance resolution.

In conclusion, diffraction is a key property of light that can restrict the resolution of optical systems. As the aperture size decreases and the wavelength of light increases, diffraction intensifies and resolution diminishes. Nevertheless, various techniques are available to overcome these limitations and improve resolution.
