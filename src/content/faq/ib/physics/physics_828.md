The direction of wave polarization is defined by the orientation of the electric field vector.

To elaborate, wave polarization pertains to the orientation of oscillations within a wave, particularly in the context of electromagnetic waves, such as light. In these waves, oscillations occur within both the electric and magnetic fields that make up the wave. The specific direction of polarization is determined by the orientation of the electric field vector, which is always perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

To visualize this concept, consider a wave traveling in a straight line. The electric field vector may oscillate vertically (up and down), horizontally (left and right), or at any angle in between. This alignment of the electric field vector is what we refer to as the wave's polarization.

In unpolarized light, electric field vectors are oriented in all possible directions that are perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In contrast, when light is polarized, the electric field vectors become aligned along a specific direction. This alignment can occur naturally, such as when light reflects off a surface, or it can be induced artificially using a polarizing filter.

Polarization is a fundamental concept in various fields of physics and engineering. For instance, it plays a significant role in the design of sunglasses and 3D glasses, in the transmission of radio signals, and in the analysis of light emitted from distant stars and galaxies. Understanding wave polarization can therefore yield valuable insights into the characteristics of light and other electromagnetic waves.
