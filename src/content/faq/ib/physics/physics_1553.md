Destructive interference occurs when two waves of the same frequency are out of phase by $180$ degrees, or equivalently, by half a wavelength.

More specifically, destructive interference is a fundamental principle in wave theory that applies to various types of waves, including light, sound, and water waves. This phenomenon arises when two or more waves combine in such a way that they produce a resultant wave with a diminished amplitude, or in extreme cases, they completely cancel each other out. The condition for this is that the waves must share the same frequency and be out of phase by $180$ degrees, or half a wavelength.

The term "out of phase" describes the scenario in which the peaks and troughs of the waves do not align. In the context of destructive interference, the peak of one wave coincides with the trough of another, resulting in their cancellation. This interaction leads to a wave of reduced amplitude, or in some instances, no wave at all.

To visualize the conditions for destructive interference, consider two waves traveling along a string. If you generate a wave pulse at one end of the string and simultaneously create an identical pulse at the opposite end, but in the opposite direction, the two pulses will meet in the middle and cancel each other out. This cancellation occurs because the upward displacement of one pulse is perfectly counteracted by the downward displacement of the other.

In the case of light waves, destructive interference manifests as dark bands in interference patterns, such as those observed in the classic double-slit experiment. Here, light waves emanating from the two slits can cancel each other out when they are $180$ degrees out of phase, resulting in dark regions on the observation screen.

In summary, the essential conditions for destructive interference are that the involved waves must be of the same frequency and must be out of phase by $180$ degrees, or half a wavelength. This results in the cancellation of the waves, leading to a reduction in amplitude or, in some cases, complete cancellation.
