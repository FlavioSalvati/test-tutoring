Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a distinct type of motion characterized by oscillation around a fixed equilibrium position.

To elaborate, Simple Harmonic Motion, commonly referred to as SHM, is a specific form of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and acts in the opposite direction. This defining trait sets SHM apart from other types of motion.

In SHM, an object oscillates back and forth around a stable equilibrium point. This equilibrium position is where the object would remain at rest if it were not disturbed. The motion arises from a restoring force that consistently acts to return the object to this equilibrium position. According to Hooke's Law, the restoring force is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, expressed mathematically as:

$$
F = -k x
$$

where $F$ is the restoring force, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

Another notable aspect of SHM is that both the velocity and acceleration of the object are variable, changing over time. The velocity reaches its maximum value at the equilibrium position and decreases as the object moves away from it, ultimately becoming zero at the maximum displacement. Conversely, the acceleration is zero at the equilibrium position and reaches its peak at the maximum displacement. This relationship occurs because the restoring force, and thus the acceleration, is greatest at that point.

The motion in SHM is also sinusoidal, meaning it can be represented using sine or cosine functions. This characteristic stems from the continuous change in direction of both velocity and acceleration. Additionally, the period and frequency of the motion remain constant and do not depend on the amplitude of the oscillation. This constancy further distinguishes SHM from other motion types, where the period and frequency can vary with amplitude.

In contrast, other forms of motion, such as uniform motion or uniformly accelerated motion, exhibit constant velocity or constant acceleration, respectively. These types of motion do not involve a restoring force or oscillation around an equilibrium position. Furthermore, their velocity and acceleration do not change in a sinusoidal pattern, and their period and frequency can fluctuate with the amplitude.
