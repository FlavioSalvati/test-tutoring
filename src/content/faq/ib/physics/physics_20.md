Uncertainties in derived quantities are managed using the rules of uncertainty propagation.

When working with derived quantities in physics, it is essential to recognize that uncertainties can propagate through your calculations. This implies that the uncertainty in your final result is affected by the uncertainties in the individual measurements used to compute it. The rules of uncertainty propagation offer a systematic approach for calculating these effects.

### Addition and Subtraction

When adding or subtracting quantities, the absolute uncertainties simply add together. For instance, if you measure the length of a table with a ruler that has an uncertainty of $\pm 1 \, \text{cm}$, and you take two measurements, the total uncertainty becomes $\pm 2 \, \text{cm}$. This is based on the premise that uncertainties can accumulate in the worst-case scenario.

### Multiplication and Division

Conversely, when multiplying or dividing quantities, or raising them to a power, you need to sum the relative (or percentage) uncertainties. For example, when calculating the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length by the width, if the length has a relative uncertainty of $2\%$ and the width has a relative uncertainty of $3\%$, the area will have a relative uncertainty of $2\% + 3\% = 5\%$. This reflects the fact that uncertainties can compound in the worst-case scenario.

### Complex Equations

For more complex equations, calculus may be required to determine the propagation of uncertainties. This process involves taking the derivative of the equation with respect to each variable, multiplying each derivative by the uncertainty in that variable, and then combining these results in quadrature. Specifically, you square each uncertainty, sum them, and take the square root to obtain the total uncertainty in your derived quantity.

### Importance of Handling Uncertainties

Correctly managing uncertainties is crucial in physics as it enables you to quantify your confidence in the results. It is an integral aspect of any experimental investigation. Therefore, it is vital to understand the rules of uncertainty propagation and apply them accurately in your work.
