The Rutherford scattering model is a theoretical framework that describes how alpha particles interact with atomic nuclei.

Developed by Ernest Rutherford in $1911$, this model fundamentally transformed our understanding of atomic structure. Before Rutherford's groundbreaking work, the prevailing view of the atom was the 'plum pudding' model, proposed by J.J. Thomson. According to this model, atoms were thought to be uniform spheres of positive charge, with negatively charged electrons embedded throughout. However, Rutherford's experiments with alpha particle scattering led him to propose a radically different model.

In his experiments, Rutherford and his team directed a beam of positively charged alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil and observed the resulting scattering patterns on a fluorescent screen. They anticipated that most alpha particles would pass straight through the foil with minimal deflection, as suggested by the plum pudding model. To their surprise, while the majority of alpha particles did indeed pass through, a small fraction were deflected at large angles, and some even bounced back toward the source.

This unexpected observation could not be reconciled with the plum pudding model. In response, Rutherford proposed that atoms contain a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at their center, which is responsible for the deflections. The remainder of the atom consists mostly of empty space, allowing the alpha particles to travel through without obstruction. This led to the formulation of the nuclear model of the atom.

Additionally, the Rutherford scattering model introduced a mathematical formula to predict the distribution of scattering angles. This formula, known as the Rutherford scattering formula, is derived from the principles of classical mechanics and electrostatics. It assumes that the interaction between alpha particles and atomic nuclei occurs solely through the Coulomb force, which describes the interaction between two charged particles.

In summary, the Rutherford scattering model was a pivotal advancement in our understanding of atomic structure. It replaced the plum pudding model with the nuclear model of the atom and provided a mathematical framework for predicting how alpha particles scatter when interacting with atomic nuclei.
