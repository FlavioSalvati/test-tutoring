The work done by a force is defined as the amount of energy transferred when that force moves an object.

In the realm of physics, work quantifies the energy transfer that occurs whenever an object is displaced by an applied force. The calculation of work is achieved by multiplying the force exerted on the object by the distance over which this force is applied, and then by the cosine of the angle between the force and the direction of motion. This relationship is represented by the formula:

$$
W = F d \cos \theta
$$

where $ W $ signifies work, $ F $ represents the force, $ d $ denotes the distance, and $ \theta $ is the angle between the direction of the force and the direction of motion.

In the International System of Units (SI), work is measured in joules (J). Specifically, one joule is defined as the work done when a force of one newton moves an object one meter in the direction of the force. Therefore, the work performed by a force of $1$ newton moving an object $1$ meter along the direction of the force amounts to $1$ joule.

It is crucial to understand that work is only accomplished when the force and the displacement are aligned in the same direction. If the force is perpendicular to the direction of motion, no work is performed. This is due to the fact that the cosine of $90$ degrees is zero, resulting in zero work:

$$
W = F d \cos 90^\circ = 0
$$

Moreover, work can be categorized as either positive or negative. When the angle $ \theta $ between the force and the direction of motion is less than $90$ degrees, the work done is positive, indicating that the force is contributing energy to the object. Conversely, when the angle exceeds $90$ degrees, the work done is negative, suggesting that the object is exerting energy against the force.

In summary, the concept of work in physics serves as a means to quantify the energy transfer that occurs when a force acts on an object, resulting in displacement. Work is a scalar quantity, meaning it possesses magnitude but lacks direction, and its value depends on both the magnitude of the applied force and the distance over which it is exerted.
