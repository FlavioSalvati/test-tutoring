Total mechanical energy is determined by combining the potential energy and kinetic energy of an object.

To elaborate, the total mechanical energy $E$ of an object is defined as the sum of its kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $U$. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
E = K + U
$$

Kinetic energy represents the energy an object possesses due to its motion. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

In this formula, $m$ denotes the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity. Understanding kinetic energy is essential, as it is directly influenced by the object's velocity, which in turn affects the overall kinetic energy.
