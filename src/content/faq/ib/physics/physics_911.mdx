Electric potential refers to the amount of electric potential energy per unit charge, while electric field strength represents the force experienced by a unit positive charge within an electric field.

Electric potential, often referred to as electric potential difference or voltage, quantifies the work done per unit charge. It is a scalar quantity, meaning it possesses only magnitude, without any specific direction. The unit of electric potential is the volt (V), which is defined as one joule per coulomb (J/C). Electric potential arises from the presence of electric charges or changing magnetic fields. Importantly, electric potential is a point property, meaning it can be defined at every point in space, with its value taken as zero at infinity. To deepen your understanding of this concept, consider exploring related principles.

In contrast, electric field strength—also known as electric field intensity—is a vector quantity that indicates the force experienced by a unit positive charge due to the electric field. It is measured in newtons per coulomb (N/C) or volts per meter (V/m). The direction of the electric field at a given point reflects the direction of the force that a positive test charge would experience if it were placed at that location. A foundational understanding of electric fields can help clarify how forces operate within these fields.

The relationship between electric field strength ($E$) and electric potential ($V$) is expressed through the equation:

$$
E = -\frac{dV}{dr}
$$

where $dV$ represents the change in electric potential and $dr$ denotes the change in position. This equation illustrates that electric field strength is the negative gradient of electric potential. For those interested in visualizing this relationship, graphical representations may provide additional insights. Furthermore, investigating related concepts can enhance your understanding of how to quantify and connect electric field strength with electric potential.

In summary, electric potential describes the energy a charge possesses due to its position, measured in volts, and lacks direction. Conversely, electric field strength denotes the force a charge experiences, measured in newtons per coulomb or volts per meter, and has a defined direction. The two concepts are interconnected: the electric field indicates the rate at which electric potential changes with distance.
