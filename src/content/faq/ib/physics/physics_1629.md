Angular resolution is the capability of an optical system to differentiate or separate two closely spaced objects.

More specifically, angular resolution, often referred to as resolving power, quantifies the smallest angle between two objects that a system—such as a telescope, microscope, or camera—can perceive as distinct entities. It is typically expressed in units such as degrees, arcminutes, or arcseconds. A smaller angular resolution value indicates better resolution, allowing the system to discern objects that are positioned closer together.

This concept is particularly significant in fields like astronomy, where it establishes the level of detail visible in distant celestial bodies. For example, a telescope with high angular resolution can resolve individual stars within a galaxy, whereas a telescope with lower resolution may only present the galaxy as a singular point of light.

The angular resolution is influenced by both the wavelength of the observed light and the diameter of the aperture through which the light is collected. According to the Rayleigh criterion, the minimum resolvable angle can be approximated by the ratio of the wavelength $\lambda$ to the aperture diameter $D$, expressed as:

$$
\theta = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{D}
$$

Here, $\theta$ represents the minimum resolvable angle. This indicates that to enhance angular resolution, one can either decrease the wavelength (by using light with a higher frequency) or increase the aperture size.

However, practical limitations often arise. For instance, enlarging the aperture size of a telescope results in a larger, heavier instrument that is more challenging to handle. Likewise, observing light at higher frequencies may necessitate advanced technology or could be hindered by atmospheric absorption.

Furthermore, the atmosphere can impose restrictions on the angular resolution achievable from ground-based observations, primarily due to the blurring effects caused by atmospheric turbulence. This phenomenon is referred to as the 'seeing limit.' To mitigate these challenges, astronomers employ techniques such as adaptive optics or position telescopes in space, beyond the influence of Earth's atmosphere.

In conclusion, comprehending and optimizing angular resolution is essential for maximizing the detail that can be observed within any optical system.
