Gravitational field strength is determined using the formula 

$$
g = \frac{GM}{r^2}
$$ 

where $ G $ represents the gravitational constant, $ M $ denotes the mass of the object generating the gravitational field, and $ r $ is the distance from the center of the object to the point where the field strength is being calculated.

To elaborate, gravitational field strength quantifies the force experienced by a hypothetical test mass placed at a specific location within the field. It is defined as the force per unit mass exerted on an object due to gravitational attraction. The components of the formula are as follows:

- $ g $: Gravitational field strength, measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg).
- $ G $: The gravitational constant, approximately equal to $ 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N(m/kg)}^2 $.
- $ M $: The mass of the object creating the gravitational field, measured in kilograms (kg).
- $ r $: The distance from the center of the object to the point of interest, measured in meters (m).

This formula is derived from Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

In the specific context of Earth, the gravitational field strength is approximately $ 9.8 \, \text{N/kg} $ at the surface, and it decreases as one moves further away from the Earth's center. This reduction occurs because the distance $ r $ in the denominator of the formula increases.

It is crucial to understand that gravitational field strength is a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude and direction. The direction of the gravitational field is always directed toward the center of the mass creating the field.

In summary, gravitational field strength, measured in N/kg, indicates the intensity of gravitational force at a given point. The formula 

$$
g = \frac{GM}{r^2}
$$ 

utilizes the gravitational constant $ G $, the mass of the object $ M $, and the distance $ r $ from its center. This value illustrates how much force per unit mass is exerted by gravity at that location, and it diminishes with increasing distance from the object.
