Passive solar heating utilizes natural processes to distribute heat, while active solar heating employs mechanical and electrical systems.

Passive solar heating is a technique that harnesses the sun's energy to warm a building without relying on mechanical systems. This approach depends on several factors, including the building's design and orientation, the materials used in its construction, and the natural processes of heat distribution. For instance, a building may feature large, south-facing windows to maximize sunlight exposure. The heat absorbed from the sun is stored in the building's walls and floors, which gradually release this heat over time. This method is not only highly efficient but also sustainable; however, it necessitates careful planning and design to be effective.

In contrast, active solar heating systems utilize mechanical and electrical equipment to capture, convert, and distribute solar energy. These systems typically include solar collectors (such as solar panels), pumps or fans for heat distribution, and storage units for energy use when sunlight is unavailable. The heat collected can be used directly for heating purposes or converted into electricity for later consumption. Although active solar heating systems offer greater flexibility and can potentially provide more heat than passive systems, they are also more complex and may require increased maintenance.

In summary, the fundamental difference between passive and active solar heating lies in their methods of harnessing and distributing solar energy. Passive systems rely on natural processes and the building's design, making them more sustainable but also dependent on location and architectural choices. Conversely, active systems utilize mechanical and electrical equipment to capture and distribute solar energy, providing greater flexibility, but they may entail higher maintenance requirements and costs.
