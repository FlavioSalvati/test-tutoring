Hydrogen isotopes play a crucial role in fusion reactions due to their low atomic masses and high fusion cross-sections.

To elaborate, fusion reactions entail the merging of lighter atomic nuclei to create heavier ones, a process that releases a substantial amount of energy. The hydrogen isotopes deuterium ($D$) and tritium ($T$) are particularly well-suited for this process because of their low atomic masses. A lower atomic mass facilitates overcoming the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei, allowing them to come close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together effectively.

The fusion cross-section is a critical metric that quantifies the likelihood of a fusion reaction occurring. For hydrogen isotopes, this cross-section is notably high, indicating that when these isotopes collide, there is a significant probability that a fusion reaction will ensue. This is especially true for deuterium-tritium ($D-T$) reactions, which boast the highest fusion cross-sections among all potential fusion fuels.

Moreover, deuterium is abundant in seawater, providing a readily accessible source of fuel. Tritium, on the other hand, can be produced from lithium within a fusion reactor, making it a sustainable fuel source. The availability and sustainability of these fuels are essential considerations for the practical implementation of fusion energy.

The energy released during a fusion reaction is directly linked to the mass of the nuclei involved. In a deuterium-tritium fusion reaction, the mass of the resulting helium nucleus is slightly less than the combined masses of the original deuterium and tritium nuclei. This mass difference is converted into energy in accordance with Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, expressed as $E=mc^2$, leading to a substantial energy yield.

In summary, hydrogen isotopes are favored in fusion reactions due to their low atomic masses, high fusion cross-sections, and the availability and sustainability of deuterium and tritium as fuel sources. These factors, along with the significant energy output from deuterium-tritium fusion reactions, position hydrogen isotopes as the most viable option for fusion energy production.
