Mass plays a critical role in determining the gravitational force acting on an object; specifically, an increase in mass results in a stronger gravitational force.

In physics, gravity is a fundamental force that governs the interactions between objects with mass. This force is articulated by Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, which asserts that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

where $F$ is the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers.

This principle implies that if the mass of an object is increased, the gravitational force it exerts, as well as the force it experiences from other masses, will also increase. For example, if you were to double the mass of an object, both the gravitational force it exerts and the gravitational force it experiences would also double. This relationship highlights that gravitational force is directly proportional to mass.

However, it is crucial to understand that while mass influences the strength of gravitational force, it does not affect the acceleration due to gravity. This concept was famously illustrated by Galileo, who demonstrated that all objects, irrespective of their mass, fall at the same rate in a vacuum. This principle highlights a fundamental distinction in the study of motion. Furthermore, grasping the nuances of gravitational interactions is essential for understanding how gravitational forces operate across varying masses and distances.
