The force exerted by a spring varies with distance according to Hooke's Law, which states that the force is directly proportional to the displacement.

Hooke's Law, named after the 17th-century British scientist Robert Hooke, is a fundamental principle in physics that describes the relationship between the force $F$ required to extend or compress a spring and the distance $X$ it is displaced from its equilibrium position. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

$$
F = kX
$$

In this equation, $k$ represents the spring constant, a characteristic value that indicates the stiffness of the spring; $X$ is the displacement; and $F$ is the force applied to the spring.

The force exerted by a spring is classified as a restoring force, meaning that it acts to return the spring to its natural or equilibrium length. When a spring is stretched, it exerts a force that pulls back, attempting to return to its original length. Conversely, when a spring is compressed, it pushes back, striving to expand back to its natural state. This behavior is precisely what Hooke's Law describes.

The spring constant $k$ in Hooke's Law quantifies the stiffness of the spring. A larger value of $k$ indicates a stiffer spring that requires a greater force to stretch or compress it, while a smaller value of $k$ signifies a more flexible spring that requires less force.

It is crucial to understand that Hooke's Law is applicable only within the elastic limit of the spring. The elastic limit refers to the maximum distance that the spring can be stretched or compressed without undergoing permanent deformation. If the spring is stretched or compressed beyond this limit, it will not revert to its original length upon the removal of the applied force, rendering Hooke's Law inapplicable in such scenarios.

In summary, the force exerted by a spring changes in a linear and directly proportional manner with distance, as articulated by Hooke's Law. This force acts as a restoring force, seeking to return the spring to its equilibrium length. The proportionality constant, known as the spring constant $k$, measures the stiffness of the spring. This relationship holds true as long as the spring remains within its elastic limit.
