In a closed system, the work done is equal to the change in energy of that system.

In physics, a closed system is defined as one in which neither matter nor energy can enter or leave. The total energy within a closed system remains constant, a principle known as the conservation of energy. When work is performed on or by the system, it results in a change in the system's energy.

Work is a mechanism for transferring energy from one system or object to another. It is quantitatively defined as the force applied to an object multiplied by the distance over which that force is exerted. Work is measured in joules, which is the same unit used for energy. When work is done on a system, energy is transferred into the system, leading to an increase in its total energy. Conversely, when a system performs work on its surroundings, energy is transferred out, resulting in a decrease in its total energy.

In a closed system, any work done correlates directly to a change in the system's energy. If work is done on the system, its energy increases; if the system does work, its energy decreases. This relationship holds true because, in a closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or transformed.

For instance, consider a car accelerating along a flat road. In this scenario, the engine performs work on the car, causing it to speed up. This work is converted into kinetic energy, thereby increasing the car's total energy. Conversely, if the car slows down, it performs work on the brakes, transferring energy out of the system and decreasing its total energy.

In summary, work and energy are closely interconnected in a closed system. Work represents a transfer or transformation of energy, and the total energy of the system changes by an amount equal to the work done. This relationship is a direct manifestation of the conservation of energy, which is a fundamental principle in physics.
