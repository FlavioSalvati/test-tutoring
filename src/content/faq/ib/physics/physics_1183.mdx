Gravitational force is classified as a weak force because it is considerably weaker than the other fundamental forces of nature.

In the field of physics, there are four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Among these, gravity is the weakest. To illustrate this disparity, the gravitational force is approximately $10^{36}$ times weaker than the electromagnetic force, $10^{38}$ times weaker than the strong nuclear force, and $10^{29}$ times weaker than the weak nuclear force.

The reason gravity appears so powerful in our daily lives is that it operates over vast distances and affects large masses. For example, the gravitational pull of the Earth, a massive object, is strong enough to keep us anchored to the ground and to maintain the Moon's orbit around the Earth. However, on a smaller scale, such as between individual particles, the influence of gravity becomes negligible.

In contrast, the other three fundamental forces exert a much stronger influence at the atomic and subatomic levels. Take the electromagnetic force, for instance; it is responsible for keeping electrons in their orbits around the nucleus of an atom. The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together within the nucleus, effectively overcoming the electromagnetic repulsion that occurs between the positively charged protons. Although the weak nuclear force is less potent than both the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces, it is still significantly stronger than gravity and plays a crucial role in certain types of radioactive decay.

The relative weakness of gravity compared to the other fundamental forces poses a major puzzle in physics. This discrepancy contributes to the challenges faced in developing a quantum theory of gravity that aligns with the other three forces. This issue is often referred to as the hierarchy problem and is a central topic in the quest for a unified theory of everything in physics.

In summary, while gravity may appear powerful in our everyday experiences due to its influence over large masses and distances, it is, in fact, significantly weaker when compared to the other fundamental forces of nature. This is why gravitational force is regarded as a weak force within the realm of physics.
