Wave interference in single-slit diffraction occurs when waves passing through a narrow opening spread out and overlap, resulting in an interference pattern.

In single-slit diffraction, a wavefront of light strikes a barrier that contains a single narrow opening, or slit. As the wavefront encounters the slit, it undergoes bending and spreading in a phenomenon known as diffraction. This spreading gives rise to semi-circular or spherical wavefronts on the opposite side of the slit.

Understanding the wave interference in this context relies on the principle of superposition. This principle dictates that when two or more waves overlap, the resulting wave at any given point is the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves. In single-slit diffraction, each point along the wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets. These wavelets emanate in all directions and interfere with one another.

When the crests of two wavelets coincide, they interfere constructively, producing a bright fringe. Conversely, if a crest from one wavelet meets a trough from another, they interfere destructively, resulting in a dark fringe. This alternating sequence of bright and dark fringes constitutes the interference pattern characteristic of single-slit diffraction.

The width of the slit significantly influences the interference pattern. A narrower slit leads to greater diffraction, resulting in a wider central bright fringe. In contrast, a wider slit produces less diffraction and consequently a narrower central bright fringe. The angle of diffraction, defined as the angle between the incident wavefront and the direction of the diffracted wave, is inversely proportional to the slit width.

In conclusion, wave interference in single-slit diffraction arises from the diffraction of the wavefront at the slit and the subsequent overlapping of secondary wavelets. The resulting interference pattern is a direct manifestation of the principle of superposition and is affected by the width of the slit.
