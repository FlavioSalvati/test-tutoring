We often overlook diffraction in our everyday experiences because it becomes most apparent when light interacts with objects that are comparable in size to its wavelength.

Diffraction is a phenomenon that occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is of a size similar to its wavelength. This leads to the bending of waves around the edges of the obstacle or aperture, allowing them to enter the region that would otherwise be in the geometric shadow of the object. In our daily lives, most objects we encounter are significantly larger than the wavelength of visible light, which spans approximately $400$ to $700$ nanometers. As a result, the effects of diffraction are not easily observable.

One of the most common examples of diffraction that we might notice is the spreading of light as it passes through a small aperture, like a pinhole. However, even this effect tends to go unnoticed because it is relatively subtle, and our eyes do not have the sensitivity to detect it without the assistance of specialized equipment.

Furthermore, our brains are adept at processing visual information in a way that aligns with our understanding of the world. Even if diffraction effects were more prominent, our brains might filter them out or misinterpret them, as they do not conform to our typical expectations of how light behaves.

It is also important to note that diffraction is more readily observed with waves that have longer wavelengths, such as sound waves or water waves. For instance, when sound waves encounter a barrier, they bend around it, allowing us to hear sounds from around corners. Similarly, water waves spread out after passing through a gap in a barrier, such as a breakwater. However, these examples pertain to sound and water, not light, and thus they do not help us recognize the effects of light diffraction in our daily lives.

In summary, while diffraction is a fundamental characteristic of wave behavior, its effects remain largely unnoticed in our everyday experiences. This is due to the relatively small size of the wavelength of visible light compared to the objects we interact with, the limitations of our visual perception, and the manner in which our brains interpret visual stimuli.
