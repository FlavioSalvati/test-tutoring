Friction plays a vital role in enabling an object to travel along a circular path by providing the necessary centripetal force.

To elaborate, friction is crucial in scenarios involving circular motion, such as a car navigating a curve or a ball rolling along a circular surface. In both cases, it is the frictional force—between the car's tires and the road, or between the ball and the surface it rolls on—that supplies the centripetal force required to maintain the object's circular trajectory.

The centripetal force acts towards the center of the circle and is always perpendicular to the object's motion. Without this force, an object would continue in a straight line due to its inertia. In many instances of circular motion, this force is provided by friction.

Consider a car making a turn. The frictional force between the tires and the road surface directs toward the center of the curve. This frictional force is what allows the car to maintain its circular path. If the friction is inadequate—such as when driving on icy roads or if the car is moving too quickly—the car will be unable to sustain its circular trajectory and may skid off the road.

Similarly, when a ball rolls in a circular path, the friction between the ball and the surface exerts a force toward the center of the circle. This frictional force is essential for keeping the ball on its circular path. If this force is not strong enough, the ball will not be able to maintain its circular motion and will instead travel off in a straight line.

In summary, friction is indispensable for circular motion, as it provides the centripetal force necessary for an object to follow a curved path. Without adequate friction, an object would fail to sustain its circular motion and would instead move straight ahead due to its inertia.
