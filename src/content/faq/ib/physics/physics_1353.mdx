Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a vital technology aimed at mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy production, particularly from fossil fuels used in electricity generation and industrial processes. This technology has the potential to capture up to $90\%$ of CO2 emissions, preventing significant amounts of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere. The captured CO2 is subsequently transported and stored underground, playing a crucial role in the global effort against climate change. By enabling the continued use of fossil fuels while substantially lowering CO2 emissions, CCS offers a pathway toward a more sustainable energy future.

Despite its promise, the implementation of carbon capture and storage comes with several challenges. One of the primary drawbacks is that the process requires a considerable amount of energy to capture, transport, and store the CO2. This energy demand often leads to power plants with CCS technology being less efficient than their conventional counterparts, as they need to burn more fuel to generate the same amount of electricity.

Additionally, the efficiency of CO2 capture is not perfect. A certain percentage of CO2 will inevitably escape into the atmosphere, and the extent of this leakage can vary based on the specific technology employed and the characteristics of the power plant. Consequently, while CCS can greatly diminish a power plant's CO2 emissions, it cannot completely eliminate them.

The challenges of transporting and storing CO2 are also significant. The CO2 must be moved, often over long distances, to appropriate storage sites. This transportation process is energy-intensive, contributing to the overall energy costs associated with CCS. Moreover, the chosen storage sites, typically located deep underground, must be carefully selected to ensure they are stable and capable of securely containing the CO2 over time without risk of leakage.

In summary, while carbon capture and storage can lead to a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions from energy production, it simultaneously demands additional energy for its operation. This requirement results in a decrease in the overall efficiency of power plants that utilize CCS technology. Nevertheless, given the pressing necessity to lower CO2 emissions in the fight against climate change, the trade-offs associated with CCS may be a worthwhile consideration.
