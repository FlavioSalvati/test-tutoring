Voltage and electric field strength are fundamentally interconnected concepts in electromagnetism. Voltage, or electric potential difference, is defined as the work done per unit charge to move a positive charge from one point to another within an electric field. It is quantified in volts ($V$). 

In contrast, electric field strength measures the intensity of an electric field at a specific location. It is defined as the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed at that point and can be expressed in newtons per coulomb ($N/C$) or volts per meter ($V/m$).

The relationship between voltage and electric field strength can be clarified through the concept of work. When a charge is displaced within an electric field, work is performed against the electric force. This work is what we refer to as voltage. Consequently, a stronger electric field necessitates more work to move a charge, which results in a higher voltage.

Mathematically, this relationship is expressed by the equation:

$$
V = Ed
$$

where $V$ represents voltage, $E$ denotes electric field strength, and $d$ signifies the distance over which the charge is moved. This equation illustrates that, for a fixed distance, voltage increases with an increase in electric field strength. Conversely, for a constant electric field strength, voltage decreases as the distance increases.

In the case of a uniform electric field, the voltage is consistently distributed throughout the field, meaning the electric field strength remains constant at all points. However, in a non-uniform electric field, the voltage varies throughout the field, leading to differing electric field strengths at various locations.

In summary, voltage and electric field strength are deeply intertwined concepts that are essential for understanding electric circuits and electric field theory. Grasping their relationship is crucial for comprehending many aspects of electromagnetism.
