Gravitational force and distance have an inverse relationship: as the distance between two objects increases, the gravitational force between them decreases.

This relationship is quantitatively described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. This law states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This relationship can be summarized by the equation:

$$
F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

In this equation, $ F $ represents the gravitational force of attraction between two masses, $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the two masses involved, and $ r $ is the distance between the centers of these masses.

A critical aspect of this equation is the inverse square law. This law indicates that if the distance between two objects is doubled, the gravitational force becomes one-quarter of its original value. If the distance is tripled, the force decreases to one-ninth of its initial strength, and this pattern continues. This rapid decrease in gravitational force with increasing distance explains why we do not feel a significant pull from nearby objects, such as cars or buildings, despite their mass. The gravitational force they exert is negligible compared to the force exerted by the Earth, primarily because we are much closer to the Earth's center of mass.

It is important to note that while gravitational force weakens with increasing distance, it never actually becomes zero. Regardless of how far apart two objects may be, there will always be some gravitational force acting between them, however small. This principle explains why the Earth is still influenced by the gravitational pull of distant stars and galaxies.

In summary, according to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, the gravitational force diminishes as the distance between two objects increases. This law clarifies that the gravitational attraction weakens with greater distance because it is inversely proportional to the square of that distance. However, even at vast separations, the gravitational force does not vanish; every object in the universe continues to exert a gravitational influence on every other object.
