To calculate the wavelength of a wave, you can use the formula:

$$
\text{wavelength} = \frac{\text{speed}}{\text{frequency}}.
$$

In more detail, the wavelength represents the distance over which the wave's shape repeats, typically measured in the direction of the wave's propagation. The speed of a wave indicates how fast it travels in a specific direction, while the frequency signifies the number of oscillations (or cycles) that pass a given point in a specific time frame.

The relationship between these three properties—wavelength, speed, and frequency—is encapsulated in the formula:

$$
\text{wavelength} = \frac{\text{speed}}{\text{frequency}}.
$$

This formula is derived from the fundamental definition of speed, which is the distance traveled per unit time. In the context of a wave, the 'distance traveled' corresponds to one wavelength, and the 'unit time' is one period of the wave, which is the inverse of the frequency.

To determine the wavelength of a wave, you need to know both its speed and frequency. Once you have these values, you can easily calculate the wavelength by dividing the speed by the frequency. The result will be expressed in meters (m).

For instance, consider a wave with a speed of $300 \, \text{m/s}$ and a frequency of $100 \, \text{Hz}$. The wavelength can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{wavelength} = \frac{300 \, \text{m/s}}{100 \, \text{Hz}} = 3 \, \text{m}.
$$

This indicates that the wave completes one full cycle every $3 \, \text{m}$.

It's important to note that this formula is applicable to all types of waves, including sound waves, light waves, and electromagnetic waves. However, the speed of the wave will vary depending on the medium through which it travels. For example, sound waves propagate at different speeds in air, water, and steel. Similarly, light and electromagnetic waves travel at varying speeds in different materials. Thus, when calculating the wavelength, ensure that you use the appropriate speed for the specific medium in which the wave is traveling.
