Magnetic fields exert a force on moving charged particles, compelling them to follow circular or helical trajectories.

A magnetic field is defined as a region where magnetic forces can be detected. These fields are generated by magnets, electric currents, and varying electric fields. When a charged particle, such as an electron or proton, enters a magnetic field while in motion, it experiences a force known as the Lorentz force. This force acts perpendicular to both the direction of the magnetic field and the velocity of the charged particle.

The Lorentz force causes the charged particle to deviate from its initial path, resulting in circular or helical motion. Since the force is always at right angles to the particle's velocity, it alters the direction of the particle's motion without affecting its speed. Consequently, if the angle between the particle's velocity and the magnetic field is $90^\circ$, the particle will follow a circular path; if the angle is less than $90^\circ$, the particle will trace out a helical path.

The magnitude of the Lorentz force experienced by the charged particle is influenced by several factors, including the charge of the particle, its velocity, and the strength of the magnetic field. Specifically, the force increases with greater charge, higher speed, and stronger magnetic fields.

The direction of the Lorentz force is determined by the orientations of both the magnetic field and the particle's motion. This relationship can be understood using Fleming's left-hand rule for motors. According to this rule, if you extend your left hand such that your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger are all at right angles to each other—where your forefinger points in the direction of the magnetic field and your middle finger points in the direction of the particle's motion—your thumb will indicate the direction of the resulting force.

In conclusion, magnetic fields play a crucial role in influencing the behavior of charges in motion. They exert a force that causes these charges to move in circular or helical paths. The magnitude and direction of this force depend on the charge and speed of the particle, as well as the strength and direction of the magnetic field.
