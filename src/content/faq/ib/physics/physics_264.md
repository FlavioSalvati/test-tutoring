Mesons and baryons are distinct types of hadrons, which are particles composed of quarks. The fundamental difference between the two lies in their quark composition: mesons consist of one quark and one antiquark, whereas baryons are made up of three quarks.

Quarks are elementary particles that serve as the building blocks of matter. They exist in six varieties, referred to as "flavours": up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. The arrangement and number of these quarks determine the specific characteristics of mesons and baryons.

Mesons, being composed of a quark and an antiquark, are classified as bosons. This means they possess integer spin and conform to Bose-Einstein statistics. Mesons play a crucial role in mediating the strong force, the fundamental force that keeps protons and neutrons bound within the nucleus of an atom. Notable examples of mesons include the pion ($\pi$) and the kaon ($K$).

In contrast, baryons consist of three quarks and are classified as fermions. This classification indicates that baryons have half-integer spin and follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. Baryons include well-known particles such as protons and neutrons, which constitute the atomic nucleus. Other examples of baryons are lambda ($\Lambda$) and sigma ($\Sigma$) particles.

The properties of mesons and baryons, including their charge and spin, are determined by the types and arrangements of their constituent quarks. For instance, a proton, which is a baryon, is formed from two up quarks and one down quark, resulting in a charge of $+1$. A pion, which is a meson, can be composed of an up quark and an anti-down quark, yielding a charge of $+1$, or a down quark and an anti-up quark, resulting in a charge of $-1$.

In summary, while both mesons and baryons are quark-based hadrons, they differ fundamentally in the number and arrangement of their quarks. This distinction is crucial, as it directly influences their properties and behaviors.
