In the context of standing waves, nodes and antinodes play crucial roles in defining the wave's behavior. Nodes are points of zero amplitude, while antinodes are points of maximum amplitude.

Standing waves appear stationary, yet they arise from the superposition of two waves traveling in opposite directions, both possessing the same frequency and amplitude. This interaction creates specific points along the wave where the two waves interfere destructively, resulting in no movementâ€”these points are known as nodes. Conversely, there are points where the two waves interfere constructively, leading to maximum displacement; these are called antinodes.

Nodes are characterized by complete stagnation. They occur at locations where the two waves are always out of phase, meaning that the crest of one wave coincides with the trough of the other. This out-of-phase relationship causes destructive interference, effectively canceling the two waves. Consequently, the medium at a node remains motionless. For instance, in a vibrating string, the nodes are the positions where the string does not oscillate.

In contrast, antinodes exhibit maximum movement. They occur at points where the two waves are always in phase, which means that the crest of one wave aligns with the crest of the other, and similarly, the troughs coincide. This in-phase alignment results in constructive interference, where the waves amplify each other. As a result, the medium at an antinode experiences the greatest amplitude of motion. Again, in the case of a string, the antinodes are the points that exhibit the most significant oscillation.

The locations of nodes and antinodes are determined by the wavelength of the waves and the length of the medium. For example, in a string that is fixed at both ends, nodes will always be positioned at the ends of the string. The distance between adjacent nodes (or antinodes) is equal to half the wavelength of the waves. 

Understanding nodes and antinodes is essential for comprehending the behavior of standing waves, which are significant in various fields of physics, including acoustics and quantum mechanics.
