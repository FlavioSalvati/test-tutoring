Resolution in measurements refers to the smallest detectable change in a quantity that an instrument can identify.

In greater detail, resolution is a vital concept across various measurement domains, particularly in physics. It serves as an indicator of the precision of an instrument or system. The resolution of a measuring device is closely linked to its sensitivity; while sensitivity indicates how responsive an instrument is to changes in the measured quantity, resolution defines the minimal change that can be observed.

For example, consider a digital thermometer that displays temperature readings to one decimal place. In this case, the resolution of the thermometer is $0.1$ degrees. This means that the smallest temperature change the thermometer can detect is $0.1$ degrees. If the temperature fluctuates by less than this amount, the thermometer will not register the change.

Resolution is not limited to physical measurements; it also applies to digital systems. In the context of digital images, for example, resolution refers to the level of detail that can be captured, typically measured in pixels.

It is crucial to understand that high resolution does not inherently equate to high accuracy. Accuracy pertains to how closely a measurement aligns with the true value, while resolution indicates the smallest measurable increment. An instrument may exhibit high resolution (capable of detecting very small changes), yet if it is not properly calibrated, it may yield inaccurate results.

**IB Physics Tutor Summary:** Resolution in measurements is defined as the smallest change that an instrument can detect. For instance, a thermometer with a resolution of $0.1$ degrees can only register changes of at least that magnitude. While high resolution allows for more precise measurements, it does not ensure accuracy. Understanding resolution is crucial for interpreting results and differentiating between precision and accuracy in experimental contexts. To gain deeper insights into the intricacies of instrument precision and its impact on measurements, further reading on this topic is encouraged. Additionally, grasping the significance of resolution is essential for understanding the limits within which measurements can be accurately interpreted. Finally, recognizing the distinction between resolution and accuracy is fundamental in scientific measurements, underscoring the importance of both concepts in the precise representation of data.
