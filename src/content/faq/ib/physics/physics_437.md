The primary parameters in Newton's law of universal gravitation are the gravitational constant ($G$), the masses of the two objects ($m_1$ and $m_2$), and the distance between them ($r$).

Newton's law states that every particle of matter in the universe exerts an attractive force on every other particle. This force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating their centers. The relationship is mathematically expressed with the equation:

$$
F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the gravitational force between the particles, $m_1$ and $m_2$ denote the masses of the two particles, $r$ is the distance between their centers, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.

The gravitational constant ($G$) is a fundamental component of this equation. It serves as the proportionality constant in Newton's law of universal gravitation and is approximately valued at $6.67430(15) \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N(m/kg)}^2$. This constant remains uniform throughout the universe and quantifies the strength of the gravitational force.

The masses of the objects, represented as $m_1$ and $m_2$, are also crucial parameters. The gravitational force between two objects increases proportionally with the increase in either mass. For instance, if the mass of one object is doubled, the gravitational force between the two objects will also double. This occurs because the force of gravity is directly proportional to the product of the two masses.

The distance between the objects, denoted as $r$, is another essential parameter. The gravitational force diminishes with the square of the distance. This means that if the distance between the two objects is doubled, the gravitational force reduces to one-fourth of its original value. This behavior arises because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of the two objects.

In summary, the gravitational constant, the masses of the objects, and the distance between them are the fundamental parameters in Newton's gravitational equation. A comprehensive understanding of these parameters and their interactions is vital for grasping the nature of gravitational forces.
