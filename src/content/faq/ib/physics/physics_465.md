Radiation poses significant risks to living organisms due to its potential to damage cells, which can lead to mutations and ultimately result in cancer.

Radiation is defined as energy that travels through space in the form of waves or particles. It can be classified into two main types: non-ionising radiation, such as radio waves and microwaves, and ionising radiation, which includes X-rays and gamma rays. Among these, ionising radiation is particularly hazardous to living beings.

Ionising radiation possesses sufficient energy to dislodge electrons from atoms, thereby creating ions. When this occurs within the body, it can result in cellular damage. Specifically, the DNA within these cells may undergo alterations, leading to mutations. Such mutations can interfere with normal cellular functions, prompting cells to grow and divide uncontrollablyâ€”this uncontrolled growth is the fundamental characteristic of cancer.

Furthermore, exposure to high doses of radiation can kill cells outright, leading to a condition known as radiation sickness. Common symptoms of radiation sickness include nausea, weakness, hair loss, skin burns, and diminished organ function. In extreme cases, radiation sickness can be fatal.

The detrimental effects of radiation exposure are not confined to the individual who is exposed. If ionising radiation damages the DNA in reproductive cells (sperm or eggs), it can result in mutations that affect future generations. This highlights the environmental implications of radiation exposure, as it can disrupt entire populations and ecosystems.

It is essential to understand that not all radiation exposure is harmful. The human body has mechanisms to repair certain levels of cellular damage. However, the risk of damage increases with the dose, duration, and rate of exposure to radiation.

In summary, radiation can be harmful to living organisms due to its ability to damage cells and DNA, leading to serious health issues such as cancer and radiation sickness. This risk necessitates careful management, particularly in environments where exposure to ionising radiation is a possibility.
