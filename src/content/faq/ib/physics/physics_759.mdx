The pitch of a musical note is directly proportional to its frequency; as the frequency increases, the pitch also rises.

In the fields of music and acoustics, pitch refers to the perceived frequency of a sound or note, serving as one of the fundamental elements of music and sound perception. The frequency of a note is measured in Hertz (Hz), which denotes the number of cycles per second. When the frequency of a note increases, we perceive the sound as a higher pitch; conversely, when the frequency decreases, the pitch is perceived as lower.

The relationship between pitch and frequency is logarithmic, indicating that the perceived pitch of a note is proportional to the logarithm of its frequency. This phenomenon stems from the way the human ear interprets sound. Our auditory system responds to the logarithmic intensity of sound, which is why a note that has double the frequency of another is perceived as being an octave higher, rather than simply twice as high in pitch.

This logarithmic relationship is also foundational for constructing musical scales and tuning musical instruments. For instance, in Western music, the chromatic scale is derived from a geometric series of frequencies where each note is separated by a ratio of the 12th root of 2. This implies that each successive note in the scale has a frequency approximately $1.059$ times that of the preceding note.

In summary, the pitch of a note is fundamentally linked to its frequency. This connection is essential for our understanding of music and sound, forming the basis for musical scales and the tuning of instruments. Grasping this relationship is vital for anyone studying music or acoustics and represents a key concept in the field of physics.
