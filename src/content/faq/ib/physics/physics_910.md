Electric potential energy refers to the energy that a charged particle possesses due to its position within an electric field.

To elaborate, electric potential energy is a specific form of potential energy that can be transformed into other energy types, notably kinetic energy. This energy is linked to the arrangement of a set of point charges in an electric field. The term 'potential energy' is used because it indicates the capacity to convert into other energy forms, such as kinetic energy, when the charges are permitted to move.

The electric potential energy of a system composed of point charges is defined as the work performed by an external agent to assemble the system. This involves bringing each charge from infinity to its designated position, one at a time. It is essential to recognize that the electric potential energy depends on the positions of the charges, the magnitudes of each charge, and the distances between them.

For a system of two point charges, the formula for electric potential energy, denoted as $U$, is expressed as:

$$
U = \frac{kQq}{r}
$$

Here, $k$ represents Coulomb's constant, $Q$ and $q$ are the magnitudes of the two charges, and $r$ is the distance separating the charges. When more than two charges are involved, the total electric potential energy is the sum of the potential energies for each pair of charges.

In the context of electric fields, electric potential energy is directly related to the work done by the field on a charged particle. When a positive charge moves in the direction of the electric field, it loses potential energy because work is performed by the field. Conversely, if a positive charge moves against the field, it gains potential energy. For negative charges, the opposite holds true.

Understanding electric potential energy is vital in the field of physics, as it elucidates the behavior of charged particles in electric fields. This concept is fundamental in electromagnetism and has numerous practical applications, including the functioning of capacitors in electronic circuits.
