In wave mechanics, particularly when studying standing waves, the terms "node" and "antinode" are commonly used to describe specific points in the wave pattern. 

A **node** is defined as a point of minimum displacement in a standing wave, where the wave does not move. Conversely, an **antinode** is a point of maximum displacement, where the wave oscillates with the greatest amplitude.

Standing waves, which appear to be stationary, typically arise from the interference of two waves traveling in opposite directions. In this context, nodes and antinodes play crucial roles in characterizing the wave's behavior, with nodes indicating locations of no movement and antinodes marking areas of peak movement.
