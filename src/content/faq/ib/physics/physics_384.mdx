Impulse is defined as the product of the force exerted on an object and the duration of time over which that force is applied.

Impulse, represented by the symbol $J$, is a vector quantity that can be mathematically expressed as the integral of a force $F$ over a time interval $\Delta t$. This relationship can be succinctly written as:

$$
J = F \Delta t
$$

This equation indicates that the impulse imparted to an object is equal to the force acting on it multiplied by the duration of time that the force is applied.

In more straightforward terms, impulse reflects the change in momentum of an object when a force is exerted over a specific period. If the force remains constant, the impulse delivered to the object can be calculated simply as the product of the force and the time interval:

$$
J = F \cdot t
$$

If the force varies over time, the impulse can be determined by calculating the area under the force-time graph.

Understanding the relationship between impulse and force is essential for comprehending how momentum changes. For example, in sports such as cricket or golf, athletes swing their bats or clubs with a certain force for a specific duration to impart the desired impulse to the ball, thereby altering its momentum and propelling it in the intended direction.

Additionally, this relationship plays a vital role in safety engineering. For instance, car airbags are engineered to inflate upon impact, which extends the time over which the force is applied to a passenger. This increased time reduces the force experienced by the passenger, thereby decreasing the impulse and the associated change in momentum, ultimately helping to prevent injuries.

In summary, the interplay between impulse and force is fundamental in physics. It enhances our understanding of object motion and interactions and has practical implications in various domains, including sports and safety engineering.
