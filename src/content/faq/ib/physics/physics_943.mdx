Electric field lines are perpendicular to conducting surfaces due to the ability of conductors to redistribute their charges, effectively canceling the electric field within their interior.

To elaborate, when an external electric field is applied to a conductor, the free electrons within the conductor begin to move. These electrons travel in a direction opposite to that of the applied electric field until they reach the surface of the conductor. This movement generates an induced electric field within the conductor, which opposes the applied field. The electrons will continue to redistribute until the induced electric field and the applied field are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net electric field of zero inside the conductor.

As the free electrons migrate to the surface, they create a surface charge distribution. This distribution is arranged such that the electric field just outside the conductor is perpendicular to the surface at every point. This alignment occurs because electric field lines must either begin or end on charges, and in this case, the charges reside on the surface of the conductor. Consequently, the electric field lines are perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.
