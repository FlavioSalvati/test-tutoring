The intensity distribution in single-slit diffraction is determined using the Fraunhofer diffraction equation.

In the phenomenon of single-slit diffraction, light waves that pass through a narrow slit undergo interference, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark fringes on a screen. This intensity distribution can be calculated using the Fraunhofer diffraction equation, which is based on the principles of wave interference and the Huygens-Fresnel principle.

The Huygens-Fresnel principle posits that each point on a wavefront can be treated as a source of secondary wavelets, which propagate in all directions at a speed equal to the speed of the original wave. When light traverses a narrow slit, these secondary wavelets interfere with one another, producing a distinctive diffraction pattern.

The Fraunhofer diffraction equation quantifies this intensity distribution. It is given by:

$$
I(\theta) = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin(\beta)}{\beta} \right)^2
$$

where $I(\theta)$ represents the intensity at an angle $\theta$ from the central maximum, $I_0$ is the maximum intensity, and $\beta$ is defined as:

$$
\beta = \frac{\pi a \sin(\theta)}{\lambda}
$$

In this equation, $a$ denotes the width of the slit and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. This mathematical relationship illustrates how the intensity of light diminishes as the angle $\theta$ increases, resulting in a central bright fringe flanked by alternating dark and bright fringes. The dimensions of these fringes are influenced by both the slit width and the wavelength of the light used.

To compute the intensity distribution, one would first determine $\beta$ for various angles $\theta$. After calculating $\beta$, it can be substituted into the Fraunhofer diffraction equation to ascertain the intensity at each angle. By performing this calculation across a range of angles, you can generate a graph of the intensity distribution. Gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying principles can enhance your comprehension of wave interference and the formation of diffraction patterns.

In summary, the analysis of single-slit diffraction relies on the Fraunhofer diffraction equation, which is grounded in the Huygens-Fresnel principle. This equation elucidates how light intensity varies at different angles from the central bright fringe, revealing a pattern of alternating bright and dark bands.
