You can effectively demonstrate the magnetic effect of an electric current by passing it through a wire placed near a compass.

### Materials Needed
To conduct this experiment, gather the following materials:
- A compass
- A battery
- A piece of wire
- Electrical tape

The compass is a straightforward device that utilizes Earth's magnetic field to indicate the direction of magnetic north. The wire will generate a magnetic field when an electric current flows through it.

### Experiment Procedure
1. **Connect the Wire**: Begin by connecting one end of the wire to the positive terminal of the battery. Use electrical tape to secure this connection, ensuring it is firm and reliable.
  
2. **Position the Compass**: Place the compass near the wire, ensuring it is not too close to the battery itself.

3. **Complete the Circuit**: Next, connect the other end of the wire to the negative terminal of the battery. Once these connections are made, the circuit will be complete, and an electric current will begin to flow through the wire.

### Observations
Pay close attention to the compass needle. When the current flows, you will notice that the needle deflects from its original position, which points toward Earth's magnetic north. This deflection occurs because the electric current flowing through the wire generates a magnetic field around it. This newly created magnetic field interacts with the magnetic field of the compass, causing the needle to move.

### Understanding the Deflection
The direction in which the compass needle deflects is determined by the direction of the current flow. If you reverse the connections to the battery, the current will flow in the opposite direction, resulting in the compass needle deflecting in the opposite direction as well. This behavior illustrates the right-hand rule of electromagnetism: if you point your right thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field.

### Conclusion
This simple experiment effectively demonstrates the magnetic effect produced by an electric current. It illustrates how an electric current can create a magnetic field that interacts with other magnetic fields, such as that of a compass. Additionally, it provides a practical application of the right-hand rule, a fundamental concept in the study of electromagnetism.
