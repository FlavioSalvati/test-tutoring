An object in free fall accelerates solely due to the gravitational force acting on it.

To elaborate, the concept of free fall is a fundamental principle in physics. It describes the motion of a body where gravity is the only force acting upon it. In the absence of additional forces, such as friction or air resistance, an object in free fall experiences a constant acceleration directed toward the center of the Earth. This acceleration is referred to as the acceleration due to gravity, which has an approximate value of $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ on Earth.

The force of gravity arises from the mass of the Earth attracting the mass of the object. According to Newton's second law of motion, the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is given by the equation $F = ma$. In the context of free fall, the force represents the weight of the object, which can be calculated as the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. Thus, as the gravitational force acts downward toward the Earth's center, the object accelerates in that same direction.

This acceleration is constant, meaning that the object's velocity increases by approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}$ for every second it is in free fall. For instance, after one second, its velocity would reach $9.81 \, \text{m/s}$; after two seconds, it would be $19.62 \, \text{m/s}$; and this pattern continues until the object encounters a force that counteracts gravity, such as the ground or air resistance.

It is essential to recognize that all objects in free fall accelerate at the same rate, regardless of their mass. This principle was famously demonstrated by Galileo, who dropped two spheres of different masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and observed that they hit the ground simultaneously. This phenomenon also explains why astronauts in space appear to be weightlessâ€”they are in continuous free fall towards the Earth, yet their forward motion keeps them in orbit.

In summary, an object in free fall accelerates due to the force of gravity. This force, acting in isolation, causes the object to increase its speed as it moves toward the Earth, illustrating the principle of acceleration due to gravity.
