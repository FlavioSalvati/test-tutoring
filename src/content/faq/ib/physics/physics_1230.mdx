Energy conservation in radioactive decay is governed by the principle of mass-energy equivalence.

In radioactive decay, an unstable nucleus transforms into a more stable configuration, releasing energy in the process. This energy release adheres to the mass-energy equivalence principle, famously represented by Einstein's equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

This equation indicates that energy ($E$) is equal to mass ($m$) multiplied by the speed of light ($c$) squared. This relationship implies that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa.

During the radioactive decay process, the total mass of the decay products—comprising the daughter nucleus and the emitted particles—is less than that of the original parent nucleus. The 'missing' mass has been converted into energy, which is carried away by the emitted particles. This energy may manifest as the kinetic energy of the particles or as electromagnetic radiation. Importantly, the total energy before and after the decay remains constant, thereby conserving energy.

For instance, in alpha decay, a parent nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The mass of the parent nucleus exceeds the combined mass of the daughter nucleus and the alpha particle. The mass difference is transformed into energy, which is carried away by the alpha particle as kinetic energy. Similarly, in beta decay, a neutron within the parent nucleus transforms into a proton, resulting in the emission of an electron (beta particle) and an electron antineutrino. The total energy, which includes the mass-energy of the particles and their kinetic energy, remains constant before and after the decay.

In gamma decay, the parent nucleus exists in an excited state with excess energy. It releases this energy by emitting a gamma photon, transitioning to a lower energy state. The energy of the gamma photon corresponds to the energy difference between the initial and final states of the nucleus. Once again, the total energy is conserved.

In summary, energy conservation in radioactive decay is accomplished through the conversion of mass into energy, in accordance with the principle of mass-energy equivalence. The energy released during the decay process is carried away by the emitted particles or radiation, ensuring that the total energy remains constant throughout.
