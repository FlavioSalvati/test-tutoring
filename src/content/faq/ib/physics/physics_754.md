When two waves with different frequencies superimpose, they generate a complex wave pattern known as beat frequency.

The interaction of two waves with different frequencies exemplifies the phenomenon of superposition, a fundamental concept in wave mechanics. Superposition states that the total displacement of a medium at any given point is the vector sum of the displacements caused by each individual wave. In simpler terms, when two waves meet, they combine to form a new wave. Understanding this principle is crucial for comprehending how wave interactions operate.

When the frequencies of the two waves differ, their superposition leads to a more intricate wave pattern. This complexity arises because the peaks and troughs of the waves do not always align, resulting in varying degrees of constructive and destructive interference. Constructive interference occurs when the peaks of both waves coincide, leading to an increase in amplitude, while destructive interference happens when a peak from one wave aligns with a trough from the other, which may result in a smaller amplitude or even complete cancellation of the waves. The characteristics of these interferences can help elucidate why such phenomena take place.

The resulting interference patterns are referred to as "beats." The beat frequency, defined as the frequency of amplitude variations, is calculated as the absolute difference between the frequencies of the two waves. For instance, if two waves have frequencies of $100 \, \text{Hz}$ and $102 \, \text{Hz}$, the beat frequency would be $2 \, \text{Hz}$. This indicates that the amplitude of the resulting wave oscillates, increasing and decreasing twice per second. The formation of these patterns can be further explored through the study of wave propagation and interaction in space.

The phenomenon of beats is not merely theoretical; it has practical applications across various fields. For example, in music, beats play a vital role in tuning instruments. Musicians can produce two notes with slightly different frequencies and listen for the beats. By adjusting the frequencies until the beats disappear, they achieve a state of tuning. Similarly, in radio transmission, beats can be employed to modulate signals, facilitating the transmission of information.

In conclusion, the superposition of two waves with differing frequencies results in a complex wave pattern characterized by a beat frequency. This beat frequency, which equals the absolute difference between the two wave frequencies, arises from the varying constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Understanding wave interactions and the creation of beats is essential for grasping the intricate nature of wave interference and the resultant patterns that are observed.
