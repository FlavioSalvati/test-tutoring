The formula for gravitational potential energy is given by 

$$ 
U = mgh 
$$ 

where $m$ represents the mass of the object, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $h$ denotes the height above a reference point.

Gravitational potential energy is a specific type of potential energy associated with the gravitational field. This energy depends on an object's position relative to other masses within that field. Specifically, as either the height ($h$) or the mass ($m$) of an object increases, the gravitational potential energy ($U$) also increases. The formula $U = mgh$ is derived from the work required to lift an object against the force of gravity to a specified height.

In this equation:
- $U$ signifies the gravitational potential energy.
- $m$ stands for the mass of the object, which is measured in kilograms (kg).
- $g$ represents the gravitational acceleration, which on Earth is approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$.
- $h$ is the height above the ground, measured in meters (m).

It is essential to understand that gravitational potential energy is always measured relative to a chosen reference point. This means that you can define a point where the potential energy is considered to be zero. Typically, this reference point is set at ground level, where the height ($h$) is zero, resulting in a gravitational potential energy ($U$) of zero.

The concept of gravitational potential energy is fundamental in physics as it elucidates how energy is conserved within a system. For example, when an object is elevated, work is performed against the gravitational force. This work is transformed into gravitational potential energy, which can later be converted back into kinetic energy when the object is allowed to fall.

In conclusion, the formula 

$$ 
U = mgh 
$$ 

is a straightforward yet powerful tool in physics. It enables us to calculate the gravitational potential energy of an object, thereby enhancing our understanding of energy conservation and the interactions between various forms of energy.
