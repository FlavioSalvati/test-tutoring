The tension in a pendulum undergoing circular motion varies due to the combined effects of gravity and centripetal force.

In a pendulum performing circular motion, the tension in the string or rod changes as the pendulum swings back and forth. This variation arises from the interplay between gravitational force, which pulls the pendulum bob downward, and the centripetal force, which acts to keep the bob moving in a circular path. Understanding these forces is crucial for analyzing the circular motion of pendulums.

At the highest point of the swing, the tension reaches its maximum value. At this moment, the pendulum bob is momentarily at rest, meaning the tension in the string must balance the weight of the bob. Therefore, the tension is equal to the weight of the bob plus the centripetal force necessary to maintain circular motion. This concept is essential in physics to explain the variations in tension and motion.

As the pendulum swings downward and gains speed, the tension in the string decreases. This decrease occurs because the bob is moving faster, resulting in a greater centripetal force. However, as the bob approaches the vertical position, the component of gravitational force acting along the string and contributing to tension diminishes. The net effect of these factors is a reduction in tension, illustrating the dynamics of pendulum motion.

At the lowest point of the swing, the tension again reaches a maximum. Here, the bob is moving at its highest speed, which means the centripetal force is also at its peak. Additionally, the bob is positioned directly below the pivot point, where the entire weight of the bob acts along the string, contributing fully to the tension. Thus, the tension equals the weight of the bob plus the centripetal force required to sustain circular motion.

As the pendulum swings upward again, the tension decreases for similar reasons as before. The bob is slowing down, leading to a reduction in centripetal force. However, as the bob moves further from the vertical position, the component of weight acting along the string that contributes to tension increases. The overall effect is a decrease in tension. This entire process involves various transformations of energy, including kinetic and potential energy.

In summary, the tension in a pendulum's circular motion fluctuates due to the influences of gravity and centripetal force. At the extremes of the swing—both at the top and bottom—tension is highest because it must counteract the weight of the bob while also providing the necessary centripetal force. During the mid-swing, tension diminishes as the bob accelerates, which reduces the effective contribution of weight along the string. Ultimately, tension continuously adjusts to balance gravitational forces and maintain the pendulum's circular motion.
