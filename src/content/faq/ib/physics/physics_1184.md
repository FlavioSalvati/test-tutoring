You can experimentally validate Newton's law of gravitation through two primary methods: the Cavendish experiment and the observation of planetary motion.

The Cavendish experiment, conducted by Henry Cavendish in $1798$, serves as a classic approach to confirming Newton's law of gravitation. In this experiment, Cavendish employed a torsion balance, which consists of a horizontal bar suspended from a thin wire, to which two small lead spheres were attached at either end. By bringing two larger lead spheres close to the smaller ones, he was able to observe the minute twisting motion induced by the gravitational attraction between the spheres. By meticulously measuring this twist and understanding the properties of the torsion wire, Cavendish calculated the gravitational constant, $G$, thereby verifying Newton's law.

This experiment necessitates extreme precision and careful control of environmental conditions. Factors such as air currents, temperature fluctuations, and even minor vibrations can significantly affect the results. To mitigate these influences, the experiment is typically conducted in a sealed room equipped with temperature control and vibration isolation. Modern adaptations of the Cavendish experiment utilize laser interferometry, allowing for even more precise measurements of the minute twisting motion.

Another method to verify Newton's law of gravitation involves observing the motion of planets. According to this law, the force of gravity diminishes with the square of the distance between two objects. Consequently, planets that are located farther from the sun are expected to move more slowly in their orbits, a phenomenon that is indeed observed. For instance, Mars, which is approximately $1.5$ times farther from the sun than Earth, takes about $1.9$ Earth years to complete one orbit. This observation aligns with the predictions made by Newton's law of gravitation.

Furthermore, the law predicts that the gravitational force causes planets to move in elliptical orbits, with the sun located at one of the foci of the ellipse. This prediction has been substantiated through centuries of meticulous astronomical observations. The precise shapes and timings of planetary orbits provide compelling evidence in support of Newton's law of gravitation.

In summary, both the Cavendish experiment and the observation of planetary motion serve as robust experimental validations of Newton's law of gravitation. These experiments illustrate the law's predictions regarding the strength of gravity and the resultant motion of objects influenced by it.
