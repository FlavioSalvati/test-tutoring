The magnitude of a vector is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

To elaborate, a vector is a quantity that possesses both magnitude (or size) and direction. The magnitude of a vector can be interpreted as its 'length' in a specified direction. For instance, consider a vector that represents a displacement of $3$ units to the east and $4$ units to the north. The magnitude of this vector reflects the straight-line distance from the starting point to the endpoint.

To determine the magnitude of a vector, one must identify its components. These components represent the 'parts' of the vector along each axis. In two-dimensional space, a vector consists of two components: one along the $x$-axis (horizontal) and one along the $y$-axis (vertical). In three-dimensional space, a vector includes three components: one along the $x$-axis, one along the $y$-axis, and one along the $z$-axis (depth).

The formula for calculating the magnitude of a vector in two dimensions is given by 

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

where $x$ and $y$ are the components of the vector. This expression is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

For a vector in three dimensions, the formula extends to 

$$
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$

This is an application of the Pythagorean theorem in three-dimensional space.

In both scenarios, you square each component of the vector, sum these squares, and then take the square root of the resulting sum. This process yields the magnitude of the vector, which is always a non-negative number (either positive or zero). It is important to note that the magnitude of a vector indicates its 'length' but does not provide information about its direction. To fully characterize a vector, one must specify both its magnitude and its direction.
