Larger telescopes provide better resolution because they have a greater light-gathering capacity and a higher resolving power.

In more detail, the resolution of a telescope is determined by its ability to distinguish between two close objects in the sky. This ability is directly related to the diameter of the telescope's objective lens or mirror, also known as its aperture. The larger the aperture, the more light the telescope can gather, which improves its ability to see faint objects and provides a clearer, more detailed image.

The resolving power of a telescope, which is its ability to reveal fine detail, is inversely proportional to the diameter of its aperture. This means that as the aperture increases, the resolving power also increases, allowing the telescope to distinguish smaller and smaller details. This is why larger telescopes can provide more detailed images than smaller ones.

Furthermore, larger telescopes are less affected by the Earth's atmosphere, which can distort the light from celestial objects and reduce the quality of the image. This is because the larger the telescope, the more it can 'average out' these distortions over its larger aperture, resulting in a clearer image.

However, it's important to note that while larger telescopes do provide better resolution, they also require more precise engineering and are more difficult to handle and maintain. They are also more expensive and require a larger, more stable mounting system. Therefore, while larger telescopes do provide better resolution, they are not always the most practical choice for amateur astronomers or for certain types of astronomical research.

In conclusion, the size of a telescope's aperture plays a crucial role in its resolution. Larger telescopes, with their greater light-gathering capacity and higher resolving power, can provide more detailed and clearer images of celestial objects. However, their size and complexity also bring challenges in terms of cost, handling, and maintenance.
