The uncertainty associated with stopwatch measurements can be estimated by taking into account the reaction time of the individual operating the stopwatch.

When using a stopwatch, various factors can contribute to uncertainty in your measurements. The most significant factor is typically your reaction time—the duration it takes for you to start and stop the stopwatch in response to the event being timed.

Human reaction times can vary widely, but they generally fall within the range of $0.1$ to $0.3$ seconds. Therefore, when timing an event with a stopwatch, it is reasonable to consider your measurement to have an uncertainty of at least $\pm 0.2$ seconds. This is a rough estimate; the actual uncertainty may be higher or lower depending on the individual's specific reaction time.

Another important factor to consider is the precision of the stopwatch itself. Most digital stopwatches provide time readings to the nearest hundredth of a second; however, this does not necessarily imply that they are accurate to that level. You should consult the manufacturer's specifications to obtain information regarding the stopwatch's accuracy, which can help you estimate the uncertainty.

If you perform multiple measurements of the same event, you can calculate the standard deviation of those measurements to gain a better understanding of the uncertainty involved. The standard deviation quantifies the spread of your measurements—greater spread indicates higher uncertainty.

In addition to the aforementioned factors, there may be other sources of uncertainty specific to the experiment you are conducting. For example, if you are timing a falling object, uncertainties may arise from the height from which the object is dropped or the precise moment the object is released.

To summarize, the primary source of uncertainty when using a stopwatch is your reaction time, typically estimated at around $\pm 0.2$ seconds. Both the precision of the stopwatch and your reaction speed influence the overall accuracy. Calculating the standard deviation of multiple measurements can provide further insight into uncertainty. Always verify the stopwatch's accuracy and consider any experiment-specific uncertainties, such as the timing of events or the positioning of objects.
