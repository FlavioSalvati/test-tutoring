The primary non-renewable energy sources include coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy.

As the term implies, non-renewable energy sources are those that cannot be replenished once depleted. These resources are finite and have formed over millions of years from the remains of ancient plants and animals. The four principal types of non-renewable energy are coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy.

Coal is a sedimentary rock that can appear black or brownish-black and is predominantly composed of carbon, along with various other elements such as hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. It serves as the largest source of energy for electricity generation globally. Coal is extracted from the earth through both underground and surface mining methods.

Oil, commonly referred to as petroleum, is a naturally occurring liquid found in rock formations. It is derived from the remains of ancient marine organisms. Oil has diverse applications, including heating homes, fueling vehicles, and producing plastics. Extraction occurs through drilling processes.

Natural gas, often simply known as gas, is a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbons, primarily consisting of methane. It is utilized for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. Like oil, natural gas is extracted through drilling, frequently in conjunction with oil extraction.

Nuclear energy is produced during nuclear reactions or radioactive decay. The predominant method for generating nuclear power involves nuclear reactors that harness heat from nuclear fission. The fuel used in these reactors, uranium, is also a non-renewable resource.

While these non-renewable energy sources have significantly contributed to the development and advancement of human civilization, their use has resulted in considerable environmental challenges. These issues include air pollution, climate change, and the potential for catastrophic incidents such as oil spills or nuclear accidents. Additionally, given the finite nature of these resources, there is an urgent need to explore and implement renewable energy sources to ensure a sustainable future.
