Polarisation has a minimal effect on the pattern produced by single-slit diffraction.

In single-slit diffraction, light waves pass through a narrow slit and subsequently spread out, resulting in a series of light and dark fringes on a screen. This phenomenon arises from the wave nature of light and the principle of superposition, where waves interfere both constructively and destructively to create the observed pattern. Notably, the orientation of the electric field—referred to as the polarisation of light—has little impact on this diffraction pattern.

Polarisation describes the direction in which the electric field of a light wave oscillates. In the case of unpolarised light, the electric field oscillates in all directions that are perpendicular to the direction of propagation. When light is polarised, the electric field oscillates in a specific direction, which can be achieved using a polarising filter that permits only light waves oscillating in that particular direction to pass through.

Despite polarisation affecting the intensity of light, it does not significantly alter the diffraction pattern observed in single-slit experiments. The diffraction pattern is predominantly governed by the wavelength of the light, denoted as $\lambda$, and the width of the slit, represented as $d$. This relationship can be expressed by the formula:

$$
\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin \theta
$$

Here, $\theta$ is the angle relative to the central maximum. Notably, the polarisation of light does not appear in this equation, indicating that it does not play a crucial role in defining the diffraction pattern.

However, the polarisation of light does influence the intensity of the light that passes through the slit. When the light is polarised parallel to the slit, the intensity is maximised. Conversely, if the light is polarised perpendicular to the slit, the intensity is minimised. It is important to note that while this variation in intensity exists, it does not change the overall diffraction pattern; it merely affects the brightness of the fringes.

In summary, although polarisation can influence the intensity of light in single-slit diffraction, it does not significantly affect the overall diffraction pattern. The pattern itself is primarily determined by the wavelength of the light and the width of the slit.
