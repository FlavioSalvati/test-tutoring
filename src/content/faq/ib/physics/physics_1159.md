Weight is defined as the force of gravity acting on an object, whereas mass refers to the quantity of matter contained within that object.

Although weight and mass are fundamental concepts in physics, they are frequently misunderstood. Mass is a scalar quantity, which means it possesses only magnitude and lacks direction. It quantifies the amount of matter in an object and remains constant, regardless of the object's location in the universe. For instance, an apple with a mass of $1\, \text{kg}$ will maintain this mass whether it is on Earth, the Moon, or floating in space.

In contrast, weight is a vector quantity, indicating that it has both magnitude and direction. Weight measures the gravitational force acting on an object, and it can change depending on the object's position within a gravitational field. For example, the same $1\, \text{kg}$ apple would have a weight of approximately $9.8\, \text{N}$ (newtons) when on Earth, but its weight would decrease to about $1.6\, \text{N}$ on the Moon due to the Moon's weaker gravitational pull.

The relationship between weight and mass is articulated by the equation:

$$
W = mg
$$

where $W$ represents weight, $m$ symbolizes mass, and $g$ denotes the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, the value of $g$ is approximately $9.8\, \text{m/s}^2$, although this value may slightly vary depending on geographic location.

It is essential to recognize that mass is consistently measured in kilograms ($\text{kg}$), while weight is measured in newtons ($\text{N}$) within the International System of Units (SI). This distinction arises because weight is classified as a force, and the SI unit of force is the newton.

In summary, while mass and weight are interconnected, they are not identical. Mass represents the quantity of matter in an object and remains constant, while weight quantifies the gravitational force acting on an object and can vary depending on its location.
