To convert from kilometres per hour (km/h) to metres per second (m/s), you can simply multiply the speed by $\frac{5}{18}$.

In physics, converting between different units of measurement is often necessary. This is due to the fact that various contexts require different units, making it essential to be able to translate between them. For instance, speed can be expressed in either kilometres per hour (km/h) or metres per second (m/s). While these two units are related, they are not interchangeable.

To convert from km/h to m/s, it is important to understand the relationships between kilometres and metres, as well as between hours and seconds. Specifically, there are $1,000$ metres in a kilometre and $3,600$ seconds in an hour. As a result, to convert from km/h to m/s, you can divide by $3.6$. This conversion arises because there are $3.6$ times as many seconds in an hour as there are metres in a kilometre.

However, there is a more straightforward method to remember this conversion. By multiplying the speed in km/h by $\frac{5}{18}$, you will directly obtain the speed in m/s. This works because $\frac{5}{18}$ is approximately equal to $\frac{1}{3.6}$. 

For example, if a car is travelling at $90$ km/h, you can calculate its speed in m/s by multiplying $90$ by $\frac{5}{18}$, which results in $25$ m/s.
