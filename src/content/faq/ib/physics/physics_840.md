The phase relationship in wave interference is fundamentally influenced by the path difference and the wavelength of the waves involved.

Wave interference occurs when two or more waves interact, resulting in a new wave that differs from the individual waves. This interaction can lead to either constructive or destructive interference, depending on the phase relationship between the waves. The phase relationship refers to the difference in the positions of the peaks and troughs of the waves at a specific point in space and time.

Two critical factors determine the phase relationship: the path difference and the wavelength of the waves. The path difference is the difference in distance traveled by the two waves from their source to the point of interference. If the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, the waves will arrive in phase, leading to constructive interference. In this case, the resultant wave will exhibit a greater amplitude. Conversely, if the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength, the waves will arrive out of phase, resulting in destructive interference. This can produce a wave with reduced amplitude or even complete cancellation.

The wavelength of the waves is also a crucial factor. Waves with shorter wavelengths have more frequent peaks and troughs, which means the phase relationship can vary more rapidly over a given distance. This can lead to more intricate patterns of interference.

In summary, the phase relationship in wave interference—and consequently the resulting interference pattern—is determined by both the path difference and the wavelength of the interfering waves. Understanding these concepts is essential for predicting and analyzing wave behavior in various contexts, including light, sound, and ocean waves.
