The strong nuclear force is the fundamental interaction that binds protons and neutrons together within an atomic nucleus, ensuring stability against the repulsive electromagnetic forces that act on protons.

Often referred to as the strong interaction, this force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is critical for maintaining the integrity of atomic nuclei, as it effectively counterbalances the electromagnetic force, which would otherwise lead to the repulsion of positively charged protons, ultimately destabilizing and breaking apart the nucleus.

Remarkably, the strong nuclear force is approximately $100$ times stronger than the electromagnetic force. However, it operates over an extremely short range, being effective only within the confines of the atomic nucleus, typically up to distances of about $1$ femtometre ($1 \, \text{fm} = 10^{-15} \, \text{metres}$). Beyond this short range, the strength of the strong force diminishes rapidly, becoming negligible and thus having no influence on the structure of the atom outside the nucleus.

In addition to binding protons and neutrons, the strong nuclear force is responsible for the binding energy that keeps the nucleus intact. This binding energy corresponds to the mass defect of the nucleus, which is defined as the difference between the actual mass of the nucleus and the total mass of its individual constituent protons and neutrons. According to Einstein's famous equation, $$E=mc^2$$, where $E$ represents energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light, this mass defect is converted into energy. This energy is what ensures the stability of the nucleus, preventing it from disintegrating.

In conclusion, the strong nuclear force is vital for the stability of atomic nuclei. It effectively binds protons and neutrons together, counteracts the repulsive forces between protons, and provides the necessary binding energy to maintain nuclear integrity. Without the strong nuclear force, atomic nuclei would be unstable, and the existence of atoms—along with the matter we encounter in our everyday lives—would not be possible.
