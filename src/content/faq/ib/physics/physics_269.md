Concerns surrounding peat extraction arise primarily from its detrimental environmental impact, which includes habitat destruction and carbon emissions.

Peatlands, a specific type of wetland found in nearly every country on Earth, play a vital role in the global ecosystem. They host a diverse array of wildlife, many of which are rare or endangered. The process of peat extraction leads to the destruction of these habitats, resulting in a significant loss of biodiversity. Additionally, peatlands are frequently drained prior to extraction, which alters the hydrology of the surrounding areas. This alteration can affect other ecosystems and may increase the risk of flooding.

Moreover, peatlands are crucial for climate regulation. They are among the most effective carbon sinks on the planet, storing more carbon than all other vegetation types combined. When peat is extracted, it is often burned for fuel or used in horticulture, both of which release the stored carbon back into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to global warming.

The extraction process itself can further exacerbate the release of greenhouse gases. When peatlands are drained, the water table drops, exposing the peat to air. This exposure leads to decomposition, releasing not only carbon dioxide but also methane, which is over $20$ times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its global warming potential.

In addition to environmental concerns, peat extraction can have significant social implications. In many regions, peatlands are vital for local communities, providing essential resources such as fuel, food, and building materials. The destruction of these ecosystems can therefore have profound effects on local livelihoods.

In conclusion, while peat extraction may offer short-term economic gains, it comes with substantial environmental and social costs. These costs include habitat destruction, the release of greenhouse gases, and adverse effects on local communities. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for the sustainable management of peatlands, which includes halting peat extraction altogether.
