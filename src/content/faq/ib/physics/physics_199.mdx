The electric field generated by an electric dipole can be calculated using specific formulas for different positions relative to the dipole. In particular, along the axial line, the electric field $E$ is given by the formula:

$$
E = k \cdot \frac{2p}{r^3}
$$

While on the equatorial line, the electric field is expressed as:

$$
E = k \cdot \frac{p}{r^3}
$$

To elaborate, an electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance. The electric field produced by a dipole is non-uniform and varies based on the observation point. The two primary positions to consider are the axial line (the line that extends through both charges) and the equatorial line (the line that is perpendicular to the axial line and intersects the midpoint between the charges).

For the axial line, the electric field $E$ is defined by:

$$
E = k \cdot \frac{2p}{r^3}
$$

In this formula, $k$ represents Coulomb's constant, approximately $9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2$, $p$ is the dipole moment (which is the product of the charge and the distance separating the charges), and $r$ is the distance from the center of the dipole. This equation indicates that the electric field diminishes with the cube of the distance from the dipole. Additionally, if the dipole moment is positive, the electric field is directed away from the dipole.

For the equatorial line, the electric field $E$ can be expressed as:

$$
E = k \cdot \frac{p}{r^3}
$$

Similar to the axial case, this formula shows that the electric field decreases with the cube of the distance from the dipole. However, in this case, if the dipole moment is positive, the electric field is directed toward the dipole.

It is crucial to note that these formulas are approximations that hold true when the distance $r$ is significantly larger than the separation distance between the charges. They provide accurate estimates of the electric field when the observation point is far from the dipole, but their accuracy diminishes as one moves closer to the individual charges.
