The use of coal raises significant environmental concerns, including air pollution, climate change, water contamination, and habitat destruction.

Coal is a fossil fuel that, upon combustion, releases a variety of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. These pollutants include sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$), nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$), particulate matter, and heavy metals such as mercury. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can react with other atmospheric substances to form acid rain, which poses a threat to forests and aquatic ecosystems. Particulate matter can lead to respiratory issues in both humans and animals. Moreover, heavy metals, once emitted, can accumulate in the environment and enter the food chain, posing serious risks to human and animal health.

A major concern associated with coal is its significant contribution to climate change. Coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) emissions, a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. In fact, the combustion of coal for electricity and heating is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, coal combustion releases methane ($\text{CH}_4$), another potent greenhouse gas.

The processes involved in coal mining and processing also have substantial impacts on water resources. Coal mining can lead to the release of pollutants into nearby water bodies, adversely affecting water quality and aquatic life. Furthermore, washing coal to eliminate impurities generates large volumes of wastewater, which can contaminate local water supplies if not managed appropriately.

Lastly, coal mining often results in habitat destruction. Surface mining, in particular, entails the removal of topsoil and rock layers that cover coal seams, which can devastate local ecosystems and wildlife habitats. Underground mining can also cause land subsidence, leading to the collapse of land surfaces and further damage to ecosystems.

In conclusion, the use of coal presents considerable environmental challenges, including air and water pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction. Therefore, it is essential to seek cleaner and more sustainable energy sources to replace coal.
