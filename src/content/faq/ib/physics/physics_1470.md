In Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), the concept of equilibrium is vital; it represents the midpoint where the restoring force acting on the object is zero.

Equilibrium in the context of SHM is defined as the position at which the net force on the object is zero. This position typically corresponds to the midpoint of the oscillation, where the object is neither compressed nor stretched. Essentially, it is the point at which the object would remain if it were undisturbed.

The significance of equilibrium in SHM is closely linked to the concept of restoring force. The restoring force is the force that acts to return the object to its equilibrium position whenever it is displaced. This force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and acts in the opposite direction. This relationship is encapsulated in Hooke's Law, which states that the restoring force $F$ exerted by a spring is given by:

$$
F = -k x
$$

where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

During SHM, the object oscillates around the equilibrium position. When the object is at this position, its velocity is at its maximum, and the acceleration is zero, as there is no restoring force acting upon it. As the object moves away from the equilibrium position, the restoring force increases, leading to a deceleration until it reaches the maximum displacement. At this point, the velocity becomes zero while the acceleration reaches its maximum. Subsequently, the restoring force then accelerates the object back toward the equilibrium position, completing one full cycle of motion.

The equilibrium position also plays a crucial role in determining the potential energy of the system in SHM. The potential energy is minimized at the equilibrium position, as the object experiences neither compression nor extension. As the object moves away from equilibrium, the potential energy increases, peaking at maximum displacement.

In summary, the equilibrium position in SHM is the point at which the restoring force is zero. It serves as the reference point for the motion, the restoring force, and the potential energy within the system.
