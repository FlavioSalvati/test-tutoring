The resultant force acting on an object is calculated by summing all the individual forces that are exerted on it.

To elaborate, the process of determining the resultant force involves several key steps. First, you must identify all the forces acting on the object. Common forces include gravitational force, frictional force, tension, normal force, and any externally applied forces. Each of these forces has both a magnitude (indicating its strength) and a direction (indicating the direction in which it acts).

Once you have identified all the relevant forces, the next step is to represent these forces as vectors. A vector is defined as a quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction. In physics, vectors are often illustrated using arrows, where the length of the arrow signifies the magnitude of the force, and the arrow's direction indicates the orientation of the force.

To find the resultant force, you sum all the force vectors. This is achieved using the 'head-to-tail' method: you place the tail of one vector at the head of the previous vector, and then draw a new vector from the starting point of the first vector to the endpoint of the last vector. If the forces are collinear (acting along the same line), you can simply add or subtract their magnitudes based on their directions.

In cases where the forces do not act along the same line, you will need to use trigonometry to resolve each force into its horizontal and vertical components. After resolving all forces, you can compute the total horizontal force by summing all the horizontal components and the total vertical force by summing all the vertical components. The resultant force is then determined by combining these total horizontal and vertical forces.

It's important to note that the resultant force is a single force that has the same effect on the object as the combination of all individual forces. If the resultant force equals zero, the object will either stay at rest or continue moving with a constant velocity. Conversely, if the resultant force is non-zero, the object will accelerate in the direction of the resultant force.
