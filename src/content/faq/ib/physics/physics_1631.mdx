Blue light provides superior resolution compared to red light due to its shorter wavelength, enabling more precise imaging.

In the field of physics, the resolution of optical imaging systems—such as microscopes, telescopes, and cameras—is often constrained by the phenomenon known as diffraction. This limitation is commonly referred to as the diffraction limit. The diffraction limit is directly influenced by the wavelength of the light utilized; specifically, shorter wavelengths correspond to smaller diffraction limits, which in turn allow for higher potential resolution.

Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light. In the visible spectrum, blue light typically has a wavelength ranging from approximately $450$ to $495$ nanometers, whereas red light has a wavelength between about $620$ and $750$ nanometers. This distinction means that when blue light is employed in an optical system, it can resolve finer details compared to red light.

This principle is applied in various scientific and technological contexts. For example, in microscopy, blue light is used to achieve higher-resolution imaging. Similarly, in astronomy, telescopes that operate in the blue or ultraviolet regions of the spectrum can potentially capture finer details in images of stars and galaxies.

However, it is crucial to recognize that while blue light can enhance resolution due to its shorter wavelength, it is also more prone to scattering than red light—a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. This scattering can lead to images appearing blurred or hazy, particularly in situations where light travels through significant atmospheric layers or other scattering media. Consequently, although blue light has the potential for improved resolution, the optimal wavelength for imaging can vary based on numerous factors, including the specific characteristics of the imaging system and the properties of the medium through which the light travels.
