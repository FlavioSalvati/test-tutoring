Gravity plays a vital role in the formation of planets by drawing together dust and gas to create larger celestial bodies.

In the early stages of a solar system's development, a nebula—a vast cloud composed of gas and dust—fills the expanse of space. Gravity, one of the fundamental forces of nature, begins to exert its influence on this nebula. The particles within the nebula are drawn to one another due to gravitational attraction, causing them to clump together and eventually form larger bodies. This phenomenon is known as accretion.

As these bodies increase in size, their gravitational pull also intensifies, allowing them to attract even more particles and facilitating further growth. Over time, these accumulating masses can become substantial enough to form planetesimals, which are the building blocks of planets. The formation of planetesimals is predominantly driven by gravity; without it, the particles within the nebula would remain dispersed and would not coalesce into larger structures.

Additionally, gravity plays a critical role in determining the shape of planets. As a planetesimal continues to grow, its gravitational force can cause it to take on a spherical shape. This occurs because gravity pulls uniformly from all directions, prompting the material to distribute itself evenly and form a sphere. This is why the majority of planets, including Earth, exhibit a spherical shape.

Moreover, gravity is essential for the formation of planetary systems. The gravitational pull of a central star, such as our Sun, is what keeps the planets in their orbits. Without this gravitational force, the planets would not be held in their trajectories and would drift away into the vastness of space.

In summary, gravity is a fundamental force in the formation of planets. It drives the process of accretion, shapes celestial bodies, and maintains the structure of planetary systems. Without gravity, the universe as we understand it would not exist.
