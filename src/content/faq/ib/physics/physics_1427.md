Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, also referred to as cogeneration plants, are designed to generate both electricity and useful thermal energy within a single, integrated system. This dual production approach enhances overall efficiency significantly.

CHP plants utilize a single energy source to produce both heat and power, minimizing waste and maximizing output. By capturing the heat that would otherwise be lost during electricity generation, these plants can use it for various heating or cooling applications. The energy source for CHP systems can include a wide range of fuels, such as natural gas, coal, biomass, or even solar energy.

The operation of a CHP plant begins with the combustion of fuel, which generates electricity through either a gas turbine or a reciprocating engine. The heat produced during this combustion process is then captured and utilized to produce steam. This steam can serve multiple purposes: it can be used for industrial processes or for heating and cooling buildings. Additionally, in some configurations, the steam can be employed to drive a steam turbine, thereby generating additional electricity and further enhancing the plant's efficiency.

One of the primary advantages of CHP plants is their remarkable efficiency. Traditional power plants typically convert only about $30\%-35\%$ of the energy contained in the fuel into usable electricity, with the remainder lost as heat. In contrast, CHP plants can achieve efficiencies of $80\%-90\%$ by utilizing the heat that would otherwise be discarded.

Another notable benefit of CHP plants is their flexibility. They can be tailored to meet the specific energy demands of a given site and can be scaled up or down according to the requirements for heat and power. Furthermore, many CHP systems can operate independently from the electrical grid, providing a dependable energy source during grid outages.

Despite their many advantages, CHP plants also present certain challenges. They tend to be more complex and expensive to construct and maintain than traditional power plants. Moreover, they require a consistent demand for both heat and power to function optimally, which may not always be feasible. Nevertheless, the high efficiency and adaptability of CHP plants make them an appealing choice for sustainable energy production.
