Radioactivity is fundamentally associated with atomic nuclei, as it refers to the spontaneous disintegration of unstable atomic nuclei.

Also known as radioactive decay, radioactivity is a process in which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. This phenomenon is crucial to understanding the behavior of atomic nuclei and the transformations they undergo. The atomic nucleus is a compact, dense region at the center of an atom, composed of protons and neutrons. The stability of a nucleus is determined by the balance between the number of protons and neutrons it contains; when this balance is disrupted, the nucleus becomes unstable and may undergo radioactive decay.

Radioactive decay can result in the emission of different types of radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays, each possessing distinct properties and effects. Alpha particles are essentially helium nuclei, consisting of two protons and two neutrons, and they are the least penetrating type of radiation. In contrast, beta particles are high-energy electrons or positrons, while gamma rays are high-energy photons; both of these forms of radiation are more penetrating than alpha particles.

The rate at which a radioactive substance decays is quantified by its half-life, defined as the time required for half of the atoms in a sample to decay. This half-life is a constant characteristic specific to each radioactive isotope. For instance, the half-life of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope commonly used in archaeological and geological dating, is approximately $5,730$ years.

The exploration of radioactivity has led to significant advancements in various fields, including medicine, archaeology, and energy production. For example, radioactive isotopes play a vital role in medical imaging and cancer treatment, while the heat generated from natural radioactive decay is harnessed in nuclear power plants to produce electricity.

In summary, radioactivity is a phenomenon closely linked to the behavior and properties of atomic nuclei. It involves the spontaneous disintegration of unstable atomic nuclei, resulting in the emission of radiation in the form of alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. The decay rate of these substances is measured in terms of their half-life.
