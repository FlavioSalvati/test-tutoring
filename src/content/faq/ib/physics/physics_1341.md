Solar power generates electricity by converting sunlight into electrical energy through the use of photovoltaic cells.

Solar power, often referred to as solar energy, is the process of transforming sunlight into electricity. This transformation is achieved with photovoltaic cells, commonly known as solar cells. These cells are constructed from materials that exhibit the "photovoltaic effect," a phenomenon where electric current or voltage is produced when the material is exposed to light.

The photovoltaic effect, first discovered by French physicist Edmond Becquerel in $1839$, is a physical and chemical process that generates voltage or electric current in a material when it absorbs light. When sunlight strikes the solar cells, it dislodges electrons from their atoms. If conductors are connected to the positive and negative terminals of the cell, it creates an electrical circuit. The flow of these electrons through the circuit generates electricity. This conversion of light (photons) into electricity (voltage) is known as the photovoltaic effect.

Solar cells are usually assembled into larger units called solar panels. These panels can be installed on rooftops, on the ground, or even on floating platforms in bodies of water. The amount of electricity generated by these panels increases with the intensity of sunlight striking the cells. Consequently, the effectiveness of solar power generation is influenced by several factors, including sunlight intensity, the angle of sunlight incidence, and the efficiency of the solar cells themselves.

The electricity produced by solar power is in the form of direct current (DC). However, most residential and commercial appliances operate on alternating current (AC). To accommodate this, the DC electricity is converted into AC electricity using an inverter. The resulting AC electricity can be used to power various electrical devices, and any surplus energy can be fed back into the electrical grid.

Solar power is a renewable and environmentally friendly energy source. It produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation and requires minimal maintenance once the solar panels are installed. As a result, solar power is becoming an increasingly popular choice for sustainable energy generation.
