The nuclear reactions occurring within the Sun are primarily driven by the fusion of hydrogen atoms, which ultimately form helium.

The Sun, much like other stars, is a colossal sphere composed of hot, glowing gas. Approximately 75% of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen. Its immense gravitational force generates extreme pressure and temperatures at the core, exceeding $15$ million degrees Celsius. These conditions create an ideal environment for nuclear fusion, the fundamental process that powers the Sun's energy output.

In the Sun, nuclear fusion predominantly occurs through the proton-proton chain reaction, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium. This process initiates when two protons collide and fuse, resulting in the formation of a deuterium atom (a heavier isotope of hydrogen), a positron (a particle of antimatter), and a neutrino. The newly formed deuterium atom subsequently collides with another proton, producing a helium-3 atom while emitting a gamma-ray photon. When two helium-3 atoms collide, they fuse to create a helium-4 atom, releasing two protons in the process. This entire sequence of reactions releases an extraordinary amount of energy, which we perceive as sunlight.

The energy generated by nuclear fusion in the Sun's core takes an extensive amount of time to reach the surface. The photons produced during fusion undergo numerous interactions as they move through the Sun, a phenomenon known as the 'random walk'. It can take a photon up to $170,000$ years to finally escape the Sun's interior and reach the surface. Once a photon does escape, it travels at the speed of light, reaching Earth in just over $8$ minutes.

The Sun has been converting hydrogen into helium for approximately $4.6$ billion years, and it is estimated that it has enough hydrogen to continue this process for another $5$ billion years. After this period, the Sun will begin to fuse helium, leading to its expansion into a red giant. Eventually, it will shed its outer layers, leaving behind a white dwarfâ€”a typical life cycle for a star like our Sun.
