Simple harmonic motion (SHM) can be visually represented through a sine or cosine wave on a displacement-time graph.

To elaborate, SHM is a form of periodic motion characterized by a restoring force that is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position. The key characteristics of SHM include amplitude, frequency, and phase. These properties can be graphically depicted using sine or cosine waves, which mathematically describe the behavior of SHM.

In this graph, the horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis indicates displacement from the equilibrium position. The amplitude of the motion, which is the maximum displacement from equilibrium, corresponds to the peak values of the wave on the graph. The frequency of the motion, defined as the number of complete cycles per unit of time, is represented by the distance between successive peaks (or troughs) on the graph. The phase of the motion, which indicates the state of the motion at time zero, is reflected by the position of the wave on the graph at that initial time.

To create the graph, one must first determine the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the motion. Next, a sine or cosine wave is plotted based on these characteristics. For instance, if the motion has an amplitude of $A$, a frequency of $f$, and a phase of $\phi$, the corresponding function to plot would be either:

$$
A \sin(2\pi ft + \phi)
$$

or 

$$
A \cos(2\pi ft + \phi).
$$

It's essential to choose between the sine and cosine functions based on the phase of the motion. If the motion begins at the equilibrium position and moves in the positive direction, the sine function is appropriate. Conversely, if the motion starts at a peak (or trough) and moves towards the equilibrium position, the cosine function should be used.
