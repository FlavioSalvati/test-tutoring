The frequency of a siren changes as it moves past you, a phenomenon known as the Doppler effect.

The Doppler effect is a physical principle that describes how the frequency of a wave varies depending on the relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. This concept is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who introduced it in the 19th century. When a sound source, such as a siren, approaches an observer, the sound waves are compressed, resulting in a higher frequency and, consequently, a higher pitch. In contrast, when the source moves away from the observer, the waves are stretched, leading to a lower frequency and a lower pitch.

To illustrate this, imagine you are standing on the side of a road as an ambulance approaches with its siren active. As the ambulance gets closer, the sound waves emitted by the siren are compressed due to its forward motion towards you. This compression causes an increase in frequency, which your ears interpret as a higher pitch. This is why the siren sounds louder and higher in pitch as the ambulance approaches.

Once the ambulance passes by and begins to move away from you, the situation changes. The sound waves from the siren are now stretched because the ambulance is retreating. This stretching results in a decrease in frequency, which your ears perceive as a lower pitch. As a result, the siren seems quieter and lower in pitch as the ambulance continues to move away.

This variation in frequency caused by the relative motion of the source and the observer is what we refer to as the Doppler effect. While commonly associated with sound waves, this effect also applies to other types of waves, such as light and radio waves. For example, astronomers utilize the Doppler effect to determine whether a star or galaxy is moving towards or away from Earth by analyzing the changes in frequency of the light emitted by these celestial objects.

In conclusion, the alteration in frequency of a siren as it passes by serves as a practical demonstration of the Doppler effect. This fundamental concept in wave physics has extensive applications, ranging from medical imaging techniques to astronomical observations.
