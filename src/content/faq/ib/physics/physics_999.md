The capacity of a battery is quantified in milliampere-hours (mAh) or ampere-hours (Ah), which indicates the total amount of electric charge it can supply.

Battery capacity reflects the quantity of electric charge a battery can deliver at a specific voltage. It is most commonly expressed in units of milliampere-hours ($mAh$) or ampere-hours ($Ah$). Essentially, this measurement informs us about the current a battery can provide over a designated period. For example, a battery rated at $1000 \, mAh$ is capable of delivering a current of $1000 \, mA$ (or $1 \, A$) for one hour, $500 \, mA$ for two hours, $2000 \, mA$ for half an hour, and so forth.

The capacity of a battery is influenced by its chemical composition and physical dimensions. Different battery types, such as alkaline, lithium-ion, and nickel-cadmium, possess varying energy densities. This means that they can store different amounts of energy relative to their volume or weight. Generally, larger batteries contain more active material to engage in the chemical reactions that generate electric charge, leading to a higher capacity.

However, it is crucial to recognize that the actual energy output of a battery can be affected by several factors. These include the discharge rate (the speed at which current is drawn), the required voltage, and the operating temperature. For instance, drawing current at a higher rate may lead to a decrease in the battery's capacity due to increased internal resistance. Additionally, operating a battery at lower temperatures can reduce its capacity, as the chemical reactions responsible for electric generation become less efficient in cooler conditions.

Furthermore, a battery's capacity may diminish over time as a result of repeated charge and discharge cycles, a phenomenon known as cycle life. Each time a battery undergoes a charge-discharge cycle, its capacity is slightly reduced, which is why rechargeable batteries eventually need replacement.

In summary, the capacity of a battery measures the amount of electric charge it can supply, typically expressed in milliampere-hours ($mAh$) or ampere-hours ($Ah$). It is influenced by the battery's chemical makeup and size, and can be affected by factors such as discharge rate, operating conditions, and the total number of charge-discharge cycles.
