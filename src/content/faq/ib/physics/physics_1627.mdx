The Rayleigh criterion for resolution serves as a key measure that defines the minimum distance required for distinguishing between two light sources.

This criterion is a fundamental principle in physics, particularly within the field of optics. Established by the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, it quantifies the ability of an optical system to resolve fine details in the observed object. According to the Rayleigh criterion, two light sources are considered to be just resolved when the center of the diffraction pattern from one source aligns directly with the first minimum of the diffraction pattern from the other.

The resolution of optical systems, such as microscopes or telescopes, is inherently limited by the wave nature of light. When light from two distinct points enters an optical system, it undergoes diffraction, resulting in overlapping diffraction patterns. If this overlap is excessive, the two points become indistinguishable and are described as unresolved. The Rayleigh criterion provides a method to calculate the minimum separation required for the two points to be resolved, depending on the wavelength of the light and the diameter of the aperture through which the light is entering.

The Rayleigh criterion is mathematically expressed by the formula:

$$
\theta = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{D}
$$

where:
- $\theta$ represents the minimum angular separation between two points that can be resolved,
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light, and
- $D$ is the diameter of the aperture.

This formula illustrates that resolution improves—meaning the minimum resolvable angle decreases—when the wavelength of light is reduced or when the aperture size is increased.

In practical applications, the Rayleigh criterion holds significant importance across various scientific and technological fields. For instance, it determines the smallest details observable in microscopic images and the finest features discernible in astronomical observations. Therefore, understanding and applying the Rayleigh criterion is essential for the effective design and utilization of optical instruments.
