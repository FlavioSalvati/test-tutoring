In the presence of dielectric materials, electric fields are diminished due to the phenomenon of polarization.

When an electric field is applied to a dielectric, the internal positive and negative charges of the material shift in opposite directions. This displacement generates an induced electric field within the dielectric that opposes the applied field, a process referred to as polarization. As a result, the overall electric field within the dielectric is reduced.

The extent of polarization, and consequently the reduction in the electric field, is influenced by the characteristics of the dielectric material. This relationship is quantified by a property known as relative permittivity, or dielectric constant, denoted as $\varepsilon_r$. A higher dielectric constant corresponds to greater polarization, leading to a more significant reduction in the electric field.

Moreover, the presence of a dielectric material also affects the capacitance of a capacitor. When a dielectric is placed between the plates of a capacitor, the capacitance increases. This increase occurs because the reduced electric field enables the capacitor to store more charge for a given potential difference. The increase in capacitance is directly proportional to the dielectric constant of the material.

In summary, the introduction of a dielectric into an electric field results in the polarization of the material, which in turn reduces the electric field. The degree of this reduction is contingent upon the dielectric constant of the material. These effects have significant implications for the functionality of capacitors and various electronic devices.
