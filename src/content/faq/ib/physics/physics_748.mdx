Interference patterns are significantly influenced by the coherence of the source. Higher coherence leads to clearer and more defined patterns.

In physics, interference refers to the phenomenon where two waves superimpose to create a resultant wave that may have greater, lower, or the same amplitude. This concept is fundamental to wave theory and is particularly important in the study of both light and sound waves. The resulting patterns from this interference, known as interference patterns, can be observed in various contexts, such as the vibrant colors seen in soap bubbles and oil films, as well as the alternating dark and bright fringes observed in the double-slit experiment.

The coherence of a source pertains to the phase relationship among different points in a wavefront at a given moment. In simpler terms, it describes how well the peaks and troughs of a wave align with one another. A highly coherent source, such as a laser, generates waves that are in phase, resulting in a stable and distinct interference pattern. Conversely, a source with low coherence, such as an incandescent light bulb, produces waves that are often out of phase, leading to a less stable or even nonexistent interference pattern.

For interference to occur, the waves must maintain a constant phase difference and share the same frequency. If the source lacks coherence, the phase difference between the waves will not remain constant, and the interference pattern will become unstable. This is why lasers, which emit highly coherent light, are frequently employed in experiments to yield clear and stable interference patterns.

In summary, the coherence of a source is crucial in determining the quality of interference patterns. The greater the coherence of the source, the clearer and more defined the interference pattern will be. This concept is essential for understanding wave theory and interference, as it elucidates why some sources produce distinct interference patterns while others do not.
