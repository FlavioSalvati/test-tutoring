In uniform circular motion, the direction of velocity continuously changes, always remaining tangential to the object's path.

To elaborate, uniform circular motion describes the movement of an object along a circular trajectory at a constant speed. While the speed stays constant, the direction of the velocity vector is in a state of perpetual change. This is due to the fact that velocity is a vector quantity, which encompasses both magnitude (speed) and direction.

At any specific point along the circular path, the direction of the velocity is always tangent to the circle at that point. This tangential direction is perpendicular to the radius that extends from the center of the circle to that point. As the object progresses along the circular path, the orientation of the radius—and consequently the orientation of the velocity—shifts. This continual alteration in the direction of velocity is the reason the object follows a circular trajectory.

Despite the object's speed remaining unchanged, the persistent change in the direction of velocity indicates that the object is under constant acceleration. This type of acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration, and it is directed towards the center of the circle. The force responsible for this acceleration, called centripetal force, is what maintains the object’s circular motion.

In summary, during uniform circular motion, the object's speed remains constant, but the direction of its velocity undergoes continuous changes, always being tangential to the path of motion. This ongoing change in velocity direction results in centripetal acceleration directed towards the center of the circle, enabling the object to maintain its circular path.
