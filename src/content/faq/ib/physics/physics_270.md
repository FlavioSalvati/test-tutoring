Evaluating energy sources for sustainability involves a comprehensive assessment of their renewability, environmental impact, and economic viability.

### Renewability

Renewability is a fundamental criterion in determining the sustainability of an energy source. Renewable energy sources are those that can naturally replenish themselves over a short period. These include solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy. Such sources are deemed sustainable because they do not get depleted during use and can provide a continuous supply of energy. In contrast, non-renewable energy sources, such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy, are finite and will eventually diminish, rendering them less sustainable in the long run.

### Environmental Impact

The environmental impact of an energy source is another vital consideration in assessing its sustainability. This aspect involves analyzing the quantities of greenhouse gases and other pollutants generated during the extraction, processing, and consumption of the energy source. Generally, renewable energy sources exhibit lower environmental impacts compared to their non-renewable counterparts. For example, solar and wind energy produce virtually no emissions during their operational phases, while the combustion of fossil fuels releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants. However, it is crucial to evaluate the entire life cycle of the energy source, as renewable technologies can also incur substantial environmental costs during their production and disposal stages.

### Economic Viability

Economic viability constitutes the third essential factor in evaluating the sustainability of an energy source. This term refers to the cost-effectiveness associated with producing and utilizing the energy source. Although renewable energy technologies may present high initial costs, they frequently have lower operational and maintenance expenses compared to non-renewable technologies. Furthermore, as technological advancements occur and economies of scale are realized, the costs associated with renewable energy are declining, making them increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources. Nevertheless, the economic viability of these sources is also influenced by factors such as government policies, market conditions, and geographical location, all of which can affect the cost and accessibility of various energy options.

### Conclusion

In summary, assessing the sustainability of an energy source is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of its renewability, environmental impact, and economic viability. By evaluating these factors, we can make informed decisions regarding which energy sources are the most sustainable and best suited to meet our needs.
