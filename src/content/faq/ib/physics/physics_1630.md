Resolution and magnification are two essential concepts in optics, particularly relevant in fields such as microscopy and photography. Although they are often confused, they address different aspects of an image.

**Resolution** refers to an optical system's ability to distinguish or separate two closely situated objects or points within an image. This capability is influenced by the wavelength of light that the optical system can utilize. Higher resolution results in clearer and more detailed images. For instance, in microscopy, a high-resolution lens can clearly differentiate between two closely spaced points, while a low-resolution lens may cause these points to appear blurred together. The resolution is fundamentally limited by diffraction, a phenomenon where light waves spread out as they pass through a small aperture, such as the pupil of the eye or a camera's aperture.

In contrast, **magnification** pertains to the enlargement of the appearance of an object, rather than its physical size. This enlargement can be achieved using lenses or other optical devices. In the context of microscopy, magnification is defined as the ratio of the size of the image to the actual size of the object. For example, a magnification of $10\times$ means that the object appears ten times larger than its real size. However, it is crucial to note that increasing magnification does not inherently enhance the clarity or detail of the image. If the resolution is inadequate, the magnified image may merely present as a larger blur.

In summary, while magnification indicates how much larger an object appears, resolution pertains to the ability to discern fine details within that image. Both parameters are vital in microscopy and photography, yet they serve distinct purposes. An effective optical system should integrate high resolution with suitable magnification to yield clear, detailed images.
