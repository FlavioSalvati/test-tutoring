Coherence in wave sources refers to the relationship between the phases of two or more waves originating from the same or different sources.

Coherence is a fundamental concept in wave physics, particularly within the realms of optics and quantum mechanics. It describes the correlation between the phases of multiple waves. When the phase difference between these waves remains constant, they are classified as coherent. This stable phase relationship is essential for producing constructive and destructive interference, which underpins various optical phenomena such as diffraction and holography.

Coherence can be categorized into two types: spatial coherence and temporal coherence.

**Spatial coherence** pertains to the phase relationship across the wavefront of a single wave source. A wave source exhibiting high spatial coherence generates light that is in phase across its entire wavefront. Conversely, a source with low spatial coherence, such as an incandescent light bulb, emits light with varying phases across its wavefront.

**Temporal coherence**, in contrast, refers to the phase relationship at different points in time. This concept is closely tied to the monochromaticity of the wave source. A source with high temporal coherence, such as a laser, emits light with a very narrow range of frequencies, ensuring that the phase relationship between any two points in the wave remains consistent over time. In contrast, a source with low temporal coherence, like a light bulb, produces light that spans a wide range of frequencies, resulting in rapidly changing phase relationships.

In practical applications, coherence is vital in various fields of physics and engineering. For instance, in interferometry and holography, the coherence of the light source is crucial for generating clear and high-contrast interference patterns. In telecommunications, maintaining coherence in the signal is essential for effective data transmission. Furthermore, in quantum mechanics, the coherence of quantum states is a key factor in advancing quantum computing and quantum information processing.

In summary, coherence in wave sources serves as a measure of the phase relationship between waves and plays a crucial role in numerous areas of physics and engineering.
