The speed of a wave traveling through a string is directly proportional to the square root of the tension in the string.

To elaborate, the wave speed in a string (or any medium) is influenced by specific properties of that medium. For a string, two critical properties are its tension ($T$) and its mass per unit length, known as linear density ($\mu$). The relationship between wave speed ($v$), tension ($T$), and linear density ($\mu$) is expressed by the formula:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}.
$$

This indicates that an increase in the tension of the string results in an increase in wave speed, and conversely, a decrease in tension will lower the wave speed.

The underlying reason for this behavior is that tension in the string generates a restoring force when the string is displaced. This force is essential for wave propagation. A higher tension leads to a stronger restoring force, allowing the wave to travel faster. However, it's crucial to understand that this relationship is not linear. Specifically, if the tension is doubled, the wave speed increases by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, rather than doubling.

In contrast, the linear density of the string has the effect of slowing down the wave. A string with greater mass per unit length possesses more inertia, which the wave must overcome to propagate. Consequently, a higher linear density leads to a reduced wave speed. This is why linear density appears in the denominator of the wave speed formula: increasing linear density decreases wave speed, while decreasing linear density increases wave speed.

In summary, the speed of a wave on a string increases with greater tension because the higher tension enables faster wave movement. This is captured in the formula for wave speed, which involves the square root of tension divided by the mass per unit length of the string. Thus, while an increase in tension does raise the wave speed, it does so according to a square root relationship rather than a direct proportionality.
