The resultant of two vectors can be determined using three primary methods: the graphical method, the parallelogram method, and the analytical method.

### Graphical Method
The graphical method involves representing the vectors to scale on graph paper. To do this, you position the vectors head to tail and then draw the resultant vector from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. While this method is simple and intuitive, it may lack accuracy, as it depends on the precision of your drawing and measuring skills.

### Parallelogram Method
The parallelogram method is slightly more complex. In this approach, you depict the vectors as two adjacent sides of a parallelogram. The resultant vector is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram that extends from the point where the two vectors originate. Although this method offers more accuracy than the graphical method, it can be challenging to execute, particularly when dealing with complex vectors.

### Analytical Method
The analytical method is the most precise and intricate of the three. It involves decomposing the vectors into their respective components, performing the necessary additions or subtractions of these components, and finally recombining them to determine the resultant vector. This method requires a solid understanding of trigonometry and vector operations but is the most reliable for calculating the resultant of two or more vectors.

### Important Considerations
Regardless of the method used, it is crucial to remember that vectors possess both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the resultant vector can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem or trigonometric functions, while the direction can be determined either through trigonometric functions or by measuring the angle from a reference line.

### Conclusion
In summary, the resultant of two vectors can be determined through graphical, parallelogram, or analytical methods. Each approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, with the choice of method depending on the complexity of the vectors involved and the desired level of accuracy.
