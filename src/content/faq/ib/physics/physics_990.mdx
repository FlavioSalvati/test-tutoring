The efficiency of an electric heater is defined by the ratio of the energy supplied to the heater to the useful heat energy it generates.

To elaborate, the efficiency of any device, including an electric heater, is determined by comparing the useful output energy (or power) with the input energy (or power). For an electric heater, the input energy is the electrical energy supplied, which is typically measured in kilowatt-hours ($\text{kWh}$) or joules ($\text{J}$). The useful output energy represents the heat energy produced by the heater, also measured in $\text{kWh}$ or $\text{J}$.

The efficiency can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful Output Energy}}{\text{Input Energy}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

In an ideal scenario, an electric heater would convert all the electrical energy supplied into heat energy, resulting in an efficiency of $100\%$. However, in practice, some energy is invariably lost to the environment in the form of light or sound, which decreases the overall efficiency.
