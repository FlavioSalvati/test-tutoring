During the transmission of electrical power, various losses occur primarily due to resistance, leakage, and corona discharge.

Electrical power transmission refers to the transfer of electrical energy from a power station to the end-user. Throughout this process, several types of losses arise, which ultimately decrease the efficiency of the system. The most significant of these losses is attributed to the resistance present in the transmission lines. As current flows through the conductors, it encounters resistance, which generates heat. This heat represents a loss of energy, commonly referred to as $I^2R$ loss or copper loss. The magnitude of this loss is dependent on both the resistance of the conductor and the square of the current flowing through it. To minimize these losses, high voltage transmission is employed since it results in lower current for the same power output. Understanding the properties of the materials used in transmission lines is essential in effectively managing these resistance-related losses.

Another notable loss arises from current leakage. This phenomenon occurs when current escapes from the transmission lines and dissipates into the ground. Leakage is particularly prevalent in underground cables, where insulation may not be entirely effective. To mitigate leakage losses, the use of improved insulation materials and diligent maintenance practices is crucial.

Additionally, corona discharge constitutes another source of power loss during transmission. This phenomenon transpires when the electric field surrounding the conductor ionizes the air in its vicinity, resulting in the formation of a corona or a luminous halo. The ionization process consumes a considerable amount of energy, thereby contributing to power loss. Corona discharge is more frequent in high-voltage transmission lines, especially under conditions of elevated humidity or rainfall. This loss can be minimized by employing conductors with larger diameters or by utilizing bundled conductors. Understanding the electromagnetic properties of transmission systems is also vital for addressing the effects associated with corona discharge.

Lastly, minor losses occur due to the inductive and capacitive characteristics of the transmission lines, commonly referred to as reactance losses. Although these losses are generally smaller compared to the aforementioned losses, they can still affect the overall efficiency of the power transmission system. Efficient management and distribution of power across electrical grids are essential for mitigating these losses, as elaborated in related literature.

In summary, the primary losses during electrical power transmission arise from resistance, leakage, and corona discharge. These losses significantly reduce the efficiency of the power transmission system and pose considerable challenges in the design and operation of power grids.
