The energy released during nuclear fusion can be calculated using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, represented by the equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

In essence, fusion is a nuclear process in which two light atomic nuclei merge to create a heavier nucleus. This fusion process can either release or absorb energy, depending on the specific reaction. The energy produced during fusion is derived from the mass defect of the reaction, which is the difference in mass between the reactants (the nuclei that are fusing) and the resulting product (the heavier nucleus formed).

To determine the energy released in a fusion reaction, you first need to calculate the mass defect. This is done by subtracting the mass of the product nucleus from the total mass of the reactant nuclei. The resulting mass defect represents the mass that has been transformed into energy during the fusion process.

Once you have the mass defect, you can find the energy released by multiplying this mass defect by the square of the speed of light, $c^2$. The speed of light is approximately $3 \times 10^8$ meters per second, which means that $c^2$ is roughly $9 \times 10^{16}$ m²/s².

It's important to note that in nuclear reactions, masses are typically measured in atomic mass units (u), where $1 \, \text{u}$ is approximately $1.66 \times 10^{-27}$ kilograms. The energy released is commonly expressed in electron volts (eV), where $1 \, \text{eV}$ is roughly $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ joules. To convert between kilograms and atomic mass units or between joules and electron volts, you will need to utilize these conversion factors.

In summary, to calculate the energy released during fusion, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mass defect by subtracting the mass of the product nucleus from the total mass of the initial reactant nuclei.
2. Multiply the mass defect by the speed of light squared, $c^2$, to obtain the energy in joules.
3. Use the appropriate conversion factors if you need to change units.

This process utilizes Einstein's formula, $E = mc^2$, which establishes the fundamental relationship between mass and energy.
