Sound travels more slowly in cooler air because the molecules are less energetic and move at a reduced velocity, which hinders the propagation of sound.

To elaborate, the speed of sound in a medium is influenced by the medium's properties. In the case of air, these properties include temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Among these, temperature is the most critical factor impacting the speed of sound in air.

When air is heated, the molecules gain energy and move more rapidly. This increase in molecular motion facilitates the quicker transmission of sound waves. Conversely, when the air temperature decreases, the molecules lose energy and their movement slows down. This reduction in molecular motion results in a slower transmission of sound waves.

The speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:

$$
v = \sqrt{\gamma R T}
$$

where:
- $v$ is the speed of sound,
- $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index (the ratio of specific heats),
- $R$ is the gas constant, and
- $T$ is the absolute temperature.

As the temperature drops, the value of $\sqrt{T}$ decreases, leading to a corresponding decline in the speed of sound. For instance, at $0^\circ C$, the speed of sound in dry air is approximately $331 \, \text{m/s}$. However, at $20^\circ C$, this speed increases to about $343 \, \text{m/s}$.

It is important to note that while humidity and atmospheric pressure can also influence the speed of sound, their effects are generally less significant than that of temperature. Humidity can increase the speed of sound, as water vapor is lighter than dry air, enabling sound waves to travel faster. On the other hand, atmospheric pressure has a negligible impact on the speed of sound in air because changes in pressure are typically accompanied by changes in density that offset each other.

In summary, the speed of sound in air is primarily governed by the air temperature. Cooler air leads to slower-moving molecules, which, in turn, slows down the propagation of sound waves.
