During a skater's motion, there is a continuous interchange between potential and kinetic energy, which depends on the skater's position and speed.

To elaborate, when a skater is in motion, two primary forms of energy are involved: kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy, represented as $KE$, is the energy associated with motion and is directly related to the skater's speed. Specifically, the faster the skater moves, the more kinetic energy they possess. Conversely, potential energy, denoted as $PE$, is stored energy that depends on the skater's height or position. For instance, when a skater is positioned at the top of a ramp, they experience maximum potential energy while having minimal kinetic energy.

As the skater descends the ramp, potential energy begins to convert into kinetic energy. This transformation occurs because the skater is losing height (thereby losing potential energy) while simultaneously gaining speed (resulting in increased kinetic energy). At the bottom of the ramp, the skater reaches a state of minimum potential energy and maximum kinetic energy.

If the skater subsequently ascends another ramp, the process reverses. In this scenario, the skater loses speed (and thus kinetic energy) while gaining height (and consequently potential energy). At the summit of the second ramp, the skater again has maximum potential energy and minimal kinetic energy.

This dynamic exchange between potential and kinetic energy continues as long as the skater remains in motion. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that some energy is inevitably lost due to factors such as friction and air resistance. This lost energy is typically converted into heat, which explains why skaters often feel warm after extended periods of activity.

In conclusion, the changes in energy during a skater's motion exemplify the law of conservation of energy. This fundamental principle states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; rather, it can only be transferred or transformed. Therefore, the total amount of energy in the system—comprising the skater and the ramps—remains constant, with energy shifting from one form (potential energy) to another (kinetic energy) and vice versa.
