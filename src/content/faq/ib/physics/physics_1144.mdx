The period of circular motion is intricately connected to the radius of the circle, as described by the formula for centripetal acceleration.

In circular motion, an object travels along the circumference of a circle. The period of this motion, commonly denoted as $T$, represents the time required for the object to complete one full revolution around the circle. The radius, $r$, is defined as the distance from the center of the circle to the object's position.

The relationship between the period and the radius can be elucidated through the concept of centripetal acceleration, which is the rate of change of tangential velocity and always acts toward the center of the circle. The formula for centripetal acceleration is given by:

$$ a = \frac{v^2}{r} $$

where $v$ is the tangential velocity.

Tangential velocity can also be expressed in terms of the period and the radius using the formula:

$$ v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} $$

By substituting this expression for $v$ into the centripetal acceleration formula, we obtain:

$$ a = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2} $$

This derivation reveals that the period of circular motion is inversely proportional to the square root of the radius. Specifically, if the radius is quadrupled, the period will double, assuming that centripetal acceleration remains constant.

This relationship is foundational in various fields of physics. For instance, in planetary motion, the period of a planet's orbit around the sun—another example of circular motion—is determined by the radius of that orbit.

In simpler terms, the period of circular motion (the time it takes to complete one rotation around the circle) and the radius of the circle (the distance from the center to the edge) are interconnected through centripetal acceleration. Specifically, increasing the radius affects the period because it alters the speed required for circular motion. This principle is crucial for understanding celestial movements, such as the orbits of planets around the sun.
