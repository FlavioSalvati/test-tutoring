Nuclear fission and fusion are two distinct types of nuclear reactions that release energy, driven by the interplay of the strong nuclear force, which holds protons and neutrons together, and the electromagnetic force, which causes protons to repel one another.

In nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus, such as uranium or plutonium, is divided into two or more lighter nuclei, resulting in the release of a substantial amount of energy. This process is typically initiated when a neutron is absorbed by the heavy nucleus, rendering it unstable and prompting it to split.

Conversely, nuclear fusion involves the combination of two light nuclei—usually isotopes of hydrogen, such as deuterium and tritium—into a heavier nucleus, like helium. This reaction also releases a significant amount of energy; however, it requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. This is why fusion reactions are prevalent in the sun and other stars, where these extreme conditions are naturally present.

The energy produced in both fission and fusion reactions far exceeds that released in chemical reactions because these nuclear processes involve changes at the atomic nucleus level, which contains the majority of an atom's mass. This phenomenon is explained by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, given by the equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

This principle indicates that a small amount of mass can be transformed into a substantial amount of energy.

Despite their similarities in energy release, fission and fusion have significant differences in their practical applications. Fission is currently utilized in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons, as it can be easily initiated and controlled. In contrast, while fusion holds the promise of providing a nearly limitless and clean energy source, it remains commercially unviable due to the challenges associated with achieving and maintaining the necessary conditions for a sustained reaction.
