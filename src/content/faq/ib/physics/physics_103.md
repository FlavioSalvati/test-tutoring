Gravitational force is intrinsically linked to weight, as weight is defined as the force of gravity acting on an object's mass.

To elaborate, weight quantifies the gravitational force exerted downward on an object. It is calculated using the equation:

$$
W = m \cdot g
$$

where $ W $ represents weight, $ m $ stands for mass, and $ g $ denotes the acceleration due to gravity. This relationship indicates that an object's weight can vary depending on its location in the universe, as the value of $ g $ can differ. For instance, an object weighs less on the Moon than on Earth due to the Moon's weaker gravitational field.

Gravitational force is a universal force that acts between all masses. It is inherently attractive, meaning it pulls objects toward one another. The strength of this force is determined by both the masses of the objects involved and the distance separating them. This relationship is articulated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

In the context of weight, we typically consider the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on an object. Given that the Earth possesses a significantly larger mass than any object on its surface, the gravitational force it exerts on nearby objects is substantial. This force is what we perceive as weight.

It is crucial to understand that while mass is an intrinsic property of an object that remains constant, weight is a force that can fluctuate depending on the gravitational field. For example, an astronaut in space experiences weightlessness because there is no significant gravitational field acting on them, despite their mass remaining unchanged. This distinction between mass and weight is a fundamental concept in physics.
