Energy is conserved in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) through the continuous exchange between kinetic and potential energy.

In SHM, an object oscillates back and forth around a stable equilibrium position. While the total energy of the system remains constant, it is constantly transformed from kinetic energy (the energy associated with motion) to potential energy (the energy stored due to position or configuration). This process exemplifies the principle of conservation of energy, which is a fundamental concept in physics.

Let's examine a simple pendulum, a classic example of SHM. When the pendulum reaches its maximum displacement (the farthest point from the equilibrium position), it momentarily comes to a halt before reversing direction. At this point, all the energy in the system is potential energy, as the pendulum is at its highest position. As the pendulum swings back towards the equilibrium position, this potential energy is gradually converted into kinetic energy. At the equilibrium position, the pendulum achieves its maximum speed, meaning all the energy is now kinetic. As it continues to swing to the opposite side, the kinetic energy is once again transformed back into potential energy. This cyclical process repeats as long as no external forces, such as friction or air resistance, act upon the system.

The same principle applies to other examples of SHM, such as a mass attached to a spring. When the spring is either stretched or compressed to its maximum extent, the system possesses maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. As the mass moves towards the equilibrium position, the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases. At the equilibrium position, the kinetic energy reaches its peak, while the potential energy is zero. As the mass moves past the equilibrium position, the kinetic energy begins to decrease once more, while the potential energy increases.

In an ideal SHM system, this energy transfer between kinetic and potential energy would continue indefinitely, with no energy lost to the surrounding environment. However, in real-world systems, some energy is typically lost due to factors such as friction or air resistance. Despite these losses, the principle of conservation of energy still holds: the total energy in the system (including any energy lost to the surroundings) remains constant.
