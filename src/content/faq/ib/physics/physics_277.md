Fields possess the capacity to store potential energy by exerting a force that can perform work on an object as it moves within the field.

To elaborate, fields—such as gravitational, electric, and magnetic fields—are specific regions in space where an object experiences a force. This force is capable of performing work on the object, which translates to a transfer of energy to the object. When an object is situated within a field but remains stationary, it possesses the potential to be displaced by the force exerted by the field. This concept gives rise to the idea of potential energy.

For example, consider a book resting on a shelf. It exists within the Earth's gravitational field and possesses gravitational potential energy. If the book falls, the gravitational field does work on it, resulting in the book gaining kinetic energy. The amount of gravitational potential energy it holds is contingent upon its height within the field; the greater the height, the more potential energy it possesses.

In a similar manner, within an electric field, a charged particle has electric potential energy. If the particle moves in the direction of the force exerted by the field, the field performs work on the particle, leading to a decrease in its electric potential energy.

In the context of a magnetic field, a magnetic object or a moving charged particle also possesses magnetic potential energy. The field can do work on the object or particle, particularly if it moves in a specific manner within the field.

The potential energy stored within a field is a form of energy that can be transformed into other forms, such as kinetic energy, when the object moves. It is crucial to understand that potential energy is relative to a selected reference position or state. For instance, we commonly designate an object on the ground as having zero gravitational potential energy; however, we could select any other position as our reference point. The key factor is the difference in potential energy between two positions, as this difference dictates the amount of work the field can perform on the object as it transitions from one position to another.
