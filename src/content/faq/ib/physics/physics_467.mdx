Nuclear power plants utilize the process of radioactive decay to generate heat, which is subsequently converted into steam to drive turbines for electricity production.

More specifically, these plants operate based on the principle of nuclear fission. In this process, the nucleus of a heavy atom, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, is split into two or more smaller nuclei, along with the release of several neutrons. This reaction emits a substantial amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation, with the heat being the primary energy source harnessed by the nuclear power plant.

Within the core of a nuclear reactor, fuel rods are filled with small pellets of uranium or plutonium. When a neutron collides with the nucleus of one of these atoms, it instigates the fission process, causing the nucleus to break apart and release additional neutrons alongside a significant amount of heat. These newly released neutrons can then cause further fission reactions in nearby atoms, leading to a self-sustaining chain reaction. This chain reaction is meticulously controlled to prevent it from escalating into a nuclear explosion.

The heat produced by this controlled chain reaction is used to heat water, converting it into steam. This steam is then directed to spin a turbine that is connected to a generator. As the turbine rotates, it drives the generator, producing electricity.

It is important to note that radioactive decay also results in the emission of radiation, which can be harmful to living organisms. To mitigate this risk, the reactor core is encased in a robust shield made of concrete and steel, designed to absorb radiation and prevent its escape into the environment. Additionally, the spent fuel rods, which remain highly radioactive, are managed and stored with great care to minimize the potential for radiation exposure.

In conclusion, nuclear power plants effectively harness radioactive decay by converting the heat generated from a controlled chain reaction of nuclear fission into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity. This entire process is carefully monitored to regulate the chain reaction and contain the harmful radiation produced.
