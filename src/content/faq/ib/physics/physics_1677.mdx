The Doppler effect is relevant for understanding galaxy movement as it helps determine the velocity and direction of their motion.

The Doppler effect, named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, is a phenomenon that occurs when the frequency of a wave changes for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In the context of galaxies, this effect is often referred to as redshift or blueshift. When a galaxy is moving away from us, the light it emits appears more red than it actually is, a phenomenon known as redshift. Conversely, if a galaxy is moving towards us, the light appears more blue, known as blueshift.

The degree of this shift towards the red or blue end of the spectrum can be used to calculate the speed at which a galaxy is moving away or towards us. This is done using the Doppler formula, which relates the observed frequency or wavelength of light to the relative speed of the source and the observer. The greater the redshift, the faster the galaxy is moving away from us. Similarly, the greater the blueshift, the faster it is moving towards us.

Furthermore, the Doppler effect is not only useful for determining the velocity of galaxies, but also their direction of motion. If we observe a redshift in the light from a galaxy, we can infer that the galaxy is moving away from us. If we observe a blueshift, we can infer that the galaxy is moving towards us.

The Doppler effect has been instrumental in supporting the Big Bang theory and the concept of an expanding universe. Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer, used redshifts to determine that distant galaxies are moving away from us in every direction. This observation led to the conclusion that the universe is expanding, a key pillar of the Big Bang theory.

In conclusion, the Doppler effect is a crucial tool in astrophysics. It allows scientists to measure the velocity and direction of galaxies, providing key insights into the structure and evolution of the universe.
