A vector in three-dimensional space is defined as an ordered triple of numbers, denoted as $(x, y, z)$.

To elaborate, a vector in three-dimensional space is a geometric entity characterized by both a direction and a magnitude (or length). It is typically expressed as the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ represent the components of the vector along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively. These components can be interpreted as the distances the vector extends along each axis from the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ to its terminal point.

Visually, a vector can be represented as an arrow originating from the origin and pointing towards its endpoint. The length of this arrow indicates the magnitude of the vector, while the orientation of the arrow signifies the vector's direction. The magnitude of a vector can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions, given by the formula:

$$
\text{Magnitude} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}.
$$

Vectors play a crucial role in physics, as they are used to describe quantities that possess both magnitude and direction, such as force, velocity, and displacement. For instance, a force of $5$ Newtons directed eastward would be represented as a vector with a magnitude of $5$ and a direction corresponding to east.

Beyond their geometric representation, vectors in three-dimensional space can also be expressed algebraically. This is commonly achieved using unit vectors, which are vectors that have a length of $1$ along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. Any vector can be represented as a linear combination of these unit vectors. For example, the vector $(3, 2, 1)$ can be expressed as:

$$
3\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{j} + 1\mathbf{k},
$$

where $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$, and $\mathbf{k}$ are the unit vectors along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively.

In summary, a vector in three-dimensional space is a versatile tool for representing quantities that have both magnitude and direction. It can be depicted geometrically as an arrow or algebraically as an ordered triple of numbers or a linear combination of unit vectors.
