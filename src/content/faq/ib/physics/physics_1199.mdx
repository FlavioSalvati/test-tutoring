A half-life is defined as the time required for half of a radioactive substance to undergo decay.

The half-life of a radioactive material is an intrinsic characteristic of that substance; it remains constant regardless of external conditions such as temperature, pressure, or the physical or chemical state of the material. This property is statistical in nature, rooted in the probability of decay events occurring within a specified time frame.

To ascertain the half-life of a radioactive substance, scientists typically begin by measuring the substance's activity, which is quantified as the number of decay events per unit of time. This measurement can be conducted using instruments such as a Geiger-Müller counter or a scintillation detector, both of which are capable of detecting the particles or radiation emitted during the decay process.

As time progresses, the activity of a radioactive substance diminishes due to the ongoing decay. By recording the activity at various time intervals, scientists can create a decay curve—a graphical representation of activity plotted against time. The half-life corresponds to the time point at which the activity has decreased to half of its initial value.

In practice, pinpointing the exact moment when the activity halves can be challenging, particularly for substances with either very short or very long half-lives. Consequently, researchers often employ statistical methods to estimate the half-life from the decay curve. For instance, they may fit an exponential function to the decay data, using this model to calculate the half-life.

It is essential to recognize that the half-life represents the average time for half of the atoms in a sample to decay. This means that it is impossible to predict the exact moment when any specific atom will decay; rather, we can only determine the probability that it will decay within a given timeframe. This uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of the quantum mechanical nature of radioactive decay.

Understanding half-lives is vital across various fields of physics and related disciplines. For example, half-lives play a crucial role in radiometric dating, which helps determine the age of archaeological and geological specimens. They are also significant in nuclear medicine, where they inform the appropriate dosages of radioactive pharmaceuticals, and in nuclear power, where they assist in managing the disposal of radioactive waste.
