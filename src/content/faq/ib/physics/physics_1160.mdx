We do not feel the gravitational pull from distant stars due to the inverse square law of gravity and the vast distances that separate us from them.

Gravity is a fundamental force that acts between all masses in the universe. Its strength diminishes rapidly with increasing distance. This behavior is captured by the inverse square law, which states that the gravitational force $F$ between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r$ between them:

$$
F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
$$

In practical terms, this means that if the distance between two objects is doubled, the gravitational force between them becomes four times weaker. For instance, if the distance is tripled, the force decreases to one-ninth of its original strength, and this trend continues with increasing distance.

The stars in the universe are located at astonishing distances from us. The closest star to Earth, Proxima Centauri, is approximately $4.24$ light-years away, which equates to about $40$ trillion kilometers. Such immense distances result in an incredibly weak gravitational pull from even our nearest stellar neighbor.

Moreover, the mass of a star influences the strength of its gravitational attraction. Although stars are significantly more massive than the Earth, their mass is distributed over a much larger volume. Consequently, the density of a star—defined as mass per unit volume—is considerably lower than that of the Earth. This reduced density further weakens the gravitational pull we experience from stars compared to the pull we feel from the Earth.

Additionally, the gravitational influence of nearby celestial bodies, such as the Earth and the Sun, counteracts the feeble pull from distant stars. These nearby bodies exert a much stronger gravitational force on us due to their proximity, effectively overshadowing the weak gravitational attraction from far-off stars.

In summary, while we are technically under the influence of the gravitational pull from all stars in the universe, the effect is so minuscule that it is virtually imperceptible. Factors such as the inverse square law of gravity, the vast distances to the stars, their lower density, and the stronger gravitational pull from nearby objects all contribute to this phenomenon.
