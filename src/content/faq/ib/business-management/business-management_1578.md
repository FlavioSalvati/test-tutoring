Fixed costs are consistent and do not change with the level of output, while variable costs fluctuate based on production volume.

Fixed costs are expenses that a business has to pay regardless of its level of production or sales. These costs are often contractual or time-bound and remain constant over a certain period. Examples of fixed costs include rent for premises, salaries of permanent staff, insurance, and depreciation. These costs are 'fixed' as they do not change with the number of goods or services a company produces. For instance, if a company rents a warehouse for Â£10,000 per month, this cost will remain the same whether the company produces one unit or thousands of units.

On the other hand, variable costs are directly proportional to the level of production. They increase when production volume goes up and decrease when it goes down. Examples of variable costs include raw materials, direct labour costs, and utilities like electricity and water that are used in the production process. For example, if a company produces shirts, the cost of fabric would be a variable cost. If the company decides to produce more shirts, it will need more fabric, thus increasing the variable cost.

Understanding the difference between fixed and variable costs is crucial for businesses as it impacts pricing strategies, budgeting, and profitability analysis. It's also essential for calculating the break-even point, which is the point at which total revenue equals total costs. This includes both fixed and variable costs. By understanding these costs, businesses can make informed decisions about scaling production, setting prices, and managing resources effectively.

In summary, fixed costs are constant and do not change with the level of output, providing some predictability for businesses. In contrast, variable costs are tied directly to production levels, making them less predictable but potentially more controllable as businesses can adjust production levels to manage these costs.
