The extended marketing mix broadens the traditional concept of the four Ps—Product, Price, Promotion, and Place—by incorporating three additional Ps: People, Process, and Physical Evidence.

The traditional marketing mix, commonly referred to as the 4Ps, was introduced in the 1960s. It comprises four fundamental elements that businesses must consider when marketing their products or services. 

1. **Product**: This refers to what the company offers, which may include either a tangible good or an intangible service. 
2. **Price**: This is the amount that the customer is charged for the product.
3. **Promotion**: This encompasses the various communication strategies employed by the company to inform customers about the product.
4. **Place**: This pertains to the distribution channels used to deliver the product to the customer.

In the 1980s, the marketing mix evolved to include three additional elements, leading to what is now known as the 7Ps of marketing. This expanded mix is particularly significant in the service industry.

5. **People**: This aspect highlights the employees who provide the service. In many service-oriented sectors, personnel are considered the most valuable asset. They are responsible for customer interactions, service delivery, and embodying the company’s brand image. Thus, it is essential for these individuals to be well-trained, professional, and adept at delivering high-quality service.

6. **Process**: This refers to the systems and procedures that facilitate service delivery. It encompasses everything from how a hotel checks in its guests to how a restaurant processes orders and serves meals. An efficient and thoughtfully designed process can significantly enhance the customer experience, improve operational efficiency, and lower costs.

7. **Physical Evidence**: This element includes the tangible elements that customers encounter. It may involve the physical environment where services are rendered, such as a restaurant or hotel, as well as the packaging of products. Physical evidence plays a crucial role in shaping a customer’s perception of a product or service.

In summary, the extended marketing mix offers a more holistic framework for marketing products and services. It acknowledges that in numerous industries, especially in the service sector, additional factors must be considered beyond the traditional four Ps.
