Quality management in operations is founded on several key principles: customer focus, leadership, engagement of people, process approach, continuous improvement, evidence-based decision making, and relationship management.

The first principle, **customer focus**, is essential because the primary goal of any business is to meet and exceed customer expectations. This requires a profound understanding of both current and future customer needs, fulfilling customer requirements, and striving to surpass their expectations. It means ensuring that every aspect of the organization is directed toward delivering quality to the customer.

**Leadership** is another critical principle. Leaders at all levels play a vital role in establishing a unified purpose and direction. They create an environment that engages employees in achieving the organization's quality objectives. This involves articulating a clear vision for the company's direction and standards, while also motivating and aligning employees with these goals.

The principle of **engagement of people** emphasizes the importance of having a workforce that is competent, empowered, and actively involved in delivering value. When all members of the organization are engaged and capable, it significantly enhances the organization's ability to create value.

The **process approach** involves understanding activities as interconnected processes that work together as a cohesive system. This perspective allows the organization to manage interrelated processes effectively, thereby achieving intended results efficiently and consistently.

**Continuous improvement** is a fundamental principle of quality management. Successful organizations maintain a relentless focus on improvement. Regularly seeking ways to enhance process efficiency, minimize waste, and boost customer satisfaction is integral to a robust quality management strategy.

**Evidence-based decision making** ensures that decisions are grounded in the analysis and evaluation of data and information. This principle helps guarantee that decisions are well-informed, consistent, and conducive to achieving desired outcomes.

Lastly, **relationship management** acknowledges the significance of managing relationships with various stakeholders, including suppliers. Effectively managed relationships contribute to sustained success by optimizing performance and enhancing the ability to create value.

In summary, these principles are interrelated, and when applied collectively, they significantly improve an organizationâ€™s capability to consistently deliver products and services that meet customer requirements and enhance customer satisfaction.
