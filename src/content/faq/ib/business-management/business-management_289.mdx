Provisions are included in the final accounts to address anticipated future liabilities or losses.

Provisions play a crucial role in financial accounting and reporting. They represent amounts reserved to cover expected future liabilities or losses, which may arise from various factors such as bad debts, depreciation, legal disputes, or other unforeseen expenses. The primary purpose of including provisions in the final accounts is to ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the company's financial position.

In line with the prudence concept of accounting, businesses are mandated to account for potential future losses, but they should not anticipate future gains. This means that if a business foresees a potential loss or liability, it must recognize this in the current accounting period. This recognition is achieved by creating a provision, which effectively acts as a charge against profits. Consequently, provisions serve to prevent the overstatement of profits.

For instance, when a business sells goods on credit, there is an inherent risk that some customers may default on their payments. To mitigate this risk, the business would establish a provision for bad debts. This provision estimates the amount the business expects will be uncollectible from its customers. By creating this provision, the business ensures that its profits and assets are not overstated.

Similarly, a business may establish a provision for depreciation to account for the wear and tear of its fixed assets. This provision estimates the reduction in value of the assets during the accounting period. By recognizing this provision, the business ensures that its asset values are accurately reflected.

In conclusion, provisions are essential in the final accounts to guarantee that financial statements present a true and fair view of the company's financial position. They provide a means to account for anticipated future liabilities or losses, thereby ensuring that profits and asset values are not overstated.
