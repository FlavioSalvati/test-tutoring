An increase in fixed costs leads to a higher break-even point, meaning that a greater number of units must be sold to cover total costs.

In break-even analysis, the break-even point is defined as the level of sales at which total revenue equals total costs, resulting in neither profit nor loss. Fixed costs are expenses that remain constant regardless of the output level, such as rent, salaries, and insurance. When fixed costs rise, a business must generate more revenue to cover these expenses, which consequently elevates the break-even point.

To illustrate this concept, consider a company that sells a product for £10 per unit, incurs variable costs of £4 per unit, and has fixed costs of £1000. The break-even point can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Break-even point} = \frac{1000}{10 - 4} = 167 \text{ units}
$$

If the fixed costs increase to £1500, the new break-even point would be:

$$
\text{New break-even point} = \frac{1500}{10 - 4} = 250 \text{ units}
$$

This indicates that the company would need to sell an additional 83 units to reach the break-even point after the increase in fixed costs.

This rise in the break-even point can have significant implications for a business. It may necessitate an increase in sales volume, which could require additional marketing efforts or even expansion into new markets. Alternatively, the business might need to explore ways to reduce variable costs or increase its selling price to lower the break-even point. However, these strategies may carry potential drawbacks, such as compromising product quality or diminishing competitiveness in the market.

Thus, understanding the impact of fixed costs on break-even analysis is essential for effective business management. It enables decision-makers to make informed choices regarding pricing, cost management, and sales strategies. Additionally, it aids in assessing the financial risks associated with business operations, as a higher break-even point implies that a greater level of sales is necessary to avoid losses.
