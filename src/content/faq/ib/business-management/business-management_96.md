A STEEPLE analysis distinguishes itself from a PESTLE analysis by incorporating Ethical and Environmental factors into its framework.

Both STEEPLE and PESTLE are acronyms utilized in strategic management to help organizations comprehend the macro-environmental factors that may influence their operations. PESTLE stands for Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors. It serves as a tool to identify and analyze external influences that could impact an organization’s performance.

In contrast, STEEPLE stands for Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, and Ethical factors. It expands upon the PESTLE framework by adding Ethical factors. This inclusion means that, in addition to the elements assessed in a PESTLE analysis, a STEEPLE analysis also considers ethical issues relevant to a business. These issues may encompass corporate governance, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, and ethical consumerism.

The incorporation of Ethical factors in a STEEPLE analysis acknowledges the increasing significance of ethics in the business landscape. In today’s environment, companies are under growing scrutiny regarding their actions and are expected to operate in an ethical and socially responsible manner. This expectation can profoundly impact a company’s reputation and brand image, thereby influencing its performance and profitability.

Furthermore, while the Environmental factor is also a component of PESTLE, it receives greater emphasis in the STEEPLE analysis. This shift reflects the rising importance of environmental sustainability within the business realm. Companies are now anticipated to minimize their environmental footprint and engage in sustainable practices. This focus can affect various aspects of a company’s operations, including resource utilization, waste management, and energy consumption.

In summary, a STEEPLE analysis not only incorporates Ethical factors but also places a stronger emphasis on Environmental issues compared to PESTLE. While PESTLE examines Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Legal, and Environmental aspects, STEEPLE extends this examination by including Ethical considerations. As a result, STEEPLE not only assesses how external factors impact a business but also highlights the necessity of ethical behavior and environmental responsibility in today's world.
