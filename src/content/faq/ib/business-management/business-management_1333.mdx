The life cycle of a business typically encompasses five key stages: development, startup, growth, maturity, and decline or renewal.

The **development stage** marks the initial phase of a business's life cycle. During this conceptual phase, the business idea is generated, and its feasibility is thoroughly assessed. This stage involves conducting market research, drafting a business plan, and securing the necessary financing. It is characterized by high risk, as the business has not yet commenced operations, leading to a significant likelihood of failure.

The **startup stage** follows, when the business officially begins its operations. The primary focus during this stage is on marketing and production. Here, the business strives to establish its brand identity and build a loyal customer base. Moreover, it seeks to optimize its production processes for greater efficiency. This stage is marked by high costs and low revenues, as the business works to penetrate the market effectively.

Next is the **growth stage**, during which the business experiences rapid expansion. Having established its brand and developed a steady customer base, the focus shifts to increasing market share and scaling operations. This stage is characterized by rising revenues and profits; however, the business also confronts heightened competition and must continuously innovate to maintain its competitive edge.

The **maturity stage** follows, characterized by a slowdown in growth as the business reaches a stable operational state. At this point, the business enjoys a significant market share and is recognized as a well-known brand. The focus during this stage is on sustaining market share and enhancing operational efficiency. Revenues and profits stabilize, but the business faces the risk of complacency, which could lead to losing market share to more innovative competitors.

Finally, the **decline or renewal stage** occurs when the business begins to experience a decrease in revenues and profits. This decline may result from intensified competition, shifting market conditions, or internal challenges. The focus during this stage centers on reinventing the business to adapt to these new circumstances or, alternatively, winding down operations. This stage is characterized by diminishing revenues and profits; however, with the implementation of effective strategies, the business has the potential to renew itself and transition into a new growth phase.
