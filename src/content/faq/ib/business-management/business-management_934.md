The primary components of final accounts are the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

The **balance sheet**, also referred to as the statement of financial position, provides a snapshot of a company's financial condition at a specific point in time. It details the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Assets represent what the company owns, including items such as cash, inventory, and property. Conversely, liabilities reflect what the company owes, encompassing loans and accounts payable. Shareholders' equity, often referred to as net assets, is calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities. This figure represents the residual interest in the company's assets after all liabilities have been settled.

The **income statement**, commonly known as the profit and loss account, summarizes the company's revenues, costs, and profits over a defined period. Revenues are the earnings generated from the company's primary activities, such as the sale of goods or services. Costs include the expenses incurred in generating these revenues, such as the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses. The profit or loss of the company is determined by the difference between total revenues and total costs.

The **cash flow statement** outlines the company's cash inflows and outflows over a specific period. It is divided into three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Operating activities reflect the cash effects of transactions that generate revenues and expenses. Investing activities pertain to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investment securities. Financing activities involve obtaining resources from owners and providing returns on, as well as returns of, their investments.

These three components of final accounts are interrelated. The income statement illustrates the company's profitability, which influences the retained earnings reported in the shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet. The cash flow statement indicates changes in the company's cash position, which is reflected in the cash and cash equivalents line item on the balance sheet. By analyzing these components, stakeholders can effectively assess the company's financial performance and overall position.
