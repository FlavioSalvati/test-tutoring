A business can enhance its ability to achieve its objectives by establishing SMART goals and conducting regular progress reviews.

The SMART framework is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. These criteria guide businesses in formulating effective and actionable goals. To ensure that objectives are measurable, they must be both specific and quantifiable. For instance, rather than setting a vague goal like "increase sales," a business could establish a more precise objective such as "increase sales by $10\%$ in the next quarter." This goal is specific and measurable, allowing the business to track its sales performance and determine if it has successfully achieved the $10\%$ increase.

To confirm that objectives are attainable, they should be realistic and achievable given the business's available resources and capabilities. For example, if a small business with limited resources aims to become the market leader in its industry within a year, this goal may be overly ambitious. Conversely, if the same business sets a more feasible goal to increase its market share by $5\%$ over the course of a year, this objective is likely to be more attainable.

Regularly reviewing progress is vital for ensuring that objectives remain measurable and attainable. By consistently evaluating their progress, businesses can assess whether they are on track to meet their goals. If they find themselves falling behind, they can adjust their strategies or even revise their objectives. For example, if a business discovers it is not on pace to reach its sales target, it might implement new marketing initiatives or modify its sales goals.

Moreover, businesses should take external factors into account when establishing goals. Elements such as market trends, economic conditions, and competition can significantly influence a business's capacity to achieve its objectives. By considering these factors, a business can set more realistic and attainable goals.

In conclusion, by setting SMART goals and regularly reviewing their progress, businesses can ensure that their objectives are both measurable and attainable.
