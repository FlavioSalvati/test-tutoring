In public limited companies (PLCs), ownership is distributed among numerous shareholders, yet control is typically centralized within a board of directors.

In a PLC, ownership is held by the general public who purchase shares of the company. These shareholders are essentially the owners of the company, and their ownership stake is proportional to the number of shares they possess. For example, if an individual owns $100$ shares in a company that has issued a total of $1,000$ shares, they effectively own $10\%$ of the company.

Despite being the owners, shareholders do not manage the day-to-day operations of the company. Instead, this responsibility lies with the board of directors, who are appointed by the shareholders. The board is tasked with making strategic decisions, setting policies, and overseeing the overall operations of the company. They are accountable to the shareholders and are expected to act in the best interests of the company.

The separation of ownership and control in a PLC can sometimes result in conflicts of interest. Shareholders, as owners, are primarily focused on the company's profitability, which directly affects their dividends and the value of their shares. In contrast, directors may prioritize other objectives, such as expanding the business, increasing market share, or enhancing the company's reputation, which may not yield immediate profits.

In large PLCs, ownership can be so widely distributed that no single shareholder holds a controlling interest. This scenario can result in directors having considerable autonomy, allowing them to make decisions without significant shareholder oversight. This phenomenon is often referred to as the "divorce of ownership and control."

In summary, while shareholders are the owners of a public limited company, they usually lack direct control over its operations. That control is exercised by the board of directors, who are appointed by and accountable to the shareholders. This separation of ownership and control is a key characteristic of public limited companies.
