Businesses adopting a networked organisational structure encounter a variety of challenges, including security risks, communication hurdles, and a heavy reliance on technology.

A networked organisational structure represents a modern and flexible approach to business operations. However, it is accompanied by specific challenges that must be addressed. One of the most pressing issues is the heightened risk of security breaches. As organisations become more interconnected, they also become increasingly susceptible to cyber-attacks. Cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities within the network to access sensitive information, potentially inflicting severe damage on the business. Consequently, it is essential for companies to invest significantly in cybersecurity measures to safeguard their networks, which can be both costly and time-consuming.

Communication difficulties present another challenge. Although a networked structure can enhance communication by dismantling barriers between various segments of the organisation, it can also result in information overload. Employees may find it challenging to manage the substantial volume of information circulating through the network, leading to confusion and inefficiencies. Additionally, the absence of face-to-face interactions may contribute to misunderstandings and weaken personal connections, ultimately affecting team cohesion and morale.

Dependency on technology is yet another critical challenge. A networked organisational structure relies extensively on technological systems to function effectively. Should these systems fail, the business may experience significant disruptions. For instance, if the network goes down, employees may be unable to access the necessary information to perform their jobs, resulting in delays and decreased productivity. Furthermore, organisations may need to allocate funds for costly technology upgrades to ensure the network operates smoothly, which can strain their financial resources.

Lastly, a networked organisational structure can lead to ambiguity in leadership and accountability. In a traditional hierarchical structure, decision-making authority and accountability are clearly defined. However, in a networked structure, decision-making responsibilities are often dispersed throughout the network, which can create confusion and dilute accountability. This diffusion can complicate performance management and hinder efforts to align everyone towards common goals.

In conclusion, while a networked organisational structure offers numerous advantages, it also introduces several challenges that businesses must carefully assess and address.
