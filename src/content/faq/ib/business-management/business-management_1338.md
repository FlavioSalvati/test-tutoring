A sole trader is an individual business owner, while a partnership consists of two or more people who share ownership and responsibilities.

A sole trader, also referred to as a sole proprietor, is someone who independently owns and operates a business. This structure represents the simplest form of business organization, granting the sole trader complete control over all business decisions. For tax and liability purposes, the business and the owner are treated as a single entity. Consequently, the owner bears personal responsibility for all business debts and liabilities. The profits generated by the business are classified as the owner's personal income and are taxed accordingly.

In contrast, a partnership is a business arrangement in which two or more individuals jointly own the business. Each partner contributes in various ways, such as providing capital, assets, labor, or expertise. In return, all partners share in the profits and losses of the business. Partnerships tend to be more complex because they necessitate a partnership agreement, which stipulates the operational framework of the partnership, outlines the distribution of profits and losses, and establishes procedures for resolving disputes.

Regarding liability, partners are personally accountable for the business's debts and liabilities, similar to a sole trader. However, a unique aspect of partnerships is that each partner is also liable for the actions of the other partners, a principle known as joint and several liability.

From a taxation perspective, partnerships are not taxed as separate entities. Instead, each partner reports their share of the partnership's income or loss on their personal tax returns.

In summary, the primary distinction between a sole trader and a partnership lies in the number of owners and how responsibilities, profits, losses, and liabilities are distributed. A sole trader maintains full control and accountability, whereas these elements are collectively managed among the partners in a partnership. Both business structures offer distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them should be based on the specific circumstances and goals of the business owners.
