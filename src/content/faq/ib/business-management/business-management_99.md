The primary functions of Human Resource Management (HRM) encompass recruitment, training and development, performance management, and employee relations.

HRM is a vital component of any organization, tasked with managing its most valuable asset: its people. The first key function of HRM is recruitment. This process involves attracting, screening, selecting, and onboarding qualified candidates for various positions. The HR department is responsible for crafting job descriptions, advertising job openings, conducting interviews, and making hiring decisions. Additionally, they oversee the onboarding process, ensuring that new employees are effectively introduced to the company and its culture.

The second essential function is training and development. HRM is charged with identifying the skills and knowledge that employees need to perform their roles effectively, and subsequently providing the necessary training. This training may take various forms, including on-the-job training, mentoring programs, workshops, or professional development courses. Furthermore, HRM plays a significant role in career development, assisting employees in planning their career paths and offering opportunities for advancement within the organization.

Performance management constitutes another critical function of HRM. This process involves establishing performance standards, conducting performance reviews, offering feedback, and addressing underperformance. The objective of performance management is to ensure that employees meet their performance goals and contribute to the overall success of the organization. HRM employs performance management systems to monitor and evaluate employee performance and to identify areas where additional training or support may be necessary.

Lastly, HRM is responsible for managing employee relations. This includes addressing issues such as workplace conflicts, grievances, disciplinary actions, and redundancies. HRM also plays a crucial role in fostering a positive workplace culture, ensuring that employees feel valued and engaged. They may also negotiate employment contracts and manage employee benefits.

In summary, the primary functions of Human Resource Management involve recruiting and onboarding new employees, providing training and development opportunities, managing performance, and handling employee relations. These functions collectively aim to ensure that the organization maintains a skilled, motivated, and engaged workforce.
