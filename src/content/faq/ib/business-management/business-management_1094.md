Sales forecasting employs several primary methods, including time series analysis, regression analysis, and qualitative approaches.

**Time Series Analysis**  
Time series analysis is a statistical technique focused on data collected over time, also known as trend analysis. This method identifies patterns or trends in historical data, which are then utilized to predict future sales. For example, if a company's sales have consistently increased by $10\%$ each year for the past five years, it might project a similar growth rate for the upcoming year. However, it's important to note that this method assumes that the factors influencing sales will remain stable over time, which may not always hold true.

**Regression Analysis**  
In contrast, regression analysis is a statistical method used to estimate the relationships among multiple variables. This approach includes various techniques for modeling and analyzing relationships, particularly focusing on the connection between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the context of sales forecasting, the dependent variable typically represents sales, while independent variables might include factors such as price, advertising expenditure, GDP, and other relevant metrics. Regression analysis aids in understanding how changes in any of the independent variables can affect the expected value of the dependent variable.

**Qualitative Methods**  
Qualitative forecasting methods are often employed when data is scarce, unavailable, or outdated. Common qualitative techniques include the Delphi method, market research, and historical life-cycle analogy. The Delphi method aims to reach a consensus estimate by consulting a panel of experts. Market research usually involves conducting surveys or interviews with customers and potential customers to gather insights. The historical life-cycle analogy relies on the sales history of similar products to forecast the expected sales of a new product.

Each forecasting method has its strengths and weaknesses. The selection of a particular method often depends on specific circumstances, including data availability and quality, the desired accuracy of forecasts, and the time frame of the projections. Many businesses also opt to combine these methods to generate more accurate and reliable sales forecasts.
