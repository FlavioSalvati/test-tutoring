A business can increase its total revenue by boosting sales, raising prices, expanding its market, or introducing new products or services.

Increasing sales is one of the most straightforward ways to increase total revenue. This can be achieved through various strategies such as improving marketing efforts, offering discounts or promotions, or enhancing the quality of products or services. For instance, a business might invest in a more aggressive advertising campaign to reach a larger audience and attract more customers. Alternatively, it could offer special deals or loyalty programmes to incentivise repeat purchases and increase the volume of sales.

Raising prices is another strategy to increase revenue. However, this must be done carefully as it could potentially deter customers if the price increase is too significant or not justified by a corresponding increase in value. Businesses must consider factors such as the price elasticity of demand for their product or service, their competitive position, and the potential impact on customer loyalty and satisfaction.

Expanding the market is a more long-term strategy for increasing revenue. This could involve entering new geographical markets, targeting new customer segments, or diversifying into new product categories. For example, a business that currently operates only domestically might consider exporting its products to international markets to reach a larger customer base. Alternatively, a business might identify untapped customer segments within its existing market and tailor its marketing efforts to appeal to these new customers.

Lastly, introducing new products or services can also contribute to increased revenue. This could involve innovating existing products or services to create new variations, or developing entirely new offerings to diversify the business's product portfolio. This strategy not only provides additional sources of revenue but also helps to mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single product or service. However, businesses must also consider the costs and risks associated with product development and ensure that there is sufficient demand for the new offering.

In conclusion, there are various strategies that a business can employ to increase its total revenue. The choice of strategy will depend on the specific circumstances and objectives of the business, as well as the characteristics of its market and customers.
