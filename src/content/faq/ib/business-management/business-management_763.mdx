Mergers and acquisitions are distinct concepts in the world of corporate transactions. A merger involves the combination of two companies of roughly equal size to form a new entity, whereas an acquisition refers to one company purchasing another.

In a merger, two companies agree to unite as a single new organization rather than maintain separate operations. This scenario is often described as a "merger of equals." In this process, both companies surrender their existing stocks, and new shares of the combined company are issued. For instance, when Daimler-Benz and Chrysler merged, both companies ceased to exist independently, and they created a new entity known as DaimlerChrysler.

Conversely, in an acquisition, one company takes control of another, clearly establishing itself as the new owner. In this case, the target company dissolves, and the acquiring company integrates the business into its operations, with the acquirer's stock continuing to be publicly traded. Legally, the target company—the one being purchased—ceases to exist, while the acquirer retains its corporate identity and stock.

In practice, true mergers of equals are relatively rare. Often, when one company acquires another, the terms of the deal may allow the acquired firm to present the transaction as a merger of equals. This is frequently done to mitigate the negative connotations associated with being bought out. Consequently, it can be advantageous for both parties to frame the transaction as a merger, even if it is fundamentally an acquisition.

The terms "merger" and "acquisition" are frequently used interchangeably, yet they possess distinct meanings. An acquisition occurs when one company takes over another and establishes itself as the new owner. From a legal standpoint, the target company dissolves, and the acquirer integrates the business while continuing to trade its own stock.

Ultimately, the primary strategic distinction between mergers and acquisitions lies in the dynamics of equality and power between the involved companies. Mergers usually occur between companies of similar size and are characterized by a collaborative approach, while acquisitions typically involve a larger company absorbing a smaller one.
