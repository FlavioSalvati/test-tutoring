Inflation rates play a critical role in influencing investment appraisal outcomes by impacting both the real return on investment and the cost of capital.

Inflation is defined as the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, leading to a decline in purchasing power. When evaluating an investment, it is essential to account for the potential effects of inflation on projected returns. The real return on an investment, which is calculated after adjusting for inflation, may be significantly lower than the nominal return, which is the return prior to any adjustments for inflation. In situations where the inflation rate is high, the disparity between the real return and the nominal return can be pronounced, potentially rendering an investment less appealing than it initially seems.

Furthermore, inflation affects the cost of capital—the expense of a company’s funds, which includes both debt and equity. For investors, this refers to the required rate of return on the existing securities of a portfolio company. Inflation can elevate the cost of capital in two primary ways. First, it can raise the cost of borrowing. During periods of high inflation, lenders typically demand higher interest rates to offset the anticipated decline in the purchasing power of the money they will receive in the future. Consequently, this leads to an increase in the company's cost of debt, further raising the overall cost of capital. Second, inflation can heighten the required rate of return on equity. In times of elevated inflation, investors generally seek a higher return on their investments to compensate for the diminishing purchasing power of their future returns. This scenario can increase a company's cost of equity, thereby contributing to a higher cost of capital.

In summary, inflation rates can profoundly affect investment appraisal outcomes. They can diminish the real return on investment and escalate the cost of capital, both of which can make an investment appear less attractive. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate the potential impact of inflation on projected returns and the cost of capital when assessing an investment opportunity.
