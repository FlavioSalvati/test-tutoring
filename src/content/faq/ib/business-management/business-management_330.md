Businesses can enhance their Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) ratio by streamlining their collection processes and refining their credit policies.

The DSO ratio measures the average number of days a company takes to collect revenue after a sale is made. A lower DSO value indicates that a company collects its accounts receivable more quickly, while a higher DSO suggests that the company is extending credit to customers and taking longer to receive payment.

One of the most effective strategies for improving the DSO ratio is to accelerate the collection process. This can be accomplished by offering incentives for early payments, such as discounts. For example, a company might provide a $2\%$ discount if an invoice is paid within $10$ days. This approach not only encourages customers to pay sooner but also enhances the company's cash flow.

Another crucial strategy involves refining credit policies. Businesses should conduct thorough credit checks before extending credit to customers, ensuring they engage with financially stable clients who are likely to pay their bills on time. Additionally, it is essential to establish clear credit terms and ensure that customers fully understand them. This includes specifying the credit period, the credit amount, and the consequences of late payments.

Implementing an efficient invoicing system can also significantly reduce the DSO ratio. Invoices should be sent promptly and must be clear and accurate to avoid any payment delays. Utilizing electronic invoicing can expedite this process and provide a record of when the invoice was sent and received.

Finally, businesses may consider enlisting a collections agency for overdue accounts. While this option may seem drastic, it can be effective in recovering unpaid debts. However, it should be treated as a last resort, as it can potentially harm the relationship with the customer.

In conclusion, enhancing the DSO ratio requires a multifaceted approach that combines strategies to accelerate the collection process, improve credit policies, and ensure efficient invoicing. By implementing these strategies, businesses can bolster their cash flow and overall financial health.
