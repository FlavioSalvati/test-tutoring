The acid-test ratio is regarded as a more stringent measure of liquidity than the current ratio, as it excludes inventory from current assets.

Also known as the quick ratio, the acid-test ratio assesses a company's short-term liquidity and its capacity to meet immediate obligations without relying on inventory sales. The calculation involves subtracting inventory from current assets and dividing the result by current liabilities. This ratio is deemed more conservative than the current ratio, as it omits inventory, which may not be readily converted into cash.

In contrast, the current ratio encompasses all current assets, including inventory. It is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. While this ratio provides a broader perspective on a company's short-term financial health, it can potentially overstate liquidity if a substantial portion of current assets is tied up in inventory that cannot be quickly liquidated.

Inventory is typically excluded from the acid-test ratio because it is not always easily convertible into cash. The speed and ease of selling inventory depend on several factors, such as the type of inventory, prevailing market conditions, and the company's sales strategies. For instance, a business dealing in perishable goods may find it challenging to convert its inventory into cash rapidly without incurring losses. Similarly, companies in slow-moving industries may struggle to sell their inventory quickly.

By excluding inventory, the acid-test ratio presents a more conservative view of a company's liquidity. It emphasizes the most liquid assets—cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable—that can be swiftly converted into cash to fulfill immediate obligations. This makes the acid-test ratio a more stringent measure compared to the current ratio, which might portray a more optimistic view of a company's short-term financial health due to the inclusion of inventory.

In summary, both the acid-test ratio and the current ratio serve as valuable tools for evaluating a company's short-term liquidity. However, the acid-test ratio is considered more stringent because it excludes inventory from its calculation, thereby offering a more conservative assessment of a company's ability to meet its immediate obligations without having to sell inventory.
