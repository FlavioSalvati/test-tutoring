A limited company is a distinct type of business structure that possesses its own legal identity, separate from that of its owners. This separation means that the company can engage in contracts, own assets, and initiate or respond to legal actions under its own name. Importantly, the owners of a limited company are shielded from personal liability concerning the company's debts; their financial responsibility is limited to the extent of their investment or guarantees provided to the company.

One of the defining features of a limited company is its share capital. Share capital refers to the total amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company. Each shareholder holds a portion of the company, represented by shares, which correspond to a fraction of the overall share capital. Shareholders have the right to receive a share of the company’s profits, typically distributed as dividends.

Another significant aspect of a limited company is its governance structure. The company is managed by directors, who are appointed by the shareholders. These directors oversee the daily operations of the company and are accountable to the shareholders. The relationship between shareholders and directors is regulated by the company's articles of association, a foundational document that outlines the rules for the company's operation.

Limited companies are also subject to specific reporting and disclosure obligations. They are required to prepare annual financial statements, which must be audited if the company meets certain size criteria. These financial statements are publicly accessible documents, allowing anyone to review them. Additionally, limited companies must file annual returns with Companies House, which provide essential information regarding the company’s directors, shareholders, and registered office.

From a taxation perspective, a limited company is liable to pay corporation tax on its profits. Conversely, shareholders may be subject to income tax on dividends they receive from the company. However, they are not taxed on the profits that the company retains for reinvestment.

In summary, a limited company operates independently from its owners, enabling it to own property and engage in legal proceedings. Owners are at financial risk only for their investment, safeguarding their personal assets. The company is financed through shareholder investments and managed by appointed directors, all while adhering to stringent regulations, including the preparation of annual financial reports. The company pays corporation tax, while shareholders are taxed on any dividends received.
