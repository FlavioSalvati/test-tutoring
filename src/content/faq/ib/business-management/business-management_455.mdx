To effectively assess the accuracy of past sales forecasts, several key metrics are essential: forecast error, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

**Forecast Error**  
Forecast error serves as a fundamental metric for evaluating the accuracy of sales predictions. It is calculated by subtracting the actual sales from the forecasted sales. A positive forecast error indicates that actual sales exceeded the forecast, while a negative forecast error suggests that actual sales fell short of the forecast. This metric offers a straightforward way to gauge forecast accuracy; however, it does not consider the scale of the sales or the forecast itself.

**Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**  
Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is another critical metric used to measure the accuracy of sales forecasts. It is computed by averaging the absolute differences between the forecasted and actual sales values. MAD provides a comprehensive measure of the average error in the sales forecast without regard to the direction of the error. This metric is particularly valuable when comparing the accuracy of various forecasting methods or models, as it delivers a single, easily interpretable figure representing forecast accuracy.

**Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**  
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is akin to MAD, but it expresses the forecast error as a percentage of actual sales. This characteristic makes MAPE especially useful for comparing forecast accuracy across different products or time periods, as it accounts for the scale of sales. MAPE is calculated by averaging the absolute percentage differences between the forecasted and actual sales.

In addition to these metrics, analyzing the distribution of forecast errors can also yield valuable insights. This analysis can reveal whether the errors are random or if there are systematic biases present in the forecasts. For instance, if forecast errors are consistently positive, it may indicate a pattern of underestimating sales. Conversely, if errors are consistently negative, this could suggest a trend of overestimating sales.
