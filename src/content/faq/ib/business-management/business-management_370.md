Reviewing past investment appraisals for ongoing projects is essential for evaluating performance, managing risks, and guiding future decision-making.

Investment appraisal plays a pivotal role in the decision-making process of any business. It involves assessing the viability of an investment proposal through various methodologies, including net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period. These appraisals provide a snapshot of the potential profitability and risks associated with a project at a specific point in time. However, as projects evolve, the initial assumptions made during the appraisal may become outdated. Thus, it is imperative to regularly review past investment appraisals for ongoing projects.

Firstly, reviewing past appraisals enables businesses to evaluate project performance. By comparing actual outcomes with projected figures, organizations can ascertain whether a project is on course to achieve its financial goals. If a project is underperforming, this review can uncover the underlying reasons and suggest corrective measures. Conversely, if a project exceeds expectations, the review can identify the factors contributing to its success, which can then be leveraged in future endeavors.

Secondly, past investment appraisals assist in managing risks. Given that projects typically involve substantial financial commitments, they inherently carry a degree of risk. Regular reviews of past appraisals allow businesses to monitor these risks and take proactive measures if they begin to escalate. For instance, if actual costs exceed estimated costs significantly, this may signal a risk of cost overruns, prompting the business to adjust its budget or reconsider the project's feasibility.

Lastly, past investment appraisals can provide insights for future decisions. They reveal valuable information about the accuracy of the businessâ€™s forecasting and appraisal techniques. If actual results frequently diverge from projections, it may indicate a need to refine the appraisal methods used. Additionally, lessons learned from these reviews can inform the business's strategy for future investments.

In conclusion, the practice of reviewing past investment appraisals for ongoing projects is a fundamental aspect of effective business management. It empowers organizations to assess performance, manage risks, and make more informed investment decisions.
