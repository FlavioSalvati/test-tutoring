When sales prices increase, the break-even point decreases, provided that all other factors remain constant.

The break-even point is the level of sales at which total revenue equals total costs, indicating that the business is not making a profit or incurring a loss. It is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Break-even point} = \frac{\text{Total Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution Margin Ratio}}
$$

The contribution margin ratio is determined by subtracting the variable cost per unit from the selling price per unit. Therefore, when the selling price per unit increases, the contribution margin ratio also rises, which in turn leads to a decrease in the break-even point.

To illustrate this concept, consider the following example: A company has fixed costs of £10,000, a selling price per unit of £50, and a variable cost per unit of £30. The contribution margin per unit is calculated as:

$$
\text{Contribution Margin} = £50 - £30 = £20
$$

Thus, the break-even point in units is:

$$
\text{Break-even Point} = \frac{£10,000}{£20} = 500 \text{ units}
$$

Now, if the selling price per unit increases to £60, the new contribution margin per unit becomes:

$$
\text{New Contribution Margin} = £60 - £30 = £30
$$

Consequently, the break-even point decreases to:

$$
\text{New Break-even Point} = \frac{£10,000}{£30} \approx 333.33 \text{ units}
$$

This reduction in the break-even point signifies that the company must sell fewer units to cover its costs, which can positively impact cash flow and risk management. However, it is essential to recognize that this example simplifies the dynamics of real-world business operations. An increase in selling price may influence product demand, which could affect the total number of units sold. Additionally, it could lead to increased variable costs due to factors like higher commission rates for sales staff.

In summary, when a company raises its selling price, it decreases the amount it needs to sell to cover its costs, thus lowering the break-even point. This allows the business to reach its no-profit, no-loss threshold more quickly. Nevertheless, real-world scenarios, such as fluctuations in demand or variable costs, can complicate the actual outcome.
