Non-operating incomes and expenses can have a substantial effect on profitability ratios by altering the net income figures of a company.

Profitability ratios are key financial metrics employed by analysts and investors to assess and evaluate a company's capacity to generate income (profit) in relation to its revenue, balance sheet assets, operating costs, and shareholders' equity over a specific time frame. These ratios reveal how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profit and create value for shareholders. However, non-operating incomes and expenses—which arise from activities outside a company's primary business operations—can significantly influence these ratios.

Non-operating income may include various items, such as interest income, gains from asset sales, or earnings from investments. Although these revenues are not generated from the company’s core activities, they still contribute to the overall profitability. When non-operating income is substantial, it can artificially inflate profitability ratios, presenting the company as more profitable than it truly is based solely on its core operations.

Conversely, non-operating expenses encompass costs that are not directly associated with the company's main business activities. Examples include interest expenses, losses from asset sales, or legal settlement costs. These expenses detract from the company's overall profitability. When non-operating expenses are high, they can depress profitability ratios, leading to an impression of diminished profitability.

For instance, consider a scenario where a company sells a piece of real estate and realizes a significant gain. This non-operating income will boost the company's net income for that period, consequently increasing profitability ratios such as the net profit margin, return on assets, and return on equity. This increase occurs even though the income was not derived from the company’s core business operations.

On the flip side, if a company faces a large non-operating expense, such as a lawsuit settlement, it will decrease the net income for that period. This reduction will negatively impact profitability ratios, making the company appear less profitable, despite the fact that the expense is unrelated to its core business activities.

Therefore, when analyzing a company's profitability ratios, it is crucial to account for the effects of non-operating incomes and expenses. These elements can significantly distort the true profitability derived from the company's primary operations.
