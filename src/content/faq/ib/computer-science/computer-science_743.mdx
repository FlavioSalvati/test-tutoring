Web graphs are essential tools for ranking search results by analyzing the interconnections between web pages to ascertain their relevance and importance.

A web graph serves as a visual representation of the internet, where each node symbolizes a web page, and each edge represents a hyperlink connecting two pages. This structure is utilized by search engines to rank search results through a method known as 'link analysis'. The underlying principle is that a web page gains greater importance or relevance if it is linked to by many other pages, particularly if those linking pages are themselves deemed important.

One of the most renowned algorithms that employs web graphs for search result ranking is Google's PageRank. PageRank assigns a numerical weight to each element within a hyperlinked collection of documents, such as the World Wide Web, with the goal of quantifying its relative importance within that set. This algorithm can be applied to any collection of entities characterized by reciprocal citations and references. The numerical weight assigned to a specific element $E$ is known as the PageRank of $E$, denoted as $PR(E)$.

The PageRank algorithm produces a probability distribution that indicates the likelihood of a user randomly clicking on links to arrive at any given page. PageRank can be computed for collections of documents of any size. In various research papers, it is commonly assumed that the initial distribution of PageRank is evenly distributed among all documents in the collection. The computation of PageRank necessitates multiple passes, referred to as "iterations," through the collection to refine the approximate PageRank values, bringing them closer to their theoretical true values.

Another notable algorithm that leverages web graphs is the HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm. This algorithm evaluates web pages not only based on their relevance to search terms but also on their quality. The quality of a web page is assessed by the number of links it receives from other high-quality pages.

In conclusion, web graphs are pivotal in the ranking of search results. They enable search engines to gauge the relevance and importance of web pages, ultimately delivering more accurate and valuable search results to users.
