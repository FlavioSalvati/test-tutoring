Distributed systems are engineered to be resilient, enabling them to recover from failures through various strategies such as redundancy, replication, checkpointing, and logging mechanisms.

The primary goal of distributed systems is to maintain functionality even when certain components fail. This resilience is accomplished through a combination of strategies that ensure the system can operate effectively under adverse conditions.

One of the fundamental strategies employed is redundancy. This approach involves using multiple instances of the same component. If one instance fails, another can seamlessly take over its responsibilities. Redundancy is often paired with load balancing, which distributes the workload across multiple instances. This prevents any single instance from becoming a bottleneck or point of failure.

Replication is another critical strategy in distributed systems. This involves duplicating data across multiple nodes. If one node experiences a failure, the data remains accessible from another node. This not only guarantees data availability but also enhances performance, as requests can be served from the nearest available node. There are various replication strategies, including:

- **Master-Slave Replication**: In this model, one node (the master) is responsible for updating the data, while other nodes (the slaves) replicate the data from the master.
- **Peer-to-Peer Replication**: Here, all nodes can update the data independently, and changes are propagated to other nodes throughout the system.

Checkpointing is a technique that involves saving the state of the system at regular intervals. In the event of a failure, the system can restart from the most recent checkpoint, minimizing the amount of work lost. Checkpointing can be classified into two types:

- **Coordinated Checkpointing**: All nodes save their state simultaneously.
- **Uncoordinated Checkpointing**: Each node saves its state independently.

Logging is another essential mechanism for recovery. It entails recording the actions performed by the system so that, in the event of a failure, the system can retrace its steps and reverse any actions that contributed to the failure. This method is particularly useful for recovering from software errors or data corruption.

In addition to these strategies, distributed systems implement fault detection and fault tolerance techniques to identify and manage failures. Fault detection involves monitoring the system to identify failures, while fault tolerance refers to designing the system to continue functioning correctly even in the presence of failures. By integrating these techniques with redundancy, replication, checkpointing, and logging, distributed systems can effectively recover from failures and provide reliable service.
