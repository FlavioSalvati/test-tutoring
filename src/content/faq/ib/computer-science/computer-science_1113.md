Yes, two-dimensional arrays can indeed have different lengths for each row.

In computer science, a two-dimensional array is fundamentally an array of arrays. The 'outer' array holds 'inner' arrays as its elements. These inner arrays can vary in length, resulting in what is known as a 'jagged array', which is also referred to as a ragged array or a list of lists. This differs from a 'rectangular' or 'square' array, where each row contains the same number of elements.

Many programming languages, including Java, C#, and Python, allow two-dimensional arrays to be non-rectangular. This means that each 'row' (or 'column', depending on your perspective) can have a different length. The reason for this flexibility is that a two-dimensional array is essentially an array of references to other arrays. Each of these referenced arrays can be allocated separately and may have different lengths.

For instance, in Java, you can create a jagged two-dimensional array with varying row lengths as follows:

'''java
int[][] jaggedArray = new int[3][];
jaggedArray[0] = new int[5];
jaggedArray[1] = new int[3];
jaggedArray[2] = new int[7];
'''

In this example, the variable 'jaggedArray' represents a two-dimensional array with three rows. The first row contains $5$ elements, the second row has $3$ elements, and the third row consists of $7$ elements.

However, it is important to note that not all programming languages support jagged arrays. In some languages, such as C and C++, two-dimensional arrays must be rectangular. This restriction arises because these languages treat a two-dimensional array as a single contiguous block of memory, rather than as an array of references to other arrays.

In conclusion, whether a two-dimensional array can have varying lengths for each row depends on the programming language being used. If your language supports jagged arrays, then it is indeed possible to have different lengths in each row. Conversely, if the language does not support this feature, then all rows must have the same length.
