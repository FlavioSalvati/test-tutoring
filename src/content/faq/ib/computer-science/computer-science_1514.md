Serverless computing aligns seamlessly with the distributed web paradigm by offering on-demand, scalable resources tailored for distributed applications.

In the distributed web paradigm, applications are architected to operate across multiple interconnected systems rather than relying on a single centralized server. This design enhances the resilience, scalability, and efficiency of web applications, enabling them to harness the collective resources of numerous systems. Serverless computing is ideally suited to this framework, as it empowers developers to create and deploy applications without the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure.

Often referred to as Function as a Service (FaaS), serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider dynamically handles the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application operates within stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (lasting only for a single invocation), and completely managed by the cloud provider. This arrangement allows developers to concentrate on writing application code instead of dealing with operational tasks associated with server management, such as capacity planning, patching, or scaling.

Within the context of the distributed web, serverless computing offers several significant advantages. First and foremost, it provides on-demand scalability. As the workload on a distributed application grows, serverless computing platforms can automatically provision additional resources to meet the increased demand. This capability enables distributed applications to scale seamlessly, requiring no manual intervention from developers.

Secondly, serverless computing facilitates the development of microservices, which are essential components of the distributed web. Microservices consist of small, independent services that collaborate to form a larger application. By leveraging serverless computing, developers can create and deploy individual microservices independently, which enhances the flexibility and agility of the development process.

Lastly, serverless computing can significantly improve the cost-efficiency of distributed applications. In traditional server-based models, developers are obligated to pay for a predetermined amount of server capacity, regardless of their actual usage. In contrast, serverless computing adopts a pay-as-you-go model, allowing developers to pay solely for the resources they consume. This can lead to substantial cost savings in operating distributed applications, particularly for workloads with variable or unpredictable demand.

In conclusion, serverless computing serves as a pivotal enabler of the distributed web paradigm, delivering on-demand, scalable resources that empower developers to create efficient, resilient, and cost-effective distributed applications.
