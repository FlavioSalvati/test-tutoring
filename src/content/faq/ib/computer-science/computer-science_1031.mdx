Channel overlap can lead to interference, significantly diminishing the performance and reliability of wireless networks.

To elaborate, wireless networks operate within specific frequency bands, which are divided into distinct channels. These channels function similarly to lanes on a motorway, facilitating the back-and-forth flow of data between devices. However, akin to a motorway where excessive vehicles (or data packets, in this context) attempt to occupy the same lane simultaneously, congestion can occur, resulting in a slowdown of overall traffic speed.

Channel overlap becomes problematic when two or more networks operate on overlapping channels, effectively trying to share the same 'lane' at the same time. This scenario can cause interference, as data packets from different networks may collide, disrupting one another. Such collisions can lead to a decrease in both speed and reliability, as devices are forced to repeatedly resend data packets that are lost or corrupted due to interference.

Moreover, channel overlap can also contribute to increased latency within a network. Latency refers to the duration it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another. When a network experiences significant interference due to channel overlap, it may take longer for data packets to reach their intended destination, as they often need to be resent multiple times. This situation can be particularly detrimental for applications that demand real-time data transmission, such as video streaming or online gaming.

To mitigate the effects of channel overlap, it is essential to manage channel usage within a wireless network carefully. This may involve selecting non-overlapping channels for different networks or employing advanced network management strategies, such as dynamic channel selection. Dynamic channel selection can automatically shift a network to a less congested channel when necessary, thereby enhancing performance and reliability.
