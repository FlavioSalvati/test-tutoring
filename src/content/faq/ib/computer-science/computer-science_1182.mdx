To split a linked list into two halves, the first step is to locate the middle node and then separate the list at that point.

In detail, the process of splitting a linked list involves traversing the list to identify the middle node, after which the list is divided into two distinct sublists. This can be effectively accomplished using the slow and fast pointer technique, commonly referred to as the hare and tortoise method. For additional information on linked lists, please refer to relevant resources.

To begin, initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the linked list. The `slow` pointer advances one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps with each iteration. Consequently, when the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be positioned at the middle node. This is due to the fact that the `fast` pointer travels at twice the speed of the `slow` pointer.

After identifying the middle of the list, the next step is to split the linked list into two halves. This can be accomplished by setting the `next` pointer of the `slow` pointer (which now points to the end of the first half) to `null`. This action effectively breaks the connection between the two halves of the list. The head of the first half remains as the original head of the list, while the head of the second half is designated as the node following the middle node.
