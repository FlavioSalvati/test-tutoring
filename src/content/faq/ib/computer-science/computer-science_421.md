Resource limitations can severely impair network performance, resulting in slow speeds, increased latency, and even potential system crashes.

The performance of a network is largely contingent upon the availability of various resources, which include bandwidth, processing power, memory, and storage. When these resources are restricted, a range of issues may arise, adversely affecting network functionality.

**Bandwidth** is one of the most crucial resources in a network. It represents the maximum data transfer rate of a network or internet connection. When bandwidth is constrained, users may experience sluggish speeds and heightened latency. This occurs because the network struggles to accommodate the volume of data being transmitted, leading to delays and slow response times. For instance, if a network is designed to support $100$ users but $200$ users attempt to access it simultaneously, the network will likely become congested, resulting in performance degradation.

**Processing power** is another vital resource. It denotes the capacity of a computer or network device to process data efficiently. If processing power is insufficient, the network might experience sluggishness or even crashes. This situation arises when a device cannot manage the volume of data being sent and received. For example, a server running multiple applications and services may lack the necessary processing power to handle all tasks effectively, leading to slow performance or system failures.

**Memory** and **storage** are equally important resources. Memory is utilized to temporarily hold data while it is being processed. Limited memory can cause the network to slow down or crash, as it cannot accommodate all the data it needs to handle. Conversely, storage is used for long-term data retention. If storage capacity is limited, the network may run out of space for data storage, potentially resulting in data loss.

In summary, resource limitations can profoundly affect network performance, leading to slow speeds, increased latency, and the risk of system crashes. It is, therefore, essential to ensure that a network is equipped with adequate resources to manage the volume of data being transmitted and received effectively.
