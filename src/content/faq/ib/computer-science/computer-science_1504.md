Techniques for detecting and evading web crawler activities encompass several methods, including IP address analysis, user-agent string analysis, and behavioral analysis.

**IP Address Analysis**  
One of the most common techniques for detecting web crawlers is the analysis of IP addresses. Web servers can monitor the IP addresses that send requests. If a single IP address generates a high volume of requests within a short timeframe, it is likely that a web crawler is responsible for these requests. To avoid detection, web crawlers often utilize proxy servers to distribute their requests across multiple IP addresses.

**User-Agent String Analysis**  
Another method employed to identify web crawlers is user-agent string analysis. When a web browser or web crawler makes a request to a web server, it transmits a user-agent string that indicates the software making the request. Web servers can analyze these strings to detect requests from known web crawlers. However, web crawlers can circumvent this detection by altering their user-agent strings to resemble those of standard web browsers.

**Behavioral Analysis**  
Behavioral analysis represents a more sophisticated approach to detecting web crawler activities. This technique involves examining the patterns of requests made to a web server. For instance, web crawlers may make requests in a systematic and predictable manner, or they might access pages that are not typically visited by human users. To evade such scrutiny, web crawlers can randomize the sequence of their requests and include requests to commonly accessed pages in their activity.

**Advanced Detection Methods**  
In addition to the aforementioned techniques, there are also more advanced methods for detecting and blocking web crawlers, such as CAPTCHA tests and JavaScript challenges. CAPTCHA tests are designed to be easy for humans to solve but challenging for automated software. JavaScript challenges involve delivering a piece of JavaScript code that must be executed correctly for the server to process the request. This can pose difficulties for web crawlers, as they typically lack the ability to execute JavaScript successfully. 

In summary, the battle between web crawlers and detection methods continues to evolve, with both sides developing increasingly sophisticated techniques.
