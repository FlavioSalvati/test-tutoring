A stack can be effectively implemented using an array, utilizing push and pop operations to manage the addition and removal of elements.

A stack is a linear data structure that adheres to a specific order for performing operations. This order can be characterized as LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). The two primary operations associated with stacks are push and pop. The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while the pop operation removes the element from the top.

To create a stack using an array, the first step is to declare an array of a specified size. This size will dictate the maximum number of elements that the stack can accommodate. Additionally, a variable is needed to keep track of the stack's top position. This variable should be initialized to $-1$ to signify that the stack is currently empty.

The push operation involves incrementing the top variable and then placing the new element at the index specified by this variable. Prior to executing the push operation, it is essential to check if the stack is full. This can be determined by comparing the top variable to the maximum size of the array. If the top variable equals the maximum size of the array minus one, then the stack is considered full.

Conversely, the pop operation entails retrieving the element at the index indicated by the top variable and subsequently decrementing the top variable. Before executing the pop operation, a check must be performed to confirm that the stack is not empty. This is done by comparing the top variable to $-1$. If the top variable is $-1$, it indicates that the stack is empty.

In addition to the push and pop operations, other useful operations can be implemented, such as peek (which returns the top element without removing it), isFull (which checks if the stack is full), and isEmpty (which checks if the stack is empty). These operations can be efficiently managed using the top variable and the array.
