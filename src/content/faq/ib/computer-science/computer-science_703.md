Redundancy in distributed web systems is effectively managed through techniques such as replication and load balancing.

In distributed web systems, redundancy plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability, availability, and fault tolerance. Redundancy refers to the duplication of essential components or functions within a system, aimed at enhancing its reliability. This duplication often takes the form of backups or fail-safes.

One primary method for achieving redundancy is through replication. Replication entails creating multiple copies of data and storing them in various locations. This approach guarantees that if one server fails, the data remains accessible from other servers. Replication can occur in real-time, known as synchronous replication, or at scheduled intervals, referred to as asynchronous replication. Synchronous replication maintains identical copies of data at all times, but it requires more resources and may result in slower system performance. Conversely, asynchronous replication allows for minor discrepancies between data copies, using fewer resources and minimizing the impact on system speed.

Another effective strategy for managing redundancy is load balancing. Load balancing involves distributing network traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed. This process not only enables the system to manage high traffic volumes without crashing but also incorporates redundancy. In the event of a server failure, the load balancer can redirect traffic to the remaining operational servers, thereby maintaining system availability.

In addition to replication and load balancing, distributed web systems can employ techniques such as sharding. Sharding involves dividing data into smaller, more manageable segments, with each segment stored on a different server. This strategy aids in handling large data volumes while providing an additional layer of redundancy.

In summary, managing redundancy in distributed web systems is a multifaceted challenge that requires a combination of various techniques. The primary objective is to ensure that the system remains reliable and accessible, even in scenarios involving server failures or spikes in traffic.
