To prevent a stack overflow in a fixed-size stack array, it is essential to check the stack's capacity before pushing new elements onto it.

A stack overflow occurs when more items are pushed onto a stack than it can accommodate. This issue is particularly prevalent in fixed-size stack arrays, where the size is determined at the time of creation and cannot be altered thereafter. To avoid this problem, you must implement a mechanism that verifies whether the stack has sufficient space for new elements before pushing them onto it.

In most programming languages, this can be accomplished by comparing the current size of the stack (i.e., the number of elements it currently contains) with its maximum capacity. If the current size is less than the maximum capacity, there is still room on the stack, allowing you to safely push a new element onto it. Conversely, if the current size is equal to the maximum capacity, the stack is full, and you should refrain from attempting to push a new element, as doing so would lead to a stack overflow.

Moreover, it is crucial to handle potential stack overflows gracefully. This can be achieved by throwing an exception or returning an error message when an attempt is made to push an element onto a full stack. By doing so, your program can respond appropriately, such as notifying the user of the issue or freeing up space on the stack before proceeding.

In summary, preventing a stack overflow in a fixed-size stack array requires meticulous management of the stack's capacity. By checking the stack's capacity before adding new elements and by gracefully handling any potential overflow situations, you can ensure that your program operates smoothly and efficiently.
