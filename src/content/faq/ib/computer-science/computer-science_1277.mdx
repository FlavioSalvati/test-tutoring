Distributed systems provide several advantages over centralized systems, including enhanced performance, scalability, reliability, and efficient resource sharing.

The core distinction between these two types of systems lies in their architecture: distributed systems operate across multiple machines, whereas centralized systems are confined to a single machine. This fundamental difference results in various benefits for distributed systems. 

One of the primary advantages is improved performance. By allocating tasks among multiple machines, distributed systems can process data more rapidly and efficiently than a single machine alone. This capability is especially advantageous for tasks that demand substantial computational power or involve managing large volumes of data.
