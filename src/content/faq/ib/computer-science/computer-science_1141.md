You can dynamically allocate a two-dimensional array in C++ using pointers and the 'new' operator.

In C++, dynamic memory allocation is primarily handled through the 'new' and 'delete' operators. While the process for allocating two-dimensional arrays is slightly more intricate than for one-dimensional arrays, it operates on the same foundational principles. Essentially, a two-dimensional array can be thought of as an array of arrays, which necessitates the allocation of memory for each of these inner arrays individually.

To begin, you must declare a pointer to a pointer that will serve as a reference to the first element of the two-dimensional array. This is expressed with the syntax 'type **pointerName'. For instance, if you are creating an array of integers, you would declare it as 'int **array'.

Next, you will allocate memory for the rows of the array. This is accomplished using the 'new' operator, specifying the type of elements followed by the number of elements in brackets. For example, you would write:

$$
array = new int*[rowCount]
$$

This statement creates an array of pointers, each of which will point to a separate row of the two-dimensional array.

Subsequently, you need to allocate memory for each row individually. This can be achieved through a loop, where, for each iteration, you again use the 'new' operator to allocate memory for the columns of the current row. The syntax for this is:

$$
array[i] = new int[columnCount]
$$

This effectively creates an array of integers for each row.

It is crucial to remember that once you have finished using the array, you must deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks. This process should be carried out in reverse order: first, you deallocate each row with:

$$
delete [] array[i]
$$

And then, you deallocate the array of pointers using:

$$
delete [] array
$$

In summary, the dynamic allocation of a two-dimensional array involves creating a pointer to a pointer, allocating memory for the rows, and subsequently allocating memory for the columns of each row. Although this process is more complex than that of a one-dimensional array, it adheres to the same principles of dynamic memory allocation in C++.
