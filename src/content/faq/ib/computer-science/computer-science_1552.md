Graph theory serves as a fundamental framework for understanding web connectivity by representing websites as nodes and hyperlinks as edges, thereby creating a web graph.

To elaborate, graph theory is a branch of mathematics dedicated to studying the properties and structures of graphs. In the realm of web connectivity, a graph effectively models the architecture of the World Wide Web. Each website or webpage is represented as a node (or vertex), while each hyperlink connecting two webpages is depicted as an edge (or link) between two nodes. This configuration results in a web graph, which visually illustrates the interconnectedness of the web.

The application of graph theory to web connectivity facilitates the analysis of various characteristics of the web. For example, it enables the identification of the most influential websites by locating nodes with the highest number of connections, referred to as hubs. Additionally, it assists in uncovering communities of websites that are closely linked, known as clusters. Furthermore, graph theory aids in evaluating the navigability of the web by examining the shortest paths between nodes, a concept represented by the diameter of the graph.

One of the most notable applications of graph theory in web connectivity is Google's PageRank algorithm. This algorithm leverages the structure of the web graph to assess the importance of a webpage. It operates on the principle that a webpage gains significance when it is linked to by other important webpages. The PageRank of a specific webpage is computed based on the PageRanks of the pages that link to it, resulting in a recursive definition.

In summary, graph theory provides a powerful methodology for understanding and analyzing web connectivity. It allows for the visualization of the web's structure, the identification of influential websites and communities, and the assessment of web navigability. Moreover, it underpins algorithms such as PageRank, which evaluate the importance of webpages based on their connectivity within the web graph.
