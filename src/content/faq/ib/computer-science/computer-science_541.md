A database ensures data integrity through the implementation of constraints, triggers, and transactions, which collectively maintain the accuracy and consistency of the stored data.

Data integrity is a fundamental principle in database management, ensuring that the information entered into the database remains accurate, reliable, and consistent throughout its entire lifecycle. There are several mechanisms employed by a database management system (DBMS) to enforce data integrity, including constraints, triggers, and transactions.

**Constraints** are rules applied to specific fields within a database table that limit the type of data that can be stored. They help to validate the data, ensuring it is both reliable and appropriate. For instance, a constraint might stipulate that a field must contain a unique value or cannot be left empty (NULL). Constraints can also define relationships between tables, such as foreign key constraints, which ensure that the data in one field corresponds to valid data in another table.

**Triggers** provide another method for enforcing data integrity within a database. A trigger is a type of stored procedure that automatically executes in response to specific events, such as the insertion, updating, or deletion of data in a table. Triggers can enforce complex business rules and maintain intricate integrity constraints that cannot be managed through simple constraints alone. For example, a trigger might be utilized to automatically update a summary field whenever a record is added, modified, or removed.

**Transactions** represent a third mechanism for maintaining data integrity. A transaction is a sequence of one or more operations executed as a single unit of work. If all operations within the transaction are successfully completed, the transaction is committed, and the changes become permanent. Conversely, if an error occurs during any part of the transaction, the entire transaction is rolled back, restoring the database to its prior state. This approach guarantees that the database remains consistent, even in the face of system failures or errors.

In summary, data integrity is a crucial aspect of effective database management. By utilizing constraints, triggers, and transactions, a DBMS can ensure that the data stored within a database is always accurate, reliable, and consistent.
