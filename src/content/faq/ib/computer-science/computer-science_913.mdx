System calls serve as the crucial interfaces between a process and the operating system, enabling the process to request various services from the operating system.

In more detail, system calls are a specific type of procedure call made through a software interrupt by an active process, allowing it to access services managed by the operating system. These services can range from creating new processes to reading and writing files, or even communicating with hardware devices.

When a process invokes a system call, it initiates a transition from user mode to kernel mode. User mode is a restricted processing environment intended for applications, while kernel mode is a privileged state reserved for executing operating system code. This transition is essential because the services provided by system calls often require privileges that exceed those available in user mode.

The process of executing a system call involves several key steps. Initially, the process must specify the system call number and any necessary arguments. This is typically accomplished by placing them in designated locations, such as registers. The process then generates a software interrupt, which prompts the operating system to switch to kernel mode and carry out the requested system call. Upon completion of the system call, control is returned to the process, and the operating system reverts back to user mode.

System calls are vital for the proper functioning of any operating system. They facilitate a safe and controlled means for processes to interact with the operating system and hardware. Without system calls, processes would need to directly manipulate hardware or memory, which could result in errors and system instability. By providing a regulated interface, system calls help to ensure the stability and security of the system.

In summary, system calls are fundamental to the interaction between processes and the operating system. They offer a secure and controlled interface for processes to request services, thereby contributing to the overall stability and security of the system.
