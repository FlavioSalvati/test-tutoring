An integrated database system is a cohesive framework designed to manage and maintain data across various databases in a coordinated fashion.

This type of database system consolidates information from multiple sources into a unified, consistent, and easily accessible format. The primary objective of an integrated database system is to eliminate data redundancy and inconsistency, which often arise when information is stored across different databases.

Within an integrated database system, data from diverse databases is merged into a singular, cohesive database. This integration enables more efficient data management by centralizing all information, making it simpler to access and analyze. Moreover, by removing data redundancy, an integrated database system can conserve storage space and enhance overall system performance.

The integration process encompasses several key steps: data cleaning, data transformation, and data loading. 

- **Data cleaning** involves identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies within the data. 
- **Data transformation** refers to the process of converting the data into a format compatible with the integrated database system. 
- **Data loading** entails transferring the cleaned and transformed data into the unified database.

Integrated database systems are particularly advantageous for large organizations that maintain multiple databases. By integrating these various data sources, organizations can ensure their data remains consistent and up-to-date. This comprehensive access to accurate information empowers organizations to make more informed decisions.

Furthermore, integrated database systems can support a wide range of applications, including business intelligence and customer relationship management. These applications leverage the integrated data to provide valuable insights and analytics, ultimately aiding organizations in enhancing their operations and strategic planning.

In summary, an integrated database system is a robust solution for data management and maintenance. By unifying data from multiple databases into a single system, it effectively reduces data redundancy, boosts system performance, and accommodates a variety of applications.
