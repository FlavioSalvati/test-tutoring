A problem is best approached with a recursive solution when it can be decomposed into smaller, similar sub-problems, continuing this process until a base case is reached.

In essence, recursion is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into progressively smaller sub-problems until they become trivial to solve. Typically, this involves a function calling itself to handle these smaller instances. Recursion is particularly useful in scenarios where the same problem can be represented in smaller forms of itself.

To determine whether a problem is suitable for a recursive solution, look for problems that can be addressed by solving smaller instances of the same issue. For instance, problems that require traversing tree or graph data structures often lend themselves to recursive approaches, as the overall problem can be resolved by examining its sub-structures.

Another clear indicator of a problem that might benefit from recursion is if it can be defined in terms of itself. A quintessential example of this is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Thus, calculating a Fibonacci number can be expressed in relation to calculating smaller Fibonacci numbers.

Additionally, problems that involve backtracking—such as searching or sorting—frequently require recursive methods. This is because they can be tackled by exploring all potential solutions and retracting a step if it does not yield a satisfactory outcome, a process that can be inherently defined recursively.

However, it's crucial to recognize that not all problems that can be solved recursively should be approached in this manner. While recursion can yield elegant and comprehensible solutions, it may also lead to inefficiencies or even stack overflow errors if not implemented with caution. Therefore, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before opting for a recursive strategy.
