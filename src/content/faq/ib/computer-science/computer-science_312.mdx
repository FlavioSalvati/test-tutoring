In programming languages that lack explicit support for arrays, two-dimensional arrays can be effectively simulated using nested data structures or by utilizing a single block of sequential memory.

### Nested Data Structures

One common method to implement a two-dimensional array is through nested data structures. This involves creating a list (or a similar data structure) that contains other lists, with each inner list representing a row or column of the desired array. This approach is quite versatile, allowing for the creation of arrays of various dimensions, not limited to just two dimensions. However, it may be less efficient compared to using a native array, particularly for large arrays. This inefficiency arises because each inner list is treated as a separate object, requiring individual allocation and management.

### Sequential Memory

Alternatively, a two-dimensional array can be implemented using a single block of sequential memory, such as a string or a buffer. In this case, the elements of the two-dimensional array are stored in a one-dimensional array format, typically organized either row by row or column by column. To access a specific element located at row $i$ and column $j$, you can calculate its position in the one-dimensional array using the following formula:

$$
\text{index} = i \times C + j
$$

Here, $C$ represents the total number of columns. This method is generally more efficient than using nested lists because it leverages a single contiguous block of memory. However, it also introduces additional complexity, as you must manually manage memory and calculate element positions.

### Understanding the Underlying Structure

In both scenarios, the fundamental challenge of implementing a two-dimensional array in a language without explicit array support lies in grasping how arrays function at a low level. This understanding allows you to effectively map the two-dimensional structure of the array to the one-dimensional layout of the underlying data structure or memory block. Success in this endeavor requires a solid foundation in data structures, memory management, and an awareness of the specific features and limitations inherent to the programming language in use.
