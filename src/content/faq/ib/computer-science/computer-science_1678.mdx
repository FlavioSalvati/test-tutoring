Organisations can minimise data loss during software deployment by implementing robust backup strategies and thorough testing procedures.

To begin with, a robust backup strategy is crucial in minimising data loss. This involves regularly backing up all data and ensuring that the backup copies are stored in a secure and separate location. The frequency of backups should be determined by the rate at which the data changes. For instance, if the data changes frequently, then the backups should be done more often. It's also important to verify the integrity of the backups to ensure that they can be restored when needed. This can be done by performing regular test restores.

Another key strategy is the use of redundancy. This involves having duplicate systems or data so that in the event of a failure, the redundant system or data can take over. Redundancy can be implemented at various levels including at the hardware level (e.g. using RAID systems), at the software level (e.g. using redundant servers), or at the data level (e.g. using data mirroring or replication).

Thorough testing procedures are also essential in minimising data loss. Before deploying new software, it should be thoroughly tested to identify and fix any bugs that could potentially lead to data loss. This includes functional testing to verify that the software works as expected, performance testing to ensure that it can handle the expected load, and security testing to identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited to cause data loss.

In addition to these, organisations can also minimise data loss by using reliable deployment methods. For instance, they can use phased deployment where the new software is gradually rolled out to users. This allows any issues to be identified and fixed before the software is deployed to all users. They can also use blue-green deployment where two identical production environments are used. One environment (the blue environment) runs the old version of the software while the other environment (the green environment) runs the new version. If any issues are identified with the new version, users can be quickly switched back to the old version.

Lastly, organisations should also have a disaster recovery plan in place. This plan should outline the steps to be taken in the event of a data loss incident. It should also include details on how to restore the data from the backups and how to switch to the redundant systems.
