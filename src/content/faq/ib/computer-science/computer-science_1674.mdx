Legacy systems in modern organisations typically face challenges such as outdated technology, high maintenance costs, and lack of integration capabilities.

One of the most significant challenges with legacy systems is that they often rely on outdated technology. This can make it difficult to find IT professionals who are familiar with the system's programming language or architecture, as these may no longer be taught in contemporary computer science courses. As a result, maintaining and updating these systems can become increasingly difficult and expensive over time. Furthermore, outdated technology may not be able to support newer features or functionalities that are expected in modern software applications, limiting the system's capabilities and potentially hindering the organisation's operations.

Another common challenge is the high cost of maintaining legacy systems. These systems often require specialised knowledge and skills to operate and maintain, which can be expensive to source. Additionally, as these systems age, they may require more frequent maintenance and repairs, further driving up costs. In some cases, the cost of maintaining a legacy system can exceed the cost of implementing a new system. However, the potential disruption and risks associated with replacing a critical system can make organisations hesitant to abandon their legacy systems.

Legacy systems also often lack the ability to integrate with other systems. Modern organisations typically use a variety of software applications, and the ability to share data and functionality between these applications can greatly enhance efficiency and effectiveness. However, legacy systems were often designed to operate in isolation, and may not have the necessary interfaces or protocols to connect with other systems. This lack of integration can result in data silos, where valuable information is trapped within a single system and cannot be easily accessed or used by other parts of the organisation.

Finally, legacy systems can pose significant security risks. Older systems may not have been designed with modern security threats in mind, and may not be able to support the latest security measures. This can leave the system, and the valuable data it contains, vulnerable to cyber attacks. Furthermore, vendors may no longer provide security updates for older systems, making it difficult to protect these systems against newly discovered threats.
