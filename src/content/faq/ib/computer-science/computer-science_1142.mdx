During a dequeue operation in a queue, the element located at the front of the queue is removed and returned.

To elaborate, a queue is a type of data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. The action of removing an element from the queue is referred to as a dequeue operation.

When a dequeue operation is executed, the element at the front of the queue—often called the head of the queue—is removed. If the queue is implemented using an array, this typically requires shifting all subsequent elements down by one position to fill the void created by the removed element. Conversely, if the queue is implemented using a linked list, the head node is simply detached, and the second node becomes the new head.

In addition to removing the element, a dequeue operation usually returns the value of the removed element. This functionality allows the dequeue operation to be utilized in various algorithms and programs. For example, a queue may be employed to manage tasks within a computer system, where each dequeue operation retrieves and returns the next task to be executed.

It is crucial to recognize that attempting to perform a dequeue operation on an empty queue is generally considered an error. Different programming languages and libraries handle this scenario in diverse ways. Some may throw an exception, while others may return a special value (such as null or undefined) to signal that the queue is empty.

Regarding computational complexity, a dequeue operation can typically be performed in constant time, denoted as $O(1)$, provided that the queue is implemented efficiently. This efficiency makes the queue an excellent data structure for managing elements in situations where the order of processing is critical.
