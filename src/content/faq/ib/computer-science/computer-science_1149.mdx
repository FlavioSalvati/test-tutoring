In breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms, queues play a crucial role in managing the nodes that need to be processed next.

BFS is a systematic approach for exploring a graph, focusing primarily on two operations: (a) visiting and inspecting a node, and (b) accessing and visiting the neighboring nodes of the currently inspected node. The algorithm initiates at a root node, examines all its neighboring nodes, and subsequently inspects the unvisited neighbors of each of those nodes. This is where the queue becomes essential.

A queue is a data structure that operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In the context of BFS, we begin by initializing the queue with the starting node. We then enter a loop where we dequeue a node from the front of the queue, visit this node, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors at the back of the queue. This process continues until the queue is empty, indicating that all nodes reachable from the starting node have been visited.

The utilization of a queue ensures that nodes are visited in the order of their proximity to the start node. Specifically, all nodes at a distance $d$ from the starting node are visited before any nodes at distance $d + 1$. When we visit a node and enqueue its neighbors, those neighbors are at a greater distance from the start node than the current node. Since the queue operates on a FIFO basis, we will visit all remaining nodes at the current distance before moving on to nodes at the next distance level.

In summary, the queue in a BFS algorithm is instrumental in controlling the order of node visits. By employing a queue, we ensure that we first explore all nodes that are one step away, followed by all nodes that are two steps away, and so forth. This sequential approach captures the essence of the breadth-first search algorithm.
