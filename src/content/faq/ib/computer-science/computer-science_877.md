Interrupts play a vital role in CPU operation by allowing it to temporarily halt its current task in order to address higher-priority tasks.

To elaborate, interrupts are essential components of a computer's architecture that enable the CPU to manage multiple tasks concurrently and efficiently. They are signals sent to the CPU from either hardware or software, indicating that an event requires immediate attention. Upon receiving an interrupt, the CPU pauses its current task, saves its state, and begins executing a designated routine known as the interrupt handler, which is specifically designed to address the interrupt.

Interrupts can be categorized into two primary types: hardware interrupts and software interrupts. Hardware interrupts are generated by external devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, or printer, whenever they require the CPU's attention. For instance, when a key is pressed on the keyboard, it triggers an interrupt that prompts the CPU to process the keystroke. In contrast, software interrupts originate from programs executing on the computer. They are typically used to request services from the operating system, such as accessing a file or transmitting data over a network.

The process of handling an interrupt is quite complex. When an interrupt is received, the CPU first completes the instruction it is currently executing. It then saves its current state, including the program counter and the values in its registers, to ensure it can resume its previous task later. Following this, the CPU retrieves the address of the appropriate interrupt handler from the interrupt vector table, a specialized table in memory that contains the addresses of all interrupt handlers. The CPU then begins executing the specified interrupt handler.

The primary responsibility of the interrupt handler is to address the event that triggered the interrupt. Once the handling is complete, it issues a "return from interrupt" (RFI) instruction, signaling to the CPU to restore its previous state and resume its prior task. This mechanism allows the CPU to efficiently manage multiple tasks, responding promptly to significant events while continuing its other operations.

In conclusion, interrupts are a fundamental aspect of how a CPU organizes and manages its tasks. They enable the CPU to react swiftly and effectively to critical events, ensuring that the computer operates smoothly and responsively.
