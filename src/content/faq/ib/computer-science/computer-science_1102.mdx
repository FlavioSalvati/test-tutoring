A recursive approach can be less efficient than an iterative one, particularly when it results in higher time complexity or excessive memory usage.

Recursion is a powerful concept in computer science that enables us to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, smaller subproblems. However, it is not always the most efficient method. In certain scenarios, recursion can lead to increased time complexity, which means the algorithm takes longer to execute. This is especially true for problems where the same subproblem is solved multiple times, such as in the calculation of Fibonacci numbers. In contrast, an iterative approach can solve these problems more efficiently by avoiding redundant calculations.

Another concern with recursion is that it can lead to excessive memory usage. Each recursive call creates a new layer in the call stack, consuming additional memory. If the recursion depth becomes too great, it can result in a stack overflow error. Iterative solutions, on the other hand, typically require a constant amount of memory, making them more efficient for handling large input sizes.

Moreover, recursion can be less efficient due to the overhead associated with function calls. Each recursive call involves operations for pushing and popping data on the system stack, which can be time-consuming. In contrast, iterative solutions utilize loops, which generally avoid this overhead and can execute faster.

That said, the efficiency of recursion compared to iteration can vary depending on the specific problem and its implementation. In some instances, a well-crafted recursive solution may be just as efficient, or even more so, than its iterative counterpart. Furthermore, certain problems are inherently suited to a recursive approach, often making them significantly more challenging to solve using iteration. Therefore, while recursion may be less efficient in some cases, it remains an invaluable tool in a programmer's toolkit.
