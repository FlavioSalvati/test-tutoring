Data redundancy in database design can be effectively minimized through normalization, the implementation of primary keys, and the establishment of relationships between tables.

Normalization is a structured process aimed at decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. This multi-step approach organizes data into tabular form while removing duplicate entries from relational tables. The primary objectives of normalization are twofold: firstly, to eliminate redundant data—for instance, avoiding the storage of the same information in multiple tables—and secondly, to ensure that data dependencies are logical, meaning that only related data is stored within a single table. Achieving these goals not only reduces the overall storage requirements of a database but also guarantees that data is organized logically.

Primary keys serve as another critical mechanism for preventing data redundancy. A primary key acts as a unique identifier for each record in a table. By ensuring that every record possesses a unique key, we can prevent the entry of duplicate records. This practice not only mitigates redundancy but also enhances the efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation. Primary keys can consist of a single field or a combination of fields, provided that the combination remains unique across the table.

Establishing relationships between tables is yet another effective strategy to avoid data redundancy. In a relational database, tables are interconnected through the use of foreign keys. A foreign key in one table references a primary key in another table, allowing for more efficient data organization and reducing the necessity for duplicate entries. For example, rather than storing a customer's address in multiple tables, we can create a dedicated table for address details. Other tables can then refer to this address table using foreign keys, thereby eliminating the need to replicate the same information across different tables.

In conclusion, minimizing data redundancy in database design is essential for efficient data management. This practice not only conserves storage space but also enhances the efficiency of data manipulation and retrieval. Key strategies to achieve reduced redundancy include normalization, the use of primary keys, and the establishment of relationships between tables.
