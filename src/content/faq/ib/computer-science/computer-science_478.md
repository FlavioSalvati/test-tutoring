Distributed systems maintain transaction atomicity using protocols such as Two-Phase Commit (2PC) and Three-Phase Commit (3PC).

In the context of a distributed system, a transaction represents an operation that spans multiple nodes. To uphold consistency and reliability, these systems must guarantee that a transaction is atomic, meaning it must be treated as a single, indivisible operation. This implies that either all changes made during a transaction are committed to the system, or none are. This is where protocols like Two-Phase Commit (2PC) and Three-Phase Commit (3PC) become essential.

The Two-Phase Commit protocol is a distributed algorithm designed to coordinate all processes involved in a distributed atomic transaction. It consists of two distinct phases: the prepare phase and the commit phase. During the prepare phase, the coordinator issues a "query to commit" message to all participating nodes and awaits replies from each one. In the commit phase, the coordinator sends a "commit" message to all nodes if every node responds with a 'yes' to the initial query. Conversely, if any node replies with a 'no', the coordinator issues a "rollback" message to all nodes.

The Three-Phase Commit protocol serves as an enhancement to 2PC, addressing the blocking problem that can arise in the latter. In 3PC, an additional phase—the pre-commit phase—is introduced before the commit phase. In this pre-commit phase, the coordinator sends a "pre-commit" message to all nodes and waits for their acknowledgments. Only after confirming receipt of all acknowledgments does the coordinator proceed to the commit phase.

Both protocols ensure that all nodes within a distributed system reach a consensus on whether to commit or abort a transaction, thereby guaranteeing atomicity. However, they come with their own limitations. For example, 2PC may lead to a blocking scenario if the coordinator fails after some nodes have voted 'yes,' but before a final decision is made. In contrast, 3PC requires a greater number of message exchanges, which can introduce additional latency.

In addition to these protocols, distributed systems can employ techniques such as logging and checkpointing to further ensure atomicity. Logging involves maintaining a record of all changes made during a transaction, which can be utilized to revert the system to a consistent state in the event of a failure. Checkpointing, on the other hand, entails saving the state of the system at regular intervals, providing a means to restart the system in case of a failure.
