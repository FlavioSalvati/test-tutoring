Tracing a recursive algorithm involves carefully following the sequence of function calls and returns while monitoring the changing state of variables throughout the process.

To effectively trace a recursive algorithm, it's essential to grasp the concept of recursion. Recursion is a technique in which the solution to a problem is derived from solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, a function that invokes itself is referred to as a recursive function.

The first step in tracing a recursive algorithm is to identify the **base case**. The base case represents the simplest version of the problem that the algorithm can solve directly. It serves as the stopping condition for the recursion, preventing it from continuing indefinitely.

Following this, you should understand the **recursive case**. This segment of the function is responsible for calling itself to tackle a smaller variant of the problem. It is crucial that each recursive call progresses toward the base case; failing to do so could result in infinite recursion and ultimately lead to a stack overflow error.

To trace the algorithm, begin by observing the sequence of function calls, starting with the initial invocation that addresses the original problem size. Then, track the series of recursive calls made by the function, each time operating on a smaller problem size.

For each function call, maintain a record of the state of all relevant variables, which includes the function's parameters, any local variables, and the return value. One effective way to visualize this is by constructing a recursion tree or stack, where each node or layer corresponds to a function call, and its children or lower layers denote the recursive calls it initiates.

When a function call reaches the base case, it will return a value without making further recursive calls. This return value will then be utilized by the function call that made the recursive invocation, and this process continues until you return to the original function call.

By adhering to this structured approach, you can trace the execution of a recursive algorithm step-by-step, gaining insight into how it resolves the problem. This skill is invaluable for debugging and optimizing recursive algorithms, as well as for comprehending more complex algorithms that employ recursion.
