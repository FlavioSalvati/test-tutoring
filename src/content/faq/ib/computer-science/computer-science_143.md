A truth table for logical operations is created by systematically listing all possible combinations of inputs and their corresponding output values.

To begin constructing a truth table, you must first identify the number of variables involved in the operation. Each variable can take on one of two values: true (commonly represented as $1$) or false (commonly represented as $0$). The total number of rows in the truth table is given by $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of variables. For instance, if you have two variables, the truth table will consist of four rows, calculated as $2^2$.

Next, enumerate all possible combinations of input values for your variables. Start with all variables set to false, and then iteratively change the value of the rightmost variable. After exhaustively listing all combinations for the rightmost variable, move one column to the left and repeat the process. Continue this pattern until all possible combinations have been accounted for.

Once you have listed all possible input combinations, you can determine the output for each combination based on the logical operation you are analyzing. For example, when constructing a truth table for the AND operation, the output will be true only when all inputs are true. Conversely, if you are analyzing the OR operation, the output will be true if at least one input is true.

Finally, record the output values in a column to the right of the input combinations. This completes your truth table. It is important to remember that the purpose of a truth table is to illustrate the results of a logical operation across all possible input combinations. This makes it a valuable tool for understanding and visualizing how various logical operations function.

In summary, constructing a truth table involves the following steps: 
1. Identify the number of variables.
2. List all possible input combinations.
3. Determine the output for each combination based on the logical operation.
4. Record the output values in a column adjacent to the input values.
