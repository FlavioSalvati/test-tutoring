UDP is preferred over TCP in scenarios where speed and efficiency take precedence over reliability.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are both essential communication protocols utilized for transmitting data over the internet. While TCP is recognized for its reliability—thanks to its error-checking mechanisms and guaranteed delivery—it is inherently slower and consumes more resources. This is due to TCP's requirement to establish a connection prior to data transmission and to ensure that all data packets arrive in the correct order.

In contrast, UDP operates as a connectionless protocol. It transmits data without first establishing a connection and does not guarantee the order in which data packets are received. Consequently, UDP is faster and more efficient since it does not wait for acknowledgments or resend lost packets. This lower resource consumption makes it particularly suitable for systems with limited capabilities.

UDP is commonly employed in real-time applications, such as live streaming, online gaming, and Voice over IP (VoIP), where speed is prioritized over reliability. In these contexts, the occasional loss or misordering of packets does not significantly detract from the user experience. For instance, in a live video stream, a few missing frames will not disrupt the overall continuity of the video. Similarly, in online gaming, rapid responsiveness is vital, and the occasional loss of data is often preferable to the delays introduced by TCP's error-checking procedures.

Moreover, UDP supports both broadcast and multicast transmissions, enabling data to be sent to multiple recipients simultaneously. This feature is particularly advantageous in applications like IPTV and online multiplayer games, where the same data must be disseminated to numerous users at once.

In summary, while TCP offers greater reliability, UDP is favored when speed, efficiency, and resource management are the primary considerations. The decision to use TCP or UDP ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the application at hand.
