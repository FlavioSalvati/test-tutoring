Databases maintain data consistency through various mechanisms, including ACID properties, constraints, and normalization.

**ACID Properties**  
ACID, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, represents a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. 

- **Atomicity** guarantees that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is aborted.
- **Consistency** ensures that a transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another while upholding integrity constraints.
- **Isolation** allows concurrent execution of transactions to occur such that the final state of the database is the same as if the transactions had been executed sequentially.
- **Durability** asserts that once a transaction is committed, it remains committed even in the event of a system failure.

**Constraints**  
Constraints are rules applied to the data columns within a table, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data. These rules can be enforced at either the column level or the table level. Common types of constraints include:

- **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column cannot have a null value.
- **CHECK**: Validates that values in a column meet specific conditions.
- **DEFAULT**: Assigns a default value to a column when no value is provided.
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures that all values in a column are distinct.
- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table, requiring that the values are both unique and non-null.
- **FOREIGN KEY**: Maintains referential integrity by preventing actions that would disrupt the links between tables.

For instance, a PRIMARY KEY constraint is essential for uniquely identifying each record in a table, while a FOREIGN KEY constraint preserves relationships between different tables.

**Normalization**  
Normalization is a database design technique that minimizes data redundancy and eliminates undesirable issues such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. This approach involves breaking larger tables into smaller, related tables. The primary goal of normalization is to allow for the addition, deletion, or modification of a field in one table, with changes being reflected throughout the database via established relationships.

**Additional Techniques**  
In addition to the above mechanisms, databases implement techniques such as locking and versioning. Locking prevents multiple users from simultaneously updating the same data, while versioning tracks changes made to the data over time. Together with ACID properties, constraints, and normalization, these mechanisms play a crucial role in helping databases maintain data consistency.
