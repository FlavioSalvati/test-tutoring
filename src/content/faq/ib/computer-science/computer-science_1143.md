The enqueue operation in a queue involves adding an element to the end of the queue.

To elaborate, a queue is a type of data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This principle dictates that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. The enqueue operation is essential to this data structure, as it is the method by which new elements are incorporated into the queue.

When an element is enqueued, it is positioned at the 'rear' of the queue. If the queue was empty before the enqueue operation, this new element becomes both the 'front' and 'rear' of the queue. Conversely, if there are already elements in the queue, the new element is added as the new 'rear', while the 'front' remains unchanged.

The enqueue operation can be visualized as a line of people waiting for a bus. When a new person arrives, they join the end of the line (the 'rear'), without affecting the person at the front of the line, who will be the next to board the bus.

Regarding computational complexity, the enqueue operation is generally classified as an $O(1)$ operation. This signifies that it takes a constant amount of time to complete, regardless of the queue's size. The reason for this is that adding an element to the end of the queue does not necessitate shifting or reordering the existing elements.

However, it's important to recognize that the actual time complexity can vary depending on the specific implementation of the queue. For instance, if the queue is implemented using a dynamic array and that array requires resizing during the enqueue operation, this could temporarily increase the time complexity.

In summary, the enqueue operation is a crucial aspect of the queue data structure, enabling the addition of new elements in accordance with the FIFO principle. It is typically a swift operation, though its precise performance may be influenced by the specific implementation used.
