Key stakeholders in system planning are identified by determining who will be affected by or have influence over the system's implementation and operation.

In more detail, the process of identifying key stakeholders in system planning involves a comprehensive analysis of all individuals, groups, or organisations that have a vested interest in the success of the system. These stakeholders can be internal or external to the organisation.

Internal stakeholders typically include employees who will use the system, managers who will oversee its operation, and executives who will make strategic decisions based on the system's output. It's important to involve these stakeholders in the planning process as they will have valuable insights into the system's requirements and potential challenges.

External stakeholders can include customers who will interact with the system, suppliers who provide necessary components, and regulatory bodies that set standards the system must meet. These stakeholders' needs and expectations must be considered in the planning process to ensure the system is fit for purpose and compliant with relevant regulations.

Another method to identify key stakeholders is to conduct a stakeholder analysis. This involves identifying all potential stakeholders, assessing their interest and influence over the project, and prioritising them based on this assessment. This can help to ensure that the most important stakeholders are involved in the planning process and their needs are adequately addressed.

In addition, it's also important to consider the potential impact of the system on different stakeholders. For example, a new system may change work processes, requiring employees to learn new skills. In this case, the employees would be key stakeholders as they would be directly affected by the system's implementation.

In conclusion, identifying key stakeholders in system planning involves a thorough analysis of all those who have an interest in or are affected by the system, and ensuring their needs and expectations are considered in the planning process.
