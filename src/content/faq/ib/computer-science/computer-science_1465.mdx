A neural network consists of three main types of layers: the input layer, hidden layers, and the output layer.

At its core, a neural network is a collection of algorithms designed to recognize patterns. It processes sensory data through a form of machine perception, which involves labeling or clustering raw inputs. The patterns identified by the network are represented numerically within vectors, allowing all types of real-world data—including images, sounds, text, and time series—to be translated into a format suitable for analysis.

The first layer in a neural network is the input layer. This layer is responsible for receiving data from your dataset. Each node within the input layer corresponds to a specific feature in the dataset. For instance, if you are using a neural network to analyze images, each node could represent an individual pixel in the image. The input layer takes in the raw data and transmits it to the next layer.

The hidden layers are where the true processing occurs. These layers consist of nodes, or neurons, that receive input from the previous layer, apply a set of weights, and then pass the results on to the next layer. The weights represent the parameters that the network "learns" during the training process. Each node utilizes a unique set of weights for its inputs, enabling the network to learn intricate patterns. The configuration of hidden layers—including their number and the number of nodes within each layer—can vary significantly based on the specific application.

Finally, the output layer is where the network generates its final decision. Each node in the output layer represents a potential output of the network. For example, if the task is to classify emails as either 'spam' or 'not spam', the output layer would contain two nodes—one for each classification. The network assigns probabilities to each input, indicating its likelihood of belonging to each class, and the class with the highest probability is selected as the final output.

In summary, a neural network comprises an input layer that receives data, one or more hidden layers that process this data, and an output layer that provides the final result. The hidden layers are crucial for the network's ability to learn and recognize patterns in the input data, while the output layer is responsible for delivering the final classification or decision.
