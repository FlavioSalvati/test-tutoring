Recursion is a powerful programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. However, this approach can lead to stack overflow errors if the depth of recursive calls exceeds the stack size limit.

Every time a recursive function is invoked, it creates a new stack frame in the call stack, a data structure that holds information about active functions or subroutines in a program. Each stack frame includes the function's local variables, its return address, and other essential execution details. As the function continues to call itself, these frames accumulate on the stack until it reaches a base case, at which point the function starts to return and remove frames from the stack.

If a recursive function makes too many calls before reaching the base case, the stack can become full, resulting in a stack overflow. This situation typically causes the program to crash or generate a stack overflow error.

The maximum recursion depth that triggers a stack overflow can vary based on several factors, including the size of the stack, the memory required for each stack frame, and the specific programming language or environment in use. In some cases, it only takes a few thousand recursive calls to reach this limit.

To prevent stack overflow errors, it is crucial to ensure that recursive functions have a well-defined base case that can be reached within a manageable number of calls. Additionally, optimization techniques such as tail recursion or memoization can be employed to minimize memory usage for each recursive call. Alternatively, using an iterative approach instead of recursion can eliminate the risk of stack overflow, as iteration does not utilize the call stack in the same way.
