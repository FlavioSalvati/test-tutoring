The Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle of a stack dictates that the most recently added item is the first one to be removed.

In practical terms, a stack is a data structure that adheres to the LIFO principle, meaning that when items are added to the stack, the last one placed on the stack will be the first to be taken off. This can be likened to a stack of plates: you can only add or remove a plate from the top of the stack, not from the middle or bottom.

When an item is added to a stack, this action is commonly referred to as "pushing" onto the stack. The pushed item then occupies the new top position, sitting above all previously added items. Conversely, when an item is removed from the stack, this action is termed "popping" from the stack. The item that is popped is always the one that was most recently pushed, which is to say, the current top of the stack.

The LIFO principle is foundational to the operation of a stack, as it governs the order in which items are added and removed. This characteristic makes stacks particularly advantageous in various computing scenarios. For instance, they are utilized in memory allocation, where the most recently allocated block of memory is the first to be deallocated. They also play a crucial role in the execution of programming languages, where the most recently called function is the first to finish executing and be removed from the stack.

In conclusion, the LIFO principle serves as the core rule for how items are managed within a stack. It guarantees that the most recently added item is always the first to be removed, thereby making stacks a valuable asset in numerous areas of computing.
