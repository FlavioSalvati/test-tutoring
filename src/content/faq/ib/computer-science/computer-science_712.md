Digital rights management in the online realm is facilitated through various strategies, including digital rights management (DRM), encryption, watermarking, and licensing agreements.

**Digital Rights Management (DRM)** serves as a fundamental approach to regulating access to copyrighted digital content. DRM technologies are designed to prevent unauthorized redistribution of digital media and to limit how consumers can copy the content they have purchased. This is achieved by encrypting the content and providing decryption keys solely to authorized users or devices. For instance, when an individual purchases an eBook, the file is encrypted in such a manner that only the designated eBook reader software or device can decrypt and display the content.

**Encryption** is another crucial method employed to manage digital rights. It involves encoding information so that only authorized parties can access it, often working in tandem with DRM. For example, a movie may be encrypted to ensure it can only be played on devices that possess the appropriate decryption key. This effectively prevents the illegal copying and distribution of the movie.

**Watermarking** is a technique that embeds a concealed copyright notice or digital signature within a piece of content. This method aids in identifying the original source of the content and helps establish ownership in the event of copyright disputes. Watermarks can be visible or invisible and are crafted to remain intact even if the content is copied or altered.

**Licensing agreements** are legal contracts established between the content creator and the user, outlining the terms and conditions for using the digital content. For example, a software license may stipulate that the user is permitted to install the software on only one computer. Breaching the terms of the license can lead to penalties, including the revocation of access to the content.

In addition to these strategies, laws and regulations are also in place to safeguard digital rights. These include copyright laws that protect the rights of content creators and privacy laws that ensure individuals can control how their personal information is utilized online. Such laws and regulations are enforced by governments and can result in penalties for those who violate them.
