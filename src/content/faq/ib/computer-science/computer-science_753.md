The Semantic Web enhances data sharing by establishing a common framework that enables the sharing and reuse of data across various applications, enterprises, and communities.

The Semantic Web is a vision put forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the principal international standards organization for the Internet. It expands the network of hyperlinked, human-readable web pages by incorporating machine-readable metadata that describes the pages and their interrelations. This innovation allows automated agents to access the Web more intelligently, performing tasks on behalf of users.

The foundation of the Semantic Web lies in the notion of defining and linking data on the web in a manner that machines can utilize for more efficient data integration, retrieval, and reuse. By employing standards and common data formats, the Semantic Web facilitates data sharing and reuse across a diverse range of applications, whether for small personal projects or large multinational corporations.

A pivotal technology that enables the Semantic Web is the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF serves as a standard model for data interchange on the Web and is designed to facilitate data merging, even when the underlying schemas differ. While RDF utilizes XML as a universal syntax for structured documents, it enhances this with semantic annotations that enable machines to comprehend the data.

Another significant technology is the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is specifically designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about entities, groups of entities, and their relationships. It allows users to create a defined vocabulary for their data, which can be leveraged by others and various applications to interpret and utilize that data effectively.

In summary, the Semantic Web offers a common language for applications to exchange information seamlessly. It promotes data sharing and reuse across different applications, effectively dismantling the silos that often exist within large organizations. Additionally, it simplifies the integration of data from diverse sources by providing semantic annotations that facilitate mapping between different data schemas. This capability makes the Semantic Web a powerful tool for enhancing data sharing and reuse.
