Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science that can be effectively visualized using methods such as tree diagrams and fractal images. 

At its core, recursion involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem. While this concept can be difficult to grasp, visualization techniques can significantly enhance understanding. One popular method for visualizing recursion is through tree diagrams. In these diagrams, each node represents a recursive call, while the branches illustrate the various paths that the recursion may take. This representation clearly shows how the original problem is divided into smaller components, which are then combined to arrive at the solution.

For instance, consider the calculation of the factorial of a number, denoted as $n!$. The recursive definition states that $n!$ can be expressed as $n \times (n-1)!$. In a tree diagram for this problem, the top node represents $n!$, which branches out to a node for $(n-1)!$ and a leaf for $n$. The node for $(n-1)!$ would further branch down to nodes for $(n-2)!$ and $(n-1)$, and this pattern continues. This visualization effectively illustrates how recursion simplifies the problem into more manageable parts, with the solutions to these smaller problems ultimately contributing to the solution of the original problem.

Another compelling way to visualize recursion is through fractal images. Fractals are intricate shapes that exhibit self-similarity, meaning they maintain the same structure regardless of the scale at which they are viewed. They are often generated using recursive algorithms, making them ideal for demonstrating the concept of recursion. A prime example is the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle, which is formed by recursively dividing a triangle into four smaller triangles and removing the central triangle. This process can be repeated indefinitely, yielding a complex pattern that retains its form at any scale. Such visualizations highlight how recursion can produce intricate designs from simple iterative rules.

In summary, visualizing recursion is an effective way to clarify this complex concept. Whether through tree diagrams or fractal images, these visualization techniques illustrate how recursion decomposes problems into simpler components and how these components are synthesized to solve the original problem.
