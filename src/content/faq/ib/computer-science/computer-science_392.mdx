A practical example of a static data structure can be found in the implementation of a computer's file system.

The file system of a computer represents a quintessential instance of a static data structure. It is specifically designed to organize and manage files stored on devices such as hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs). The file system is considered static because it is established when the storage device is formatted, remaining unchanged in size or structure throughout the computer's operation.

The architecture of the file system resembles a tree, where directories (or folders) serve as nodes and files act as leaves. This hierarchical organization facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of files. Each file or directory is associated with a unique path originating from the root of the tree, which is utilized for easy access.

Additionally, the file system incorporates a directory table—essentially a table of contents—which is structured as a static array that maintains information about each file and directory. This information typically includes the name, size, creation date, and physical location on the disk. The size of the directory table is fixed and remains constant, regardless of the addition or removal of files.

Another example of a static data structure within the file system is the bitmap, which is employed to track both free and occupied space on the disk. The bitmap is represented as a static array of bits, where each bit corresponds to a block of disk space. A bit value of $1$ indicates that the block is in use, while a value of $0$ signifies that the block is free. The bitmap is established during the disk formatting process and does not alter in size, even as files are added or deleted.

In conclusion, a computer's file system is a sophisticated application of static data structures, encompassing trees, arrays, and bitmaps. These structures are crucial for the efficient organization and management of files, as well as for monitoring the utilization of disk space.
