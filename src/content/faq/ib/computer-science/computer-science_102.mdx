Operating systems (OS) are essential for managing power in mobile devices, employing various power management techniques to enhance battery life while maintaining optimal performance. Two widely used techniques in this domain are dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and CPU throttling.

**Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS)** is a power management strategy that adjusts the voltage supplied to a device based on the computational demands of the task being executed. When the device undertakes complex operations requiring significant processing power, the voltage is increased to meet these demands. Conversely, when the device is idle or engaged in simpler tasks, the voltage is reduced to conserve energy. This method is particularly advantageous in mobile devices, where maximizing battery life is a primary concern.

**CPU throttling**, also referred to as dynamic frequency scaling, is another key technique utilized by operating systems to regulate power consumption. This method involves decreasing the operating frequency of the central processing unit (CPU) during periods of low demand. When the workload increases, the CPU frequency is subsequently raised to handle the additional processing requirements. Often, DVS and CPU throttling are employed together to achieve optimal power efficiency.

In addition to these techniques, operating systems incorporate power-saving modes to further reduce energy consumption. Modes such as sleep or hibernate significantly lower power usage by deactivating components of the device that are not currently in use. For instance, in sleep mode, the display and other non-essential functions are turned off, allowing the device to quickly resume full functionality when needed.

Moreover, operating systems manage power by regulating both the hardware and software of the device. They can deactivate unnecessary hardware components, limit the performance of certain applications, and adjust display brightness to save energy. Additionally, they oversee the power consumption of wireless communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, by disabling them when they are not in use.

In summary, the operating system plays a crucial role in power management for mobile devices. By integrating various power management techniques, implementing power-saving modes, and exercising control over hardware and software, it ensures that mobile devices operate efficiently while optimizing battery life.
