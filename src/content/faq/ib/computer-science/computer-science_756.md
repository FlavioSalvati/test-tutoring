Object decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex system into smaller, more manageable components or objects.

In computer science, object decomposition is a fundamental concept, particularly within the realm of object-oriented programming (OOP). This approach involves disassembling a complex system into simpler, more digestible parts, commonly referred to as objects. Each object encapsulates a specific aspect or component of the system, allowing developers to work on these elements independently. This methodology enhances clarity, design efficiency, and overall management of intricate systems.

The process of object decomposition starts with identifying the various components or aspects that comprise the system. These can be tangible elements, such as the parts of a car in a car simulation program, or intangible elements, like user accounts in a banking system. Each identified component is subsequently represented as an object within the system.

After identifying the objects, the next step is to define their properties and behaviors. Properties are the characteristics or attributes that describe each object, such as the color of a car or the balance of a bank account. Behaviors, on the other hand, refer to the actions that the object can perform, such as a car accelerating or an account being credited or debited.

Once the properties and behaviors have been established, the objects are organized into a hierarchy based on their relationships and interactions. This hierarchy, often termed the class hierarchy, further simplifies the system by grouping related objects together, thereby enhancing organizational clarity.

Object decomposition serves as a powerful strategy for managing complexity in software development. By segmenting a complex system into smaller, manageable parts, developers can concentrate on one component at a time, making it easier to comprehend and manage the overall system. Additionally, this approach promotes reusability, as objects can be utilized across different parts of the system or even in other systems, thereby minimizing the amount of code that needs to be developed. Furthermore, it supports modularity, allowing changes to one object without impacting others, which contributes to a more robust and maintainable system.
