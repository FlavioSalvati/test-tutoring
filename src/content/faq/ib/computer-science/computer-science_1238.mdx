The operating system (OS) plays a crucial role in managing the resources of a computer system, including the CPU, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices. One of its primary responsibilities is to determine the order in which processes are executed, a function known as scheduling. To accomplish this, the OS employs a scheduling algorithm that assigns priority levels to each process, ensuring that the process with the highest priority receives resources first.

Various types of scheduling algorithms exist, each with its own approach to determining process priority. For instance, in the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm, the process that arrives first is prioritized for execution. Alternatively, the Shortest Job Next (SJN) algorithm prioritizes the process with the shortest estimated run time. Other algorithms, such as Priority Scheduling, allow users or the system to assign specific priority levels to processes.

To effectively manage process priority, the OS utilizes a technique known as preemption. In a preemptive scheduling system, the OS has the capability to interrupt a currently running process to allocate resources to a higher-priority process. This mechanism is particularly vital in real-time systems, where certain tasks must be completed within strict time constraints.

Beyond scheduling, the OS also oversees resource allocation through techniques such as paging and segmentation. These methods enable the OS to divide memory into manageable sections, which can then be allocated to different processes, ensuring that each process has the necessary resources to operate effectively.

In summary, the OS prioritizes processes for resource allocation through a combination of scheduling algorithms, preemption, and memory management techniques. Together, these strategies ensure that processes are executed efficiently and fairly, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the computer system.
