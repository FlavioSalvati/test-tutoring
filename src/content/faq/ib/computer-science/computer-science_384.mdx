In computer science, trees can be utilized to represent expressions through a specialized data structure known as expression trees.

Expression trees are a particular type of binary tree designed for representing mathematical expressions. They serve essential roles in compilers and calculators for parsing and interpreting expressions. Each node in the tree corresponds to an operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, while the leaf nodes represent operands, which can be either constants or variables.

The structure of the tree mirrors the order of operations in the expression. For instance, in the expression $2 + 3 \times 4$, the multiplication operation is positioned closer to the root of the tree than the addition operation. This arrangement reflects the precedence of multiplication over addition, ensuring that the expression is evaluated correctly.

To evaluate an expression tree, one would perform a post-order traversal of the tree. This traversal technique involves visiting the left child first, then the right child, and finally the parent node. When visiting a node, the corresponding operation is executed using the values from its child nodes. By the time you reach the root of the tree, the entire expression has been evaluated.

Expression trees also provide capabilities for manipulating expressions in various ways. For example, you can simplify an expression by replacing a subtree that represents a constant expression with a single node that reflects the value of that expression. Additionally, you can differentiate an expression with respect to a variable by substituting each node with the derivative of the operation it represents.

In conclusion, expression trees are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating expressions in computer science. They enable structured and systematic parsing, evaluation, and manipulation of expressions, making them invaluable for various computational tasks.
