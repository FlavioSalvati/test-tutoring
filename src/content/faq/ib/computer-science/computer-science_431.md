Real-time operating systems (RTOS) differentiate themselves by managing resources with a focus on prioritizing time-sensitive tasks and ensuring deterministic behavior.

In an RTOS, resource management is fundamentally driven by the necessity to satisfy stringent timing constraints. This approach contrasts with general-purpose operating systems (GPOS), which primarily aim to maximize throughput and operational efficiency. An RTOS is engineered to deliver a high degree of predictability, which is essential for applications where any delay in response could result in catastrophic consequences, such as those found in aviation control systems or medical devices.

A key characteristic of an RTOS is its distinct scheduling policy. While a GPOS typically employs preemptive or time-sharing scheduling, an RTOS usually adopts a priority-based scheduling approach. In this system, each task is assigned a priority level, and the scheduler consistently selects the highest-priority task that is ready for execution. This methodology ensures that time-critical tasks are not delayed by those of lower priority.

Another notable aspect of an RTOS is its management of interrupts. In a GPOS, an interrupt may cause the suspension of a currently executing task, potentially leading to unpredictable delays. Conversely, an RTOS is designed to minimize interrupt latency—the time taken for the system to respond to an interrupt. This is achieved by disabling interrupts during critical code sections or by assigning a high priority to the interrupt service routine.

Memory management in an RTOS also differs significantly from that in a GPOS. While a GPOS typically employs dynamic memory allocation—which can lead to fragmentation and unpredictable delays—an RTOS often utilizes static or fixed-size block memory allocation. This approach ensures that a task can always access the memory it requires without incurring delays.

In summary, the resource management strategies of a real-time operating system are tailored to meet rigorous timing constraints and maintain predictable behavior. This is accomplished through a combination of priority-based scheduling, minimized interrupt latency, and static memory allocation.
