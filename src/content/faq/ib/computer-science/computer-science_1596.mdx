The four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

**Encapsulation** is the principle that combines data and the functions that manipulate that data, safeguarding both from external interference and misuse. Essentially, it is the mechanism that hides the internal state of an object while exposing only the necessary methods for interaction. This principle is vital for maintaining data integrity within an object and preventing unauthorized access.

**Inheritance** is a mechanism that enables one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This principle fosters code reusability and supports hierarchical classification. The class from which properties and methods are inherited is referred to as the 'parent' or 'super' class, while the class that inherits is called the 'child' or 'sub' class. The child class can introduce its own methods and properties in addition to those inherited from the parent class.

**Polymorphism** is a principle that allows a single interface to represent a general class of actions. It enables methods to function differently based on the object that invokes them. This principle is often employed to simplify code and enhance readability. For instance, the same method name can be utilized across different classes, but the implementation and outcome can vary depending on the class in question.

**Abstraction** is the principle of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes that are relevant to the problem at hand and operating at the most suitable level of inheritance for a particular aspect of the problem. It involves creating simplified, abstract representations of more intricate, real-world objects and systems. This principle aids in reducing complexity and enhancing efficiency, allowing programmers to concentrate on the essential attributes of the object.

In summary, these four principles of OOP provide a coherent framework for organizing complex programs. They facilitate easier modification, extension, and maintenance of code, contributing to the popularity of OOP as a programming paradigm.
