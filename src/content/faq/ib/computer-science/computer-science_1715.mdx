Volatile memory requires power to retain data, while non-volatile memory can store data even when power is off.

Volatile memory, as the name suggests, is a type of computer memory that requires a continuous power supply to retain the information stored in it. This means that when the power supply is interrupted or the computer is turned off, all the data stored in volatile memory is lost. The most common example of volatile memory is Random Access Memory (RAM), which is used by computers to store data that is being processed or used by the operating system, applications, and the user.

On the other hand, non-volatile memory does not require a continuous power supply to maintain the storage of information. It can retain the stored data even when the power is turned off or the computer is shut down. This makes non-volatile memory an ideal choice for long-term data storage. Examples of non-volatile memory include Read-Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, and hard disk drives.

The main advantage of volatile memory, such as RAM, is its speed. It is much faster than non-volatile memory, which makes it ideal for temporary storage of data that needs to be accessed quickly, such as the data being processed by the CPU. However, its major drawback is its volatility, which means it cannot be used for long-term storage of data.

Non-volatile memory, on the other hand, is slower than volatile memory, but it has the advantage of being able to retain data without a power supply. This makes it ideal for storing data that needs to be preserved over time, such as the operating system, applications, and user files.

In summary, the main difference between volatile and non-volatile memory lies in their ability to retain data. Volatile memory requires a continuous power supply and is used for temporary storage of data, while non-volatile memory can retain data without power and is used for long-term storage.
