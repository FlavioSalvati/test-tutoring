A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology designed to establish a secure connection over a less secure network, such as the internet, between a user's device and the broader online environment. It accomplishes this by employing tunnelling protocols, which are sets of rules that govern how data is packaged and transmitted across networks. These protocols encapsulate data packets, effectively creating a 'tunnel' through which data can be securely conveyed.

The process begins with the VPN client on your device sending data to the VPN server. Initially, this data is encapsulated within a tunnelling protocol, which envelops it in an outer packet. This outer layer serves as a protective shield against external interference, safeguarding the data from potential eavesdroppers on the public network.

Various tunnelling protocols can be utilized by a VPN, including:

- Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol (PPTP)
- Layer 2 Tunnelling Protocol (L2TP)
- Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)
- Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)

Each of these protocols has distinct advantages and disadvantages regarding security, speed, and compatibility. The selection of a specific protocol often depends on the user's requirements or the characteristics of the network in use.

For instance, PPTP is known for its speed and lower encryption levels, making it suitable for activities such as streaming, where high speed is prioritized over security. Conversely, L2TP/IPSec provides enhanced security features but tends to operate at slower speeds. SSL/TLS is widely employed for secure web browsing, underpinning the security of HTTPS websites.

Upon reaching the VPN server, the outer packet is removed, and the original data is decrypted before being forwarded to its intended destination. This process is also reversed for incoming data. By utilizing tunnelling protocols in this manner, a VPN effectively creates a secure and private 'tunnel' for data transmission over the public internet, ensuring that your information remains confidential and protected, even when accessing less secure networks.
