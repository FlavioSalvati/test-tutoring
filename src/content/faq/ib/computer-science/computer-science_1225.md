Common limitations of system resources include restricted processing power, insufficient memory, inadequate storage, and limited network bandwidth.

**Processing Power**  
Processing power is a fundamental constraint on system resources. The speed and efficiency of a computer system are primarily determined by its Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU's processing power is measured in gigahertz (GHz), which indicates how quickly it can execute instructions. If the CPU's processing power is inadequate, it may lead to system slowdowns or even freezes, particularly when running complex applications or multiple programs simultaneously.

**Memory**  
Memory, specifically Random Access Memory (RAM), is another critical system resource that can often be limited. RAM serves as temporary storage for data that a computer is actively processing. When a system lacks sufficient RAM, it resorts to using hard drive space as virtual memory, which is considerably slower. This transition can result in a significant decrease in system performance, especially when running memory-intensive applications or multitasking.

**Storage**  
Storage capacity is yet another common limitation. The total amount of data a system can accommodate is determined by its storage capacity, typically measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB). When a system's storage is nearly full, it can hinder performance and prevent the saving of new data. Moreover, different types of storage media have varying access speeds; for instance, Solid State Drives (SSDs) generally provide faster data access than Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), but SSDs may offer lower overall capacity.

**Network Bandwidth**  
Finally, network bandwidth is an essential factor that can limit system performance. Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network within a specific timeframe. If a system's network bandwidth is constrained, it can lead to slower internet browsing, streaming, downloading, and other online activities. This limitation is especially problematic for systems that depend on cloud-based applications or services.

**Conclusion**  
In conclusion, system resources are finite and can significantly impact a computer system's performance. By understanding these limitations, users can optimize system performance and make informed decisions when purchasing or upgrading computer systems.
