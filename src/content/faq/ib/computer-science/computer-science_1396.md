There are several established methods for testing computer models, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

**Unit Testing** is the foundational level of testing, focusing on the verification of individual components or units of a software application. Typically conducted by the developers themselves, the primary goal of unit testing is to ensure that each unit functions as intended. A unit is defined as the smallest testable part of any software, often represented by a program module or an object. It generally involves one or a few inputs and produces a single output.

**Integration Testing** follows unit testing and involves the combination and assessment of individual units as a cohesive group. This method is designed to uncover faults that may arise from interactions between integrated units. Various approaches to integration testing exist, such as top-down, bottom-up, and sandwich testing (a hybrid of both top-down and bottom-up). Each approach offers unique advantages and disadvantages.

**System Testing** represents a higher level of testing that validates the complete and fully integrated software product. The objective of system testing is to assess the software's compliance with specified requirements. This testing is typically performed by a team that is independent of the development team, ensuring an unbiased evaluation of the software.

Finally, **Acceptance Testing** occurs after system testing and prior to the system being made available for actual use. This type of testing is conducted to verify that the system meets the requirements outlined in the System Requirements Specification (SRS) document. Acceptance testing is usually carried out by the client or end users rather than the developers.

In addition to these primary testing methods, there are other significant techniques such as **Regression Testing**, which is performed to confirm that recent changes to the program or code have not negatively impacted existing features, and **Performance Testing**, which evaluates the system's performance under various load conditions. Each of these testing methods is crucial in ensuring the reliability and robustness of computer models.
