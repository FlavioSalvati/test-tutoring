System testing plays a vital role in the software development life cycle (SDLC), occurring during the testing phase after the implementation or coding phase.

In the SDLC, system testing is an essential step that follows the coding phase. This testing level involves evaluating the entire system to confirm that it operates as intended. The primary objective of system testing is to assess the system's compliance with predefined requirements.

After the design and coding of the system are completed, the process transitions into the testing phase. During this phase, the system undergoes comprehensive testing to ensure its functionality aligns with user requirements. System testing is the first instance where the system is evaluated in its entirety, focusing on its end-to-end functionality and verifying that it meets the established requirements.

System testing encompasses various types of tests, including both functional and non-functional tests. Functional tests are employed to confirm that the system's features and functions operate as expected, while non-functional tests assess the system's performance, reliability, and overall quality.

Additionally, the system testing phase integrates integration testing, where individual components of the system are combined and tested collectively. The goal of integration testing is to identify faults that may arise during the interactions of these integrated components.

Upon the completion of system testing and the resolution of any detected defects, the system progresses to the acceptance testing phase. This final testing stage ensures that the system is fully prepared for delivery or deployment.

In summary, system testing is a critical component of the software development life cycle. It is the phase where the complete system is evaluated in its entirety to ensure it meets the specified requirements and is ready for deployment.
