Yes, it is possible to construct a logic diagram for a simple computational problem using tools such as flowcharts, decision trees, or Boolean logic diagrams.

A logic diagram serves as a graphical representation of a computational problem or process. It utilizes symbols to depict various operations or decisions, while arrows illustrate the flow of logic. This visualization is particularly beneficial in computer science, as it enables us to understand the steps a computer would follow to solve a given problem.

Let's take a straightforward computational problem as an example: determining whether a number is even or odd. We can create a logic diagram for this task using a flowchart.

We begin with a 'Start' symbol, typically represented by an oval, which signifies the initiation of our process. Next, we include an input symbol, generally depicted as a parallelogram, where we will input the number we wish to evaluate.

Following this, we encounter a decision symbol, usually represented by a diamond shape. At this point, we check whether the number is even or odd. To do this, we can use the modulus operation: $number \mod 2$. If the result of this operation is $0$, the number is classified as even; if it is not $0$, the number is deemed odd.

From the decision symbol, two arrows emerge. One is labeled 'yes' (or 'true') and directs us to a process symbol (a rectangle) that indicates 'Number is even'. The other arrow is labeled 'no' (or 'false') and leads to a process symbol that states 'Number is odd'.

Ultimately, both of these process symbols converge to an 'End' symbol, which marks the conclusion of our process.

This example illustrates a simple scenario; however, logic diagrams can also represent significantly more complex computational challenges. They are invaluable tools in computer science, aiding us in understanding and conveying how a problem can be systematically solved through algorithms.
