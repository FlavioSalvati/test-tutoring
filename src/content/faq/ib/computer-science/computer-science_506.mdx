A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a software application designed to manage databases that adhere to the relational model.

More specifically, an RDBMS is a type of Database Management System (DBMS) that organizes data in a structured format using rows and columns. This tabular structure enables users to identify and access data in relation to other data points within the database. The relational model employs logical data structures known as tables or relations to systematically organize data. Each table contains a key field, which uniquely identifies each row, and this key field can be utilized to establish connections between different tables of data.

The term "relational database" was coined by E. F. Codd at IBM in 1970. Codd's model has since become the most widely adopted database model, with all major DBMSs built upon its principles. Notable examples include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database.

RDBMSs offer numerous advantages. They help minimize data redundancy and inconsistencies, ensure data integrity, support complex queries, and provide robust security measures for data. Additionally, they facilitate data independence, meaning that applications do not require modifications if the underlying database structure changes.

However, RDBMSs also have certain limitations. They can be complex and challenging to configure, and they may not be the ideal solution for all types of applications. For instance, they may struggle to efficiently handle unstructured data, such as social media posts or images.

In an RDBMS, data manipulation is performed using a relational language. The most prevalent of these languages is SQL (Structured Query Language), which allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve data. SQL is the standard language for managing data stored in an RDBMS and is also employed for stream processing in relational data stream management systems (RDSMS).

In summary, an RDBMS is a powerful tool for managing structured data. It provides a flexible and efficient means of storing, retrieving, and manipulating data, serving as the foundation for many of the world's most widely used database systems.
