Inorder traversal of a binary tree follows a specific sequence: it first visits the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.

In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two children: a left child and a right child. Inorder traversal is a systematic method to visit all nodes in the tree. The process begins at the root node; however, instead of visiting the root first, the algorithm first delves into the left subtree. Once the entire left subtree has been visited, the root node is then processed. Finally, the traversal proceeds to the right subtree. This recursive process is applied to each subtree until all nodes in the tree have been visited.

The term "inorder" derives from the order in which nodes are visited: left child, parent (node), and then right child. This method is also referred to as LNR order (Left, Node, Right). Notably, performing an inorder traversal on a binary search tree will yield a sorted sequence of the tree's elements.

To execute an inorder traversal, you begin at the root node and move to the left child. You continue this movement down the left side of the tree until you reach a node that does not have a left child. This node is visited first. After visiting this node, you backtrack to the parent node and visit it. Next, you proceed to the right child. If the right child has a left child, you again move to the left child and repeat the traversal process. If the right child has no left child, you visit the right child and then backtrack to its parent. This cycle continues until every node in the tree has been visited.

From a programming perspective, an inorder traversal can be implemented using either recursion or an iterative method utilizing a stack. The recursive approach involves invoking a function on the left child, processing the current node, and subsequently calling the function on the right child. The iterative approach employs a stack to keep track of nodes that still need to be visited.

Inorder traversal is a foundational concept in computer science, particularly in the study of data structures and algorithms. It is an essential technique for processing binary trees in a structured manner and plays a crucial role in various tree-based algorithms.
