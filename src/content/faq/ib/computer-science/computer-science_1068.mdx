The process that converts high-level code into executable code is known as compilation.

In the field of computer science, the transformation of high-level code—written in human-readable formats—into executable code that a machine can understand and execute is accomplished through a process called compilation. This process is facilitated by a specialized program known as a compiler. The compiler serves as a vital tool in software development, effectively bridging the gap between human programmers and the machine's binary language.

High-level code is typically written in languages such as Python, Java, and C++. These languages are designed to be easily understandable by humans, featuring syntax and commands that closely resemble natural language. However, computers cannot directly interpret these high-level languages; they only comprehend machine code, which consists of a series of binary instructions. Thus, there is a need to translate high-level code into machine code, and this is where the compiler plays its essential role.

The compilation process consists of several stages. Initially, the compiler performs lexical analysis, during which it scans the entire high-level code to understand its structure and syntax. Next, the compiler parses the code, checking for syntax errors and constructing a tree-like representation of the code's structure. This is followed by semantic analysis, a phase in which the compiler verifies the code for semantic errors and ensures compliance with the programming language's rules.

Once these analysis stages are complete, the compiler moves on to the optimization stage. In this phase, the compiler refines the code to enhance its efficiency without altering its intended functionality. This may involve eliminating redundant code or reordering instructions for improved performance.

Finally, the compiler reaches the code generation stage, where it produces the machine code—this is the executable code that the computer can run. It is important to note that machine code is specific to the architecture of the computer's processor, meaning that a program compiled for one type of processor may not be compatible with another type.

In summary, the compilation process is a critical step in software development that transforms high-level, human-readable code into machine-executable code. This process encompasses several stages, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
