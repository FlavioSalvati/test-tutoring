To find the transpose of a matrix, you swap its rows and columns in a two-dimensional array.

Transposing a matrix involves creating a new matrix in which the rows of the original matrix become the columns, and the columns become the rows. This process is achieved by switching the row and column indices of each element in the matrix.

Consider a matrix $ A $ with dimensions $ m \times n $ (with $ m $ rows and $ n $ columns). The transpose of this matrix, typically denoted as $ A^T $, will have dimensions $ n \times m $ (with $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns). Specifically, the element located at the $ i $-th row and $ j $-th column of the original matrix will occupy the $ j $-th row and $ i $-th column in the transposed matrix.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to transpose a matrix in a programming language like Java:

1. **Declare and initialize a two-dimensional array** to represent the original matrix. We will call this array `originalMatrix`.
2. **Determine the number of rows** ($ m $) and **columns** ($ n $) in `originalMatrix`.
3. **Declare a new two-dimensional array** of size $ n \times m $ to hold the transposed matrix. We will refer to this array as `transposedMatrix`.
4. **Use a nested loop** to iterate over each element in `originalMatrix`. The outer loop should run from $ 0 $ to $ m - 1 $ (inclusive), while the inner loop should run from $ 0 $ to $ n - 1 $ (inclusive).
5. Inside the inner loop, **assign the value** at the $ i $-th row and $ j $-th column of `originalMatrix` to the $ j $-th row and $ i $-th column of `transposedMatrix`.
6. After both loops have completed, `transposedMatrix` will contain the transpose of `originalMatrix`.

This method is effective because the transpose of a matrix represents a reflection over its main diagonal, which extends from the top left to the bottom right. By swapping the row and column indices, we achieve this reflection. This approach can be applied to transpose any rectangular or square matrix.
