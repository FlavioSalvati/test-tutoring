One-dimensional arrays are designed to store a linear sequence of elements, while two-dimensional arrays organize elements into rows and columns, resembling a table.

A one-dimensional array represents the simplest type of array, capable of holding a sequence of elements of the same data type. Each element in the array can be accessed directly using its index. For instance, consider an array of integers; to access the fifth element, you would use the index $4$, as array indices typically start at $0$. This type of array is particularly useful for storing and manipulating lists of items, such as student names or test scores.

Conversely, a two-dimensional array can be conceptualized as an array of arrays. It arranges elements in a tabular format, comprising rows and columns. To access an element within a two-dimensional array, you need to specify two indices: one for the row and another for the column. This structure is ideal for scenarios where data naturally fits into a table format, such as a matrix of numbers, a spreadsheet, or a chessboard.

When it comes to memory layout, the elements of a one-dimensional array are stored in a contiguous block of memory. This arrangement allows for efficient access to elements since you can easily compute the memory address of any element based on its index. However, this also means that the size of the array must be predetermined and remains fixed once the array is created.

In contrast, a two-dimensional array can be visualized as an array containing pointers to other arrays. The outer array holds pointers to inner arrays, which may vary in length. This flexibility allows for diverse sizes and shapes of the array, but accessing elements becomes a bit more complex, as it requires following two pointers to reach a specific element. Additionally, the elements of a two-dimensional array are not guaranteed to be stored in a contiguous memory block, which can affect performance, especially for larger arrays where the memory access pattern is not optimized.
