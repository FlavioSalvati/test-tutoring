The Semantic Web sets itself apart from the traditional web by its capability to understand and interpret the content of web pages.

The traditional web, as we currently know it, is primarily designed for human users. While people can easily grasp the content and context of web pages, computers face significant challenges in doing the same. Essentially, the traditional web is a vast collection of documents and hyperlinks where the meanings of the information are implicit, understood by human users but not by machines. Consequently, the immense amount of information available on the web is largely inaccessible for automated processing and integration.

In contrast, the Semantic Web serves as an extension of the traditional web, aimed at enabling computers to comprehend and interpret the content and context of web pages. This initiative strives to make the web intelligible to machines in addition to humans, thereby fostering a more intelligent and intuitive online experience. The Semantic Web revolves around the concept of incorporating metadata and semantic tags into web pages, which clarifies the meanings of information, making it understandable for machines. This development facilitates more sophisticated and precise search capabilities, automated data integration, content personalization, and much more.

To realize its objectives, the Semantic Web employs a variety of technologies and standards, including the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and SPARQL. These tools provide a framework for expressing information in a manner that machines can read. Specifically, RDF represents information in a graph structure, OWL defines vocabularies and the relationships between terms, and SPARQL acts as a query language for retrieving and manipulating data stored in RDF format.

In summary, the Semantic Web aims to create a web of data that can be processed both directly and indirectly by machines. It aspires to transform the web into a global database or knowledge base, where information is interconnected and structured in ways that are easily understandable and usable by computers. This evolution has the potential to revolutionize how we find, share, and combine information on the web.
