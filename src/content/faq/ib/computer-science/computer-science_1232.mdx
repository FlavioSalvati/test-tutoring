Resource exhaustion, also referred to as resource depletion, occurs when a computer system or application depletes its available system resources, such as memory, CPU time, or disk space. This situation can manifest in various symptoms, depending on which resource is depleted and the extent of the depletion.

One of the most prevalent symptoms of resource exhaustion is a noticeable slowdown in system performance. When resources become scarce, the system must exert more effort and time to complete tasks. For instance, if the system is running low on memory, it may need to swap data in and out of disk storage, which is significantly slower than accessing data from RAM.

Another critical symptom of resource exhaustion is system crashes or unresponsiveness. If a system exhausts a vital resource, such as memory or CPU time, it may become incapable of maintaining operations. This can lead to a system crash, where the system abruptly halts and requires a restart. Alternatively, the system may become unresponsive, appearing to function but failing to react to user inputs.

Additionally, resource exhaustion can result in the inability to initiate new tasks or processes. When a system is low on resources, it may lack sufficient capacity to start a new application or open a new document. For example, if memory is running low, the system may be unable to launch additional applications.

In certain scenarios, resource exhaustion can also lead to data loss. For instance, if a system runs out of disk space, it may be unable to save new data or modifications to existing files, resulting in potential loss of work. This issue can be particularly detrimental in business or academic environments.

In summary, resource exhaustion can have severe repercussions for a computer system, leading to performance slowdowns, crashes, unresponsiveness, and data loss. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor system resources proactively and take measures to mitigate the risk of resource exhaustion whenever possible.
