Multitasking refers to the concurrent execution of multiple tasks, which is managed by the operating system through a process known as scheduling.

In essence, multitasking is a fundamental feature of modern operating systems, enabling several tasks, commonly referred to as processes, to operate simultaneously on a single computer. However, this does not imply that each task is executed at the same instant. Instead, the operating system rapidly alternates between tasks, creating the illusion of concurrent execution.

The operating system orchestrates multitasking via a mechanism called process scheduling. This involves determining which tasks should be executed, when they should run, and the duration of their execution. The primary objective is to optimize processor utilization and ensure that all tasks receive an equitable share of computing resources. Various scheduling algorithms are available for the operating system to implement, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Round Robin (RR), each possessing distinct advantages and disadvantages.

Beyond process scheduling, the operating system must also manage the resources required by each task. These resources encompass memory, input and output devices, and any data needed by the task. To efficiently manage these resources, the operating system employs several techniques, such as virtual memory and device drivers.

An important aspect of multitasking is the concept of context switching. This process involves saving the state of a task so that it can be resumed later. Context switching is essential for the rapid interchange between tasks. When a task is paused, its state is preserved in memory. When the task is resumed, its state is retrieved and loaded back into the processor, allowing it to continue from where it left off.

In summary, multitasking is a sophisticated process that necessitates meticulous management of tasks and resources by the operating system. It is a vital component of contemporary computing, enabling us to run multiple applications simultaneously and optimize the utilization of our computer's resources.
