To create a deep copy of a two-dimensional array, you need to initialize a new array and copy each element from the original array individually. 

In computer programming, a **deep copy** refers to a process where the elements of an array are duplicated such that modifications made to the new array do not impact the original array. This contrasts with a **shallow copy**, where the new array merely references the original array, leading to changes in one affecting the other.

To perform a deep copy of a two-dimensional array, follow these steps:

1. Create a new array with dimensions identical to those of the original array.
2. Use nested loops to iterate through each element of the original array, copying the values to the corresponding positions in the new array. The outer loop will traverse the rows, while the inner loop will handle the columns.

Here is an illustrative example in Java:

'''java
int[][] original = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
int[][] copy = new int[original.length][];

for (int i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {
    copy[i] = new int[original[i].length];
    for (int j = 0; j < original[i].length; j++) {
        copy[i][j] = original[i][j];
    }
}
'''

In this example, 'new int[original.length][]' initializes a new two-dimensional array that has the same number of rows as the original array. The statement 'new int[original[i].length]' within the outer loop creates a new array for each row, ensuring that it contains the same number of columns as the original. The inner loop then facilitates the copying of each element from the original array to the new array.

It's crucial to note that this method is suitable only for two-dimensional arrays containing primitive data types. If the array contains objects, you will need to create a new instance of each object and copy its fields. This is necessary to ensure that modifications to the objects in the new array do not affect those in the original array. In Java, objects are passed by reference; therefore, merely copying the object would result in both arrays referring to the same instance.
