The operating system (OS) serves as a vital component of a computer system, acting as an intermediary between users and hardware. It creates an environment where application software can operate effectively. This interaction occurs primarily through system calls, which are requests made by application software to the OS for various services and resources.

System calls are essential programming interfaces that enable application software to communicate with the operating system. Through these calls, applications can request a wide range of services, such as creating, reading, writing, or deleting files; sending or receiving data over a network; and starting or stopping processes. System calls allow application software to utilize hardware resources without needing to understand the underlying details of that hardware.

In addition to facilitating interactions, the operating system also manages resources for application software. These resources include the processor, memory, file storage, and input/output devices. The OS is responsible for scheduling tasks, allocating memory, managing files, and handling communication with hardware devices. It ensures that each application receives sufficient resources to function properly while preventing any single application from monopolizing the system's resources. For a comprehensive understanding of how the OS manages these resources, further exploration of resource management concepts is recommended.

Moreover, the operating system provides a layer of abstraction for application software. Instead of directly interacting with the complex and potentially error-prone hardware, application software communicates with the OS. The OS translates these interactions into instructions that the hardware can understand. This abstraction simplifies the development and execution of application software across various types of hardware. To delve deeper into the specific functions of operating systems, additional resources can be consulted.

**Summary for IB Computer Science Tutor:** The operating system (OS) connects application software to hardware through system calls, which are requests for services such as file handling and data transfer. The OS manages resources like memory and processors, ensuring efficient operation and preventing resource monopolization. By providing a user-friendly interface, the OS simplifies the process for software to run on diverse hardware platforms. Understanding these mechanisms also involves examining how the OS utilizes various strategies to enhance performance.
