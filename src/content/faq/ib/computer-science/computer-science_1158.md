A sentinel node in linked lists is a dummy node that acts as a marker or placeholder, simplifying various operations.

In the realm of linked lists, a sentinel node is a unique type of node that does not contain any significant data. Instead, it serves a specific purpose by acting as a marker or placeholder, which helps to streamline operations and minimize the need for special cases during linked list manipulations.

For example, in a singly linked list, when traversing the list to locate a specific node or to delete a node, it is necessary to check if the next node is null. However, by utilizing a sentinel node, this check can be eliminated. The sentinel node can be positioned at the end of the list, ensuring that no node's next pointer is null. This modification can greatly simplify the code and reduce the likelihood of encountering null pointer errors.

In a doubly linked list, a sentinel node can similarly denote both the beginning and the end of the list. This configuration facilitates the addition or removal of nodes at either end without the need to verify the existence of previous or next nodes.

Furthermore, sentinel nodes can also be employed in circular linked lists. In this scenario, the last node in the list points back to the sentinel node at the start of the list, rather than pointing to null. This design choice simplifies the detection of the end of the list during traversal.

Overall, the primary advantage of utilizing a sentinel node is its ability to simplify code and enhance robustness by eliminating the need to handle special cases. It is important to note, however, that the sentinel node itself does not store any meaningful data; it functions solely as a marker or placeholder.
