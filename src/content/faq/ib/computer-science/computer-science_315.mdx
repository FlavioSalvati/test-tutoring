In Python, you can create and manipulate multidimensional arrays using the NumPy library, which is essential for numerical computations.

While Python lacks built-in support for multidimensional arrays, the NumPy library fills this gap by offering a high-performance array object along with various tools for array operations. 

To get started with NumPy, you first need to import the library using the command:

```python
import numpy as np
```

After importing NumPy, you can create a multidimensional array using the `numpy.array()` function. This function accepts a list of lists (or tuples), where each inner list (or tuple) represents a row of the array. For instance, the following command creates a 2-dimensional array with $2$ rows and $3$ columns:

```python
np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
```

Accessing elements in a multidimensional array is straightforward using indices. The syntax for this is `array[row, column]`. For example, if `a` is a 2-dimensional array, the expression `a[0, 1]` retrieves the element located in the first row and second column. You can also use slicing to extract a range of elements; for instance, `a[0:2, 1:3]` returns a subarray consisting of the first two rows and the second and third columns of `a`.

You can perform a variety of operations on multidimensional arrays, similar to operations on regular arrays. This includes element-wise addition and multiplication, computing the dot product of two arrays, or applying a function to each element. NumPy also offers functions for common mathematical operations, such as calculating the sum, mean, and standard deviation of array elements.

In addition to creating and manipulating multidimensional arrays, NumPy provides several functions for reshaping, transposing, and altering the dimensionality of arrays. For example, the `reshape()` function allows you to change the shape of an array without modifying its data. The `transpose()` function swaps the rows and columns of an array, while the `ravel()` function flattens a multidimensional array into a one-dimensional array.

In summary, although Python does not include native support for multidimensional arrays, the NumPy library offers a powerful and flexible solution for working with these data structures effectively.
