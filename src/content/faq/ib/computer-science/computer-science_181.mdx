MPLS networks stand out because they utilize labels for packet forwarding, rather than relying on lengthy network addresses.

Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a protocol designed to enhance the speed and management of network traffic flows. Unlike conventional IP routing, which forwards packets based on lengthy network addresses, MPLS directs packets using short path labels. This method significantly boosts efficiency.

In traditional IP routing, each router independently decides the next destination for each packet based solely on the packet's network layer header. As a result, whenever a packet reaches a router, the router must reference its routing table to determine the next hop. This decision-making process can be time-consuming, potentially slowing down the network.

In contrast, MPLS networks operate differently. The first device that a packet encounters assigns it to a specific Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). Each FEC is designated a unique label, which is a short, fixed-length string of bits. These labels not only identify the FEC to which the packet belongs but also encapsulate forwarding information, such as the next hop for the packet. Consequently, routers in an MPLS network can make forwarding decisions based solely on the label, without needing to inspect the packet. This leads to faster and more efficient processing.

Additionally, MPLS networks are protocol-agnostic, allowing them to transport various types of payloads, including IP packets, ATM cells, and Ethernet frames. This versatility makes MPLS networks highly adaptable to different kinds of network traffic.

Another significant advantage of MPLS networks is their capability for traffic engineering. This enables network operators to manage traffic flows to accommodate diverse service requirements. This feature is particularly beneficial for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) for real-time applications, such as voice and video, which demand low latency.

In summary, MPLS networks differentiate themselves by employing labels for packet forwarding, resulting in greater efficiency and versatility compared to traditional IP routing. They also provide robust traffic engineering capabilities, making them well-suited for managing various types of network traffic while ensuring high-quality service.
