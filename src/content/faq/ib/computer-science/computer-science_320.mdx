A circular queue is distinct from a regular (or linear) queue in that it treats the end and the beginning of the queue as adjacent, allowing for continuous rotation.

In a regular queue, elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, adhering to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Once the queue reaches its capacity, no additional elements can be inserted, even if space becomes available through the removal of elements from the front. This condition is referred to as "overflow."

Conversely, a circular queue effectively addresses this limitation. In a circular queue, the last element links back to the first element, forming a circular structure. When an element is removed from the queue, the first position becomes available, but the position of the rear remains unchanged. Therefore, when a new element is added after the rear has reached the end of the storage array, it can be placed in the first position, provided that it is not already occupied. This characteristic makes circular queues a more efficient model for memory utilization compared to regular queues.

From an implementation perspective, circular queues can be constructed using either an array or a linked list. The criteria for determining if the queue is full differ between the two types. In a regular queue, the queue is considered full when the rear reaches the end of the array. In contrast, in a circular queue, the queue is full when the next position of the rear points to the front.

In summary, the primary distinction between a regular queue and a circular queue lies in their treatment of the queue's end. A regular queue sees the end of the queue as the limit of its capacity, while a circular queue views the end as adjacent to the beginning, facilitating continuous rotation and improved space utilization.
