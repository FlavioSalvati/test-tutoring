Centrality in web graph analysis is typically assessed using four primary measures: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.

In the context of web graph analysis, centrality measures serve to identify the most significant nodes within a graph. These metrics help pinpoint the nodes that exert the greatest influence over the network, determined by their connections. The four main types of centrality are as follows:

1. **Degree Centrality**: This is the most straightforward measure. It counts the number of edges connected to a node, which, in a web graph, translates to the number of hyperlinks a webpage possesses. A webpage with high degree centrality has numerous links to other pages, often interpreted as a reflection of its immediate influence or popularity.

2. **Closeness Centrality**: This measure evaluates how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. In a web graph, it indicates how few clicks are necessary to reach any other webpage from a given page. A webpage with high closeness centrality is capable of disseminating information quickly throughout the network.

3. **Betweenness Centrality**: This metric gauges the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes. In the realm of web graphs, a webpage with high betweenness centrality frequently appears on the shortest paths connecting two other webpages. This characteristic can be interpreted as a form of control or brokerage over the flow of information within the network.

4. **Eigenvector Centrality**: This measure assesses a node's influence within the network. It assigns relative scores to all nodes based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes enhance the score of the node in question more than equal connections to low-scoring nodes would. In web graph terms, a webpage with high eigenvector centrality is not only linked to many other pages but also connected to pages that are themselves considered important.

In summary, centrality measures in web graph analysis provide a valuable framework for identifying the most influential nodes within a network based on their connectivity. These measures facilitate a deeper understanding of the network's structure and dynamics, allowing for the identification of key players or influencers within it.
