Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) enables objects of various types to be treated as instances of a common type.

The term "polymorphism," derived from Greek and meaning "many shapes," represents one of the four core principles of OOP, alongside encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. This feature allows a single interface to be employed for a broad category of actions, with the specific action being determined by the context in which it is used. Essentially, polymorphism permits objects to exhibit different behaviors based on their data type or class.

To illustrate, consider a basic example involving a 'Shape' class in a graphics program. This class may include a method called 'draw'. However, the implementation of drawing a circle differs from that of drawing a rectangle. Here is where polymorphism is advantageous. Both the 'Circle' and 'Rectangle' classes would inherit from the 'Shape' class, with each providing its own implementation of the 'draw' method. Consequently, when a user selects a shape to draw, the program can invoke the 'draw' method on the chosen shape without needing to know its specific type. This is made possible by polymorphism, which allows the program to treat both the circle and rectangle as instances of the same type: 'Shape'.

Polymorphism can be realized in two primary ways: method overloading and method overriding. Method overloading permits a class to define multiple methods with the same name but differing parameters. Conversely, method overriding allows a subclass or child class to supply a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in one of its parent classes or superclasses.

In summary, polymorphism in OOP enhances coding flexibility by enabling the same method or operator to apply to different types. This leads to simpler, more intuitive, and cleaner code. Additionally, it promotes code reusability and contributes to making programs more dynamic.
