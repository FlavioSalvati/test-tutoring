To resize a two-dimensional array, you can create a new array with the desired dimensions and then copy the elements from the original array into this new one.

In most programming languages, arrays are of fixed size, meaning that once an array is created, its size cannot be altered. However, you can simulate resizing by allocating a new array with the desired dimensions and transferring the elements from the old array to the new one. This operation is commonly referred to as 'resizing' an array.

When dealing with a two-dimensional array, the process is somewhat more intricate since it involves an array of arrays. Nonetheless, the core principle remains unchanged: create a new two-dimensional array with the specified dimensions, and then iterate through the original array to copy its elements into the new one.

For instance, consider the following example in Java:

```java
int[][] oldArray = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
int[][] newArray = new int[4][3];

for (int i = 0; i < oldArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < oldArray[i].length; j++) {
        newArray[i][j] = oldArray[i][j];
    }
}
```

In this example, `oldArray` is a $3 \times 3$ array, while `newArray` is a $4 \times 3$ array. The nested for loops facilitate the copying of elements from `oldArray` to `newArray`. After the completion of these loops, `newArray` will contain all the elements from `oldArray`, along with an additional row that can be utilized for new elements.

It is essential to recognize that this resizing process entails creating a new array and copying over the elements, which can be computationally intensive, particularly if the array is large. If your program requires frequent resizing of arrays, you may want to consider using alternative data structures such as lists or vectors, which can dynamically adjust their sizes as necessary.
