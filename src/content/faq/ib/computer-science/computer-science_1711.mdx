System designers integrate feedback into iterative design by using it to refine and improve subsequent design iterations.

Iterative design is a cyclical process of prototyping, testing, analysing, and refining a product or process. Feedback plays a crucial role in this process as it provides the necessary insights for improvement. System designers use feedback from users, stakeholders, and other designers to identify areas of the design that are not meeting the intended goals or user needs. This feedback can be gathered through various methods such as user testing, surveys, interviews, or even through direct observation.

Once the feedback is collected, system designers analyse it to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the current design iteration. They look for patterns and trends in the feedback to identify common issues or areas of improvement. This analysis helps them to prioritise the changes that need to be made in the next iteration.

The feedback is then used to refine the design. System designers make changes to the design based on the feedback, focusing on improving the areas that were identified as weak or problematic. These changes could be minor tweaks or major overhauls, depending on the feedback received.

The updated design is then tested again, and the cycle repeats. Each iteration of the design is an opportunity to incorporate feedback and make improvements. This process continues until the design meets the desired goals and user needs.

In essence, feedback is the driving force behind iterative design. It provides the necessary information for system designers to continuously improve and refine their design. By integrating feedback into the iterative design process, system designers can ensure that the final product or system is user-friendly, effective, and meets the needs of its intended users.
