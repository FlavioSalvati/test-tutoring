RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile and used for temporary storage, while ROM (Read Only Memory) is non-volatile and stores permanent data.

RAM and ROM are both types of computer memory, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of volatile memory. This means that it requires power to maintain the stored information; once the power is turned off, all data in the RAM is lost. RAM is used by the computer to store data that is being processed or used by the currently active applications. It allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, which is why it's called 'Random Access'. The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can process at once without slowing down.

On the other hand, ROM, or Read Only Memory, is a type of non-volatile memory, meaning it does not require power to maintain the stored information. Even when the power is turned off, the data stored in ROM remains intact. ROM is used to store firmware or software that boots up the computer and performs diagnostics. This data is written during the manufacturing process and cannot be altered or erased by normal computer operations, hence the name 'Read Only'.

In terms of functionality, RAM is much faster than ROM. This is because RAM is directly connected to the CPU and is designed for speed to facilitate real-time computing tasks. ROM, however, is slower and is typically used for permanent, read-only tasks such as storing the computer's BIOS or bootloader.

In summary, while both RAM and ROM are integral parts of a computer's architecture, they serve different functions. RAM provides temporary, high-speed storage for data being actively processed, while ROM provides permanent storage for critical system data that must be preserved even when the computer is powered off.
