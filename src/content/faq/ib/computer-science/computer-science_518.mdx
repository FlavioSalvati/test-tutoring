Data consistency in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) is achieved through the implementation of ACID properties, constraints, normalization, and transaction management.

The ACID properties represent a fundamental set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability:

- **Atomicity** guarantees that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is aborted, ensuring that the database remains unchanged.
- **Consistency** ensures that a transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another. This means that all rules and constraints must be satisfied before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation** ensures that concurrent execution of transactions does not interfere with one another. The result of executing transactions concurrently should be the same as if they were executed sequentially, one after the other.
- **Durability** guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the event of a system failure. This means that completed transactions are permanently recorded in the database.

Constraints are rules that enforce specific conditions on data columns within a table, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the stored data. Constraints can be categorized as either column-level or table-level:

- **Column-level constraints** apply to individual columns.
- **Table-level constraints** apply to the entire table.

Common types of constraints include:
- **NOT NULL:** Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
- **UNIQUE:** Ensures that all values in a column are distinct.
- **PRIMARY KEY:** Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **FOREIGN KEY:** Maintains referential integrity between tables.
- **CHECK:** Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

Normalization is a database design technique aimed at reducing data redundancy and eliminating undesirable characteristics such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. This process involves dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable tables and establishing relationships between them. The primary objective of normalization is to simplify the addition, deletion, or modification of data so that changes can be made in a single table and subsequently propagated throughout the database via defined relationships.

Transaction management is essential for maintaining data consistency within a database. A transaction is defined as a single logical unit of work that accesses and potentially modifies the database contents. Transactions employ read and write operations to interact with data. To preserve consistency, any changes made by an incomplete transaction must remain invisible to other transactions. Moreover, once a transaction is completed, its changes should persist even in the event of failures. This reliability is achieved by utilizing log files that record all changes made during transactions.

In summary, ensuring data consistency in RDBMS involves a comprehensive approach that integrates ACID properties, constraints, normalization, and transaction management. These techniques collectively work to uphold the integrity and reliability of the data within the database.
