The success of the system testing phase is evaluated based on the number of defects identified and resolved, as well as the overall performance of the system.

System testing is a vital stage in the software development lifecycle. It entails evaluating the entire system to ensure it meets the specified requirements and operates as intended in real-world conditions. The effectiveness of this phase is primarily gauged by its ability to identify and rectify defects, along with the system's performance across various scenarios.

One of the key metrics for assessing the success of system testing is the number of defects identified. This encompasses both functional and non-functional defects. Functional defects are issues that hinder the system from executing its intended functions, whereas non-functional defects pertain to aspects such as performance, usability, and security. A higher number of identified and resolved defects during system testing typically indicates a greater quality of the system, thus suggesting a more successful testing phase.

Another significant metric is the system's performance, which includes factors such as speed, reliability, and stability under different loads and conditions. Performance testing, a subset of system testing, evaluates how the system behaves under both normal and peak loads, the responsiveness to user inputs, and its stability over time. If the system demonstrates strong performance in these tests, it reflects positively on the success of the system testing phase.

Additionally, the success of system testing can be measured by the degree to which the system meets the specified requirements. This evaluation involves comparing the actual behavior of the system with the expected behavior outlined in the requirements specification. If the system operates as anticipated and fulfills all the specified requirements, this is a strong indicator that the system testing phase has been successful.

In summary, the success of the system testing phase is not determined by a single criterion but rather by a combination of factors, including the number of defects identified and resolved, the system's performance, and its compliance with specified requirements. These metrics collectively offer a comprehensive perspective on the system's quality and its readiness for deployment.
