A sparse matrix is defined as a matrix that is predominantly composed of zero values. Such matrices can be represented using two-dimensional (2D) arrays, but their efficient storage and manipulation are of primary concern.

In greater detail, a sparse matrix is characterized by having a majority of its elements equal to zero. This stands in contrast to a dense matrix, where most of the elements are non-zero. Sparse matrices are frequently encountered in scientific and engineering applications, particularly when solving systems of linear equations.

The main advantage of using a sparse matrix over a standard matrix is the enhancement of storage efficiency. In a standard matrix, each element occupies memory space, regardless of its value. In contrast, a sparse matrix only stores the non-zero elements, resulting in substantial memory savings when dealing with large matrices that contain a significant number of zeros.

There are several methods to represent sparse matrices using 2D arrays. The simplest approach involves using a conventional 2D array where each entry corresponds to an element in the matrix. While this method is straightforward and easy to comprehend, it does not leverage the matrix's sparsity, as it still allocates memory for every element, including those that are zero.

A more efficient representation of a sparse matrix is achieved through techniques such as 'Compressed Sparse Row' (CSR) or 'Compressed Sparse Column' (CSC). In these methods, three distinct arrays are utilized: one for storing the non-zero values, one for the corresponding column indices (in the case of CSR) or row indices (for CSC), and a third array for index pointers. The index pointers array contains one entry for each row (for CSR) or column (for CSC), and its values indicate the position within the values array where the first non-zero element for that row or column can be found. This approach enables the efficient skipping of zero values during matrix operations, which can lead to significant memory savings and improved performance.

Another representation method is the 'Coordinate List' (COO) format, which employs two arrays to store the row and column indices of each non-zero element, along with a third array to hold the actual values. While this method is simple and flexible, it may be less efficient than CSR or CSC for certain computational tasks.
