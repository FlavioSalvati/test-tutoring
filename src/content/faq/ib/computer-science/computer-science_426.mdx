An operating system (OS) is essential for managing system resources by allocating and monitoring both hardware and software resources across various tasks.

The OS serves as a crucial intermediary between the user and the computer's hardware. It is responsible for overseeing the system's resources, which include the CPU, memory, disk space, and peripheral devices such as printers and scanners. The OS's primary goal is to ensure that these resources are utilized efficiently and effectively, preventing conflicts and facilitating smooth operation.

One of the OS's main responsibilities is CPU management. The OS determines which processes have access to the CPU and when they can use it, a function known as process scheduling. To optimize CPU utilization and minimize response time, the OS employs various algorithms to establish the order in which processes are executed. Additionally, the OS allocates CPU time fairly among different tasks, ensuring that all processes receive an appropriate share of the CPU's resources.

Memory management is another critical function performed by the OS. It meticulously tracks each byte of the system's memory and monitors which processes are using specific memory areas at any given moment. When a process needs to be executed, the OS allocates the necessary memory. Upon completion of the process, the OS releases the memory for use by other processes. This management is vital for maintaining efficient memory usage and preventing processes from interfering with one another.

In terms of disk management, the OS monitors the location of files on the disk and governs the reading and writing of data. It is responsible for allocating disk space for different files and directories, ensuring that disk space is used optimally and that files can be easily located.

The OS also plays a significant role in managing peripheral devices. It communicates with these devices, sending commands and receiving data as needed. Furthermore, the OS oversees the allocation of these devices to various tasks, ensuring efficient usage and preventing conflicts between tasks.

In conclusion, the operating system is pivotal in managing system resources. By effectively allocating and monitoring both hardware and software resources, it enables the computer system to operate smoothly and efficiently.
