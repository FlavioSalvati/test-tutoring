Memory management in operating systems is responsible for controlling and coordinating computer memory, assigning portions to different programs to optimise overall system performance.

Memory management is a critical function of an operating system. It is the task of managing the computer's primary memory, which is the Random Access Memory (RAM). The operating system is responsible for keeping track of each and every byte in a computer's memory and also which program is using which memory. This is important because multiple processes often need to access memory at the same time, and it's the job of the memory management system to ensure that this can happen without causing conflicts.

The memory management system has several key responsibilities. Firstly, it must keep track of what parts of memory are currently being used and by whom. This is typically done using a data structure such as a bitmap or a table. Secondly, it must allocate memory to processes when they need it. This involves deciding which parts of memory to give to the process, and updating its records to reflect this. Thirdly, it must deallocate memory from processes when they no longer need it, again updating its records.

Memory management also involves the concept of 'virtual memory'. This is a technique that allows the execution of processes that may not be completely in the memory. It does this by creating the illusion that there is more memory in the system than there actually is. This is achieved by swapping data between physical memory and disk storage in a way that is transparent to the user.

In summary, memory management in operating systems is a complex task that involves keeping track of each byte in a computer's memory, allocating and deallocating memory to processes, and managing virtual memory. It is a crucial part of the operating system's role, as it ensures that all processes can access memory as and when they need it, without causing conflicts or crashes.
