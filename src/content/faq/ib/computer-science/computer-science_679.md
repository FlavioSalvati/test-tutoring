Common methods for data decompression on the web include Huffman coding, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), and the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm.

**Huffman Coding** is a widely used method for lossless data compression. It employs a variable-length code table to encode each source symbol, where the code table is constructed based on the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence of each symbol. The most frequent symbols are assigned the shortest codes, while the least frequent symbols receive longer codes. Huffman coding is employed in various applications, including the ZIP file format and JPEG image compression.

**Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** is a straightforward approach to data compression that stores consecutive runs of data as a single value along with a count of how many times that value occurs. This method is particularly effective for data that contains many repetitive sequences, such as simple graphic images, icons, line drawings, and animations. However, RLE is less effective for files with few runs, as it can potentially increase the file size. RLE is commonly utilized in graphics file formats such as PCX and BMP.

**Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)** is a universal lossless data compression algorithm developed by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch. LZW is notably used in GIF images and was also implemented in early modem technologies. The algorithm functions by reading sequences of symbols, grouping these symbols into strings, and then converting these strings into fixed-length codes. This flexibility allows the algorithm to adapt to varying data lengths, resulting in efficient compression ratios.

All these methods are crucial for minimizing the amount of data transferred over the web, which in turn accelerates webpage loading times and reduces bandwidth consumption. They play an essential role in the efficient operation of the internet.
