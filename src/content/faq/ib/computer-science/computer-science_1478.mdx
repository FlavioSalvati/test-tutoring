The essential protocols that enable the functioning of the web are HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).

**HTTP** is the protocol utilized for transferring hypertext requests and information between servers and web browsers. It is the mechanism that allows users to access websites by entering a URL in their browser. HTTP operates as a request-response protocol within the client-server computing model. In this context, the web browser acts as the client, while the server is an application running on a computer that hosts the website. When a client sends an HTTP request message to the server, the server responds with a message containing the requested resources, such as HTML files and other content, or it may perform various functions on behalf of the client.

**TCP/IP**, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a comprehensive suite of communication protocols designed for interconnecting network devices over the internet. TCP/IP can also function as a communication protocol within private networks, such as intranets and extranets. The entire suite of protocols is commonly referred to as TCP/IP, with TCP and IP being the two primary protocols. TCP is tasked with ensuring the reliable transmission of data across networks connected to the internet, while IP is responsible for directing and routing data packets to their appropriate destinations.

In addition to HTTP and TCP/IP, there are other important protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for transferring files, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for handling email services, and DNS (Domain Name System) for converting domain names into IP addresses. Nonetheless, HTTP and TCP/IP remain the foundational protocols that facilitate the crucial processes of accessing and transferring information on the web.
