Data normalization consists of several levels, including First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), Fourth Normal Form (4NF), and Fifth Normal Form (5NF). 

Normalization is a vital process in database design that aims to organize data effectively to minimize redundancy and dependency. This involves dividing a database into two or more tables and establishing relationships between them. The primary goal of normalization is to enable the addition, deletion, and modification of data without introducing data anomalies.

The **First Normal Form (1NF)** establishes essential rules for organizing a database. These rules include eliminating duplicate columns within the same table, creating separate tables for each group of related data, and identifying each set of related data with a primary key.

The **Second Normal Form (2NF)** builds upon the principles of the first normal form. To achieve 2NF, a database must first comply with all 1NF rules. Additionally, it requires the removal of subsets of data that apply to multiple rows in a table, placing them into separate tables. Relationships between these new tables and their original tables are established using foreign keys.

The **Third Normal Form (3NF)** advances the normalization process further. A table is in 3NF if it satisfies all the criteria of 2NF and eliminates columns that do not depend on the primary key.

**Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** is a stricter version of 3NF. A table is considered to be in BCNF if, for every non-trivial functional dependency $X \to Y$, the set $X$ is a superkey.

**Fourth Normal Form (4NF)** introduces an additional requirement. A relation is in 4NF if it adheres to all the rules of 3NF and contains no multi-valued dependencies.

Finally, the **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**, also known as Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF), addresses scenarios where information can be reconstructed from smaller pieces of data that can be managed with reduced redundancy. A table is in 5NF if and only if every join dependency in it is implied by the candidate keys.

Each level of normalization addresses specific issues that may arise in relational databases. It is important to recognize that a higher level of normalization does not necessarily indicate a superior database design. Depending on the particular requirements of a given application, a less normalized database may prove to be more efficient.
