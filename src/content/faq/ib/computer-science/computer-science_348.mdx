The runner technique, also referred to as the two-pointer technique, is a widely used method for solving problems involving linked lists. This approach utilizes two pointers, commonly designated as the "slow" pointer and the "fast" pointer (or "runner"). The slow pointer advances through the list at a rate of one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves at a rate of two steps per iteration. This technique is particularly effective for identifying specific properties of a linked list, including cycle detection and locating the middle element.

The fundamental concept behind the runner technique is that when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will have traversed approximately half the distance (assuming there is no cycle). In cases where a cycle exists, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer, indicating the presence of that cycle. Additionally, this technique can be employed to find the middle element of a linked list: when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be positioned at the midpoint.

To implement the runner technique, you start by initializing both pointers at the head of the linked list. In each iteration of a loop, you will move the slow pointer forward by one step and the fast pointer by two steps. If at any point the fast pointer becomes null (or if the next node of the fast pointer is null), it signifies that you have reached the end of the list. Conversely, if the fast pointer becomes equal to the slow pointer at any time during traversal, this indicates that a cycle exists in the linked list.

The runner technique is a powerful and efficient strategy for tackling linked list problems, and it is beneficial to become well-acquainted with its application. By traversing a linked list with two pointers operating at different speeds, you can solve challenges more effectively and efficiently.
