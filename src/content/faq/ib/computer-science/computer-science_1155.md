The memory allocation for a linked list is dynamic and non-contiguous, whereas for an array, it is static and contiguous.

In computer science, the method of memory allocation for various data structures significantly influences their performance and application. An array is considered a static data structure, meaning its size is determined at the time of creation and remains fixed thereafter. It requires a contiguous block of memory, which implies that all elements are stored sequentially in one location. This can pose challenges when adding or removing elements, as you would typically need to create a new array of a different size and copy the existing elements to it. Nonetheless, array element access is very efficient; you can compute the exact memory address of each element using its index.

Conversely, a linked list is classified as a dynamic data structure, allowing its size to change during the execution of a program. It does not necessitate a contiguous block of memory; instead, its elements, known as 'nodes', can be distributed throughout memory. Each node comprises a data element and a 'link' to the subsequent node in the list. This structure facilitates relatively simple addition or removal of elements, as you only need to adjust the links between the nodes. However, accessing elements in a linked list can be slower compared to an array, as it requires traversing the list from the beginning to locate the desired element.

Regarding memory allocation efficiency, arrays are advantageous when the number of elements is known in advance and remains constant. In contrast, when the number of elements is likely to fluctuate, a linked list may be more efficient, as it can dynamically grow or shrink as necessary without needing a new block of memory. Additionally, since linked lists do not rely on contiguous memory, they can better utilize fragmented memory spaces.

In summary, the decision to use an array or a linked list hinges on the specific requirements of your program, including how memory is allocated and utilized. A clear understanding of these differences can lead to more effective design choices.
