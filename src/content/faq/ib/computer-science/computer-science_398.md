A stack is distinct from an array in its method of data access, adhering to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

In the realm of computer science, both stacks and arrays are fundamental data structures used for storing and managing data. However, they operate quite differently and are suited for different tasks. 

An array is a data structure that maintains a fixed-size sequential collection of elements, all of the same type. It enables access to its elements via their indices, which means that if you know the position of an element, you can access it directly. This characteristic makes arrays particularly advantageous when frequent access or modification of elements at various positions is required.

Conversely, a stack is a linear data structure that operates under a specific order for its operations, following the LIFO principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This behavior is analogous to a physical stack of plates: you can only add or remove plates from the top. Unlike an array, a stack does not allow direct access to its elements located in the middle; to reach a specific element, you must remove the elements above it one at a time.

The primary operations performed on a stack include 'push' (adding an element to the top of the stack), 'pop' (removing the top element), and 'peek' or 'top' (viewing the top element without removing it). These operations are executed in constant time, which makes stacks particularly efficient for certain algorithms, such as parsing expressions and traversing trees or graphs.

In summary, while arrays provide direct access to any of their elements, stacks restrict access to only the top element and follow the LIFO principle for adding and removing elements. The decision to use a stack or an array hinges on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
