Distributed systems are designed to manage concurrent operations through various techniques, including locking, optimistic concurrency control (OCC), and distributed transactions.

In a distributed system, multiple nodes collaborate to execute operations simultaneously. However, this concurrency can lead to conflicts if not properly managed. One widely used method for handling concurrent operations is locking. Locking involves a node securing a data item when it intends to perform an operation on it. This mechanism prevents other nodes from accessing or modifying the data item until the lock is released, thereby ensuring that operations are carried out in a controlled manner and mitigating conflicts and inconsistencies.

Another approach is optimistic concurrency control (OCC). Unlike locking, OCC permits multiple nodes to access and modify data items concurrently, operating under the assumption that conflicts are infrequent. When a node attempts to commit its changes, it checks whether any other node has modified the data item since it was last accessed. If a modification has occurred, the node must discard its changes and restart the process. This technique is particularly advantageous in scenarios where read operations are more prevalent than write operations.

Distributed transactions represent another strategy for managing concurrent operations. A distributed transaction consists of a sequence of operations executed across multiple nodes, treated as a single logical unit. This means that either all operations succeed, or none do, which is referred to as atomicity. Distributed transactions also uphold the ACID propertiesâ€”atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. Consistency ensures that the system remains in a valid state both before and after the transaction. Isolation guarantees that each transaction is executed independently of others, while durability confirms that once a transaction is committed, it persists even in the event of failures.

Additionally, distributed systems employ replication to manage concurrent operations effectively. Replication involves maintaining multiple copies of the same data item across different nodes, allowing operations to be executed on any copy, thus enhancing availability and performance. However, replication also introduces the challenge of ensuring consistency among the various copies. This challenge is often addressed through replication strategies, such as primary-backup and multi-master replication.

In summary, managing concurrent operations in distributed systems is a complex endeavor that requires careful conflict management and consistency enforcement. Techniques such as locking, optimistic concurrency control, distributed transactions, and replication play crucial roles in achieving effective concurrency control.
