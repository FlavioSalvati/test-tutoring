To construct a truth table for multiple logical operators, begin by listing all possible combinations of input values and then determine the corresponding output for each combination.

A truth table is a mathematical tool used in logic to compute the functional values of logical expressions based on their input arguments. It serves to illustrate all possible outcomes of a set of logical operations. While creating a truth table for expressions involving multiple operators can be somewhat complex, it remains a manageable task.

**Step 1: Identify the Variables**

Start by identifying all the variables present in your logical expression. For instance, in the expression $(p \land q) \lor r$, the variables are $p$, $q$, and $r$.

**Step 2: List Possible Combinations of Truth Values**

Next, list all possible combinations of truth values for these variables. With three variables, there are $2^3 = 8$ combinations. These combinations should be organized in rows within your truth table.

**Step 3: Evaluate the Expression**

Now, you will need to determine the truth value of the expression for each combination of inputs. Begin by evaluating the innermost parentheses first. In our example, compute the truth value of $(p \land q)$ for each row. Record these values in a new column in the table.

**Step 4: Evaluate the Overall Expression**

Following that, evaluate the next component of the expression using the values you just calculated. In our example, you will now determine the truth value of $(p \land q) \lor r$ for each row. Document these results in another new column in your table.

**Operator Definitions:**

- The AND operator ($\land$) yields true if both inputs are true.
- The OR operator ($\lor$) yields true if at least one of the inputs is true.
- The NOT operator ($\neg$) inverts the truth value of the input.

By following these systematic steps, you can create a truth table for any logical expression, regardless of the number of operators involved. This technique is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the behavior of logical expressions in the field of computer science.
