The architecture of a distributed system is inherently designed to support scalability. This is achieved by enabling the addition of more nodes to manage an increased workload efficiently.

In a distributed system, the workload is distributed across multiple nodes, each functioning independently. This decentralized architecture enhances scalability because, as demand grows, additional nodes can be integrated into the system to accommodate the increased load. This stands in stark contrast to a centralized system, where a single node is responsible for handling all tasks. In such cases, expanding the system's capacity often necessitates costly and complex upgrades to the hardware of that one node.

Scalability in a distributed system is primarily achieved through two key strategies: horizontal scaling and vertical scaling. 

**Horizontal scaling** involves augmenting the system's capacity by adding more nodes. This method is often preferred due to its flexibility and cost-effectiveness in managing increased workloads. For instance, if a system experiences a temporary spike in demand, additional nodes can be deployed to handle this surge and subsequently removed when the demand decreases.

**Vertical scaling**, on the other hand, entails enhancing the capacity of existing nodes. This can be accomplished by upgrading the hardware, such as installing more powerful processors or increasing memory. While vertical scaling can indeed boost the system's capacity, it is generally more expensive and less flexible compared to horizontal scaling, as it relies on improving the infrastructure of the current nodes.

Moreover, distributed systems are built with fault tolerance in mind, which allows them to continue functioning even if one or more nodes fail. This resilience is achieved through redundancy, where copies of each piece of data are stored across multiple nodes. If one node goes offline, the system can still retrieve the data from another node. This not only enhances the reliability of the system but also contributes to its scalability, as the system can maintain effective operation while integrating additional nodes.

In summary, the architecture of a distributed system promotes scalability by facilitating the addition of nodes to handle increased workloads and employing strategies such as horizontal and vertical scaling. Additionally, the inherent fault tolerance of these systems further enhances their scalability, allowing them to operate effectively even as more nodes are added.
