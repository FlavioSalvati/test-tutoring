The maximum transmission length for a CAT6 cable is $100$ metres.

CAT6, or Category 6, is a standard for Ethernet and other network physical layers that is backward compatible with the Category 5/5e and Category 3 cable standards. It is specifically designed to provide high performance for Ethernet networks, supporting both Gigabit Ethernet and 10-Gigabit Ethernet. The $100$ metre maximum length for CAT6 cable transmission is outlined by the standard.

This length is determined by several factors, including signal frequency, cable quality, and the nature of the data being transmitted. The $100$ metre limit serves as a guideline to ensure reliable data transmission across the entire length of the cable. Exceeding this length may result in degraded signal quality, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

The $100$ metre limit encompasses up to $90$ metres of solid "horizontal" cabling connecting network equipment to the work area, along with an additional $10$ metres of stranded patch cable linking each jack to the corresponding device. This configuration allows for a reasonable degree of flexibility in positioning network equipment and devices while still ensuring dependable data transmission.

It is crucial to recognize that although the standard sets a maximum length of $100$ metres, the practical maximum length might be shorter depending on the specific network environment and the quality of the cable installation. Factors such as electromagnetic interference, the quality of the cable, and the quality of installation can all influence the maximum effective length of a CAT6 cable.

In summary, while the standard indicates a maximum length of $100$ metres for a CAT6 cable, the actual maximum length in any given installation may be less due to various contributing factors. Therefore, it is advisable to test the cable in its installed environment to ensure reliable data transmission.
