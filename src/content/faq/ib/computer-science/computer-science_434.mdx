The operating system (OS) is fundamental in managing resources within virtualized environments by allocating and controlling access to hardware resources for each virtual machine (VM).

In a virtualized setting, the OS is tasked with the essential responsibility of overseeing resource allocation. This includes managing key components such as the CPU, memory, storage, and network resources, ensuring that each VM has the necessary resources to operate efficiently. Additionally, the OS maintains the overall performance and stability of the system, balancing the needs of all VMs.

To facilitate resource management, the OS employs a component known as the hypervisor. The hypervisor is software that creates and runs VMs, acting as an intermediary between the physical hardware and the virtual machines. It is responsible for distributing the resources of the physical host machine among the VMs, ensuring that each VM receives a fair share of resources. Furthermore, the hypervisor isolates VMs from one another, preventing any interference that could disrupt their operations.

When it comes to CPU management, the OS schedules CPU time for each VM using algorithms that determine which VM receives CPU resources and when. This scheduling ensures equitable access to CPU resources, thereby maintaining system responsiveness.

Memory management is another critical function of the OS in a virtualized environment. The OS allocates a specific amount of memory to each VM and monitors usage to ensure that no VM exceeds its allocated limit. If a VM requires additional memory, the OS can allocate more, provided that there is sufficient free memory available on the physical host machine.

In addition, the OS handles the management of storage and network resources. It allocates storage space to each VM and oversees the data flow between VMs and storage devices. The OS also regulates network traffic between VMs and network devices, facilitating smooth communication.

In summary, the OS plays a vital role in resource management within virtualized environments. It ensures that each VM has the necessary resources for effective operation while simultaneously maintaining the overall performance and stability of the system.
