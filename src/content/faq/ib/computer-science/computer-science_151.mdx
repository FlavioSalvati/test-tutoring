A half-adder is a fundamental digital circuit utilized in computing to execute the simplest form of binary addition.

In essence, a half-adder is a specific type of adder, which is an electronic device designed for adding numbers. This circuit can add two single binary digits and produces two outputs: the sum ($S$) and the carry ($C$). Here, the 'sum' indicates the result of the addition, while the 'carry' signifies whether there has been an overflow in binary terms.

The term 'half-adder' is derived from its inability to account for any carry from a prior addition. This limitation arises because a half-adder performs only half the function of a full adder, which does consider a carry from previous additions.

The logic diagram of a half-adder consists of two inputs and two outputs, which are interconnected via an XOR (exclusive OR) gate and an AND gate. The XOR gate computes the sum of the two binary digits, while the AND gate determines the carry.

For instance, when both input digits are $1$, the XOR gate will output $0$ (since it produces a true output only when the inputs differ), and the AND gate will output $1$ (as it outputs true only when both inputs are true). Therefore, in this case, the sum is $0$ and the carry is $1$, which accurately reflects the result of adding $1$ and $1$ in binary.

In summary, a half-adder is a crucial building block in digital circuits, essential for the process of binary addition. This simple yet vital component plays a significant role in the design of more complex computing systems.
