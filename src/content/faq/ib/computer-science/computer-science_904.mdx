The operating system (OS) serves as the intermediary between users and computer hardware, including persistent storage devices like hard drives, solid-state drives, and flash drives. It is responsible for managing these devices and enabling other software, such as applications, to interact with them. This interaction is facilitated primarily through a component of the OS known as the file system.

The file system organizes and manages data on storage devices, determining how data is stored and retrieved. It provides a logical structure for data, allowing users and applications to read from or write to storage without directly interacting with the physical device. Instead, when a user or application seeks to access data, they engage with the file system, which translates their requests into a series of instructions understandable by the storage device. This abstraction simplifies the user experience, as it allows them to work with files and directories without needing to know the underlying details of physical data storage.

In addition to the file system, the OS interacts with storage devices through device drivers. A device driver is specialized software that controls a specific piece of hardware. The driver for a storage device understands the unique commands that the device can accept and how to communicate with it effectively. When the file system requires data to be read or written, it sends a request to the relevant device driver. The driver then translates this request into a format that the storage device can process and forwards it accordingly. Once the device executes the requested operation, it sends the results back to the driver, which in turn relays this information to the file system.

Beyond managing data storage and retrieval, the OS also monitors the status of storage devices. It can detect situations such as low disk space and alert the user or identify when a device is failing and needs replacement. Additionally, the OS controls access to storage devices, ensuring that only authorized users and applications can read or write data. This access management is essential for maintaining data security and integrity.

In summary, the OS interacts with persistent storage devices through both the file system and device drivers. It effectively manages data storage and retrieval, monitors device status, and controls access to ensure secure and reliable operation.
