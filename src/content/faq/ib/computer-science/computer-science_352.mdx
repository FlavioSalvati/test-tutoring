In operations involving linked lists, managing underflow and overflow is crucial. This is typically done by checking the list's size before performing any operations.

In the context of linked lists, underflow and overflow refer to specific conditions: underflow occurs when an attempt is made to remove an element from an empty list, while overflow happens when an element is added to a list that has reached its maximum allowable size. It's important to note, however, that standard linked list implementations do not impose a maximum size limit, aside from the constraints of the computer's memory. Therefore, overflow is generally not a concern in typical linked list usage.

On the other hand, underflow is a more common issue that must be addressed. Underflow occurs when you attempt to remove an element from an empty list. To prevent this scenario, it is essential to check whether the list is empty before attempting to remove an element. If the list is indeed empty, you should return an appropriate error message or handle the situation in a manner that aligns with your application's requirements.

For instance, when implementing a stack using a linked list, you might have a `pop` function designed to remove the most recently added element. Prior to invoking this function, you should verify whether the list is empty. If it is, you could return an error message such as "Error: stack underflow," indicating that the operation to remove an element from an empty stack was attempted. For further information, please refer to our accompanying notes.

Regarding overflow, as previously mentioned, this issue is not typically relevant to linked lists because they can expand dynamically as long as there is available memory. However, if you are dealing with a specific type of linked list that has a fixed capacity, such as a circular buffer, it becomes necessary to manage overflow. In such cases, you should check the size of the list before adding a new element and return an error message if the list has already reached its maximum capacity.
