An operating system (OS) is essential for ensuring data safety through effective memory management, hardware access control, and implementation of file systems.

The OS plays a pivotal role in the secure reading and writing of data on a computer. One of its primary functions is memory management. The OS allocates memory to various processes while ensuring that these processes do not interfere with one another. This function is crucial for data integrity, as it prevents one process from inadvertently overwriting the data of another. Moreover, the OS ensures that memory is deallocated once a process is completed, effectively preventing memory leaks that could potentially lead to data loss or corruption.

Another significant responsibility of the OS in maintaining data safety is controlling access to hardware resources. The OS serves as an intermediary between applications and the computer's hardware. This intermediary role is critical because direct hardware access by applications can result in data corruption or loss. For instance, if two applications attempt to write to the same sector of a hard drive simultaneously, the data could become compromised. The OS mitigates this risk by regulating the timing and manner in which applications access hardware.

In addition to memory management and hardware control, the OS implements file systems, which are vital for safeguarding data. A file system provides a structured method for organizing and storing data on storage devices, such as hard drives. The OS utilizes the file system to track the locations of stored data, ensuring that it can be reliably read and written. It also introduces a level of abstraction, enabling applications to interact with files and directories instead of dealing with raw data directly on the storage medium. This abstraction simplifies the process for applications, making it easier to safely handle data.

Furthermore, the OS includes additional features that bolster data safety. These features encompass backup and recovery tools, which are instrumental in restoring data following a failure, and security mechanisms such as access control, which help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. By executing these functions, the OS is integral to ensuring that data is reliably read and written on a computer.
