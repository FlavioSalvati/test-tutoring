Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) establishes a hierarchical relationship by enabling classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes.

Inheritance is a core concept in OOP, allowing the creation of new classes derived from existing ones. This process involves the new class, referred to as the subclass or derived class, inheriting the attributes and behaviors (properties and methods) of an existing class, known as the superclass or base class. This relationship creates a hierarchical structure, with the superclass positioned at the top and the subclasses positioned below.

The hierarchy established through inheritance is described as an 'is-a' relationship. For example, consider a superclass called 'Animal' and a subclass called 'Dog'; the relationship can be articulated as 'Dog is an Animal'. This indicates that a Dog inherits all properties and methods of an Animal, while also possessing additional properties and methods unique to dogs. Such a hierarchical framework promotes code reusability and provides a logical, organized structure for classes.

Inheritance also embraces the concept of polymorphism in OOP, further enriching the hierarchical framework. Polymorphism enables a subclass to override or extend the methods of its superclass. Consequently, while a subclass inherits the methods of its superclass, it can also modify these methods to cater to its specific requirements. This capability results in a more intricate hierarchy where subclasses inherit from the superclass and can also exhibit distinctive behaviors.

Furthermore, multiple levels of inheritance can be implemented, forming a multi-level hierarchy. For instance, a class 'Poodle' can be a subclass of the 'Dog' class, which in turn is a subclass of the 'Animal' class. This arrangement creates a three-level hierarchy: 

$$
\text{Animal} \rightarrow \text{Dog} \rightarrow \text{Poodle}
$$

Each level in this hierarchy inherits the properties and methods from the level above it, while also being able to introduce its own specific properties and methods.

In summary, inheritance in OOP constructs a hierarchy of classes that fosters code reusability, organization, and flexibility. It facilitates the definition and creation of classes based on other classes, establishing a structured 'is-a' relationship among them. This hierarchical structure is a fundamental characteristic of OOP that enhances its power and versatility.
