Databases manage concurrent transactions through a process known as concurrency control.

Concurrency control is a fundamental aspect of database systems that ensures transactions are executed safely and concurrently without interfering with one another. This is particularly important in multi-user database environments where multiple transactions may be executed simultaneously. The primary objectives of concurrency control are to maintain the consistency, isolation, and durability of transactions, collectively referred to as the ACID properties.

Several methods are employed to manage concurrent transactions, including locking, timestamping, and optimistic concurrency control.

**Locking** is a widely-used approach for controlling concurrency. In this method, a transaction locks the data it accesses, preventing other transactions from modifying it until the initial transaction is complete. There are two primary types of locks: shared locks and exclusive locks. Shared locks allow multiple transactions to read the same data concurrently, while exclusive locks permit one transaction to both read and write data, blocking all other transactions from accessing it.

**Timestamping** is another effective method for concurrency control. Each transaction receives a unique timestamp upon initiation. The database utilizes these timestamps to determine the order in which transactions should access the data. If a transaction attempts to access data that has already been accessed by a newer transaction, the database will either abort the older transaction or place it in a waiting state.

**Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** is a strategy based on the assumption that conflicts between transactions are infrequent. This method allows multiple transactions to access the same data without employing locks. However, before a transaction can be committed, it must confirm that no other transaction has modified the data it accessed. If a conflict is detected during this verification, the transaction is aborted and must be restarted.

In conclusion, databases manage concurrent transactions by utilizing various concurrency control techniques. These strategies are essential for maintaining the integrity of the database and ensuring that all transactions are executed in a safe and consistent manner.
