Object-oriented database models manage data by storing and representing it as objects, which can be manipulated through methods.

In an object-oriented database model, data is organized as a collection of objects rather than in tables, as is typical in relational databases. Each object is an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint defining the properties and methods of the objects. The properties, often referred to as attributes, hold the actual data, while the methods specify the operations that can be performed on this data.

A key feature of object-oriented databases is inheritance. This allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes, establishing a hierarchy of classes. Inheritance promotes code reusability, enhances efficiency, and simplifies the management of the database model.

Another significant feature is encapsulation. This concept bundles the data (attributes) and the operations on that data (methods) within a single unit, known as an object. Encapsulation ensures data integrity by allowing access and modifications only through the object's methods, thereby preventing unauthorized access and changes.

Object-oriented databases also support polymorphism, which enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in various ways. This characteristic adds flexibility and adaptability to the database model, making it easier to accommodate changes.

Moreover, object-oriented databases excel at handling complex data and relationships more effectively than relational databases. They can store and manipulate not only simple data types, such as numbers and strings, but also complex data types, including multimedia data, time-series data, and spatial data. Additionally, they can represent intricate relationships among objects, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and even recursive relationships.

Furthermore, object-oriented databases are particularly well-suited for applications requiring high performance and scalability. They can efficiently manage large volumes of data and high transaction rates, and they can be distributed across multiple servers to enhance performance and reliability.

In summary, object-oriented database models manage data by storing and representing it as objects that can be manipulated through methods. They provide several advantages over relational databases, including code reusability, data integrity, flexibility, and the capability to handle complex data and relationships effectively.
