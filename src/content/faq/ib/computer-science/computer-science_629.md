Backpropagation in neural networks is a technique used to adjust the weights of neurons based on the error rate observed in the output.

Backpropagation, which stands for "backward propagation of errors," is an essential algorithm for training various types of neural networks, including multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks. This algorithm operates under the framework of supervised learning, meaning it learns from datasets that contain both input values and their corresponding desired outputs.

The process starts with a forward pass, where the input data is fed through the network to produce an output. This output is then compared to the desired output, and the difference between the two is computed as the error. The primary goal of backpropagation is to minimize this error.

Once the error is calculated, it is propagated backwards through the network, beginning from the final layer; this is where the term 'backpropagation' originates. The weights of the neurons are adjusted to reduce the error. This adjustment is achieved through a method known as gradient descent.

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm designed to minimize the error function. It operates by calculating the gradient of the error function with respect to the network's weights and then updating the weights in the direction that reduces the error. The magnitude of these adjustments is governed by the learning rate, a hyperparameter that dictates how quickly the network learns.

The backpropagation process is iterated over multiple epochs, which represent complete passes through the training dataset, until the network's performance reaches an acceptable level. The outcome is a trained network capable of accurately mapping inputs to outputs.

In summary, backpropagation is a fundamental component of training neural networks. It involves a forward pass to generate an output, calculating the error by comparing this output to the desired output, and subsequently adjusting the weights of the neurons to minimize this error. This cycle is repeated until the network achieves satisfactory performance.
