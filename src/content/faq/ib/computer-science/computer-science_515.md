In a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), several common data types are utilized to define the nature of data that can be stored in specific columns of a table. These data types play a pivotal role in maintaining data integrity by restricting the type of data that can be entered, ensuring that the database operates predictably and handles data appropriately. For further insights, please refer to our supplementary notes.

Here are some of the primary data types used in RDBMS:

1. **Integer**: This data type is designed to store whole numbers, which can be either positive or negative, but do not include decimal points.

2. **Float**: In contrast, the float data type is used to store real numbers, which are numbers that possess decimal points.

3. **Character (char) and Variable Character (varchar)**: Both of these data types are employed to store strings. The key distinction lies in their length:
   - The 'char' data type is used for fixed-length strings. For instance, if a column is defined as 'char(5)', it will always occupy 5 characters. Therefore, if you store the string 'abc', it will be stored as 'abc ' (with two trailing spaces).
   - Conversely, the 'varchar' data type accommodates variable-length strings. If a column is defined as 'varchar(5)', it can hold up to 5 characters but is not required to be that long. Thus, if you store 'abc', it will be stored as 'abc' (without additional spaces). Understanding these distinctions is essential for effective database design.

4. **Date and Time**: These data types are specifically designed to store temporal values:
   - The 'date' type stores values representing year, month, and day.
   - The 'time' type is used to capture hour, minute, and second values.

5. **Boolean**: The boolean data type is utilized to store true or false values. This is particularly useful for columns that need to represent binary choices, such as yes/no or true/false.

**IB Computer Science Tutor Summary**: In RDBMS, various data types including integer, float, char, varchar, date, time, and boolean are employed to define the types of data stored in a database's columns. Integers are used for whole numbers, floats for decimal numbers, chars for fixed-length strings, varchars for variable-length strings, date and time for temporal values, and boolean for true/false values.
