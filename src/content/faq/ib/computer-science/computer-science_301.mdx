A recursive function for generating the Fibonacci sequence can be constructed by having the function call itself to compute the sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with the values $0$ and $1$. Mathematically, this sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$$
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
$$

with the initial conditions (or seed values) given by:

$$
F(0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad F(1) = 1.
$$

To implement a recursive function for the Fibonacci sequence in a programming language, one must first establish the base cases. Base cases are the conditions under which the function terminates and returns a value. For the Fibonacci sequence, these base cases are:

$$
F(0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad F(1) = 1.
$$

In code, this can be represented as follows:

```python
if n == 0:
    return 0
elif n == 1:
    return 1
```

Next, you will define the recursive case for the function. The recursive case involves the function calling itself with a different argument. For the Fibonacci sequence, the recursive case corresponds to:

$$
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).
$$

In code, this can be implemented as:

```python
else:
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

Combining all these components, a complete recursive function for the Fibonacci sequence can be structured as follows:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

This function operates by calling itself repeatedly with progressively smaller values of $n$ until it reaches the base cases. At that point, it begins to return values, which are then summed together to calculate the Fibonacci number for the original input value of $n$.

Keep in mind that recursion can be a challenging concept to understand initially. However, with practice, it can become an invaluable tool in your programming toolkit.
