A common use case for dynamically allocated arrays arises when the size of the array cannot be determined at compile time.

In computer programming, there are scenarios where the size of an array is not known until the program is running. This is where dynamically allocated arrays become essential. These arrays allow programmers to define an array without specifying its size during compilation, enabling size determination at runtime. This feature is particularly valuable in situations where the data to be stored is variable and may change throughout the program's execution.

For instance, consider a program designed to store the names of students in a class. The number of students can fluctuate from one class to another and even vary across academic years. In such situations, declaring a static array with a large fixed size to accommodate the maximum possible number of students would be inefficient. Instead, utilizing a dynamically allocated array allows the program to set the array size at runtime based on the actual number of students.

Another example involves a program that reads data from a file. The size of the data may only become apparent once the file is opened and read. In this case, a dynamically allocated array can be employed to store the data, with the array size being determined according to the amount of data read from the file.

In addition to providing flexibility, dynamically allocated arrays also optimize memory usage. Since the size of the array is determined at runtime, only the necessary amount of memory is allocated. This prevents the memory wastage that can occur with static arrays.

However, it is crucial to manage dynamically allocated arrays with care. Programmers must ensure that the memory allocated for the array is properly deallocated once it is no longer needed, to avoid memory leaks. While this adds an extra layer of complexity compared to using static arrays, the advantages in terms of flexibility and efficient memory usage often outweigh this drawback.
