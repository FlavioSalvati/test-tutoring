A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node can have at most two children. These children are typically categorized as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in the tree is referred to as the root. Each node within a binary tree contains a data element along with two pointers that reference its children. If a child does not exist, the corresponding pointer is set to null. Binary trees are widely utilized in various domains of computer science, including expression parsing in programming languages, network routing algorithms, and machine learning applications.

Conversely, a binary search tree (BST) is a specialized form of a binary tree that incorporates additional constraints. While it maintains the characteristic of having a maximum of two children per node, it imposes a crucial ordering requirement: for every node, all elements in its left subtree must be less than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree must be greater. This ordering property enables binary search trees to serve as efficient data structures for numerous search and sorting operations. In a balanced binary search tree, operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching can be executed in logarithmic time, denoted as $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree.

In summary, both binary trees and binary search trees are tree data structures characterized by nodes with a maximum of two children. However, binary search trees possess an additional ordering property that dictates how the nodes are organized. This ordering facilitates efficient searching and sorting of data, rendering binary search trees a valuable tool in various areas of computer science.
