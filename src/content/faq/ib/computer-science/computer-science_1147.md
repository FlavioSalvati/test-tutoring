During a pop operation on a stack, the topmost element is removed and returned to the user.

To elaborate, a stack is a data structure that adheres to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. The pop operation is one of the core operations of a stack, alongside the push operation, which adds an element to the top of the stack.

When a pop operation is executed, the topmost element is removed. In the case of a stack implemented as an array, this involves decrementing the index that tracks the top of the stack. Conversely, if the stack is implemented as a linked list, the head node is removed, and the next node becomes the new head. In both scenarios, the element that is removed is returned by the pop operation. This dual functionality is advantageous because it allows the user to both eliminate the top element and utilize its value in a single operation.

It is crucial to recognize that attempting to perform a pop operation on an empty stack will lead to an error commonly referred to as stack underflow. This occurs because there is no element available to remove and return. To mitigate this risk, it is a best practice to check whether the stack is empty before executing a pop operation.

Regarding time complexity, the pop operation on a stack is generally considered an $O(1)$ operation. This indicates that it takes a constant amount of time to complete, regardless of the size of the stack. The reason for this constant time complexity is that the pop operation only interacts with the top element of the stack, without needing to engage with any other elements.

In summary, the pop operation is a fundamental aspect of the stack data structure. It removes and returns the topmost element while adhering to the LIFO principle. However, it is essential to exercise caution to avoid stack underflow by ensuring that the stack is not empty prior to performing a pop operation.
