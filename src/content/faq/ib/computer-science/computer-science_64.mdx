Read and write speeds can vary significantly across different types of persistent storage, including Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), and NVMe SSDs.

**Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)** are the oldest form of persistent storage and exhibit the slowest read/write speeds. This is primarily due to their mechanical components, which include a spinning disk and a moving read/write head. The performance of an HDD is largely influenced by its revolutions per minute (RPM); higher RPMs correspond to faster read/write speeds. Nevertheless, even the most rapid HDDs fall short of the performance levels achieved by SSDs and NVMe SSDs.

**Solid State Drives (SSDs)** represent a significant advancement over HDDs in terms of speed. They utilize flash memory for data storage, which facilitates much quicker data access and transfer. Unlike HDDs, SSDs have no moving parts, enabling them to read and write data almost instantaneously. The read/write speeds of SSDs can vary based on the type of flash memory employed. For instance, SSDs that utilize NAND flash memory tend to be slower than those that use Single-Level Cell (SLC) or Multi-Level Cell (MLC) flash memory.

**NVMe SSDs** are currently the fastest type of persistent storage available. NVMe, which stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express, is a protocol specifically designed to optimize the speed of SSDs. NVMe SSDs connect directly to the motherboard via the PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) interface, allowing for significantly faster data transfer compared to the SATA interface used by traditional SSDs and HDDs. Consequently, NVMe SSDs can achieve read/write speeds that are several times greater than those of standard SSDs and HDDs.

In summary, the read/write speeds of different persistent storage types vary widely. NVMe SSDs lead the pack in terms of speed, followed by standard SSDs, and then HDDs. However, it is essential to recognize that higher performance often comes with a greater price. Therefore, when selecting a type of persistent storage, it is crucial to balance your budget with your speed requirements.
