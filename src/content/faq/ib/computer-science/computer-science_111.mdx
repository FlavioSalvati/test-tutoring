Integers are represented in computer memory as binary numbers using a system known as two's complement.

In computer systems, integers are stored as sequences of binary digits, which consist of 1s and 0s. The most prevalent method for representing these integers is through two's complement, a system that accommodates both positive and negative integers. This versatility makes it an ideal choice for a wide range of computing applications.

The capacity to store an integer depends on the number of bits allocated for that integer. For instance, an 8-bit integer can represent values ranging from $-128$ to $127$, while a 16-bit integer can handle values from $-32,768$ to $32,767$. Generally, the range of representable values is calculated using the formula:

$$
[-2^{(n-1)}, 2^{(n-1)} - 1]
$$

where $n$ denotes the number of bits.

In the two's complement system, the sign of an integer is indicated by the most significant bit (MSB). If the MSB is $0$, the number is positive; if it is $1$, the number is negative. The binary representation of positive integers is straightforward. However, representing negative integers involves a slightly more complex process. To obtain the binary representation of a negative number, first, you invert the bits of its absolute value, and then you add $1$ to the inverted result.

For example, to represent $-9$ in an 8-bit two's complement format, start by representing $9$ as $00001001$. Next, invert the bits to get $11110110$. Finally, add $1$ to this result:

$$
11110110 + 00000001 = 11110111
$$

Thus, $11110111$ is the two's complement representation of $-9$.

This method of integer representation is widely adopted because it streamlines the hardware design of computers. With two's complement, the same circuitry can efficiently handle both addition and subtraction, simplifying the overall design and enhancing system performance.
