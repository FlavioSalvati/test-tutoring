The primary function of a web application firewall (WAF) is to safeguard web applications from a range of cyber threats and attacks.

A web application firewall is a specialized type of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application. It is specifically designed to protect web applications by inspecting and filtering the traffic that flows between the application and the internet. WAFs are particularly effective in defending against attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and file inclusion, all of which can lead to significant data breaches.

WAFs operate based on a set of rules, commonly referred to as policies. These policies are aimed at protecting against vulnerabilities within the application by filtering out malicious traffic. One of the key advantages of a WAF is its ability to rapidly adapt to the ever-changing threat landscape. As new threats emerge, new policies can be developed and implemented to counteract them.

In addition to providing protection from various threats, WAFs serve other important purposes. They can assist in detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which seek to render a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. WAFs also play a role in preventing zero-day exploitsâ€”attacks that target a security vulnerability on the same day that the vulnerability becomes publicly known.

Moreover, WAFs offer valuable insights into HTTP traffic, which can help identify trends and patterns in user interactions with web applications. This information is useful not only for pinpointing potential security risks but also for understanding user behavior and enhancing the overall user experience.

In summary, the primary purpose of a web application firewall is to protect web applications from various cyber threats. It accomplishes this by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic and by deploying policies that defend against specific attack types. WAFs are a vital component of any comprehensive web security strategy.
