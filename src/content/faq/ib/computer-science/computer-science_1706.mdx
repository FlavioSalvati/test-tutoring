Designers ensure systems are user-friendly by conducting user research, usability testing, and incorporating user-centred design principles.

To create a user-friendly system, designers first need to understand their users. This is achieved through user research, which involves gathering information about the users' needs, behaviours, experiences, and motivations. This can be done through various methods such as interviews, surveys, and observations. The insights gained from this research help designers to create systems that are tailored to the users' needs and preferences.

Usability testing is another crucial step in ensuring a system is user-friendly. This involves testing the system with real users to identify any usability issues. During usability testing, users are asked to complete tasks while designers observe and note any difficulties or frustrations. This feedback is then used to refine and improve the system. Usability testing can be conducted at various stages of the design process, from early prototypes to the final product.

Incorporating user-centred design principles is also key to creating a user-friendly system. User-centred design is an approach to design that grounds the process in information about the people who will use the product. User-centred design processes focus on users through the planner, design, development and deployment of a product.

Designers also ensure systems are user-friendly by making them accessible to as many users as possible. This means considering users with different abilities and disabilities when designing the system. For example, ensuring the system is usable for people with visual impairments by providing text alternatives for images, or making sure the system is navigable by keyboard for people who can't use a mouse.

Lastly, designers often use design patterns and guidelines that have been proven to work well in similar systems. These can provide a useful starting point and can help to ensure consistency, which is important for usability. However, it's important to remember that what works well in one context may not work as well in another, so these should be used as a guide rather than a strict set of rules.
