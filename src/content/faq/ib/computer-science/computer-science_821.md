Encapsulation is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming (OOP) that significantly enhances program development through modularity, data hiding, and code reusability.

At its core, encapsulation combines data and the functions that operate on that data into a single unit known as a "class." This integration safeguards both the data and the associated methods from external interference and misuse, playing a crucial role in the development process in several key ways.

Firstly, encapsulation fosters modularity. By encapsulating data along with the methods that manipulate it within a single class, we create self-contained code modules. These modules can be developed, tested, and debugged independently, which streamlines the development process. Furthermore, this modular approach enhances the clarity and maintainability of the code, as each module features a well-defined interface and a specific, limited responsibility.

Secondly, encapsulation promotes data hiding. The internal data of a class is not accessible directly from outside the class. Instead, other code must interact with the data through designated class methods. This restriction prevents accidental or malicious modifications to the data, thereby enhancing the program's security and integrity. Additionally, this abstraction allows for changes in the implementation details of a class without impacting other parts of the code that rely on it.

Finally, encapsulation encourages code reusability. Once a class is implemented and thoroughly tested, it can be reused across various parts of a program or even in different programs without the need for rewriting. This not only saves time and effort but also promotes consistency and reliability, as the same validated code is utilized in multiple contexts.

In summary, encapsulation is a powerful principle in OOP that drives program development by enabling modularity, data hiding, and code reusability. By understanding and effectively applying this concept, developers can create code that is more robust, secure, and efficient.
