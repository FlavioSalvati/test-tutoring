Linked lists provide several advantages over arrays, including dynamic sizing, efficient insertions and deletions, and optimal memory usage.

A linked list is a dynamic data structure, which means that its size can change during the program's execution. This flexibility is a significant benefit compared to arrays, which have a fixed size that must be determined at the time of declaration. If you are uncertain about the volume of data you will handle, or if the data size is likely to fluctuate significantly, a linked list is a more adaptable choice. For further details, refer to the relevant resources.

Another important advantage of linked lists is the efficiency of insertions and deletions. In an array, adding or removing an element necessitates shifting all subsequent elements, which can be computationally expensive. In contrast, linked lists allow these operations to be performed more efficiently. To insert a new element, you only need to adjust the pointers of the adjacent nodes. Similarly, to delete an element, you simply reroute the pointers around the node that is to be removed. This characteristic makes linked lists particularly advantageous in applications where insertions and deletions are frequent. Additional insights can be found in specialized literature.

Linked lists also avoid the problem of wasted memory. When using an array, overestimating the required size leads to unused space that goes to waste. Conversely, underestimating the size necessitates creating a new, larger array and copying the contents from the original array, which can be time-consuming. In contrast, a linked list allocates exactly the amount of memory needed and can easily expand or contract as required.

Furthermore, linked lists can be easily transformed into more complex data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables. This transformation is more challenging with arrays, due to their lack of the flexibility and dynamic nature inherent in linked lists. For a comprehensive exploration of data structures, see the relevant references.

In summary, linked lists are advantageous due to their ability to grow or shrink as needed, providing significant flexibility. They enable quick addition or removal of items without wasting time or space. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size and may lead to wasted space or require cumbersome copying to a larger array, linked lists adapt to your needs, conserving both memory and effort.
