Distributed systems encounter several challenges, including network latency, clock skew, the necessity for consensus, and data consistency.

In a distributed system, multiple computers or servers collaborate to accomplish tasks, often over a network. This architecture introduces various synchronization challenges. One prominent issue is network latency, which refers to the delay that occurs when a signal travels from one location to another. This latency can arise from several factors, such as the physical distance between the communicating parties and the speed of the network. High latency can result in delays in data transmission, disrupting the synchronization of the system.

Another significant challenge is clock skew. Each computer or server in a distributed system operates with its own internal clock. However, these clocks may not be perfectly synchronized, leading to a situation known as clock skew. This discrepancy can create difficulties when coordinating tasks across multiple machines. For instance, if one machine's clock is ahead of another's, it might initiate a task before the other machine is prepared, resulting in inconsistencies and errors within the system.

The need for consensus presents another critical challenge in distributed systems. Consensus algorithms are utilized to ensure that all machines in the system agree on a single data value. Nevertheless, achieving consensus can be particularly challenging in large systems or under conditions where network communication is unreliable. If consensus cannot be reached, the system may fail to operate correctly.

Moreover, the issue of data consistency adds to the challenges faced by distributed systems. In such systems, the same data may be replicated across multiple machines. When one machine updates a piece of data, it is essential that all other machines receive the same update. However, due to network latency and other factors, these updates may not occur simultaneously, potentially leading to data inconsistencies that can disrupt system functionality.

In summary, synchronization in distributed systems is a complex issue that encompasses challenges such as network latency, clock skew, the necessity for consensus, and data consistency. Addressing these challenges requires meticulous management and the implementation of advanced algorithms to ensure the system operates effectively.
