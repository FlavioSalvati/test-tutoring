To identify the ancestors of a node in a tree, you traverse from that node upward to the root.

More specifically, an ancestor of a node in a tree is any node that lies along the path from that node to the root. This includes the node's parent, the grandparent, and so on, continuing up to the root itself. Notably, the root is considered an ancestor to all nodes within the tree.

To determine the ancestors of a given node, you begin at the node and follow the links to its parent, then to the grandparent, and continue this process until you arrive at the root. This method of moving through the tree is referred to as traversal. In a binary tree, each node has at most one parent, ensuring that the path from any node to the root is unique. The same principle holds for trees where nodes can have more than two children, known as n-ary trees; each node still has exactly one parent, which guarantees a unique path to the root.

The task of finding a node's ancestors can be implemented using either a simple loop or a recursive function. When using a loop, you start at the node and repeatedly move to the parent until you reach the root. Alternatively, if you opt for recursion, you define a function that takes a node as input, adds that node to a list of ancestors, and then calls itself with the parent node as the new input. The recursion's base case occurs when the input node is the root of the tree.

From a computational perspective, the time complexity of finding a node's ancestors is $O(h)$, where $h$ represents the height of the tree (i.e., the maximum number of edges from the root to any leaf node). This complexity arises because, in the worst-case scenario, you may need to traverse from a leaf node all the way to the root. The space complexity is also $O(h)$, as you may need to store up to $h$ nodes in the list of ancestors during this traversal process.
