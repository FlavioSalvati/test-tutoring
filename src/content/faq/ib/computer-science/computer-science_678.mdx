Distributed computing in web technology refers to a system where multiple computers collaborate to solve computational problems effectively.

This model entails sharing components of a software system across several computers to enhance both efficiency and performance. In the realm of web technology, distributed computing utilizes multiple servers or computers, often situated in various geographical locations, to host and run applications, manage data, and deliver services over the internet.

The primary objective of distributed computing is to pool resources and capabilities, thereby providing users with a singular and cohesive network experience. This is accomplished by breaking down a program into smaller, manageable parts, which can be processed concurrently by different computers. The outcomes are then aggregated to address the overall problem. Such an approach can significantly decrease the time required to process large datasets or perform complex calculations.

Distributed computing systems can be classified into three main types: client-server systems, peer-to-peer systems, and cloud computing. In a client-server architecture, one or more computers—known as servers—offer services to other computers, referred to as clients. In contrast, a peer-to-peer system allows all computers within the network to share resources equally and communicate directly with one another. Cloud computing represents a subset of distributed computing that provides computing resources over the internet as a service.

In the context of web technology, distributed computing is instrumental in managing high traffic loads, providing redundancy and failover capabilities, and ensuring data integrity and security. For instance, a popular website may leverage distributed computing to distribute its traffic across multiple servers, thereby preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck and ensuring continuous availability, even if one server fails.

Moreover, distributed computing facilitates the development of global web services. A company, for example, might utilize distributed computing to host its website on servers located in various countries. This strategy ensures that users can access the website quickly and reliably, regardless of their geographical location.

In summary, distributed computing in web technology serves as a powerful mechanism for enhancing performance, reliability, and scalability. It empowers web services to manage substantial volumes of data and traffic, deliver services on a global scale, and maintain high availability and reliability.
