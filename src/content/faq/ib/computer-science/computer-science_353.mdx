The height of a binary tree is defined as the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.

More precisely, the height of a binary tree measures the maximum number of edges along the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. This can also be interpreted as the maximum level of any leaf node in the tree. Alternatively, the height can be viewed as the depth of the tree's deepest node.

In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The root node, located at the top of the tree, serves as the starting point, while the leaf nodes are those that do not have any children. The height of a binary tree is a critical factor in algorithm analysis, as it can significantly influence the time complexity of operations such as search, insertion, and deletion.

It is important to remember that an empty tree (one with no nodes) is assigned a height of $-1$, and a tree that contains only a single node (the root) has a height of $0$. This distinction arises from the fact that the height is defined in terms of the number of edges along the longest path, rather than the total number of nodes.

To calculate the height of a binary tree, you can employ a recursive algorithm. Starting from the root node, you traverse down each subtree, incrementing a counter for each edge you cross. Upon reaching a leaf node, you return the counter. The height of the tree is then determined by taking the maximum value returned from the left and right subtrees.

Grasping the concept of tree height is essential for comprehending more complex data structures and algorithms, such as AVL trees and B-trees. These structures play a vital role in various domains within computer science, including database systems and file systems.
