Search engines index web pages by utilizing web crawlers, which are automated software programs designed to discover, analyze, and archive information from websites.

Web crawlers, commonly referred to as spiders or bots, systematically traverse the internet to collect data from various sites. This process, known as web crawling or spidering, allows crawlers to gather information that is subsequently organized into an index. This index functions as a comprehensive catalog of all web pages and their associated content available online.

A web crawler begins its journey with a list of initial URLs, known as seeds. As it visits each URL, the crawler identifies and extracts all hyperlinks present on the page, adding them to its queue of URLs to explore. This iterative process enables the crawler to navigate from one page to another through these hyperlinks. Additionally, the crawler revisits websites periodically to check for any changes or updates to their content.

Upon visiting a page, the web crawler scans the content while paying close attention to essential elements such as the page title, keywords, and hyperlinks. It also analyzes the HTML code to grasp the site's structure. This information is then utilized to create a detailed map of the site, which is stored within the search engine's index.

The index itself is an extensive database where all information collected by the web crawlers is stored. When a user conducts a search, the search engine does not scan the entire internet; rather, it refers to its index to locate relevant pages. The search engine employs sophisticated algorithms to assess each page's relevance to the user's query, considering factors such as the placement of keywords, the quantity of inbound and outbound links, and the overall authority of the page.

Beyond indexing, search engines also rank web pages based on their relevance and quality. This ranking process, known as search engine optimization (SEO), entails evaluating various factors, including keyword usage, content quality, and the number of links directed to a page. SEO is vital for websites, as it significantly influences their visibility in search engine results, ultimately impacting the volume of traffic they receive.
