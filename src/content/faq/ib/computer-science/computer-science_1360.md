The network database model effectively manages relationships by allowing for multiple parent and child record types, creating a complex network structure.

In this model, relationships are facilitated through a system of pointers that connect various data elements. This approach offers flexibility in representing objects and their interrelations. Unlike the hierarchical model, which restricts each child to a single parent, the network model permits each child to have multiple parents, thereby establishing a more intricate web of relationships.

Data within the network model is organized into records, while relationships are represented as sets. A set consists of an owner record type, a set name, and a member record type. Each set delineates a one-to-many relationship between the owner and the member. Notably, the owner record type can serve as a member or owner in multiple sets, and similarly, the member record type can function as either an owner or a member across various sets. This structure allows for the modeling and management of complex relationships effectively.

The relationships in a network database model are physically implemented through pointers, which are essentially memory addresses that link one record to another. For instance, a record representing a student may contain a pointer to the record of the course in which the student is enrolled. This pointer-based mechanism enables efficient traversal of relationships within the database.

However, managing these pointers can introduce complexity. Operations such as adding, deleting, or updating records necessitate corresponding updates to the relevant pointers, which can be a time-consuming task. Moreover, the network model demands a sophisticated database management system capable of handling the intricacies associated with the pointer structure.

In summary, the network database model adeptly manages relationships by allowing multiple parent and child record types, resulting in a complex network structure. This model utilizes pointers to physically implement relationships, facilitating efficient database traversal. Nevertheless, the management of these pointers can be intricate and requires an advanced database management system.
