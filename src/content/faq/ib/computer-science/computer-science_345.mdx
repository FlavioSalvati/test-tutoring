A queue can be effectively implemented using a linked list by adding elements at the end and removing them from the beginning.

To elaborate, a queue is a data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. In contrast, a linked list is a linear data structure where each element, known as a node, is a distinct object that contains a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

To implement a queue using a linked list, we must maintain two pointers: one pointing to the head of the list and the other pointing to the tail. The head pointer refers to the first element in the queue, while the tail pointer refers to the last element. When a new element is added (a process known as enqueuing), it is appended to the end of the list, and we update the tail pointer to point to this new element. Conversely, when an element is removed (a process known as dequeuing), it is taken from the head of the list, and we update the head pointer to point to the next element.

Below is a simple implementation of this concept in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def enqueue(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.tail is None:  # Queue is empty
            self.head = self.tail = new_node
            return
        self.tail.next = new_node  # Link the new node to the end of the queue
        self.tail = new_node  # Update the tail pointer

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.head is None:  # Queue is empty
            return
        temp = self.head  # Temporarily store the head
        self.head = temp.next  # Move the head pointer to the next node
        if self.head is None:  # If the queue is now empty, update the tail
            self.tail = None
        return str(temp.data)  # Return the data of the dequeued node
```

In this implementation, the `Node` class represents an individual element in the linked list. Each node has a `data` attribute that holds the value of the element and a `next` attribute that points to the subsequent node. The `Queue` class represents the queue itself, containing `head` and `tail` attributes to manage pointers to the first and last elements of the queue, along with `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods to facilitate adding and removing elements, respectively.
