In recursion, problems are addressed by breaking them down into smaller, simpler instances of the same problem, continuing this process until a solution can be easily determined. This approach involves two essential components: the base case and the recursive case.

The **base case** represents the simplest form of the problem that can be resolved directly. It serves as the stopping condition for the recursion. For instance, when calculating the factorial of a number, the base case occurs when the number is either $0$ or $1$, since both $0!$ and $1!$ equal $1$. Without a defined base case, a recursive function may enter an infinite loop, ultimately resulting in a stack overflow error.

Conversely, the **recursive case** is the portion of the function where it calls itself, breaking the problem down into a simpler version. This is where the actual recursion happens. For example, in the factorial function, the recursive case involves multiplying the number by the factorial of the number minus one, expressed mathematically as:

$$
n! = n \times (n - 1)!
$$

This process reduces the problem's complexity, gradually steering it toward the base case.

Grasping the distinction between the base case and the recursive case is vital for implementing recursion successfully. The base case provides a necessary endpoint, preventing infinite recursion, while the recursive case ensures that the problem continues to simplify until it can be resolved by the base case. Recursion is a powerful technique capable of solving complex problems with elegant and efficient solutions. However, it demands careful consideration to accurately define both the base and recursive cases.
