Operating systems play a crucial role in managing hardware and software resources on a computer, and a fundamental aspect of their design is to ensure equitable resource distribution among users. This is accomplished through effective process scheduling and resource allocation mechanisms.

**Process Scheduling**

Process scheduling refers to how an operating system determines which processes are granted access to the system's resources at any given moment. This decision-making is typically governed by a scheduling algorithm, which may consider various factors, such as priority, job size, or the time of submission. The primary objective of the scheduling algorithm is to provide all processes with a fair share of resources while simultaneously maximizing the overall efficiency of the system.

One widely used scheduling algorithm is the Round Robin algorithm. This method assigns a fixed time slice, denoted as $t$, to each process. Once a process has exhausted its allocated time slice, it is moved to the end of the queue, and the next process is granted access to the system's resources. This ensures that no single process can monopolize the resources, allowing all processes an equal opportunity to execute.

**Resource Allocation**

In addition to process scheduling, resource allocation is another vital mechanism that operating systems employ to maintain fairness. This process involves determining how the system's resources—such as CPU time, memory, and disk space—are distributed among various processes. Resource allocation is typically managed through an algorithm that takes into account factors like process priority, the resources required by each process, and the availability of those resources.

For example, an operating system might implement a resource allocation algorithm that prioritizes processes needing fewer resources or those that have been waiting the longest for access. This strategy helps mitigate resource starvation, a situation where a process is unable to proceed because it is consistently denied the necessary resources.

**Conclusion**

In summary, operating systems leverage a combination of process scheduling and resource allocation mechanisms to ensure that all users receive a fair share of system resources. These mechanisms are carefully designed to enhance the system's overall efficiency while preventing any single user or process from dominating the available resources.
