Graphic design applications typically share several essential features, including layering, typography tools, color palettes, image editing capabilities, and vector graphics functionalities.

These software tools empower users to create, edit, and manipulate visual content effectively. One of the most prevalent features is the ability to utilize layers. This functionality allows users to isolate different elements of a design onto separate layers, enabling independent editing of each layer. This is particularly beneficial for intricate designs that involve multiple components, as it simplifies the management and manipulation of these elements.

Another important feature is the inclusion of typography tools. These tools enable users to add, edit, and manipulate text within their designs. They usually offer a wide selection of fonts and allow adjustments to attributes such as size, color, and spacing. Many applications also provide advanced typography options, including kerning, leading, and tracking adjustments, which enhance the overall typographic quality of the design.

Color palettes are also a common feature in graphic design applications. They facilitate the selection, mixing, and matching of colors for use in designs. Users often have access to a variety of pre-set colors and the capability to create custom colors. Additionally, some applications offer tools for managing and organizing color palettes, which is particularly useful for ensuring consistency across multiple designs.

Image editing is a fundamental component of many graphic design applications. This encompasses basic editing functions, such as cropping, resizing, and rotating images, as well as more advanced features like filters, effects, and retouching tools. These capabilities allow users to modify and enhance images to meet their design requirements effectively.

Finally, many graphic design applications offer robust support for vector graphics. Unlike raster graphics, which are composed of pixels, vector graphics are defined by mathematical equations. This characteristic allows vector graphics to be scaled up or down without any loss of quality, making them ideal for logo design and other applications where scalability is crucial. Vector graphics tools typically include features for creating and editing shapes, lines, and curves, as well as functionalities for combining and manipulating these elements to produce complex designs.
