To illustrate a doubly linked list with a tail pointer, you should draw nodes that are connected by arrows in both directions, along with a distinct tail pointer pointing to the last node.

A doubly linked list is a specialized data structure where each node comprises two pointers and a data element. The first pointer directs to the previous node in the sequence, while the second pointer leads to the next node. The tail pointer is a unique feature of a doubly linked list; it consistently points to the last node in the list.

To create a sketch of this structure, begin by drawing a series of rectangles arranged in a horizontal line, each representing a node. Each rectangle should be divided into three sections: the left section for the pointer to the previous node, the middle section for the data itself, and the right section for the pointer to the next node.

Next, draw an arrow from the 'next' section of the first node to the 'previous' section of the second node, and conversely, from the 'previous' section of the second node back to the 'next' section of the first node. Repeat this linkage process for each pair of consecutive nodes in the list, thereby illustrating the bidirectional connections that define a doubly linked list.

The tail pointer is indicated by a separate arrow originating from a point labeled 'tail', which should point directly to the last node in the list. This tail pointer is particularly beneficial for operations requiring quick access to the end of the list, such as appending new elements.

It is important to note that the first node, often referred to as the head node, will have its 'previous' pointer set to null, signifying that it is the beginning of the list. Conversely, the last node, known as the tail node, will have its 'next' pointer set to null, indicating that it is the end of the list.

In summary, a sketch of a doubly linked list with a tail pointer should clearly depict a sequence of nodes, each interconnected in both directions, along with a distinct tail pointer that designates the last node of the list.
