An algorithm may necessitate the use of a dynamic data structure to effectively manage varying quantities of data or to perform complex operations efficiently.

In the field of computer science, data structures are essential for organizing and storing data in a manner that facilitates efficient access and modification. Dynamic data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and graphs, are particularly advantageous because they can adjust their size during the execution of a program. This adaptability allows for the management of fluctuating amounts of data, in contrast to static data structures, like arrays, which have a predetermined size that must be specified at the time of their creation.

Dynamic data structures are also advantageous for algorithms that must execute complex operations. For instance, a binary search tree can be employed to search for a specific value within a dataset efficiently. The tree structure enables the algorithm to eliminate half of the remaining data with each comparison, leading to a logarithmic time complexity of $O(\log n)$. Similarly, graphs can represent relationships among different entities, allowing algorithms to perform operations such as finding the shortest path between two nodes.

Moreover, dynamic data structures can optimize memory usage. Since they can grow and shrink as needed, they utilize only as much memory as is required for the current dataset. This feature is particularly beneficial in scenarios where memory is limited, such as in embedded systems or mobile devices.

In summary, dynamic data structures provide flexibility, efficiency, and optimized memory usage, making them invaluable tools for a wide range of algorithms. The necessity for a dynamic data structure in an algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the task, including the characteristics of the data, the operations to be performed, and the resources available.
