WPA2 is an enhanced version of WPA, offering improved security features and stronger encryption methods.

Wireless Protected Access (WPA) and its successor, Wireless Protected Access II (WPA2), are security protocols developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to protect wireless computer networks. WPA was introduced in $2003$ as a temporary solution to address the security vulnerabilities inherent in WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). Despite its improvements, WPA still had weaknesses, which led to the creation of WPA2, launched in $2004$.

WPA employs the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption. TKIP was designed to provide more secure encryption compared to WEP; however, it was only a stopgap measure. Since TKIP was built on the existing WEP framework, it allowed for easier upgrades of existing hardware, but it also inherited some of WEP's vulnerabilities.

In contrast, WPA2 utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption, which is a significantly more secure method. AES is a robust encryption standard employed by the U.S. government to protect classified information, making it an excellent choice for wireless encryption. Additionally, WPA2 introduced the Robust Secure Network (RSN) feature, which continuously validates the security of the wireless connection, thereby enhancing overall security.

A notable distinction between WPA and WPA2 is the introduction of a new authentication method in WPA2 called the Pre-Shared Key (PSK). This method requires a password for connecting to the wireless network, which is then used to generate a unique encryption key for each client. This approach significantly complicates unauthorized access, making it more challenging for intruders to infiltrate the network.

In summary, while both WPA and WPA2 provide security for wireless networks, WPA2 delivers a higher level of protection through stronger encryption and more sophisticated features. It is essential to recognize that as technology evolves, so do the tactics employed by hackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is always advisable to utilize the most current security protocol available.
