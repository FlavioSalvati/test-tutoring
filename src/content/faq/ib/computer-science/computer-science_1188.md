Leaf nodes in a tree are defined as those nodes that do not have any children.

In a tree data structure, each element is referred to as a node. The topmost node is known as the root. If the root connects to other nodes, those nodes are termed its children. Nodes that lack children are classified as leaf nodes or external nodes, whereas nodes that possess at least one child are referred to as internal nodes.

To identify the leaf nodes within a tree, one must traverse the tree. Tree traversal is the method of visiting each node in the tree precisely once in a systematic manner. There are several traversal techniques available, including depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). DFS investigates as deeply as possible down each branch before backtracking, while BFS examines all neighbors at the current depth level prior to advancing to nodes at the subsequent depth level.

During the traversal, each node is evaluated to determine whether it has any children. A node is classified as a leaf node if it has no children. In the context of a binary tree, a node is deemed a leaf if both its left and right children are null. In a more general tree structure, a node is considered a leaf if its list of children is empty.

For instance, consider a binary tree with nodes labeled from $1$ to $7$, where $1$ serves as the root, $2$ and $3$ are its children, $4$ and $5$ are children of $2$, and $6$ and $7$ are children of $3$. In this configuration, the leaf nodes are $4$, $5$, $6$, and $7$, as these nodes do not have any children.

In summary, identifying the leaf nodes in a tree requires traversing the structure and checking each node for children. A node is classified as a leaf node if it does not have any children.
