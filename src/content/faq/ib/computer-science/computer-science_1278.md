Distributed systems play a crucial role in a variety of real-world applications, including online banking, social networking, and cloud computing.

One of the most prominent examples of a distributed system is online banking. In this scenario, a bank's servers are distributed across multiple locations, each responsible for specific functions such as transaction processing, customer service, and security. This division of tasks enables the system to manage a high volume of transactions concurrently while minimizing delays. Additionally, it improves the system's reliability and fault tolerance; if one server fails, the overall system remains unaffected.

Social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, also leverage distributed systems to manage extensive data and serve millions of users globally. To handle this demand, these platforms distribute both data and processing tasks across numerous servers located in different regions. This architecture not only accommodates high traffic levels but also ensures continuous service availability, even in the event of a server or data center outage. For more details on the types of networks involved, you can explore additional resources.

Cloud computing services, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, represent another significant application of distributed systems. These services enable businesses to store and process data on remote servers instead of relying on local machines or data centers. By distributing data and processing tasks across multiple servers, often situated in various geographical locations, cloud computing provides businesses with scalable, reliable, and cost-effective computing resources. To gain a deeper understanding of the distinctions between centralized and distributed systems, you may refer to further reading materials.
