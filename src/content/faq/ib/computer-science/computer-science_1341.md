Common database recovery methods include backup and restoration, transaction logging, shadow paging, and checkpointing.

**Backup and Restoration**  
Backup and restoration is a straightforward approach to database recovery. Regular backups are created for the entire database or specific portions of it. In the event of a failure, the most recent backup can be restored, allowing the system to resume operations. While this method is simple and effective, it can be time-consuming, especially for large databases. Additionally, adequate storage space is necessary to accommodate the backups.

**Transaction Logging**  
Transaction logging is another prevalent recovery method. In this approach, every modification made to the database is recorded in a log file. If a failure occurs, this log can be utilized to either "undo" or "redo" transactions, thereby recovering the database to a consistent state. This method is generally efficient and requires less storage space compared to full backups. However, it can be complex to implement and maintain.

**Shadow Paging**  
Shadow paging is a technique in which changes are not immediately applied to the main database. Instead, they are recorded on a 'shadow' copy of the database page. If a transaction completes successfully, the shadow page is promoted to the main page. Conversely, if a failure occurs during the transaction, the original page remains unchanged, allowing for easy recovery. This method is efficient and offers a high level of data integrity, but it can be complex to implement and may require additional storage space.

**Checkpointing**  
Checkpointing is a technique that complements transaction logging. At regular intervals, a 'checkpoint' is created, ensuring that all transactions up to that point are safely written to the database. In the event of a failure, only the transactions that occurred after the last checkpoint need to be addressed during recovery. This approach simplifies the recovery process and reduces the time required. However, it necessitates careful management to balance the frequency of checkpoints with overall system performance.

Each of these methods has distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the selection of a recovery method depends on the specific needs of the database system. In practice, a combination of these methods is often employed to achieve robust and efficient recovery.
