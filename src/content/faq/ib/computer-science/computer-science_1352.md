Integrated databases effectively manage data redundancy by implementing data normalization and utilizing unique identifiers for each data entry.

Data redundancy is a prevalent issue in database management, and integrated databases address this challenge through a process known as data normalization. Normalization is a systematic method that decomposes tables to eliminate redundancy and undesirable characteristics, such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. This multi-step process organizes data into a tabular format by removing duplicated entries from relational tables.

Normalization involves partitioning a database into two or more tables and establishing relationships between these tables. The primary goal of normalization is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications can occur in a single table and subsequently be reflected throughout the rest of the database via the defined relationships. This approach safeguards the database against insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.

In addition to normalization, integrated databases manage data redundancy by employing unique identifiers for each data entry. These unique identifiers, commonly known as primary keys, ensure that each record within the database is distinct and can be individually identified. This mechanism prevents the creation of duplicate entries and helps maintain the integrity of the data stored in the database.

Moreover, integrated databases may implement referential integrity constraints to further combat data redundancy. Referential integrity ensures that all references within the data are valid. Specifically, it requires that any value in a foreign key column must always point to an existing row in another table. If a piece of data is referenced from one table, the referenced data must exist, thereby preventing redundancy and preserving the integrity of relationships between tables in the database.

In summary, integrated databases address data redundancy through a combination of data normalization, the use of unique identifiers, and the enforcement of referential integrity constraints. These techniques collectively ensure that the data within the database remains accurate, consistent, and reliable.
