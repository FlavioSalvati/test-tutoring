Static data structures are limited in their ability to manage memory overflow, as they possess a fixed size that cannot be exceeded.

Static data structures, such as arrays in many programming languages, are allocated a predetermined amount of memory at the time of their creation. This size is defined during compile time and remains constant throughout the program's execution. Consequently, if a program attempts to store more data than the allocated capacity of the structure, it will result in a memory overflow.

Memory overflow is a critical issue that can lead to unpredictable behavior, including program crashes, data corruption, and security vulnerabilities. When a static data structure overflows, it may overwrite adjacent memory locations that are utilized by other components of the program. This can result in incorrect behavior in those components or even cause the entire program to crash.

In languages like C and C++, the programmer is responsible for ensuring that they do not exceed the bounds of the array. This introduces the potential for bugs if the programmer neglects to perform these checks or miscalculates the size of the array. In contrast, languages such as Java and Python automatically enforce array bounds checking and will throw an exception if an attempt is made to exceed them. While this mechanism helps prevent memory overflow, it also requires the programmer to handle the exceptions that may arise.

Static data structures are inherently unsuitable for managing memory overflow. When a program needs to store an uncertain amount of data, or a quantity that may surpass the capacity of a static data structure, it should opt for a dynamic data structure instead. Dynamic data structures, such as linked lists, can expand and contract during program execution, making them capable of accommodating larger volumes of data.

In summary, static data structures are not designed to cope with memory overflow due to their fixed size. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the limits of these structures are respected and to employ dynamic data structures when necessary.
