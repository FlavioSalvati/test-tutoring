Guided and unguided transmission media serve distinct roles in data transmission, utilizing different methods to transfer information.

**Guided Transmission Media**  
Guided transmission media, also referred to as bounded media, utilize physical conduits to direct the flow of signals. This category includes various types of cables, such as twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, and fiber-optic cables. By guiding data signals along a specific path, these media ensure reliable transmission. They are predominantly employed in telecommunications and computer networks where a direct wired connection is essential. Guided media typically provide high-speed and high-capacity transmission while exhibiting reduced susceptibility to interference. However, their effectiveness is constrained by the physical characteristics of the medium, including the length and routing of the cables.

**Unguided Transmission Media**  
In contrast, unguided transmission media—also known as unbounded media—do not rely on physical paths for data transmission. Instead, they transmit data using waves or signals that propagate through the air, allowing reception by any device equipped to capture the signal. Common examples include radio waves, microwaves, and infrared signals. Unguided media are predominantly utilized in wireless communication systems, including mobile phones, Wi-Fi networks, and satellite communications. The primary advantages of unguided media are their mobility and flexibility, as they do not necessitate a physical connection. Nevertheless, they are more prone to interference and typically offer lower transmission speeds and capacities compared to guided media.

In summary, guided transmission media, characterized by physical cables like twisted pairs, coaxial, or fiber-optic, facilitate direct, high-speed data transmission with minimal interference but are limited by their inherent physical properties. Unguided transmission media, on the other hand, leverage signals such as radio waves for flexible and mobile communication, albeit with greater susceptibility to interference and comparatively lower speeds. The choice between guided and unguided media depends on specific requirements for mobility, speed, and reliability.
