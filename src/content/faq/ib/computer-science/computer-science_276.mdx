Yes, all iterative algorithms can be transformed into recursive ones, and vice versa.

Iterative and recursive algorithms represent two distinct approaches to solving problems in computer science. An iterative algorithm employs loops to execute a sequence of code repeatedly, whereas a recursive algorithm addresses a problem by decomposing it into smaller subproblems of the same nature. It solves these subproblems and then combines their solutions to tackle the original problem.

Theoretically, any problem that can be solved using an iterative approach can also be addressed recursively. This equivalence arises from the underlying concept of repetition present in both methods. In an iterative algorithm, repetition is achieved through loops, while in a recursive algorithm, it is accomplished by having a function invoke itself.

To convert an iterative algorithm into a recursive one, you need to identify two key components: the base case (the simplest instance of the problem that can be solved directly) and the recursive case (how to reduce the problem to a simpler version of itself). The iterative loop would then be replaced by a recursive function call.

For instance, consider the task of calculating the factorial of a number, denoted as $n!$. The iterative solution would involve a loop that multiplies the integers from $1$ to $n$. In contrast, the recursive solution defines the factorial of a number as follows:

$$
n! = n \times (n - 1)!
$$

with the base case being that $1! = 1$.

While it is theoretically possible to convert any iterative algorithm into a recursive format, doing so may not always be practical or efficient. Recursive algorithms can be more complex to understand and debug compared to their iterative counterparts. Additionally, they may consume more memory and processing power, as each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack. Therefore, while it is essential to grasp both iterative and recursive algorithms, it is equally important to select the most suitable approach for each specific problem.
