Dynamic web pages are generated in real-time and can adapt based on user interactions, distinguishing them from static web pages.

To elaborate, static web pages are pre-coded with fixed content that remains unchanged for every user and every visit. Typically written in HTML and CSS, static pages deliver the same response to every request made to the server. Consequently, the content of a static web page does not alter unless a developer manually updates the underlying code. While static web pages are simpler and quicker to develop, requiring fewer server resources, they provide a less personalized user experience and lack interactivity.

In contrast, dynamic web pages are created on-the-fly in response to user interactions or updates in data. These pages employ server-side scripting languages such as PHP, ASP.NET, or JSP, in conjunction with HTML and CSS. When a user requests a dynamic page, the server executes the script to generate and deliver a unique page tailored to that user. This capability facilitates a more interactive and personalized user experience. For instance, a dynamic web page may present different content based on the user's geographical location, the time of day, or the user's previous interactions with the page.

Although dynamic web pages are more complex to develop and demand greater server resources compared to static pages, they provide a more engaging user experience. They are crucial for web applications, e-commerce sites, social media platforms, and any website that necessitates user interaction or real-time updates.

In summary, the primary distinction between static and dynamic web pages lies in their generation process. Static pages are pre-coded and identical for every user, while dynamic pages are generated in real-time, adapting to user interactions and data changes.
