Operating systems provide built-in tools that monitor and report on resource usage, helping users and administrators understand system performance metrics.

Operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS come equipped with various tools that deliver detailed insights into resource utilization. These tools track and display metrics related to the performance of the CPU, memory, disk usage, network activity, and other hardware components. By providing real-time data, they enable users to assess their systems' performance and resource allocation effectively.

In Windows, the primary tool for monitoring resource usage is the Task Manager. This tool offers information about running processes, including the percentage of CPU and memory each process is consuming, along with overall system performance. The Performance tab provides a graphical representation of CPU, memory, disk, and network usage over time. Additionally, the Resource Monitor offers more granular details regarding resource consumption by individual processes.

Linux users have access to several command-line tools for monitoring resource usage. The command `top` delivers a real-time, dynamic overview of processes running on the system, along with their respective CPU and memory usage. The command `vmstat` reports on virtual memory statistics, while `iostat` offers insights into CPU usage and I/O statistics for storage devices. The command `free` provides information about the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system.

For macOS users, the built-in utility known as Activity Monitor serves to report on resource usage. This tool presents a comprehensive overview of system resource consumption, including CPU usage, memory usage, energy usage, disk activity, and network activity. It also lists all processes running on the system, detailing the resources each one is utilizing.

These monitoring tools are indispensable for system administrators and developers, allowing them to effectively oversee and manage system resources. They play a crucial role in identifying processes that consume excessive resources, detecting potential bottlenecks, and troubleshooting performance issues. Mastering the interpretation of these reports is an essential skill for managing and optimizing computer systems.
