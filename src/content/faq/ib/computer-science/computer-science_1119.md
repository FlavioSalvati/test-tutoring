When passing a two-dimensional array to a function, the way you specify the array's size depends on the programming language you are using.

In C++, when you pass a two-dimensional array to a function, it is necessary to specify the size of the array in the function's parameter list. This requirement arises because the compiler needs to know the dimensions of the array to accurately interpret its memory layout. While the size of the first dimension can be omitted, the size of the second dimension must be explicitly provided. For instance, if you have a 2D array of integers with $5$ rows and $10$ columns, you would declare the function as follows:

$$
\text{void myFunction(int myArray[][10])}
$$

In contrast, Java does not require you to specify the size of the array when passing it to a function. Instead, you simply declare that the function accepts a two-dimensional array as a parameter. For example, if you have a 2D array of integers, you would define the function like this:

$$
\text{void myFunction(int[][] myArray)}
$$

Similarly, in Python, you can pass a two-dimensional array (or a list of lists) to a function just like any other variable. Python does not necessitate the specification of the array's size. For instance, if you have a 2D list of integers, you can declare the function as follows:

$$
\text{def myFunction(myArray):}
$$

This flexibility makes Python particularly user-friendly for handling arrays of varying dimensions.
