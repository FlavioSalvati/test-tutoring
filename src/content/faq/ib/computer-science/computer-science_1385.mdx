The relational model sets itself apart from other database models by organizing and structuring data into tables.

Developed by E.F. Codd in 1970, the relational model is a database framework that structures data into one or more tables (also referred to as "relations"), which consist of rows and columns. Each row is uniquely identified by a key. Furthermore, rows in one table can be linked to rows in another table by including a column that contains the unique key of the related row. This approach contrasts with other database models, such as the hierarchical model and the network model, which organize data into tree-like and graph structures, respectively.

A fundamental characteristic of the relational model is its foundation in mathematical set theory. This foundation facilitates a high degree of data independence, meaning that changes in the physical storage of data do not impact the logical representation of that data. This is a significant advantage over other models, where modifications to physical storage often require corresponding changes to the logical view.

Another defining aspect of the relational model is its support for declarative queries, most prominently through SQL (Structured Query Language). This empowers users to specify the data they wish to retrieve without detailing the process for obtaining it. In contrast, many other models necessitate procedural queries, where users must outline the steps to retrieve the data.

Additionally, the relational model promotes data integrity through the implementation of constraints. Constraints are rules that the data must adhere to, enabling the enforcement of business regulations and preventing the entry of invalid data. This feature is typically less robust in other database models.

Moreover, the relational model is noted for its scalability and efficiency. It can effectively manage substantial volumes of data and handle complex queries, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. This capability stands in contrast to other models that may face challenges when dealing with extensive datasets or intricate queries.

In summary, the relational model distinguishes itself from other database models through its use of tables, its foundation in set theory, its support for declarative queries, its emphasis on data integrity, and its remarkable scalability and efficiency.
