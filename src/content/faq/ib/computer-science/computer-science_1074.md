Effective strategies for debugging during algorithm development include systematic testing, code reviews, and the use of debugging tools.

**Systematic Testing**  
Systematic testing is a vital approach for debugging algorithms. This method involves creating a thorough set of test cases that encompass all potential scenarios your algorithm should accommodate. It is essential to include edge cases—such as the smallest and largest possible inputs—as well as representative typical cases. By executing these tests, you can pinpoint any segments of your algorithm that do not function as intended. Additionally, utilizing automated testing tools can expedite the testing process, allowing you to run tests quickly and repeatedly, which facilitates the identification and rectification of bugs.

**Code Review**  
Another effective strategy is code review. This process entails having one or more individuals examine your algorithm to detect any possible issues. Such reviews can be particularly beneficial as they offer a fresh perspective on your work. The reviewer may uncover errors or inefficiencies that you might have missed and could also propose alternative methods to enhance your algorithm. Code reviews can be conducted informally with a colleague or classmate, or formally as part of a structured review process.

**Using Debugging Tools**  
Employing debugging tools is also a critical strategy. Most programming environments come equipped with tools designed to help you identify and resolve bugs within your algorithm. These tools can display the state of your program at various points during execution, enabling you to see exactly what transpires as your algorithm runs. This visibility can assist you in identifying any unexpected behavior and understanding its underlying cause. For instance, you might utilize a debugger to step through your algorithm line by line, observing the values of variables and the flow of control. Additionally, there are tools available that can detect common errors, such as memory leaks or buffer overflows.

**A Methodical Approach**  
Beyond these strategies, it is crucial to adopt a methodical approach to debugging. When you encounter a bug, take the time to comprehend precisely what is happening before making any modifications. This process may involve reproducing the bug, analyzing the output, and tracing the execution flow of your algorithm. Once you have identified the source of the bug, implement the necessary changes, and then retest your algorithm to confirm that the bug has been resolved and that no new bugs have been introduced.
