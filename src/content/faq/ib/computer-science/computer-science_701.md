Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in web applications enable direct data sharing among connected users without relying on a central server.

In a P2P network, each user, referred to as a "peer," functions simultaneously as both a client and a server. This allows peers to share their resources—such as files, bandwidth, and processing power—directly with one another. This decentralized approach contrasts with the traditional client-server model, where a central server provides resources to its connected clients. The P2P architecture eliminates a single point of failure, resulting in enhanced resilience and efficiency.

P2P networks can serve various purposes in web applications. For instance, they can facilitate the efficient distribution of large files, as each peer can download different segments of the file from multiple peers concurrently. This simultaneous downloading significantly alleviates the load on any individual server and boosts download speeds. Furthermore, P2P networks are instrumental in real-time communication applications, such as video conferencing, where data is transmitted directly between users, thereby reducing latency.

The implementation of P2P networks employs a range of protocols and technologies. For example, the BitTorrent protocol is widely used for file sharing, while the WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) API is designed for real-time communication in web applications. These protocols manage various tasks, including peer discovery, connection establishment, and data transfer.

Nevertheless, P2P networks also introduce certain challenges. They can be more complex to manage and secure compared to traditional networks due to the absence of a central authority responsible for enforcing rules and safeguarding against malicious activities. Additionally, the reliability of P2P networks can be compromised because the availability of resources hinges on the presence and cooperation of peers. Despite these challenges, P2P networks remain a favored option for numerous web applications, owing to their potential advantages in efficiency, resilience, and scalability.
