In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes serve as the foundational structures that define the properties and methods of objects, which are specific instances of these classes.

To elaborate, a class in OOP acts as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It specifies a collection of properties, also referred to as attributes or fields, and methods, which are functions or behaviors that an object of this class will possess. For example, consider a class named 'Car'. This class may include properties such as 'colour', 'model', and 'speed', along with methods like 'accelerate' and 'brake'.

In contrast, an object is a concrete instance of a class. It represents a specific realization of the class, with actual values assigned to the properties defined within it. For instance, an object of the 'Car' class might have the property values: 'colour' as 'red', 'model' as 'Ferrari', and 'speed' as '200 \, \text{km/h}'. Furthermore, this object can execute the methods defined in the class, enabling it to perform actions such as accelerating or braking.

The interaction between classes and objects is a fundamental principle of OOP. When a program is executed, objects communicate with each other by sending messages. Upon receiving a message, an object responds by invoking one of its methods. This interaction is governed by the definitions established in the class. For instance, if an object of the 'Car' class receives a message to 'brake', it will activate the 'brake' method specified in the 'Car' class.

Inheritance is another essential feature of the relationship between classes and objects in OOP. A class can inherit properties and methods from another class, known as its superclass. The class that inherits is referred to as the subclass. This subclass can be utilized to create objects that incorporate both the inherited properties and methods, as well as any additional ones defined in the subclass. This mechanism promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical organization of classes and objects.

In summary, the interaction between classes and objects in OOP is facilitated by the definitions within the class, which delineate the properties and methods of the objects. Additionally, objects communicate through messages that trigger method execution. Inheritance significantly enhances this interaction by allowing for hierarchical structuring and the reuse of code across classes and objects.
