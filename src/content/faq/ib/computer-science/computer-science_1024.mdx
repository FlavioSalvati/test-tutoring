The components of a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) consist of wireless clients, access points, and a network infrastructure that includes Ethernet connectivity.

A WLAN is a type of local area network that utilizes high-frequency radio waves for communication and data transmission, rather than relying on physical wires. This flexibility allows WLANs to serve as extensions of traditional wired Local Area Networks (LANs) or as standalone alternatives.

The first essential component of a WLAN is the wireless clients. These are the devices that connect to the network wirelessly, ranging from laptops, smartphones, and tablets to desktop computers equipped with a wireless network interface card (NIC). The wireless NIC enables these devices to access the network without needing a physical wired connection.

The second critical component is the access points (APs). Access points are devices that transmit the wireless signal and manage the traffic between wireless clients and the broader network. Typically, access points are connected to the wired network infrastructure via Ethernet cables. They serve as a bridge, facilitating communication between wireless clients and wired devices within the network.

The third component is the network infrastructure with Ethernet connectivity. This includes all the wired devices and cabling that interconnect the network. Common elements of this infrastructure are routers, switches, and servers. The router directs traffic between different networks, while switches allow for communication among devices within the same network. Servers are responsible for providing various services, such as file storage and email.

Additionally, a WLAN may incorporate a wireless controller. This device manages multiple access points, ensuring they work in concert to provide comprehensive coverage over a larger area. The wireless controller can also handle tasks such as load balancing and implementing security measures, simplifying network management.

In summary, a WLAN comprises wireless clients, access points, and a network infrastructure with Ethernet connectivity. These components collaboratively enable flexible and convenient access to network resources without the need for physical, wired connections.
