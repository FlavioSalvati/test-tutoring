Collective intelligence on the web is evident through various collaborative platforms, including social media, wikis, forums, and crowdsourcing initiatives.

Collective intelligence refers to the shared or group intelligence that arises from the collaboration and competition among numerous individuals. On the internet, this phenomenon is prominently displayed in platforms that facilitate user-generated content and cooperation. A prime illustration of collective intelligence is Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. This openness allows for a vast repository of knowledge contributed by individuals from around the globe. The collective efforts of its users help to create, update, and maintain the information available on the site.

Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram also exemplify collective intelligence. Users actively share information, ideas, personal experiences, and opinions, which contributes to a collective understanding of various topics. For instance, during significant global events, social media can deliver real-time updates and a diversity of perspectives that traditional media may overlook.

Furthermore, forums and discussion boards like Reddit and Quora serve as additional examples of collective intelligence on the web. These platforms enable users to pose questions, share knowledge, and engage in discussions across a wide array of subjects. The community's collective intelligence plays a critical role in answering questions, solving problems, and generating innovative ideas.

Crowdsourcing initiatives represent another manifestation of collective intelligence. These initiatives tap into the collective power of the crowd to solve problems, create content, or gather data. A notable example is the Galaxy Zoo project, which invited internet users to assist in classifying galaxies based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. This project harnessed the collective intelligence of hundreds of thousands of volunteers to accomplish a task that would have been unfeasible for a small team of astronomers.

In conclusion, collective intelligence on the web is a potent resource that capitalizes on the knowledge, skills, and perspectives of a large number of individuals. It is a fundamental component of many online platforms and initiatives, enriching the vast and diverse pool of information available on the internet.
