A full binary tree is defined by the property that every node has either zero or two children. 

Also referred to as a proper or plane binary tree, a full binary tree is a specific type of binary tree where each node contains either no children (leaf nodes) or exactly two children. Importantly, no node in a full binary tree has just one child. This unique structure makes full binary trees particularly interesting and valuable for various computer science problems and algorithms.

In a full binary tree, all leaf nodes—those nodes that do not have any children—are typically located at the same level. In the case of an incomplete binary tree, there may be a difference of one level among the leaf nodes. This uniform structure can simplify certain operations and algorithms that interact with such trees. For instance, in a full binary tree, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than the number of nodes that have two children.

Another key characteristic of a full binary tree is the relationship between the total number of nodes and the height of the tree. Specifically, the height of a full binary tree containing $n$ nodes is given by:

$$
\text{Height} = \log_2(n + 1)
$$

This logarithmic relationship indicates that full binary trees are height-balanced, a property that is essential for the efficiency of many algorithms, including search algorithms that rely on the tree's height for their performance.

Full binary trees are extensively utilized in computer science. They serve as the foundation for heaps, which are utilized in the heap sort algorithm, a widely used sorting technique. Additionally, full binary trees play a crucial role in binary search trees, which are fundamental data structures for numerous search algorithms. Consequently, understanding the properties and characteristics of full binary trees is vital for anyone studying computer science.
