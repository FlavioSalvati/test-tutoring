To ensure that preconditions are satisfied before executing a solution, it is essential to implement checks and validations within your code.

Preconditions are the specific conditions or criteria that must be fulfilled before a function or method is executed. They form part of the function's contract, clearly outlining what is expected from the caller. To verify that these preconditions are met, you can utilize checks and validations in your code. This can be accomplished through the use of conditional statements, such as if-else statements, which assess whether the preconditions are satisfied prior to executing the function or method. If the preconditions are not met, the function should refrain from proceeding and should return an error or throw an exception instead. 

For instance, consider a function designed to divide two numbers. A critical precondition in this case would be that the divisor must not be zero. Before performing the division, you would check if the divisor is zero. If it is, you would halt the division process and return an error or throw an exception.

In addition to incorporating checks and validations in your code, it is vital to document your preconditions. This documentation assists other developers in understanding the necessary conditions for your function or method to operate correctly. You can provide this documentation in the comments within your code or in the broader documentation of your software.

Moreover, employing unit tests is an effective way to verify that your preconditions are met. Unit tests are small, isolated tests that evaluate whether specific parts of your code function as intended. You can create unit tests explicitly designed to check if your preconditions are satisfied. If a unit test fails, it indicates that a precondition has not been met, prompting you to rectify your code.

In summary, ensuring that preconditions are satisfied before executing a solution is crucial for the reliable functioning of your software. You can achieve this by implementing checks and validations in your code, documenting your preconditions, and utilizing unit tests.
