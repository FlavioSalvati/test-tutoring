Distributed databases differ from centralized databases primarily in their approach to data storage, which is spread across multiple physical locations.

In a centralized database system, all data is stored and managed in a single location, typically on a central server. This server handles all data requests, which may result in a bottleneck if it becomes overloaded. While centralized databases are simpler to manage due to their singular location, they also pose a significant risk as a single point of failure. If the central server experiences downtime, the entire database becomes inaccessible.

In contrast, a distributed database system manages and stores data across multiple physical locations, which can span different buildings, cities, or even countries. This distribution can be implemented in various ways, including data partitioning—where each location stores a portion of the overall data—or data replication—where each location maintains a complete copy of the database.

Distributed databases offer several advantages over their centralized counterparts. First, they enhance reliability and fault tolerance. If one site fails, the system can continue functioning by accessing data from other locations. Second, they provide improved performance, as data is located closer to users, thereby reducing data access times. Additionally, distributed databases are inherently scalable; they can easily accommodate increasing volumes of data by adding more sites.

However, distributed databases also present unique challenges. They are more complex to manage due to the necessity of synchronizing data across multiple locations, which can lead to issues such as data inconsistency. Furthermore, the initial setup and ongoing maintenance costs of a distributed database system can be higher than those of a centralized system, largely due to the need for multiple servers and robust network infrastructure.

In summary, the primary distinction between distributed and centralized databases lies in their data storage and management strategies. Centralized databases consolidate all data in one location, while distributed databases distribute data across multiple locations. Although distributed databases offer enhanced reliability, performance, and scalability, they also introduce increased complexity and potential issues with data consistency.
