Computer languages are defined by three key characteristics: syntax, semantics, and level of abstraction.

**Syntax** refers to the collection of rules that govern the structure of programs written in a specific computer language. This encompasses how statements are constructed, the use of punctuation, and the arrangement of words and symbols. For instance, in Python, indentation is employed to delineate the scope of loops and functions, while in C++, curly braces are utilized for the same purpose. Syntax errors, such as missing punctuation or incorrect ordering of elements, can prevent a program from executing properly.

**Semantics**, in contrast, pertains to the meaning conveyed by the statements in a computer language. It involves the interpretation of symbols, variables, and functions within the code. For example, in Java, the '==' operator is used to compare primitive data types, whereas the 'equals()' method is employed to compare objects. A misunderstanding of a languageâ€™s semantics can lead to logical errors, where the code executes without producing the anticipated output.

Finally, the **level of abstraction** of a computer language indicates how closely it resembles machine code versus natural language. Low-level languages, such as Assembly, provide a granular view of the hardware, requiring the programmer to manually manage memory and processing resources. On the other hand, high-level languages like Python or Java abstract away these intricate details, offering built-in functions and structures that facilitate more intuitive programming and reduce the likelihood of errors. However, this abstraction often results in a trade-off regarding performance and control over hardware.

In conclusion, grasping the syntax, semantics, and level of abstraction of a computer language is fundamental for writing efficient and error-free code. Each language possesses unique strengths and weaknesses, and the selection of a language should be guided by the specific requirements of the task at hand.
