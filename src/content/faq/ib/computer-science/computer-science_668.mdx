HTTP and HTTPS are two protocols used for web communication, with the primary distinction being the level of security they provide. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.

HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, serves as the foundation for data exchange on the internet. It facilitates the transmission of hypertext requests and information between servers and web browsers. However, HTTP lacks security features, meaning that the data exchanged can be vulnerable to interception by unauthorized entities. This is where HTTPS plays a critical role.

HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is essentially an extension of HTTP that incorporates additional security measures. This enhanced security is achieved through the use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols. These protocols encrypt the data being sent and received, making it difficult for third parties to decipher the information. This encryption is especially vital when dealing with sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or login credentials.

The primary difference between HTTP and HTTPS lies in the presence of the SSL or TLS layer. When a user connects to a website via HTTPS, the site establishes a secure session using a digital SSL/TLS certificate. This secure connection is indicated by the prefix 'https://' in the URL, along with a padlock icon that appears in many web browsers. This ensures that all communication between the user and the website is encrypted, safeguarding it from interception.

In addition to providing security, HTTPS also offers authentication. This feature verifies that the website is indeed the one the server is intended to communicate with. Such validation is crucial in preventing 'man-in-the-middle' attacks, where a malicious actor intercepts and potentially alters the communication between the user and the server.

In summary, while both HTTP and HTTPS are protocols for transmitting hypertext, HTTPS incorporates significant security enhancements. These enhancements include data encryption and authentication, ensuring that the information transferred cannot be intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties. Consequently, HTTPS is particularly essential for websites that handle sensitive information.
