Autonomous agents operate within a network, leveraging communication protocols to exchange messages and data, thereby coordinating their actions effectively.

In this context, autonomous agents are independent entities capable of executing tasks without human oversight. They communicate using predefined protocols—sets of rules that govern how they exchange information and interact with one another. Communication can occur in two primary forms: direct and indirect. 

**Direct Communication**  
Direct communication involves agents sending messages directly to one another. This process is often facilitated by a messaging system, where agents transmit messages that may contain data or specific instructions. This form of communication is akin to how humans use email or text messaging. Messages can range from simple notifications, such as alerts about completed tasks, to more complex communications that include detailed instructions or large data sets. For effective understanding, agents must operate using a common language or protocol. Notable examples of such protocols include the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) and the Agent Communication Language (ACL).

**Indirect Communication**  
On the other hand, indirect communication—often referred to as stigmergy—occurs through modifications made to the shared environment by the agents. This method is reminiscent of how ants communicate by leaving pheromone trails. In this scenario, when an agent performs an action, such as placing a marker or adjusting a variable, other agents can respond to these environmental changes. Indirect communication is particularly advantageous in swarm intelligence scenarios, where numerous simple agents collaborate to tackle complex problems.

**Blackboard Communication**  
Additionally, agents can utilize blackboards—shared memory spaces where they can post and read messages. This form of communication is also categorized as indirect, as agents do not directly send messages to one another. Instead, they write their messages on the blackboard for others to read and respond to as needed.

Regardless of the communication method employed, it is essential that all agents adhere to the same protocols and understand a common language. This uniformity ensures that messages are interpreted correctly and that agents can respond appropriately. The choice of communication method is influenced by the specific needs of the network and the tasks the agents are required to perform.
