Network layering is a key design principle that involves dividing complex tasks into multiple layers, with each layer performing a distinct function.

In the realm of computer networking, network layering serves as a foundational concept that simplifies the intricate process of data communication by breaking it down into manageable components. This is accomplished by segmenting the communication process into several layers, each designated to handle a specific task. This layered structure not only enhances the design and management of networks but also facilitates interoperability among diverse hardware and software systems.

To illustrate this concept more clearly, consider the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, which is a conceptual framework that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of telecommunication or computing systems. The OSI model comprises seven distinct layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

1. **Physical Layer**: This is the lowest layer, responsible for the actual physical connection between devices. It addresses the electrical and mechanical aspects involved in transmitting raw bit streams over a physical medium, such as cables.

2. **Data Link Layer**: This layer is tasked with node-to-node data transfer. It ensures reliable communication by providing error detection and correction mechanisms.

3. **Network Layer**: The primary role of this layer is to deliver individual packets from the source host to the destination host. It manages routing and forwarding of packets across the network.

4. **Transport Layer**: This layer offers transparent data transfer between end users and provides reliable data transfer services to the layers above it.

5. **Session Layer**: The Session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating connections between applications on either end. It coordinates communication sessions between devices.

6. **Presentation Layer**: This layer transforms data into a format that the Application layer can process. It is responsible for data formatting and encryption before transmission across the network.

7. **Application Layer**: The topmost layer interacts directly with software applications, providing the necessary network services to these applications.

Each layer in the OSI model serves a specific function and communicates with the layers immediately above and below it. This layered architecture promotes separation of concerns, making network troubleshooting and management more straightforward. Additionally, it allows for greater flexibility, as modifications in one layer do not impact the others. This encapsulates the essence of network layering.
