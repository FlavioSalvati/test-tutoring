An operating system (OS) is essential for managing system performance. It does so by efficiently allocating and overseeing resources, scheduling tasks, and processing system calls.

The OS serves as the foundation of a computer system, overseeing both hardware and software resources. Its primary responsibility is to ensure optimal system performance. One of the key methods by which the OS achieves this is through resource allocation and management. The OS determines which processes can access system resources, including the CPU, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices. It employs various algorithms to establish the order and duration of resource access, with the goal of maximizing efficiency and minimizing response times.

Task scheduling is another critical component of managing system performance. The OS decides when and for how long each process should run. This involves balancing the requirements of different processes, ensuring that each receives a fair share of CPU time while also taking into account their priority levels. The OS implements scheduling algorithms—such as round-robin or priority scheduling—to effectively manage this process. These algorithms aim to enhance throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and CPU utilization.

Furthermore, the OS is responsible for handling system calls, which are requests made by software for services provided by the OS. These requests can include actions such as accessing hardware, creating or deleting files, or spawning new processes. The OS manages these system calls to ensure they are processed efficiently and securely. This management process involves checking permissions, validating inputs, and overseeing the execution of the system calls.

Another vital aspect of system performance management is memory management. The OS tracks which segments of memory are currently in use and by which processes. It allocates memory to processes as needed and frees it when those processes are completed. To manage memory efficiently, the OS utilizes techniques such as paging and segmentation.

In conclusion, the operating system plays a crucial role in enhancing system performance. It achieves this through efficient resource allocation, task scheduling, system call handling, and memory management. By performing these functions, the OS ensures that the computer system operates smoothly and efficiently, providing a stable and responsive environment for program execution.
