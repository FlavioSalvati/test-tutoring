Plants capture light energy during photosynthesis through chlorophyll in their chloroplasts.

Photosynthesis is a process that converts light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later used by the organism. This process is fundamental to life on Earth, as it provides the energy that drives the biosphere. The process takes place in the chloroplasts, a type of organelle found in plant cells.

The chloroplasts contain a pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for capturing light energy. Chlorophyll absorbs light most efficiently in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but less so in the green part. This is why plants appear green; they reflect green light.

When light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, it boosts the energy level of electrons in the chlorophyll molecule. This energy is then used to power the reactions of photosynthesis. Specifically, the light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.

During these reactions, water molecules are split into oxygen, protons and electrons. The oxygen is released as a waste product, while the protons and electrons are used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These are energy-rich molecules that are used in the second stage of photosynthesis, the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle.

In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma of the chloroplasts, the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This glucose can then be used by the plant for growth and reproduction, or stored for later use.

In summary, plants capture light energy during photosynthesis through the chlorophyll in their chloroplasts. This energy is then used to power a series of reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is not only vital for the survival of the plant, but also for life on Earth as a whole, as it is the primary source of oxygen in the atmosphere.
