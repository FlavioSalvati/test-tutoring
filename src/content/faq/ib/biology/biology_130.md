Materials are transported across the cell membrane through two main processes: passive transport and active transport.

**Passive Transport**  
Passive transport is a process that does not require energy from the cell. It involves the movement of substances from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, following the concentration gradient. This movement continues until equilibrium is achieved, meaning the concentrations on both sides of the membrane become equal. There are three primary types of passive transport: diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis.

1. **Diffusion**  
   Diffusion is the simplest form of passive transport. It allows small, non-polar molecules, such as oxygen ($O_2$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), to pass directly through the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane.

2. **Facilitated Diffusion**  
   In contrast, facilitated diffusion involves the movement of larger or polar molecules, such as glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) and ions. These molecules cannot directly traverse the lipid bilayer, so they require protein channels or carriers to assist their movement across the membrane.

3. **Osmosis**  
   Osmosis is a specialized form of diffusion that specifically involves the movement of water molecules. Water moves from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration in an effort to dilute the solute and achieve equilibrium.

**Active Transport**  
Active transport, on the other hand, requires energy from the cell in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process enables cells to move substances against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. Active transport is crucial for maintaining the internal environment of the cell, known as homeostasis. There are two main types of active transport: primary and secondary.

1. **Primary Active Transport**  
   Primary active transport directly utilizes ATP to pump substances across the membrane. A notable example is the sodium-potassium pump, which is essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradient necessary for nerve impulse transmission.

2. **Secondary Active Transport**  
   Secondary active transport, also referred to as co-transport, indirectly uses ATP. This process involves the movement of one substance down its concentration gradient, which provides the energy needed to transport another substance against its gradient.

In addition to these transport mechanisms, cells employ bulk transport to move large particles or substantial quantities of substances across the membrane. This is accomplished through the formation of vesicles in processes known as endocytosis (the intake of substances) and exocytosis (the expulsion of substances).

In summary, cells utilize a variety of transport mechanisms to move materials across their membranes, depending on the properties of the substances involved and the energy availability within the cell.
