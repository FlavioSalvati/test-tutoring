Agriculture plays a crucial role in contributing to methane emissions, primarily through livestock production and rice cultivation.

As a significant source of methane—a potent greenhouse gas that exacerbates global warming—agriculture's impact cannot be overlooked. The two predominant agricultural practices responsible for methane emissions are livestock farming and rice cultivation. Livestock, especially ruminants like cows and sheep, generate methane during their digestive process, a phenomenon known as enteric fermentation. These animals possess a specialized stomach that ferments food, producing methane as a by-product, which is subsequently released into the atmosphere primarily through belching.

Rice cultivation also represents a major contributor to methane emissions in agriculture. When rice is grown in flooded fields, the waterlogged conditions create an anaerobic environment that favors methane-producing bacteria. These bacteria, referred to as methanogens, decompose organic matter in the soil, releasing methane as a by-product. This methane can escape into the atmosphere either through the water column or directly from the soil surface.

Additionally, the management of manure significantly contributes to methane emissions. When manure is stored in lagoons or tanks, it undergoes anaerobic decomposition, resulting in the production of methane. This issue is particularly pronounced in large-scale industrial farming operations, where substantial quantities of manure are generated.

The impact of agriculture on methane emissions is both significant and increasing, driven by the rising global demand for meat and rice. This trend poses a major concern for climate change, as methane is considerably more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. It is estimated that agriculture accounts for approximately $50\%$ of all human-caused methane emissions. Consequently, implementing strategies to mitigate methane emissions from agriculture—such as improving livestock diets to minimize enteric fermentation, adopting alternative rice cultivation practices, and enhancing manure management techniques—is essential for addressing climate change.
