The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, plays a vital role in cellular respiration, the process through which cells generate energy. This cycle occurs in the mitochondria, often referred to as the "powerhouse" of the cell. It represents the second stage of aerobic respiration, occurring after glycolysis and preceding the electron transport chain.

The cycle initiates with the combination of a molecule of acetyl CoA, which is derived from the breakdown of glucose, and a molecule of oxaloacetate to form citrate. Through a series of enzymatic reactions, citrate is ultimately converted back into oxaloacetate. In the process, the cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one molecule of ATP, three molecules of NADH, and one molecule of FADH2 for each complete turn of the cycle.

The carbon dioxide generated is a waste product; it is expelled from the cell and eventually eliminated from the body via the lungs. ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, serves as an immediate source of energy for the cell, fueling various cellular processes such as muscle contraction and protein synthesis.

In contrast, NADH and FADH2 function as carriers of high-energy electrons. They do not provide energy directly; instead, they transport these electrons to the electron transport chain, which is the final stage of aerobic respiration. Within the electron transport chain, the energy from these electrons is harnessed to produce a significantly larger quantity of ATP. This highlights the importance of the Krebs cycle: although it produces only a small amount of ATP directly, it establishes the necessary conditions for the production of a much greater amount of ATP during the electron transport phase.

In summary, the Krebs cycle is an essential component of cellular respiration, yielding carbon dioxide, ATP, NADH, and FADH2. Each of these products plays a critical role in cellular function, from providing immediate energy to facilitating the generation of additional energy.
