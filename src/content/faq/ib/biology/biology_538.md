In certain reptiles, the temperature during embryonic development plays a crucial role in determining the sex of the offspring.

Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) is a form of environmental sex determination that is particularly prevalent among reptiles. In this mechanism, the sex of the offspring is not dictated by the genetic information inherited from the parents; rather, it is influenced by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated during a critical phase of embryonic development.

While the precise mechanism by which temperature affects sex determination remains incompletely understood, it is believed to involve temperature-sensitive enzymes. These enzymes regulate the synthesis of sex hormones, which subsequently influence the development of the sex organs. At certain temperatures, these enzymes may promote the production of male hormones, resulting in male offspring, whereas at other temperatures, they may encourage the production of female hormones, leading to female offspring.

The temperature range where sex determination occurs is referred to as the pivotal temperature. For instance, in many turtle species, eggs incubated at temperatures below the pivotal temperature tend to develop into males, while those incubated at temperatures above this threshold develop into females. However, the specific pivotal temperature and the associated patterns of sex determination can vary significantly across different species.

This phenomenon has critical implications for the survival of these species, especially in the context of climate change. As global temperatures rise, there is a considerable risk that populations may become disproportionately skewed toward one sex, jeopardizing the species' survival. For example, a recent study revealed that over $99\%$ of green sea turtles in certain areas of the Great Barrier Reef are now female due to increasing temperatures.

In summary, temperature-dependent sex determination is a captivating and intricate process that is vital to the life cycle of many reptile species. Gaining a deeper understanding of this process is essential not only for advancing our knowledge of reptile biology but also for effectively conserving these species in a rapidly changing environment.
