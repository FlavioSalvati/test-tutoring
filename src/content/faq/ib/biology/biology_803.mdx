Aquaporins are specialized protein channels located within the cell membrane that facilitate the rapid transport of water molecules.

Commonly referred to as water channels, aquaporins belong to a larger family of integral membrane proteins known as major intrinsic proteins (MIPs). These proteins form pores in the cell membrane specifically designed to allow the passage of water molecules, a process that is essential for numerous biological functions.

The structure of aquaporins is characterized by a narrow pore that traverses the membrane. This pore is lined with specific amino acids that attract water molecules, enabling them to pass through in a single file. The unique arrangement of these amino acids effectively prevents the passage of other molecules or ions, ensuring that only water is transported.

The movement of water through aquaporins occurs via passive transport, which means it does not require any energy input. Water molecules naturally move from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration, adhering to the principle of osmosis. This process is vital in various biological systems. For instance, in the kidneys, aquaporins facilitate the reabsorption of water from the filtrate back into the bloodstream, concentrating urine and helping to prevent dehydration.

Aquaporins are regulated by the cell, which can modulate the number of these proteins present in the membrane based on physiological needs. This regulation allows the cell to control the rate of water transport, enabling it to respond to environmental changes or variations in metabolic activity.

In summary, aquaporins are essential for the transport of water across the cell membrane. Their distinctive structure allows for the selective passage of water molecules, while the cell's ability to regulate their presence ensures that water transport rates align with the cell's requirements.
