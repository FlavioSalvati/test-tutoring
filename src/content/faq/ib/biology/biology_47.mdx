Pollutants such as plastics have profoundly disrupted marine ecosystems, inflicting harm on marine life and transforming habitats in significant ways.

Plastics are non-biodegradable pollutants that represent a grave threat to marine environments. Marine animals often mistake plastics for food, which can lead to ingestion and entanglement. When consumed, plastics can cause severe physical injuries, including internal damage and blockages in the digestive system, frequently resulting in death. Additionally, plastics can serve as vessels for other harmful pollutants, as they have the capacity to absorb toxic chemicals from their surroundings. When ingested by marine organisms, these absorbed toxins can enter the food chain, posing further risks to marine life and human health.

The effects of plastics on marine ecosystems extend beyond direct harm to individual organisms. They also contribute to habitat destruction. Microplastics—tiny fragments of plastic measuring less than $5 \text{ mm}$—can accumulate on the seabed, altering the physical characteristics of the sediment. This alteration can adversely affect the organisms that inhabit or rely on the seabed, thereby disrupting the foundational aspects of the ecosystem. Larger plastic debris can smother habitats, preventing essential light and oxygen from reaching the organisms beneath the surface.

Moreover, plastics can disturb the equilibrium of marine ecosystems. For example, floating plastics can create new habitats for species that would not typically thrive in those areas, which may lead to the introduction of invasive species. Such invasions can disrupt local ecosystems, as invasive species often outcompete native species for limited resources.

The degradation of plastics in the ocean can also result in the release of greenhouse gases, further contributing to climate change. This phenomenon can have cascading effects on marine ecosystems, including ocean acidification and rising sea temperatures. These changes can lead to coral bleaching and a significant loss of biodiversity.

In summary, pollutants like plastics exert a multifaceted impact on marine ecosystems. They inflict harm on marine life, alter habitats, disrupt ecological balance, and contribute to climate change. These consequences underscore the urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate plastic pollution in our oceans.
