Keystone species are essential for maintaining the structure and function of their ecosystems.

These organisms exert a disproportionately large influence on their environment compared to their abundance. They play a pivotal role in sustaining the structure of an ecological community, affecting numerous other organisms and helping to shape the types and populations of various species within that community.

The term "keystone species" was first introduced by Robert T. Paine in 1969. He observed that certain species, such as the starfish *Pisaster ochraceus*, significantly influenced community structure. When these starfish were removed from their ecosystem, the population of their primary prey, mussels, surged dramatically. This increase in mussels led to a decline in the diversity of other species, highlighting the crucial role the starfish played in maintaining ecological balance and diversity.

Keystone species can be predators, like the starfish, but they can also be herbivores or even plants. For instance, elephants are recognized as keystone species in the African savannah because they help regulate the populations of certain trees. This allows grasses to flourish, which in turn supports a diverse array of grazing animals. Similarly, certain plants can serve as keystone species by providing vital resources, such as food and habitat, for various organisms.

The removal of a keystone species can trigger a cascade of changes within the ecosystem, often leading to reduced biodiversity and potentially resulting in ecosystem collapse. Consequently, identifying and protecting keystone species is a critical focus of conservation biology. However, pinpointing these species can be challenging, as their impact on the community may only become evident when they are removed or their populations significantly decline.

In summary, keystone species are vital in shaping ecosystems and preserving biodiversity. Their presence or absence can have profound effects on community structure and function, illustrating the complex interdependencies that characterize ecological communities.
