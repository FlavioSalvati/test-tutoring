During telophase I and cytokinesis in meiosis, chromosomes migrate to the poles of the cell, the nuclear membrane reforms, and the cell divides into two daughter cells.

Meiosis begins with the first stage, known as meiosis I, which consists of several phases designed to ensure the correct segregation of genetic material. Telophase I marks the final phase of meiosis I, followed by cytokinesis. During telophase I, the chromosomes, which were separated earlier during anaphase I, arrive at the poles of the cell. Each pole now contains a haploid set of chromosomes; however, each chromosome still comprises two sister chromatids. The microtubules that formed the spindle fibers disassemble, and a new nuclear membrane begins to form around each set of chromosomes. This reformation of the nuclear membrane signifies the conclusion of telophase I.

Following telophase I, cytokinesis occurs, which is the process of dividing the cytoplasm. This step is crucial as it physically separates the two daughter cells. In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs through a mechanism known as cleavage. A cleavage furrow develops at the equator of the cell and deepens until the cell is pinched into two distinct cells, each containing its own nucleus. In contrast, in plant cells, a cell plate forms along the equatorial plane of the cell, eventually developing into a cell wall that divides the cell into two.

It is important to highlight that the two daughter cells produced at the end of meiosis I are not identical to the parent cell. They contain half the number of chromosomes, and due to the process of crossing over that occurs during prophase I, they possess a unique combination of genetic material. This genetic variation is a fundamental characteristic of meiosis and plays a crucial role in evolution and adaptation.

After cytokinesis, the cell enters a brief interphase-like period known as interkinesis. During interkinesis, the cell may undergo some growth, and the DNA may be repaired; however, unlike interphase, there is no replication of DNA. Following interkinesis, the cell proceeds to meiosis II, which resembles mitosis, further separating the sister chromatids and ultimately producing four genetically distinct haploid cells.
