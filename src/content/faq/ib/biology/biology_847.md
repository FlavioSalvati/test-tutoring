Messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized during the transcription process, in which a segment of DNA is copied into RNA by the enzyme RNA polymerase.

Transcription represents the initial step in gene expression, where the information encoded in a gene's DNA is transferred to a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This essential process occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. Transcription can be divided into three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.

During the initiation phase, the enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of the DNA known as the promoter. This binding indicates the start point for transcription. Subsequently, the DNA double helix unwinds and separates, exposing the gene sequence to be transcribed. RNA polymerase then begins to synthesize the mRNA strand.

In the elongation phase, RNA polymerase traverses the DNA template strand, adding complementary RNA nucleotides to form the mRNA molecule. It is crucial to understand that RNA polymerase reads the DNA template in the $3'$ to $5'$ direction while synthesizing the mRNA in the $5'$ to $3'$ direction. Consequently, the mRNA molecule is a complementary copy of the DNA strand, differing only in that RNA contains uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).

Finally, during the termination stage, RNA polymerase encounters a specific DNA sequence called the terminator, which signals the conclusion of the transcription process. At this point, RNA polymerase, the newly formed mRNA molecule, and the DNA template dissociate from one another. The mRNA undergoes additional processing before it becomes ready for translation into a protein.

In summary, the synthesis of mRNA during transcription is a complex process that involves the coordinated interaction of enzymes and nucleic acids. This pivotal step in gene expression enables the genetic information stored in DNA to be translated into proteins, which perform various essential functions within the cell.
