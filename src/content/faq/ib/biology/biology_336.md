Energy is extracted from nutrients in the digestive system through a series of processes known as digestion and absorption.

The digestion process involves breaking down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This process begins in the mouth, where mechanical digestion (chewing) and chemical digestion (via enzymes present in saliva) commence the breakdown of food. Afterward, the food travels down the esophagus and enters the stomach, where it undergoes further breakdown due to stomach acid and digestive enzymes.

The partially digested food transforms into a thick liquid called chyme, which then moves into the small intestine. In the small intestine, chyme is subjected to additional breakdown by enzymes produced by both the pancreas and the intestinal walls. These enzymes convert proteins into amino acids, fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and carbohydrates into simple sugars. The resulting smaller molecules are then absorbed through the walls of the small intestine and enter the bloodstream.

Nutrient absorption is facilitated by tiny, finger-like projections known as villi and microvilli, which line the walls of the small intestine. These structures significantly increase the surface area of the intestine, enhancing the efficiency of nutrient absorption. Once absorbed, the nutrients are transported to the liver via the hepatic portal vein, where they are processed and distributed to various parts of the body.

The energy derived from these nutrients is utilized by the body's cells through a process called cellular respiration. During this process, glucose (a simple sugar) is broken down to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which serves as the primary energy currency of the body. Cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria of cells and involves three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.

In summary, the energy from nutrients is absorbed in the digestive system through the processes of digestion and absorption. Nutrients are broken down into smaller molecules that can enter the bloodstream, be transported to the liver, and subsequently distributed throughout the body. The energy from these nutrients is then harnessed by the bodyâ€™s cells in the process of cellular respiration to produce ATP.
