Climate change significantly impacts biodiversity by altering habitats, disrupting ecosystems, and leading to species extinction.

Primarily driven by the increase in greenhouse gases, climate change has a profound effect on biodiversity worldwide. Biodiversity encompasses the variety of life on Earth, including the diversity of ecosystems, species, and genetic variation within species. The delicate balance of this biodiversity can be disrupted by climate change, resulting in significant and often irreversible consequences.

One of the key ways climate change influences biodiversity is through habitat alteration. As global temperatures rise, many habitats become unsuitable for their resident species. For instance, polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, jeopardizing the survival of iconic species such as polar bears and penguins. Similarly, coral reefs—home to approximately $25\%$ of all marine species—are experiencing bleaching and destruction due to increased ocean temperatures.

Climate change also disrupts ecosystems by affecting the timing of natural events. Numerous species depend on specific environmental cues for critical activities like migration, hibernation, and reproduction. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can disrupt these cues, leading to mismatches between species and their environments. For example, if flowers bloom earlier as a result of warmer temperatures, this may not align with the arrival of pollinators, thereby impacting both the plants and the insects that rely on them.

Moreover, climate change can drive species to extinction. As habitats shift and ecosystems become disrupted, many species may struggle to adapt quickly enough to the new conditions. This is particularly true for species with small populations or restricted geographic ranges. The extinction of one species can trigger a domino effect, impacting many others within the same ecosystem.

Additionally, climate change can compound other threats to biodiversity, such as habitat loss from deforestation, pollution, and the overexploitation of resources. These factors, when combined with the effects of climate change, can create a 'perfect storm' that endangers the survival of numerous species.

In conclusion, climate change represents a substantial threat to biodiversity. By altering habitats, disrupting ecosystems, and contributing to species extinction, it can lead to profound and potentially irreversible changes in the natural world.
