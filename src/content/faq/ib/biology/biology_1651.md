Saturated fatty acids contain only single bonds, whereas unsaturated fatty acids include one or more double bonds in their structure.

Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are types of fats that exhibit distinct chemical structures. Saturated fatty acids are described as "saturated" with hydrogen atoms because they possess only single bonds between carbon atoms. This configuration enables them to pack closely together, resulting in a solid state at room temperature. Common examples of saturated fats include butter and lard.

In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double bonds between carbon atoms. These double bonds introduce a "kink" in the fatty acid chain, which inhibits the tight packing of the molecules. Consequently, unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats can be further categorized into monounsaturated fats, which contain a single double bond, and polyunsaturated fats, which have two or more double bonds. Notable examples of unsaturated fats include olive oil and fish oil.

The presence of double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids also affects their stability. Double bonds are more reactive than single bonds, making unsaturated fats more prone to oxidation and rancidity. This increased reactivity is why unsaturated fats should ideally be stored in dark, cool environments.

From a nutritional standpoint, both types of fats play essential roles in the body, yet they have different health implications. Saturated fats are commonly associated with elevated levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, which may lead to an increased risk of heart disease. Conversely, unsaturated fats—especially polyunsaturated fats—can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels while increasing HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health.

In summary, the primary distinction between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids lies in their chemical structure. This difference significantly impacts their physical properties, stability, and health effects.
