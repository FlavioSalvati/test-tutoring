Genetic variation can be categorized into two primary types: continuous variation and discontinuous variation. 

**Continuous Variation** refers to traits that exhibit a range of small differences rather than distinct categories. This type of variation typically arises from the combined effects of multiple genes, known as polygenic inheritance, and various environmental factors. Common examples of continuous variation in humans include height, weight, and skin color. These traits do not fall into separate categories; instead, they exist along a continuum. For instance, human height is not simply classified as tall or short, but rather spans a spectrum from the shortest to the tallest individuals.

In contrast, **Discontinuous Variation** pertains to traits that can be classified into a limited number of distinct categories, with little to no intermediate forms. This variation is often influenced by a single gene or a small number of genes. Examples of discontinuous variation include blood type, eye color, and the presence or absence of certain genetic diseases. These traits are typically not influenced by environmental factors, and the differences between categories are clear-cut. For example, a person can only have one of four blood types: A, B, AB, or O.

In summary, continuous variation encompasses traits with small, gradual differences that are influenced by multiple genes and environmental conditions, such as height or skin color, which exist on a scale. Discontinuous variation, on the other hand, includes traits that fit into distinct categories, typically controlled by fewer genes, with no intermediate forms, such as blood type or eye color. This distinction illustrates the diverse range of physical characteristics shaped by our genetic makeup.
