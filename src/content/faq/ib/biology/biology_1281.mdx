Environmental factors significantly impact phenotypic expression by interacting with an organism's genetic makeup to shape its physical traits.

Phenotypic expression, often referred to as phenotype, encompasses the observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism. These characteristics arise from both genetic makeup and environmental influences. While genes serve as the blueprint for an organism's traits, the environment plays a crucial role in determining how these traits manifest. This interplay between genes and environmental factors is known as gene-environment interaction.

One notable way in which environmental factors can influence phenotypic expression is through temperature. For example, in certain reptile species, the temperature at which eggs are incubated determines the sex of the offspring. This phenomenon is referred to as temperature-dependent sex determination. In addition, consider the Himalayan rabbit: the gene responsible for fur color is influenced by temperature variations. The cooler regions of the rabbit's body, such as the ears and feet, exhibit darker fur due to the activation of a specific gene at lower temperatures.

Nutrition also serves as a critical environmental factor affecting phenotypic expression. For instance, a person's height is influenced by both their genetic potential and their nutritional intake during growth. If an individual is genetically predisposed to be tall but lacks sufficient nutrition during their developmental years, they may not achieve their full height potential.

Light exposure constitutes another environmental factor that can significantly influence phenotypic expression. The flowering of many plants is regulated by a process called photoperiodism, which refers to the organism's response to the duration of day or night. Some plants only flower when the length of daylight surpasses a certain threshold, whereas others bloom when the duration of nighttime exceeds a specific limit.

Furthermore, environmental stressors such as toxins, radiation, and pathogens can also affect phenotypic expression. For example, exposure to radiation can lead to mutations in DNA, potentially altering phenotypic traits. Similarly, certain pathogens can trigger immune responses that modify the phenotype.

In conclusion, environmental factors play a vital role in shaping an organism's phenotype through their interaction with genetic makeup. This underscores the complexity of the relationship between genes and the environment in determining an organism's traits.
