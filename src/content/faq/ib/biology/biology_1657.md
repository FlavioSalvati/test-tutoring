Covalent bonds in water contribute to its unique properties such as high boiling point, cohesion, adhesion, and polarity.

Covalent bonds are a type of chemical bond where two atoms share a pair of electrons. In a water molecule, each hydrogen atom forms a covalent bond with the oxygen atom, sharing its single electron. This results in a stable molecule with a bent shape, where the oxygen atom is at the apex and the two hydrogen atoms at the base.

One of the most significant properties of water resulting from its covalent bonds is its polarity. The oxygen atom, being more electronegative, pulls the shared electrons closer to itself, creating a partial negative charge. The hydrogen atoms, in turn, have a partial positive charge. This polarity allows water molecules to attract each other, forming hydrogen bonds. These intermolecular forces are responsible for water's high boiling point, as more energy is required to break these bonds and convert water from a liquid to a gas.

The polarity of water also leads to its properties of cohesion and adhesion. Cohesion refers to the attraction between like molecules, in this case, water molecules. This is why water forms droplets when placed on a non-polar surface, as the water molecules are more attracted to each other than to the surface. Adhesion, on the other hand, is the attraction between unlike molecules. This is why water can 'climb' up a narrow tube against the force of gravity, a phenomenon known as capillary action.

Furthermore, the covalent bonds in water contribute to its ability to act as a solvent. The polarity of water allows it to dissolve many substances, including salts, sugars, and many gases. This is crucial in biological systems, where water often acts as a medium for chemical reactions and transport of substances.

In summary, the covalent bonds in water are fundamental to its unique properties. They result in a polar molecule that can form hydrogen bonds, leading to high boiling points, cohesion, adhesion, and excellent solvent properties. These properties make water indispensable in many biological processes.
