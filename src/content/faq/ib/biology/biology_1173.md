A triglyceride is a specific type of lipid composed of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acid chains.

Triglycerides belong to the class of lipids, which are organic compounds characterized by their insolubility in water but solubility in organic solvents. They play a vital role in living organisms by serving as a compact energy reserve, providing insulation for the body, and protecting essential organs. The structure of a triglyceride is relatively straightforward, consisting of a single glycerol molecule bonded to three fatty acid chains.

The glycerol molecule, also referred to as glycerine, is a small compound that contains three carbon atoms. Each carbon atom in glycerol is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH). These hydroxyl groups are crucial because they can form ester bonds with fatty acids. Fatty acids are long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms, featuring a carboxyl group (-COOH) at one end. The carboxyl group reacts with the hydroxyl group of glycerol, resulting in the formation of an ester bond and the release of a water molecule during this process, which is known as esterification.

The fatty acids within a triglyceride can be classified as either saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fatty acids do not contain double bonds between their carbon atoms, which means they are "saturated" with hydrogen atoms. As a result, these fatty acids are typically solid at room temperature and are commonly found in animal fats. Conversely, unsaturated fatty acids possess one or more double bonds in their carbon chains. This configuration leads to fewer hydrogen atoms and introduces a "kink" in the chain, preventing the molecules from packing closely together. Unsaturated fats are generally liquid at room temperature and are prevalent in plant oils.

The characteristics of a triglyceride, including its melting point and physiological roles, are largely influenced by the types of fatty acids it contains. For instance, triglycerides that contain a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids tend to have a lower melting point, making them more likely to be liquid at room temperature. These triglycerides are also more involved in biological processes such as energy storage and insulation.
