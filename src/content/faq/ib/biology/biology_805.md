Cytokinesis is the final phase of cell division that occurs after mitosis, resulting in the division of the cytoplasm from a parent cell into two daughter cells. This process varies significantly between plant and animal cells due to their distinct structural characteristics.

In animal cells, cytokinesis initiates with the development of a cleavage furrow. This furrow is formed by a contractile ring composed of actin and myosin filaments that encircles the equator of the cell. As this ring contracts, it pulls the plasma membrane inward, creating a furrow that deepens over time. Ultimately, this furrow pinches the parent cell into two separate daughter cells, each containing its own nucleus, cytoplasm, organelles, and other essential cellular components.

Conversely, plant cells possess a rigid cell wall that prevents them from undergoing the same pinching process observed in animal cells. Instead, plant cells achieve cytokinesis through the formation of a cell plate. This cell plate develops along the equatorial plane of the cell and is composed of vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus. These vesicles, which contain components necessary for building the cell wall and membrane, fuse together at the metaphase plate. As fusion occurs, the cell plate expands outward until it reaches the existing cell wall. Once the cell plate is fully formed, it completes the division of the parent cell into two daughter cells.

In summary, although both plant and animal cells undergo cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells, the mechanisms employed reflect their structural differences. Animal cells utilize a cleavage furrow to pinch off into two cells, while plant cells form a cell plate that extends outward to achieve the same outcome.
