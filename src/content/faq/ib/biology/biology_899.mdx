The citric acid cycle, also referred to as the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is a crucial metabolic pathway that integrates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This cycle consists of a series of chemical reactions employed by all aerobic organisms to generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA, which is derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, ultimately producing ATP and carbon dioxide.

The cycle initiates with the reaction between acetyl-CoA and the four-carbon compound oxaloacetate, leading to the formation of six-carbon citrate. This citrate undergoes decarboxylation and isomerization to produce isocitrate. Subsequently, isocitrate is oxidatively decarboxylated by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase to yield the five-carbon molecule Î±-ketoglutarate. This molecule is further decarboxylated to create the four-carbon compound succinyl-CoA. Notably, the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate involves substrate-level phosphorylation, during which ATP is generated from ADP.

The subsequent steps of the cycle focus on regenerating oxaloacetate, allowing the cycle to continue. Succinate is converted to fumarate, then to malate, and finally back to oxaloacetate. Throughout these transformations, NAD+ is reduced to NADH, and FAD is reduced to FADH2.

To summarize, each molecule of acetyl-CoA that enters the citric acid cycle produces three molecules of NADH, one molecule of FADH2, one molecule of ATP (or GTP, depending on the cell type), and two molecules of carbon dioxide. The NADH and FADH2 produced are high-energy carriers that play a vital role in the electron transport chain, where they facilitate the production of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. The carbon dioxide generated during the cycle is a waste product that is expelled from the body.
