The primary products of the light-independent reactions in photosynthesis are glucose, ADP, NADP$^+$, and inorganic phosphate.

The light-independent reactions, commonly referred to as the Calvin cycle, represent the second stage of photosynthesis, which follows the light-dependent reactions. These reactions take place in the stroma of chloroplasts, where carbon dioxide and other compounds are transformed into glucose. Additionally, the Calvin cycle regenerates the initial reactants, ADP and NADP$^+$, for reuse in the light-dependent reactions.

The Calvin cycle begins with the fixation of carbon dioxide catalyzed by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). This enzyme facilitates the combination of carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), resulting in the formation of an unstable six-carbon compound. This compound rapidly dissociates into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), marking the initial step of carbon fixation, which is the process of incorporating carbon dioxide into organic compounds.

Subsequently, the 3-PGA molecules undergo conversion into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) through a series of reactions that require energy and electrons supplied by ATP and NADPH. These molecules are generated during the light-dependent reactions and are essential for driving this conversion. One molecule of G3P is utilized to synthesize glucose, while the remaining G3P molecules are recycled to regenerate RuBP, enabling the cycle to continue.

The glucose produced in the Calvin cycle serves as an energy source for the plant or can be stored as starch for future use. Meanwhile, ADP and NADP$^+$ are returned to the light-dependent reactions, where they are re-energized and converted back into ATP and NADPH. This cyclical nature of the light-independent reactions ensures that photosynthesis can persist as long as there is adequate light and carbon dioxide.

In summary, the main products of the light-independent reactions in photosynthesis are glucose, which provides energy for the plant, as well as ADP, NADP$^+$, and inorganic phosphate, which are recycled back into the light-dependent reactions. These processes are vital for the survival of plants and for sustaining life on Earth, as they are responsible for converting solar energy into chemical energy.
