The law of segregation is a key principle in genetics that governs the inheritance of traits in monohybrid crosses. It describes the process by which alleles separate and recombine during the formation of gametes and subsequent fertilization.

In a monohybrid cross, we focus on the inheritance of a single trait controlled by a pair of alleles. According to Mendel's law of segregation, these two alleles for each trait segregate during meiosis. As a result, each gamete ends up carrying only one allele for that trait. This segregation occurs because the chromosomes, which house the genes, also separate during meiosis, ensuring that each gamete receives only one set of chromosomes.

Upon fertilization, the gametes combine, allowing the offspring to inherit one allele from each parent, thereby restoring the pair of alleles for each trait. This process illustrates how the law of segregation operates in monohybrid crosses. The genotype of the offspring for each trait is determined by the combination of alleles inherited from the parents.

For instance, consider a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous pea plants, denoted as $Rr$. Here, $R$ represents the allele for round seeds, while $r$ represents the allele for wrinkled seeds. According to the law of segregation, the two alleles for seed shape in each parent plant will separate during gamete formation. Consequently, each gamete will contain only one allele for seed shape: either $R$ or $r$. When these gametes unite during fertilization, the offspring can inherit various combinations of these alleles: $RR$, $Rr$, or $rr$. This results in a phenotypic ratio of $3$ round seeds to $1$ wrinkled seed among the offspring.

In summary, the law of segregation is a fundamental principle in genetics that explains how traits are inherited in monohybrid crosses. It asserts that the two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation and subsequently recombine during fertilization, thereby determining the genotype and phenotype of the resulting offspring.
