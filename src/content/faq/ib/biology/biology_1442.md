The kidneys play a vital role in regulating blood volume by controlling the production and excretion of urine. This process is essential for maintaining the body's homeostasis and involves a series of complex mechanisms, including filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion.

Every day, the kidneys filter approximately $180$ liters of blood, eliminating waste products and excess water to form urine. The volume of urine produced and released directly influences blood volume, making kidney function crucial to overall circulatory health.

One of the key mechanisms through which the kidneys regulate blood volume is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). When blood volume decreases, the kidneys release an enzyme known as renin. This enzyme initiates a cascade of reactions leading to the formation of a hormone called angiotensin II. Angiotensin II plays two significant roles: it constricts blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure, and it stimulates the adrenal glands to release aldosterone. Aldosterone prompts the kidneys to reabsorb more sodium and water back into the bloodstream, which ultimately raises blood volume.

In addition to the RAAS, the kidneys also respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also referred to as vasopressin. When blood volume is low or the body is dehydrated, the pituitary gland secretes ADH. This hormone instructs the kidneys to reabsorb additional water, which reduces urine output and contributes to an increase in blood volume.

Moreover, the kidneys help regulate blood volume through the action of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). When blood volume is elevated, the heart releases ANP, which signals the kidneys to excrete more sodium and water in urine, thereby lowering blood volume.

In conclusion, the kidneys maintain blood volume by adjusting the reabsorption of water and sodium into the bloodstream or by excreting them in urine. This regulation is primarily mediated by the RAAS, ADH, and ANP systems. Together, these mechanisms ensure that blood volume remains within a healthy range, supporting the body's overall homeostasis.
