The primary threats to biodiversity include habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, climate change, and the introduction of invasive species.

**Habitat Destruction**  
Habitat destruction ranks among the most critical threats to biodiversity. This phenomenon is largely driven by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. When habitats are obliterated, the species that depend on them for survival are displaced, resulting in a decline in biodiversity. A notable example is the Amazon rainforest, which is home to approximately $400$ billion individual trees representing about $16,000$ different species. The rapid deforestation of this vital ecosystem for timber, agriculture, and urban development is leading to a substantial loss of biodiversity.

**Overexploitation**  
Another significant threat is overexploitation, which refers to the unsustainable hunting, fishing, or harvesting of specific species, potentially leading to their decline or extinction. For instance, overfishing has caused the populations of numerous fish species worldwide to dwindle. Similarly, the illegal wildlife trade endangers many species, including the African elephant and the pangolin, pushing them closer to extinction.

**Pollution**  
Pollution poses a serious risk to biodiversity as well. This encompasses air, water, and soil pollution, all of which can harm or kill individual organisms, disrupt species composition, and interfere with ecosystem functions. For example, oil spills can have catastrophic effects on marine biodiversity, while air pollution can result in acid rain, which damages forests and freshwater ecosystems.

**Climate Change**  
Climate change, predominantly driven by human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, represents another major threat. Alterations in temperature and precipitation patterns can modify habitats and influence the distribution and behavior of various species. Coral reefs, some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of ocean warming and acidification.

**Invasive Species**  
The introduction of invasive species also poses a significant threat to biodiversity. These species, introduced either intentionally or inadvertently to a new environment, can outcompete native species for resources, alter habitats, and spread diseases. A prime example is the brown tree snake, which was introduced to Guam and has led to the extinction of several bird species on the island.

In conclusion, human activities significantly threaten biodiversity. It is vital to understand and address these threats to preserve the planet's biodiversity for future generations.
