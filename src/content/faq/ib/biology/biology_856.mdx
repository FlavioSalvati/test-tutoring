During DNA replication, the two strands of the DNA double helix are oriented in antiparallel directions. One strand runs from the $5'$ (five prime) end to the $3'$ (three prime) end, while the other strand runs in the opposite direction, from $3'$ to $5'$. This antiparallel orientation is essential for the replication process.

The enzyme responsible for adding new nucleotides to the growing DNA strand during replication is DNA polymerase. Importantly, DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the $3'$ end of a DNA strand, which dictates that replication can only proceed in the $5'$ to $3'$ direction. For the strand oriented from $5'$ to $3'$, known as the leading strand, replication occurs continuously in the same direction as the unwinding double helix.

In contrast, the other strand, which runs from $3'$ to $5'$, is referred to as the lagging strand. Replication of the lagging strand is more complex because DNA polymerase must work in the opposite direction of the unwinding DNA. To accommodate this, replication occurs in short segments called Okazaki fragments. These fragments are later joined together by the enzyme DNA ligase, resulting in a continuous strand.

The antiparallel orientation of the DNA strands and the directionality of DNA polymerase's activity are fundamental to the process of DNA replication. These features ensure that genetic information is accurately copied and transmitted to the next generation of cells. A thorough understanding of these concepts is crucial for appreciating the complexity of DNA replication and the molecular mechanisms that sustain life.
