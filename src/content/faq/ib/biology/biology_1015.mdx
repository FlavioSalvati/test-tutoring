The melting of permafrost results in the release of methane through the thawing of organic matter, which subsequently decomposes and emits methane gas.

Permafrost is defined as a layer of soil, rock, or sediment that remains frozen for more than two consecutive years. It spans approximately 24% of the land area in the Northern Hemisphere. This frozen ground contains substantial amounts of organic carbon and other nutrients, preserved under cold conditions. As temperatures rise and permafrost thaws, the organic matter within begins to decompose, a process that is facilitated by microorganisms that become active once the permafrost melts.

The decomposition of this organic matter by microorganisms produces greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and methane ($\text{CH}_4$). Methane is particularly concerning due to its potency as a greenhouse gas; it has a global warming potential that is 25 times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Consequently, the release of methane from thawing permafrost represents a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to global warming.

The process through which methane is released from thawing permafrost is complex and involves several key steps. Initially, the organic matter in the permafrost thaws, making it available for decomposition. Subsequently, microorganisms break down this organic matter through a process known as anaerobic decomposition, which occurs in the absence of oxygen. This process generates methane as a by-product. Finally, the methane is released into the atmosphere when the soil thaws sufficiently to allow the gas to escape.

The rate at which methane is emitted from thawing permafrost is influenced by various factors, including temperature, the quantity and type of organic matter present, and the specific types of microorganisms involved. Higher temperatures and greater amounts of organic matter can lead to increased rates of methane release. Additionally, certain microorganisms are more efficient at producing methane than others.

In summary, the thawing of permafrost due to rising global temperatures can result in the significant release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. This phenomenon is a major concern for climate scientists, as it could accelerate global warming and trigger further environmental changes.
