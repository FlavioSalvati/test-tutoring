Water's surface tension is a remarkable property that enables certain organisms to float, move, and thrive on its surface.

Surface tension refers to the ability of a liquid to resist external forces, primarily due to cohesive forces among its molecules. In water, the surface tension is notably high because of the hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules. This bonding creates a 'skin' on the water's surface, which some organisms can utilize for their survival.

For instance, many insects, such as water striders, can walk on water thanks to this surface tension. Their weight is insufficient to break the hydrogen bonds holding the water molecules together, allowing them to glide across the surface without sinking. This capability is further enhanced by their hydrophobic (water-repelling) legs, which prevent them from becoming wet and consequently increasing their weight.

Additionally, certain spiders and some species of lizards are also capable of running across water. These creatures have evolved to exploit the surface tension of water in their habitats, helping them evade predators or reach food sources.

Aquatic plants also gain advantages from water's surface tension. Many species possess leaves that float on the surface, supported by the high surface tension. This adaptation allows the plant to capture sunlight for photosynthesis while its roots remain submerged for nutrient absorption.

Moreover, various small organisms, collectively referred to as neuston, inhabit the air-water interface. These organisms are small enough that the surface tension of water supports them against the force of gravity. Examples include different types of bacteria, algae, protozoa, and even small animals like certain insects and spiders.

In summary, water's surface tension fosters a unique environment that sustains a diverse array of life forms. From insects skimming across a pond to plants floating gracefully on a lake, the elevated surface tension of water plays a crucial role in their survival and behavior.
