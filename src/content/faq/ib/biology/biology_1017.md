Human agriculture significantly affects the carbon cycle by releasing carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$) through practices such as deforestation and soil degradation.

Agriculture plays a vital role in the carbon cycle, a fundamental process for sustaining life on Earth. The carbon cycle refers to the movement of carbon in various forms among the atmosphere, oceans, biosphere, and geosphere. Human agricultural activities have a profound influence on this cycle, primarily through the emission of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas.

A key contributor to the disruption of the carbon cycle is deforestation for agricultural expansion. Trees absorb CO$_{2}$ from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, effectively storing carbon in their biomass. When forests are cleared for farming, the carbon that was stored is released back into the atmosphere as CO$_{2}$, which intensifies global warming. Moreover, the removal of trees reduces the number of 'carbon sinks' available to absorb atmospheric CO$_{2}$, further worsening the situation.

Soil degradation is another critical way in which agriculture impacts the carbon cycle. Healthy soils are rich in organic matter, a significant reservoir of carbon. Conventional agricultural practices—such as overgrazing, excessive tillage, and monoculture—can lead to soil degradation, resulting in the release of stored carbon as CO$_{2}$. Additionally, the application of synthetic fertilizers can cause emissions of nitrous oxide (N$_{2}$O), another potent greenhouse gas.

Furthermore, agriculture affects the carbon cycle through the consumption of fossil fuels. Farm machinery, the production of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and the transportation of agricultural products all rely on fossil fuels, the combustion of which generates CO$_{2}$. Additionally, the cultivation of certain agricultural products, such as rice and cattle, results in the emission of methane (CH₄), a greenhouse gas that is significantly more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO$_{2}$.

In summary, human agriculture has a substantial impact on the carbon cycle. It contributes to the release of greenhouse gases, primarily CO$_{2}$, through deforestation, soil degradation, and fossil fuel use. These practices not only disrupt the carbon cycle but also contribute to climate change, emphasizing the urgent need for more sustainable agricultural practices.
