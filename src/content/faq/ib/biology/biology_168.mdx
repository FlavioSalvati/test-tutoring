Enzymes serve as biological catalysts in metabolic reactions, significantly accelerating these processes without being consumed in the reaction.

These catalysts enhance the speed of chemical reactions within the body by reducing the activation energy required for the reactions to occur. The activation energy is defined as the minimum amount of energy necessary for reactants to transform into products in a chemical reaction. By lowering this energy threshold, enzymes facilitate the occurrence of reactions, consequently increasing their rates.

Structurally, enzymes are proteins designed with specific shapes that allow them to interact with particular molecules known as substrates. The region of the enzyme where the substrate binds is referred to as the active site. The relationship between the active site and the substrate resembles that of a lock and key, ensuring that the enzyme can efficiently catalyze its designated reaction.

When a substrate binds to the active site of an enzyme, it forms a temporary intermediate known as an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex reduces the activation energy of the reaction by orienting the substrate in a manner that promotes the likelihood of the reaction occurring. Additionally, the enzyme may exert stress on the substrate's bonds, facilitating their breakage and the formation of new bonds. After the reaction occurs, the products are released, and the enzyme is available to catalyze subsequent reactions.

Enzymes are essential for life, enabling metabolic reactions to take place at rates sufficient to sustain biological functions. In the absence of enzymes, these reactions would occur too slowly, or not at all, making life as we know it impossible. Enzymes participate in a diverse array of processes, including digestion and DNA replication. Their activity can be influenced by several factors, such as temperature, pH levels, and the presence of inhibitors or activators.
