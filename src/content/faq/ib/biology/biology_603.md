Cytokinesis during meiosis I results in two haploid cells, while during meiosis II, it produces four haploid cells.

Cytokinesis is the process that occurs after nuclear division in cell replication, leading to the physical separation of the daughter cells. In meiosis, this process takes place twice: once at the conclusion of meiosis I and again at the end of meiosis II. However, the outcomes of cytokinesis in these two phases differ due to the unique characteristics of meiosis.

During meiosis I, the cell experiences a reduction division in which homologous chromosomes are separated. This division leads to the formation of two haploid cells, each containing a single set of chromosomes. The subsequent cytokinesis is responsible for the physical separation of these two new cells. This step is critical, as it reduces the chromosome number by half, a fundamental aspect of sexual reproduction that contributes to genetic diversity.

In contrast, meiosis II resembles a typical mitotic division. Here, the sister chromatids within each haploid cell produced during meiosis I are separated. However, the total chromosome number remains unchanged. The cytokinesis that follows meiosis II results in four haploid cells, each containing a single set of unreplicated chromosomes. These cells can subsequently develop into gametes, which are essential for sexual reproduction.

It is important to recognize that, while the process of cytokinesis itself does not vary significantly between meiosis I and meiosis II, the context and outcomes of these processes do. In meiosis I, cytokinesis is part of a reduction division that halves the chromosome number, whereas, in meiosis II, it is part of an equational division that maintains the chromosome number. This distinction is crucial for understanding the role of meiosis in sexual reproduction and the promotion of genetic diversity.
