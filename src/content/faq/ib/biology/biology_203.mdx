RNA splicing is an essential process that occurs during the transcription of a gene, where non-coding sequences known as introns are removed, and coding sequences called exons are joined together to create a mature mRNA molecule.

The splicing process is executed by a complex of proteins and RNA molecules referred to as the spliceosome. It begins when the RNA polymerase II enzyme transcribes a gene into a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) molecule. This pre-mRNA contains both exons, which are sequences that will be translated into proteins, and introns, which are non-coding sequences that will not be translated. The presence of introns and exons in pre-mRNA is a defining characteristic of eukaryotic genes.

The spliceosome recognizes specific sequences at the boundaries of each intron. These sequences indicate where the intron starts and ends. The spliceosome then cleaves the pre-mRNA at these designated points, effectively removing the intron. The remaining exons are subsequently ligated together to form a mature mRNA molecule, which is then prepared for translation into a protein.

RNA splicing is a highly regulated and precise mechanism. Errors during splicing can result in the production of faulty proteins, potentially leading to severe consequences for the cell. Notably, many genetic disorders stem from mutations that disrupt the splicing process.

Moreover, RNA splicing enables a single gene to generate multiple distinct proteins. This versatility arises because different combinations of exons can be connected during splicing, resulting in various mRNA molecules. This phenomenon, known as alternative splicing, significantly enhances the diversity of proteins that a cell can produce.

In summary, RNA splicing is a critical process that occurs during gene transcription. It entails the removal of introns and the assembly of exons to create a mature mRNA molecule. This intricate process, mediated by the spliceosome, is highly regulated to ensure the accurate production of proteins.
