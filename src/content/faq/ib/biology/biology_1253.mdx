Sex-linked inheritance and autosomal inheritance are two distinct forms of genetic transmission, differentiated primarily by the chromosomal location of the involved genes. 

In sex-linked inheritance, the genes are situated on the sex chromosomes, specifically the X and Y chromosomes in humans. Conversely, autosomal inheritance pertains to genes located on the autosomes, which are the non-sex chromosomes.

Humans possess a total of 23 pairs of chromosomes: 22 pairs are autosomes, while one pair consists of the sex chromosomes. Males typically have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), whereas females have two X chromosomes (XX). This disparity in sex chromosomes results in unique inheritance patterns for sex-linked traits. For example, a male inherits his X chromosome from his mother and his Y chromosome from his father. Consequently, if a trait is X-linked, the male will express the trait if he inherits a recessive allele from his mother, as he has only one copy of the gene on the X chromosome. In contrast, females, having two X chromosomes, must inherit two copies of the recessive allele to express the trait.

On the other hand, autosomal inheritance is independent of the individualâ€™s sex. Both males and females carry two copies of each autosome, which means they possess two copies of each autosomal gene. Autosomal traits adhere to Mendelian inheritance principles, whereby dominant alleles can mask the expression of recessive alleles. Therefore, an individual will express an autosomal recessive trait only if they inherit two copies of the recessive allele, regardless of their sex.

In conclusion, the fundamental distinction between sex-linked and autosomal inheritance lies in the location of the genes involved. This difference results in unique inheritance patterns for each type, with sex-linked traits influenced by the individual's sex and autosomal traits governed by Mendelian inheritance principles.
