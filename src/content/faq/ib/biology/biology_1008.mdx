The survival of a species within an ecosystem is influenced by multiple factors, including the availability of resources, competition, predation, and environmental changes.

The availability of resources is a critical factor affecting species survival. Essential resources encompass food, water, shelter, and space. When these resources become scarce, they can limit the population size of a species and potentially lead to extinction. For instance, if a particular plant species depends on a specific nutrient that is in limited supply, the population of that plant may decline over time. Similarly, if a predator species lacks sufficient prey, its population may also face a decline.

Competition is another significant factor influencing species survival. Species often compete for the same resources, and this competition can be categorized as interspecific (between different species) or intraspecific (within the same species). For example, lions and hyenas compete for the same prey, illustrating interspecific competition. Conversely, two male birds of the same species may compete for mates, which exemplifies intraspecific competition. Species that are more effective competitors are likely to have a greater chance of survival.

Predation plays an essential role in shaping species survival as well. Predators can regulate the population sizes of their prey. An increase in the number of predators can lead to a decrease in the prey population. However, if the prey population decreases excessively, it can also negatively impact the predator population, as they may not have enough food to sustain themselves. This delicate balance between predators and prey is referred to as the predator-prey relationship.

Lastly, environmental changes can significantly affect a speciesâ€™ survival. These changes can be natural, such as climate change, or human-induced, such as habitat destruction. Species that are unable to adapt to these shifts may face extinction. For example, polar bears are threatened by global warming due to the melting of the ice they rely on for hunting. Similarly, deforestation can lead to the extinction of species that depend on forest habitats.

In conclusion, the survival of a species within an ecosystem is a complex interplay of various factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for protecting biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems.
