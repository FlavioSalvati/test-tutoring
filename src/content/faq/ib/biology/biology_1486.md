Tranquilisers, commonly referred to as depressants, are medications that slow down the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in decreased anxiety, sedation, and altered behaviour. 

These drugs primarily function by enhancing the activity of a neurotransmitter known as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA serves as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning it effectively diminishes the activity of neurons. When GABA binds to its receptors on a neuron, it opens channels that allow negatively charged chloride ions to flow into the cell. This influx of chloride ions causes the interior of the neuron to become more negatively charged, which makes it more challenging for the neuron to generate an action potential. Consequently, this process leads to a reduction in neural communication.

As neural communication decreases, individuals experience lowered anxiety levels and sedation. This occurs because tranquilisers diminish the activity in brain regions responsible for arousal and stimulation. Therefore, a person taking a tranquiliser may feel more relaxed, calm, and less anxious. These effects can also manifest as behavioural changes, including decreased aggression and increased sociability.

However, the impact of tranquilisers extends beyond merely alleviating anxiety and inducing sedation. These substances can also impair cognitive and motor functions. This impairment arises because tranquilisers affect additional areas of the brain involved in essential processes such as thinking, learning, memory, and coordination. For instance, benzodiazepines, a specific class of tranquilisers, may lead to symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness, and unsteadiness.

Furthermore, prolonged use of tranquilisers can result in physical dependence, which may lead to withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation. This occurs because the brain adapts to the presence of the drug and may struggle to function normally without it. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia, which are contrary to the calming effects of the medication.

In summary, tranquilisers modulate neural communication by enhancing the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, thereby reducing neuronal activity. This pharmacological action contributes to decreased anxiety, sedation, and behavioural changes. However, it is important to note that these drugs can also impair cognitive and motor functions and may lead to physical dependence with long-term use.
