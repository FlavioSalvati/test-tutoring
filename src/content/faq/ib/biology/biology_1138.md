Cilia and flagella are both hair-like structures found in cells, but they exhibit distinct differences in size, number, and function.

**Cilia** are small, numerous hair-like projections that cover the surface of all mammalian cells. They play a vital role in locomotion and are essential for moving fluids across the surface of cells. Typically, cilia are shorter than flagella and are found in large quantities on a single cell. For example, the epithelial cells lining our respiratory tract are equipped with cilia that move in coordinated waves to expel mucus and trapped particles, effectively clearing our lungs.

In contrast, **flagella** are longer, whip-like structures that extend from the cell body. They are usually present in fewer numbers, often just one or two per cell. Flagella are primarily responsible for the movement of the entire cell, as seen in sperm cells in animals. They exhibit a wave-like motion that propels the cell forward. In certain organisms, such as bacteria, flagella also function as sensory organelles, responding to changes in temperature and the chemical composition of their surroundings.

Both cilia and flagella share a common structural arrangement known as the "$9+2$" structure. This structure consists of a ring of nine double microtubules surrounding a central pair of single microtubules. Despite this shared structural feature, the movement patterns of cilia and flagella differ significantly. Cilia move in a coordinated back-and-forth motion, while flagella exhibit a wave-like, undulating motion.

When it comes to cell signaling, cilia play a significant role. They are involved in processes such as mechanosensation, chemosensation, and thermosensation. In contrast, flagella are less engaged in cell signaling and focus primarily on facilitating cell movement.

In summary, while cilia and flagella share a similar basic structure, they differ markedly in size, number, function, and movement. Cilia are smaller, more numerous, and are involved in moving fluids across the cell's surface as well as in cell signaling. Flagella, on the other hand, are longer, fewer in number, and primarily serve to propel the cell through its environment.
