Detritivores are essential contributors to nutrient cycling, as they decompose dead organic material and return vital nutrients to the ecosystem.

These organisms, which include earthworms, beetles, certain fungi, and bacteria, play a pivotal role in the nutrient cycling process. They consume detritus—composed of dead plant and animal matter—and facilitate the breakdown of complex organic molecules into simpler forms through a process known as decomposition.

Decomposition is crucial for the nutrient cycle. When plants and animals perish, they leave behind organic material that is rich in nutrients but locked within complex molecules, making them difficult for other organisms to utilize. Detritivores address this issue by ingesting detritus, during which their digestive systems convert complex molecules into simpler forms, such as nitrates, phosphates, and other mineral salts. These simpler compounds can then be readily absorbed by plants through their roots, effectively reintegrating essential nutrients back into the ecosystem.

In addition to aiding in decomposition, the waste products of detritivores, commonly referred to as "castings," are nutrient-rich and serve as excellent natural fertilizers. This not only enhances soil fertility but also promotes plant growth. Thus, detritivores play a dual role: they recycle nutrients and bolster the overall productivity of ecosystems.

Moreover, detritivores contribute to soil health through a process known as bioturbation, which involves the physical mixing of soil. This mixing helps to evenly distribute nutrients throughout the soil, ensuring that they are accessible to a wide range of plants. Bioturbation also improves soil structure, making it more porous and better able to retain water, thereby further supporting plant growth.

In summary, detritivores are crucial to nutrient cycling. By decomposing dead organic material and facilitating the return of essential nutrients to the ecosystem, they help sustain the health and productivity of ecological systems.
