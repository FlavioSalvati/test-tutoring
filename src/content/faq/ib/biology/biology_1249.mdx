Codominance in inheritance patterns allows both alleles to express their traits simultaneously in a heterozygous organism.

In genetics, codominance significantly influences the phenotypic expression of an organism's traits. This type of dominance occurs when both alleles of a gene pair in a heterozygote are fully expressed. Consequently, the phenotype does not exhibit a clear dominant or recessive trait; instead, it reflects a combination of both alleles. This results in offspring displaying phenotypes that are distinctly different from either parent.

A classic illustration of codominance is found in the ABO blood group system in humans. This system includes three alleles: $I_A$, $I_B$, and $i$. The alleles $I_A$ and $I_B$ are codominant. This means that if an individual inherits the $I_A$ allele from one parent and the $I_B$ allele from the other, they will have type AB blood. In this case, both the A and B phenotypes are expressed equally, resulting in a blood type that exemplifies a combination of both.

Another example of codominance can be observed in certain breeds of cattle. For instance, when a cow with a red coat color mates with a cow that has a white coat color, their offspring may exhibit a roan coat color. The roan coat consists of a mixture of red and white hairs, which arises from the codominance of the red and white coat color alleles.

In summary, codominance enriches the complexity of inheritance patterns by enabling the expression of multiple alleles in an organism's phenotype. This leads to a broader variety of phenotypic outcomes, which contributes to the diversity and complexity of life. Understanding codominance is essential for students studying biology, as it sheds light on the intricate mechanisms that underpin genetic diversity and evolution.
