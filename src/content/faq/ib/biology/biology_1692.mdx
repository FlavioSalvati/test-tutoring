Post-transcriptional modification is the process where primary RNA transcripts are altered to become mature RNA molecules.

In more detail, post-transcriptional modification is a crucial step in gene expression that occurs after transcription, where the primary RNA transcript, also known as pre-mRNA in eukaryotes, undergoes specific alterations to become mature RNA. This process is essential for the correct functioning of genes and the production of proteins.

The first step in post-transcriptional modification is the addition of a 5' cap to the pre-mRNA molecule. This cap is a modified guanine nucleotide and it protects the RNA from degradation, assists in ribosome binding during translation, and is necessary for the RNA to exit the nucleus.

The next step is the addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end of the pre-mRNA. This tail, made up of a string of adenine nucleotides, also protects the RNA molecule from degradation and aids in its export from the nucleus.

The most complex part of post-transcriptional modification is RNA splicing. During splicing, introns, or non-coding regions of the RNA, are removed, and exons, or coding regions, are joined together. This process is carried out by a complex of proteins and RNA molecules known as the spliceosome. Splicing not only removes non-coding sequences but also allows for alternative splicing, where different combinations of exons are joined together to produce different proteins from the same gene.

In addition to these modifications, some RNA molecules undergo further changes such as RNA editing, where individual nucleotides are altered, and the addition of other chemical groups to specific nucleotides.

All these modifications are crucial for the correct functioning of genes. They ensure that the RNA molecule is stable, can be correctly translated into protein, and can produce different proteins from the same gene, increasing the diversity of proteins that a cell can produce. Without post-transcriptional modification, the process of gene expression would not be as flexible or as efficient.
