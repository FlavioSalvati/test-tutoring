A chromosome is a long, thread-like structure composed of DNA and proteins that carries genetic information in the form of genes.

Chromosomes are located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and serve as the primary carriers of genetic information. They consist of a complex of DNA and proteins, predominantly histones, which aid in packaging the DNA into a compact and dense form. This organization is essential because DNA molecules are remarkably long and must be condensed to fit within the confines of the cell nucleus.

The DNA within a chromosome is arranged in a linear sequence of base pairs, which together form the genetic code. This code is divided into segments known as genes, each of which contains the instructions for producing a specific protein or a set of proteins. These proteins perform a variety of functions within the cell, ranging from providing structural support to catalyzing biochemical reactions.

The structure of a chromosome undergoes changes throughout the cell cycle. During interphase, chromosomes are loosely packed and not visible under a light microscope. However, during cell division, they condense into a more compact form, allowing them to be seen as distinct entities. This condensed structure consists of two identical halves, referred to as sister chromatids, which are connected at a region known as the centromere.

The number of chromosomes varies across different organisms. For instance, humans possess $46$ chromosomes, organized into $23$ pairs. One of these pairs, the sex chromosomes, determines an individual's sex, while the remaining $22$ pairs, called autosomes, carry the rest of the genetic information.

In summary, chromosomes are intricate structures that play a vital role in the storage and transmission of genetic information. Their organization facilitates the efficient packaging of DNA within the cell nucleus and ensures the accurate distribution of genetic material during cell division.
