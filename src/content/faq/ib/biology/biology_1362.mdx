Phytoplankton and zooplankton are essential components of carbon cycling in marine ecosystems, primarily through the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, and the biological pump.

Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that inhabit the upper layers of the ocean and serve as the primary producers in the marine food web. They utilize sunlight to perform photosynthesis, a process that transforms carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is crucial for the carbon cycle, as it reduces the concentration of carbon dioxide—a greenhouse gas—in the atmosphere and converts it into organic matter. The organic carbon produced is subsequently transferred through the food web as phytoplankton are consumed by various marine organisms, including zooplankton.

Zooplankton, which are tiny animals that also reside in the ocean, feed on phytoplankton and smaller zooplankton. By consuming these organisms, zooplankton incorporate the carbon stored in their food into their own bodies. During respiration, zooplankton release some of this carbon back into the water as carbon dioxide. Nonetheless, a significant portion of the carbon remains within their bodies and is passed up the food chain when they are consumed by larger marine animals.

Both phytoplankton and zooplankton are integral to the biological pump—a process that facilitates the transport of carbon from the surface ocean to the depths of the ocean. When these organisms die, their bodies sink towards the ocean floor, carrying the carbon they contain with them. This mechanism effectively sequesters carbon in the deep ocean for periods ranging from hundreds to thousands of years, thereby preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change.

Additionally, certain species of zooplankton engage in a behavior known as diel vertical migration, where they migrate vertically within the water column on a daily cycle. They feed on carbon-rich food at the surface during the night and excrete waste at greater depths during the day. This behavior further enhances the transport of carbon to the deep ocean.

In summary, phytoplankton and zooplankton are vital contributors to the carbon cycle. Through the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, and the biological pump, they play a significant role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thus influencing Earth's climate.
