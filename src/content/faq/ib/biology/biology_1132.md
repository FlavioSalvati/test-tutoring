Facilitated diffusion is a process through which specific molecules traverse the cell membrane with the assistance of protein channels or carrier proteins.

This form of passive transport enables substances to cross cell membranes without the expenditure of energy. Instead, it relies on the concentration gradient, allowing molecules to move from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration.

Facilitated diffusion involves two primary types of transport proteins: channel proteins and carrier proteins. 

- **Channel Proteins:** These proteins create pores or channels in the cell membrane, facilitating the passage of particular molecules or ions. They exhibit selectivity, permitting only certain types of molecules to pass through. For instance, aquaporins are a class of channel proteins that specifically facilitate the movement of water molecules across the cell membrane.

- **Carrier Proteins:** Unlike channel proteins, carrier proteins bind to the specific molecule that requires transport. Once the molecule attaches to the carrier protein, it induces a conformational change in the protein's structure, allowing the molecule to be released on the opposite side of the membrane. This mechanism is crucial for transporting glucose and amino acids into cells.

It is important to recognize that facilitated diffusion is a regulated process. The cell can modulate the number of transport proteins present in the membrane, thereby controlling the rate of diffusion. This adaptability allows the cell to respond effectively to environmental changes and maintain homeostasis.

In summary, facilitated diffusion is a vital mechanism that enables cells to transport specific molecules across the cell membrane. It relies on protein channels or carrier proteins and is driven by the concentration gradient, facilitating the movement of substances from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. This process is essential for cellular survival and function, enabling the uptake of necessary nutrients and the removal of waste products.
