The cytoskeleton is an intricate network of protein filaments that spans the entire cell, offering structural support, defining the cell's shape, and facilitating movement. It is primarily composed of three distinct types of protein filaments: microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments.

**Microtubules** are the largest of these filament types, measuring approximately $25$ nanometers in diameter. They are formed from tubulin, a globular protein that polymerizes to create long, hollow tubes. Microtubules are dynamic structures capable of rapid assembly and disassembly. They are essential for maintaining cell shape, facilitating cell division, and enabling intracellular transport. For example, during mitosis, microtubules assemble into spindle fibers that help segregate chromosomes.

**Microfilaments**, also referred to as actin filaments, are the thinnest filaments, with a diameter of about $7$ nanometers. These filaments are composed of actin, another globular protein that polymerizes to form long, slender fibers. Microfilaments play a critical role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell division, and cell motility. Additionally, they contribute to the mechanical properties of the cell, allowing it to change shape and move effectively.

**Intermediate filaments** fall in size between microtubules and microfilaments, with a diameter of approximately $10$ nanometers. They are made up of a diverse range of proteins that vary depending on the cell type and the specific functions of the filament. Unlike microtubules and microfilaments, intermediate filaments are not directly involved in cell movement. Instead, they provide mechanical strength to cells and tissues, enabling them to endure physical stress.

In summary, the cytoskeleton is a sophisticated network of protein filaments that endows the cell with structure, shape, and movement capabilities. Each component—microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments—possesses unique properties and functions that contribute to the overall functionality of the cell.
