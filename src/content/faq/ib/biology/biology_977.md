Food chains and food webs serve as essential ecological models that illustrate the flow of energy and nutrients among organisms within an ecosystem.

A food chain is a linear sequence that demonstrates how energy and nutrients are transferred through an ecosystem. It begins with a producer, typically a green plant or algae, which synthesizes its own food via photosynthesis. This producer is then consumed by a primary consumer, usually a herbivore. Subsequently, the primary consumer is preyed upon by a secondary consumer, often a carnivore, and this pattern continues in a hierarchical manner. Each stage in this transfer of energy is referred to as a trophic level. According to the 10% rule, approximately $10\%$ of the energy is passed on to the next level, with the remaining energy dissipated as heat.

Despite their utility, food chains are overly simplistic and fail to capture the intricate feeding relationships found in nature. This is where food webs provide a more comprehensive view. A food web is a complex network of interconnected food chains that illustrates the various pathways through which energy and nutrients can flow. For example, a rabbit may be consumed by a fox in one food chain, while in another, it could fall prey to a hawk.

Food webs also elucidate the concept of trophic levels, but they reveal that an organism can occupy different trophic levels across various food chains within the web. For instance, a bird might function as a secondary consumer in one food chain and as a tertiary consumer in another. This complexity is vital for maintaining the balance of ecosystems, as it allows for flexibility in response to changes in species populations or the extinction of certain species.

Both food chains and food webs are valuable tools in the field of ecology. They enhance our understanding of the complex interrelationships among different species and the flow of energy and nutrients within ecosystems. Additionally, they underscore the interdependence of organisms and the potential consequences of fluctuations in population sizes, species extinctions, or the introduction of new species.
