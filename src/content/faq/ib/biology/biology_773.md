Respiratory gases are transported in the blood primarily through their binding to hemoglobin and their dissolution in plasma.

The transportation of respiratory gases, namely oxygen and carbon dioxide, occurs through two main mechanisms. Oxygen is predominantly carried in the blood by binding to a protein called hemoglobin, which is located in red blood cells. When oxygen enters the bloodstream, it binds to the iron within hemoglobin, forming a complex known as oxyhemoglobin. This binding process takes place in the lungs, where the concentration of oxygen is elevated. The oxygen-rich blood is then circulated to the body's tissues, where the concentration of oxygen is comparatively lower. In these tissues, the oxygen dissociates from hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells.

Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of cellular respiration, is transported in the blood through a slightly different mechanism. A small fraction of carbon dioxide can bind to hemoglobin; however, the majority of it is carried in the plasma, the liquid component of blood. Inside red blood cells, carbon dioxide undergoes a transformation into bicarbonate ions ($\text{HCO}_3^-$) and hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$), catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. The bicarbonate ions then diffuse out of the red blood cells and into the plasma. This conversion is reversible, allowing for the bicarbonate ions to be transformed back into carbon dioxide when blood reaches the lungs. The carbon dioxide is subsequently exhaled.

In addition to these primary methods, a small quantity of both oxygen and carbon dioxide can dissolve directly into the plasma. However, this is a less efficient means of transport because these gases have low solubility in water. The binding of gases to hemoglobin, along with their conversion into other forms in plasma, significantly enhances the volume of gas that can be transported in the blood compared to what would be possible through dissolution alone.

In summary, the transport of respiratory gases in the blood is a multifaceted process involving hemoglobin binding, conversion into other chemical forms, and dissolution in plasma. These mechanisms enable the body to efficiently deliver oxygen to its tissues while effectively removing carbon dioxide waste.
