Dominant alleles express their traits even in the presence of just one copy, whereas recessive alleles require two copies to manifest their traits.

In genetics, alleles are distinct forms of the same gene. Each individual inherits two alleles for every gene, one from each parent. These alleles can be classified as either dominant or recessive. Dominant alleles are characterized by their ability to express traits or characteristics even when only one copy is present in the pair. Consequently, if an individual receives a dominant allele from either parent, the trait associated with that allele will be exhibited.

Conversely, recessive alleles necessitate two copies for their traits to be expressed. This means that the trait linked to a recessive allele will only be shown if the individual inherits the same recessive allele from both parents. If an individual acquires one dominant allele and one recessive allele, the dominant trait will prevail, and the individual will be considered a carrier of the recessive trait.

These concepts of dominant and recessive alleles form a foundational principle in Mendelian genetics, named after Gregor Mendel, who is often regarded as the father of modern genetics. Mendel's experiments with pea plants in the mid-19th century led to the establishment of these principles. He discovered that certain traits, such as flower color and seed shape, could appear in the offspring even if they were not present in the parents, giving rise to the understanding of dominant and recessive traits.

In terms of notation, dominant alleles are conventionally represented by uppercase letters, while recessive alleles are denoted by lowercase letters. For example, if we use $A$ to represent a dominant allele and $a$ to signify a recessive allele, an individual with genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$ will express the dominant trait, while only an individual with the genotype $aa$ will exhibit the recessive trait.

It is essential to understand that being dominant does not imply that an allele is superior, more powerful, or more prevalent. The term "dominant" merely describes the manner in which the trait associated with the allele is expressed. Both dominant and recessive alleles are vital for genetic diversity and play significant roles in the process of evolution.
