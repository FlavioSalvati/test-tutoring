Biotechnology plays a pivotal role in the production of vitamins and amino acids by utilizing genetically modified microorganisms.

Specifically, genetic engineering enables the modification of microorganisms—such as bacteria and yeast—to produce essential nutrients like vitamins and amino acids. This process involves introducing specific genes into the DNA of these microorganisms, which directs them to synthesize the desired compounds.

For example, the production of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is frequently accomplished using genetically modified strains of the bacterium $Bacillus subtilis$. These engineered bacteria are designed to overproduce the enzymes required for riboflavin biosynthesis. Once the bacteria generate the vitamin, it is extracted and purified for use in dietary supplements and fortified foods.

Similarly, the production of amino acids, such as lysine and tryptophan, also employs genetically modified bacteria. These bacteria are engineered to enhance the production of these amino acids, which are subsequently harvested for various applications, including dietary supplements and animal feed. A notable example is the bacterium $Corynebacterium glutamicum$, which is commonly used in the biotechnological production of lysine.

The application of biotechnology in the production of vitamins and amino acids offers several advantages. It facilitates large-scale production that is both controlled and predictable. Additionally, this approach can be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly compared to traditional production methods, such as chemical synthesis or extraction from natural sources.

However, the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in this context is not without controversy. There are concerns regarding potential risks associated with GMOs, including unintended effects on human health and the environment. As a result, the application of biotechnology in the production of vitamins and amino acids is subject to stringent regulation and oversight to ensure safety and efficacy.
