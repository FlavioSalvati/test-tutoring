Taste and smell perception are facilitated by specialized sensory cells located in the taste buds and the olfactory epithelium, respectively.

Taste perception, also known as gustation, begins when food or drink enters the mouth. The molecules in the food or drink interact with saliva and subsequently reach the taste buds, which are situated on the tongue and other areas of the mouth. Each taste bud comprises approximately $50$ to $100$ specialized sensory cells, which respond to various types of molecules. These sensory cells possess receptors that bind to these molecules, triggering an electrical signal. This signal is then relayed to the brain via the gustatory nerves. The brain interprets these signals as distinct tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (savory).

Similarly, smell perception, or olfaction, operates in a comparable manner. When we inhale, odour molecules enter the nose and reach the olfactory epithelium, a specialized tissue located at the top of the nasal cavity. This tissue contains millions of olfactory neurons, each equipped with a specific type of receptor that can bind to particular odour molecules. Upon binding of an odour molecule to a receptor, an electrical signal is generated. This signal is transmitted to the brain through the olfactory nerve, where it is interpreted as various smells.

Interestingly, taste and smell are intricately connected. The brain integrates information from both the gustatory and olfactory systems to form the perception of flavour. This connection explains why food can taste bland when you have a cold, which impairs your sense of smell.

Moreover, both taste and smell perception can be influenced by various factors. For instance, the texture and temperature of food can affect its taste. Similarly, previous experiences and memories can shape our perception of smells. This illustrates that taste and smell are not merely straightforward sensory processes; they are complex phenomena involving multiple neural mechanisms and cognitive processes.
