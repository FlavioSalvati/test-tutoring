Demographic factors that influence population growth and regulation include birth rate, death rate, immigration, emigration, age structure, sex ratio, and population distribution.

**Birth Rate and Death Rate**  
Birth rate and death rate are the primary determinants of population growth. A high birth rate leads to an increase in population size, while a high death rate results in a decrease. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is referred to as the natural increase rate. Specifically, if the birth rate exceeds the death rate, the population will experience growth, whereas if the death rate surpasses the birth rate, the population will decline.

**Immigration and Emigration**  
Immigration and emigration significantly affect population dynamics as well. Immigration refers to the movement of individuals into a population, while emigration pertains to the movement of individuals out of it. When the rate of immigration is greater than the rate of emigration, the population will grow; conversely, if emigration outpaces immigration, the population will shrink.

**Age Structure**  
The age structure of a population also plays a crucial role in its growth and regulation. Age structure indicates the distribution of individuals across various age groups within a population. A population with a high proportion of young individuals is likely to have a greater potential for future growth, as these individuals are typically in their reproductive years. In contrast, a population with a significant number of older individuals may experience slower growth or even decline, as these individuals are past their reproductive years.

**Sex Ratio**  
Another important demographic factor is the sex ratio, which reflects the proportion of males to females within a population. A skewed sex ratio can impact population growth. For instance, if there are considerably more females than males, the reproductive potential—and thus the potential for population growth—may be limited.

**Population Distribution**  
Lastly, the distribution of individuals within a population affects its growth and regulation. If individuals are evenly distributed across a habitat, population growth may be slow, as individuals have fewer opportunities to find mates. In contrast, if individuals are clustered together, population growth may accelerate due to increased chances for mating.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, demographic factors such as birth rate, death rate, immigration, emigration, age structure, sex ratio, and population distribution significantly influence population growth and regulation. Understanding these factors is essential for predicting future population trends and making informed decisions regarding population management.
