Active transport is a crucial mechanism that allows cells to move substances across their membranes against their concentration gradients, utilizing energy in the process.

This vital process enables cells to maintain an internal environment that differs from their external surroundings. Active transport involves the movement of molecules or ions from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration. Unlike passive transport, which depends on the natural diffusion of substances, active transport requires energy, typically provided in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The mechanism of active transport is driven by specific proteins embedded within the cell membrane, known as carrier proteins or transport proteins. These proteins function as pumps; they bind to the molecules or ions that need to be transported and use energy to alter their shape, facilitating the movement of these substances across the membrane. This process is commonly referred to as primary active transport.

Active transport can be categorized into two main types: primary and secondary active transport. Primary active transport directly utilizes energy to move molecules across a membrane. A classic example of this is the sodium-potassium pump found in animal cells, which uses ATP to transport sodium ions ($Na^+$) out of the cell while bringing potassium ions ($K^+$) into the cell.

In contrast, secondary active transport relies on an electrochemical gradient, which is established by primary active transport. This gradient is used to drive the movement of other substances against their own concentration gradients. Typically, this process is coupled with the movement of another molecule that is moving down its concentration gradient, providing the necessary energy to transport the other molecule against its gradient.

In summary, active transport is an essential cellular process that employs energy to move substances against their concentration gradients, thereby allowing cells to maintain their internal environments. This process is facilitated by carrier proteins in the cell membrane and can involve either the direct use of energy (primary active transport) or the utilization of an electrochemical gradient (secondary active transport).
