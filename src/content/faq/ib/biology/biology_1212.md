The products of anaerobic respiration vary by organism: in animals, the end product is lactic acid, while in plants and yeast, it results in ethanol and carbon dioxide.

Anaerobic respiration is a form of respiration that occurs in the absence of oxygen. This metabolic process enables cells to derive energy from glucose when oxygen levels are insufficient to facilitate aerobic respiration. The specific byproducts of anaerobic respiration depend on the type of organism.

In animals, anaerobic respiration leads to the formation of lactic acid through a process known as lactic acid fermentation. This occurs in muscle cells during periods of intense exercise when oxygen supply cannot meet the energy demands. During this process, glucose is metabolized into pyruvate, which is subsequently converted into lactic acid. An accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles can lead to fatigue and soreness. Fortunately, when oxygen becomes available again, lactic acid can be reconverted into glucose in the liver.

In contrast, plants and yeast undergo anaerobic respiration, often referred to as alcoholic fermentation, which produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process is vital for the production of various alcoholic beverages and bread. Here, glucose is also broken down into pyruvate, which is then transformed into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide produced is responsible for the leavening of bread, while the ethanol contributes to the alcohol content in beverages.

It is important to note that the energy yield from anaerobic respiration is significantly lower than that from aerobic respiration. This discrepancy arises because aerobic respiration allows for the complete oxidation of glucose, releasing a substantially greater amount of energy. Nevertheless, anaerobic respiration is crucial for the survival of organisms, enabling them to continue generating energy in environments where oxygen is limited or absent. This process exemplifies the remarkable adaptability of living organisms to thrive in diverse conditions.
