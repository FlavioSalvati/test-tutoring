C4 plants utilize a distinct method of photosynthesis compared to C3 plants by employing a two-step process that effectively concentrates carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) within specialized cells.

Both C3 and C4 plants conduct photosynthesis, yet they adapt their mechanisms to suit different environmental conditions. C3 plants, which encompass the majority of plant species, rely on the Calvin cycle to transform carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) into glucose. Although this process is efficient, it has a significant drawback: during hot and dry weather, C3 plants tend to lose considerable amounts of water through their stomata, the small openings on leaves that permit $CO_2$ entry and water vapor exit.

In contrast, C4 plants have evolved an ingenious strategy to minimize water loss. They utilize a two-step process to concentrate $CO_2$ in specialized cells located deep within their leaves, thereby shielding themselves from direct exposure to air and the dehydrating effects of sunlight. This unique mechanism is referred to as C4 photosynthesis.

The first step involves capturing $CO_2$ in the mesophyll cells, which are situated in the middle layers of the leaf. In these cells, $CO_2$ combines with a three-carbon compound to form a four-carbon compound, which gives rise to the name 'C4'. This newly formed four-carbon compound is then transported to specialized cells known as bundle sheath cells, which are positioned deeper within the leaf, away from the air.

During the second step, the four-carbon compound releases its $CO_2$ within the bundle sheath cells. Because these cells are insulated from direct air exposure, they experience minimal water loss. The released $CO_2$ is subsequently utilized in the Calvin cycle to synthesize glucose, similar to the process in C3 plants.

This two-step mechanism enables C4 plants to keep their stomata closed for longer periods, thus conserving water. Additionally, it allows for more efficient capture of $CO_2$, which is particularly advantageous in hot and arid environments where $CO_2$ availability can be limited. As a result, many C4 plants, such as maize and sugarcane, flourish in conditions that would pose challenges for C3 plants.
