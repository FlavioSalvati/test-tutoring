Gender is determined by the presence of the X and Y chromosomes, where the combination of $XX$ indicates a female and $XY$ indicates a male.

In humans, gender is dictated by the 23rd pair of chromosomes, referred to as the sex chromosomes. Each individual possesses a total of $46$ chromosomes, which comprise $22$ pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. The composition of these sex chromosomes varies between males and females. Females possess two identical sex chromosomes ($XX$) and are classified as the homogametic sex, while males have two distinct sex chromosomes ($XY$) and are referred to as the heterogametic sex.

The Y chromosome contains the SRY gene, which is crucial for initiating male development. When an embryo has $XY$ chromosomes and the SRY gene is present, it will develop into a male. Conversely, in the absence of the SRY gene, as is the case with $XX$ chromosomes, the embryo will develop into a female. The SRY gene activates the formation of testes in the embryo, which subsequently produce male hormones that contribute to the development of male secondary sexual characteristics.

It is important to recognize that while the presence of the Y chromosome and the SRY gene typically leads to male development, there are notable exceptions. For instance, individuals with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) possess $XY$ chromosomes but their bodies do not respond to male hormones, resulting in the development of female secondary sexual characteristics. In contrast, individuals with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) have $XX$ chromosomes but produce an excess of male hormones, which can lead to the manifestation of male secondary sexual characteristics.

In summary, although the X and Y chromosomes generally determine gender, it is the presence or absence of the SRY gene, along with the body's response to sex hormones, that ultimately governs the development of male or female characteristics. This intricate process involves a network of genes, hormones, and biological pathways.
