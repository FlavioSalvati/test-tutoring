A habitat is defined as the environment in which an organism lives, while a niche refers to the specific role that organism plays within its habitat.

A habitat represents the physical surroundings that support a species, characterized by distinct physical and biological conditions. Essentially, it serves as the 'address' of an organism within an ecosystem. For instance, a forest may serve as a habitat for a bird, whereas a pond could be a habitat for a frog. Habitats can vary significantly in size, ranging from vast expanses like oceans to small areas such as a single leaf. They provide essential conditions for life, including food, water, temperature, light, and shelter.

Conversely, a niche describes the specific role an organism fulfills within its habitat. This concept encompasses not only the physical space occupied by the organism but also its interactions with other organisms and its utilization of resources within that habitat. A niche can be likened to the 'job' or 'profession' of an organism in its ecosystem. For example, the niche of a bee includes pollinating flowers, whereas the niche of a lion involves hunting and consuming other animals for sustenance.

Understanding the concept of a niche is vital for grasping the dynamics of ecosystems. Each species within an ecosystem has a unique niche, and the competitive exclusion principle states that no two species can occupy the same niche for an extended period. When two species attempt to share the same niche, they will compete for resources until one species is either driven out or becomes extinct in that particular location.

In summary, while a habitat refers to the 'where' of an organism's existence, a niche addresses the 'how'â€”how it survives, how it interacts with other organisms, and how it utilizes the resources available in its habitat. Both concepts are essential to the study of ecology and biodiversity.
