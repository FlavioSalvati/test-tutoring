The immune system prevents the attack on self-antigens through two main processes: central tolerance and peripheral tolerance.

The immune system is a sophisticated network of cells, tissues, and organs that collaborates to protect the body from harmful invaders. It accomplishes this by identifying and responding to antigens, which are substances that are foreign to the body. However, it is crucial for the immune system to differentiate between foreign antigens and self-antigensâ€”substances produced by the body's own cells. This differentiation is facilitated through the processes of central and peripheral tolerance.

**Central Tolerance**

Central tolerance takes place in the thymus and bone marrow, where immune cells are generated. During their maturation, these cells encounter self-antigens. If they exhibit a strong reaction to these self-antigens, they undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This mechanism effectively removes self-reactive cells before they can enter the bloodstream, thereby preventing potential autoimmunity.

**Peripheral Tolerance**

On the other hand, peripheral tolerance operates outside the thymus and bone marrow, throughout the rest of the body. It serves to regulate self-reactive cells that have escaped central tolerance through various mechanisms. These include anergy, where self-reactive cells become unresponsive; suppression by regulatory T cells; and additional instances of apoptosis.

Moreover, the immune system has a 'safety net' in the form of immune-privileged sites. These specialized areas of the body can tolerate the presence of antigens without triggering an immune response. Notable immune-privileged sites include the eyes, brain, and testes.

Despite these mechanisms, there are instances where tolerance fails, resulting in autoimmune diseases. In these conditions, the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells, treating them as if they were foreign invaders. Examples of autoimmune diseases include type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.

In summary, the immune system employs a combination of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms, as well as the presence of immune-privileged sites, to prevent the attack on self-antigens. Nonetheless, when these mechanisms fail, it can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases.
