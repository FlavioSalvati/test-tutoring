The brain processes visual information originating from the retina, which transmits signals through the optic nerve to the visual cortex.

The retina, situated at the back of the eye, is a delicate layer of tissue housing millions of light-sensitive nerve cells. These cells, known as rods and cones, are crucial for detecting light and color. When light enters the eye, it strikes the retina, where the rods and cones convert it into electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted via the optic nerve, a bundle consisting of over a million nerve fibers, to the brain.

The optic nerve conveys these signals to the visual cortex, the region of the brain dedicated to processing visual information. Located at the posterior part of the brain, the visual cortex interprets these electrical signals as images. This complex interpretation enables us to perceive and understand our visual environment. The visual cortex is organized into several distinct areas, each specializing in different aspects of visual processing. For instance, one area may focus on color perception, while another may be responsible for detecting movement.

It's important to note that visual perception is not merely a passive reception of information; the brain actively interprets visual data based on prior experiences and expectations. This phenomenon explains why two individuals can observe the same object yet perceive it differently.

Additionally, the brain possesses an ingenious capability known as perceptual filling-in, where it compensates for gaps in visual information. A prime example of this is the blind spot present where the optic nerve attaches to the retina. Despite this absence of visual input, we remain unaware of the blind spot in our field of vision because the brain seamlessly fills in the missing information using data from the surrounding area.

In summary, the brain engages in a sophisticated process to process visual information from the retina through the optic nerve and into the visual cortex. This intricate mechanism encompasses not only the conversion of light into electrical signals but also their interpretation through the lens of past experiences and expectations.
