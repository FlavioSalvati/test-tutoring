The solvent properties of water refer to its remarkable ability to dissolve various substances, thereby forming a solution.

Water is often termed the "universal solvent" due to its exceptional capacity to dissolve a wide array of substances. This characteristic is vital for its role in biological systems. The solvent properties of water arise primarily from its polar nature. Each water molecule possesses a slight positive charge on one end and a slight negative charge on the other. This polarity enables water molecules to effectively interact with and dissolve other polar and ionic substances.

The polarity of water facilitates a process known as hydration, wherein water molecules surround and separate individual ions or molecules of the solute. This characteristic explains why substances such as salts and sugars readily dissolve in water. The hydration shells formed by water molecules around solute particles effectively prevent these particles from re-associating and precipitating out of solution.

However, it is important to note that water's solvent properties are not universally applicable. Non-polar substances, including oils and fats, do not dissolve in water. This limitation arises because the attractive forces among non-polar molecules are stronger than the forces exerted by polar water molecules. This distinction is crucial for the formation of cell membranes and the segregation of cellular components.

In biological systems, the solvent properties of water play a fundamental role in numerous processes. For instance, the transportation of nutrients and waste products within organisms relies on water's ability to dissolve these substances. Enzymes and other biochemical compounds operate in aqueous environments, and many biochemical reactions occur in solution. Consequently, the solvent properties of water are essential to life as we know it.
