In glycolysis, the reversible steps are steps 2-5 and 7-10, while the irreversible steps include steps 1, 3, and 10.

Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that transforms glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, simultaneously releasing energy in the form of ATP and NADH. This pathway consists of ten distinct steps, each facilitated by a specific enzyme. Some of these steps are reversible, allowing them to proceed in both directions, whereas others are irreversible, meaning they can only move in one direction.

The reversible steps in glycolysis include:

- **Step 2:** Conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate
- **Step 3:** Conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
- **Step 4:** Splitting of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate
- **Step 5:** Conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
- **Step 7:** Conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate
- **Step 8:** Conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate
- **Step 9:** Conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate
- **Step 10:** Conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate

These reactions are considered reversible because they are near equilibrium, meaning that the forward and reverse reactions occur at approximately the same rate.

On the other hand, the irreversible steps of glycolysis are:

- **Step 1:** Conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate
- **Step 3:** Conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
- **Step 10:** Conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate

These reactions are deemed irreversible due to their significant deviation from equilibrium, where the forward reaction proceeds at a significantly faster rate than the reverse reaction. Notably, these irreversible steps are critical because they involve substantial energy changes, either consuming or producing ATP, which plays a key role in regulating the direction of the glycolytic pathway. Specifically, in steps 1 and 3, ATP is utilized to add a phosphate group to glucose, rendering these steps energetically unfavorable and hence irreversible. In step 10, ATP is generated when a phosphate group is transferred from phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate.

**Summary for IB Biology Students:** In the glycolytic pathway, which breaks down glucose to release energy, steps 2-5 and 7-10 can proceed in both forward and backward directions, classifying them as reversible. Conversely, steps 1, 3, and 10 are irreversible, exclusively moving in one direction. These irreversible steps involve critical energy transformations that either consume ATP or produce it, thereby influencing the regulation of the overall process.
