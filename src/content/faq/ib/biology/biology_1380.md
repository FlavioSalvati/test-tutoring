The primary threats to biodiversity include habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, climate change, and the introduction of invasive species.

**Habitat Destruction**  
Habitat destruction is one of the most critical threats to biodiversity. This phenomenon is primarily driven by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. When habitats are destroyed, the species that inhabit them are forced to relocate, which often leads to a decline in biodiversity. A notable example is the Amazon rainforest, which is home to approximately $400 \text{ billion}$ individual trees representing around $16,000$ species. This vital ecosystem is undergoing rapid deforestation due to logging, agricultural practices, and urban development, resulting in significant biodiversity loss.

**Overexploitation**  
Overexploitation is another major threat to biodiversity. It refers to the excessive hunting, fishing, or harvesting of specific species, leading to their decline or potential extinction. For instance, overfishing has caused a dramatic decrease in numerous fish populations worldwide. Additionally, the illegal wildlife trade poses severe risks to many species, including the African elephant and the pangolin.

**Pollution**  
Pollution constitutes a significant threat to biodiversity as well. This encompasses air, water, and soil pollution, all of which can harm or kill individual organisms, alter species composition, and disrupt entire ecosystems. For example, oil spills can have catastrophic effects on marine biodiversity, while air pollution can lead to acid rain, which damages forests and freshwater ecosystems.

**Climate Change**  
Climate change, largely fueled by human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation, represents another major threat to biodiversity. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can modify habitats and affect the distribution and behavior of various species. For example, coral reefs—among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth—are experiencing severe impacts from ocean warming and acidification.

**Invasive Species**  
The introduction of invasive species also poses a significant threat to biodiversity. These are species that are brought into a new environment, either intentionally or accidentally, and they can outcompete native species for resources, alter habitats, and spread diseases. A case in point is the introduction of the brown tree snake to Guam, which has led to the extinction of several bird species on the island.

In conclusion, human activities pose a substantial threat to biodiversity. It is essential to understand and address these threats to preserve the planet's biodiversity for future generations.
