Alpha and beta glucose differ in the orientation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the first carbon atom.

Both alpha and beta glucose are monosaccharides, representing the simplest form of sugar and serving as the fundamental building blocks of carbohydrates. They are classified as isomers, which means they share the same molecular formula, $C_6H_{12}O_6$, yet possess distinct structural formulas. The primary distinction between them lies in the positioning of the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the first carbon atom.

In alpha glucose, the hydroxyl group is oriented below the plane of the sugar molecule. Consequently, it is situated on the opposite side of the CH$_2$OH group at the sixth carbon. This arrangement results in a more stable and less reactive molecule, making alpha glucose the predominant form utilized by the body for energy.

Conversely, in beta glucose, the hydroxyl group is oriented above the plane of the sugar molecule, aligning with the CH$_2$OH group on the sixth carbon. This structural configuration produces a molecule that is more reactive and less stable compared to its alpha counterpart. However, beta glucose plays a crucial role in the synthesis of cellulose, which serves as the primary structural component of plant cell walls.

The difference in the orientation of the hydroxyl group in alpha and beta glucose also influences the formation of polysaccharides. Molecules of alpha glucose join together to create glycogen and starch, which function as energy storage compounds in animals and plants, respectively. In contrast, beta glucose molecules link to form cellulose, a vital structural molecule found in plants.

In summary, while alpha and beta glucose are both simple sugars with the same chemical formula, they differ significantly in the arrangement of the hydroxyl group on the first carbon. In alpha glucose, this group is positioned below the molecular plane, contributing to its stability and common use for energy in the body. In beta glucose, the hydroxyl group is above the plane, rendering it more reactive and essential for forming the structural integrity of plant cell walls.
