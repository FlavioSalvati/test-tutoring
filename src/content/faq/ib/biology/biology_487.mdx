The energy intermediates involved in cellular respiration include adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH$_2$).

Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic reactions that occur within the cells of organisms to transform biochemical energy derived from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), while also releasing waste products. The reactions involved in this process are primarily catabolic, meaning they break down larger molecules into smaller ones, thereby releasing energy. This released energy is stored in the form of energy intermediates, with ATP, NADH, and FADH$_2$ being the most significant.

ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is often described as the "energy currency" of the cell. It is a high-energy molecule that provides the energy necessary for a multitude of cellular functions. During cellular respiration, ATP is generated in the mitochondria through a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. This process harnesses the energy released from nutrient oxidation to synthesize ATP.

NADH and FADH$_2$ function as electron carriers and are essential components of the electron transport chain, which consists of a series of protein complexes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Both NADH and FADH$_2$ donate their electrons to this chain, and the energy released from these electrons is utilized to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby creating a proton gradient. This gradient is subsequently employed to drive ATP synthesis.

NADH is generated during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, which are the first two stages of cellular respiration. In contrast, FADH$_2$ is produced solely during the Krebs cycle. Both of these molecules carry high-energy electrons that originated from glucose. When these electrons are transferred to the electron transport chain, their energy is used to facilitate ATP production.

In summary, ATP, NADH, and FADH$_2$ serve as the primary energy intermediates in cellular respiration. They are vital for storing and transferring the energy released during the breakdown of nutrients.
