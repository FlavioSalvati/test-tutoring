Exocytosis is a fundamental cellular process through which cells transport molecules out of their interior by utilizing vesicles that merge with the plasma membrane.

This process is crucial for the secretion of various substances, particularly in specialized cells such as those found in the pancreas, which release insulin, and in neurons, which secrete neurotransmitters. However, exocytosis is not limited to these specialized cells; all cells engage in this process to replenish lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane.

The exocytosis process initiates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where proteins are synthesized. These proteins are subsequently packaged into transport vesicles that bud off from the ER and are transported to the Golgi apparatus. Within the Golgi apparatus, the proteins undergo modifications and sorting to prepare them for their final destinations. Proteins designated for exocytosis are then encapsulated into secretory vesicles that move toward the plasma membrane.

Upon reaching the plasma membrane, the secretory vesicles undergo docking, a process facilitated by specific proteins known as SNAREs. These proteins ensure that the vesicle is accurately positioned at the membrane, ready for fusion. Following this, the vesicle and plasma membranes begin to merge—a process termed membrane fusion—assisted by another set of proteins known as fusion proteins.

Once fusion occurs, the contents of the vesicle are expelled into the extracellular space. This release happens through the formation of a pore in the plasma membrane, allowing the vesicle's contents to exit the cell. Afterward, this pore closes, preserving the integrity of the plasma membrane.

In summary, exocytosis is a sophisticated process involving the transport of molecules from their synthesis site in the endoplasmic reticulum, through the Golgi apparatus, and ultimately out of the cell via vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane. This mechanism is essential for the secretion of various important substances and for maintaining the lipid and protein composition of the plasma membrane.
