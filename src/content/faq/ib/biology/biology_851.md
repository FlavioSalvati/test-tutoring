Amino acids are linked together to form polypeptides through a biochemical process known as dehydration synthesis, which results in the formation of peptide bonds.

To elaborate, the linking of amino acids to create polypeptides is a crucial aspect of protein synthesis. This process occurs via dehydration synthesis, also known as a condensation reaction, which involves the removal of a water molecule ($H_2O$) during the bond formation.

Each amino acid contains a central carbon atom that is bonded to an amino group ($-NH_2$), a carboxyl group ($-COOH$), a hydrogen atom, and a distinctive side chain, referred to as the R group. A peptide bond is formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another. Specifically, during this reaction, the carboxyl group releases a hydroxyl group ($-OH$), while the amino group donates a hydrogen atom. Together, these components create a water molecule, which is why the process is termed dehydration synthesis, as a water molecule is effectively 'removed'.

The bond formed between two amino acids is known as a peptide bond, resulting in the creation of a dipeptide. This process can be repeated with additional amino acids, leading to the formation of a longer polypeptide chain. The specific sequence of amino acids in this chain is dictated by the sequence of nucleotides in DNA. This genetic information is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) during transcription, followed by translation, where the mRNA is used to synthesize the polypeptide chain.

The formation of peptide bonds is a vital biological process, as it facilitates the creation of proteins, which are essential for numerous biological functions. Proteins can serve various roles, including acting as enzymes, structural components of cells, transport molecules, and antibodies, among others. Therefore, understanding peptide bond formation and the overall process of protein synthesis is fundamental to grasping cellular function.

It is important to note that the formation of a peptide bond is an endothermic reaction, meaning it requires an input of energy. This energy is supplied by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell. The reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes, which function as the protein factories of the cell.
