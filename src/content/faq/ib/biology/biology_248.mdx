The law of segregation plays a crucial role in Mendelian inheritance by ensuring that alleles separate during the formation of gametes.

To elaborate, the law of segregation—also referred to as Mendel's First Law—is a foundational principle of genetics introduced by Gregor Mendel in 1865. This law asserts that every individual organism possesses two alleles for each trait, and these alleles segregate (or separate) from one another during gamete formation. Consequently, each gamete will contain only one allele from each pair.

In the framework of Mendelian inheritance, this law elucidates how traits are transmitted from parents to offspring. During reproduction, an organism passes one of its alleles to its offspring. If the alleles in an inherited pair are different (i.e., the organism is heterozygous), one allele is dominant while the other is recessive. The dominant allele effectively masks the expression of the recessive allele, resulting in the trait associated with the dominant allele being expressed in the phenotype.

For instance, consider a pea plant that is heterozygous for seed color, possessing one allele for yellow seeds (the dominant allele) and one for green seeds (the recessive allele). According to the law of segregation, these two alleles will separate during gamete formation. The gametes produced will each carry one allele for seed color—either yellow or green. When fertilization occurs, the resulting offspring will inherit one allele from each parent, ultimately determining the color of their seeds.

The law of segregation is essential for understanding Mendelian inheritance, as it explains how traits are transmitted across generations. This principle provides a framework for analyzing the distribution of traits within a population and serves as a cornerstone in the field of genetics.
