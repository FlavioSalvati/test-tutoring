Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays a critical role in encoding proteins necessary for the mitochondria's energy-producing functions.

Mitochondrial DNA, commonly known as mtDNA, consists of a small circular DNA strand located within the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Unlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents, mtDNA is exclusively maternally inherited, meaning it is passed down from mother to her offspring.

The primary role of mtDNA is to encode proteins vital for the mitochondria's main function: energy production. Mitochondria, often referred to as the "powerhouse of the cell," are responsible for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell. This process, known as oxidative phosphorylation, involves a series of chemical reactions that require specific proteins, all of which are encoded by mtDNA.

The mtDNA comprises approximately $16,569$ base pairs that encode a total of $37$ genes. Of these genes, $13$ provide the instructions for synthesizing enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The remaining genes encode for molecules such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), which are essential for protein synthesis within the mitochondria.

It is important to highlight that mtDNA has a significantly higher mutation rate compared to nuclear DNA. This increased rate can be attributed to several factors: the absence of protective histones, the close proximity to reactive oxygen species generated during ATP synthesis, and limited mechanisms for DNA repair. Such mutations can result in mitochondrial diseases, which are typically characterized by symptoms such as muscle weakness and issues with growth and development.

In summary, mitochondrial DNA is crucial for encoding proteins that enable the mitochondria to produce energy efficiently. Without functional mtDNA, mitochondria would struggle to generate ATP, leading to severe consequences for the cell's energy supply and overall function.
