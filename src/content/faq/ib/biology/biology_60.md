The mortality rate plays a crucial role in influencing both population growth and stability by affecting the number of individuals within a population.

Specifically, the mortality rate measures the number of deaths in a population, typically expressed as deaths per 1,000 individuals per year. It is an essential determinant of population dynamics. A high mortality rate can lead to a decrease in population size unless the birth rate is significantly higher. Conversely, a low mortality rate can foster population growth, provided that the birth rate remains constant or increases.

Population growth refers to the change in population size over time and is influenced by various factors, including birth rates, death rates (mortality), immigration, and emigration. When the mortality rate is elevated, it can hinder population growth because the number of deaths may exceed the number of births and immigrants. In contrast, a low mortality rate can enhance population growth, as the number of births and immigrants surpasses the number of deaths.

Population stability occurs when the size of a population remains relatively constant over time. A high mortality rate can disrupt this stability, leading to a decline in population size. This decline may result in an imbalanced age distribution, characterized by a shortage of younger individuals to replace the older ones as they pass away. Such imbalances can have long-lasting effects on the population, making it difficult for it to recover its numbers.

Moreover, a high mortality rate can diminish genetic diversity within a population. With fewer individuals available to reproduce, the gene pool shrinks, increasing the population's vulnerability to diseases and reducing its adaptability to environmental changes.

On the other hand, a low mortality rate can also threaten population stability if it results in overpopulation. Overpopulation can lead to intensified competition for resources, environmental degradation, and heightened susceptibility to diseases. Therefore, achieving an optimal balance between birth and death rates is essential for maintaining population stability.
