The endometrium, which is the inner lining of the uterus, undergoes a cyclical process of thickening and shedding throughout the menstrual cycle in response to fluctuating hormone levels.

The menstrual cycle typically lasts around $28$ days and consists of a series of physiological changes in the female reproductive system, preparing the body for a potential pregnancy. A central feature of this cycle is the endometrium, which experiences significant transformations driven by the hormones estrogen and progesterone.

At the onset of the menstrual cycle, the endometrium is relatively thin. This condition occurs because the thickened endometrium from the previous cycle has just been shed during menstruation, an event characterized by the expulsion of the uterine lining that results in menstrual bleeding.

After menstruation concludes, the endometrium begins to thicken once more during the proliferative phase of the cycle. This thickening is stimulated by rising levels of estrogen, which encourage the endometrial cells to multiply and the blood vessels to expand. This process prepares the uterus for the possible implantation of a fertilized egg.

If fertilization does not take place, the levels of estrogen and progesterone will decrease. This reduction initiates the secretory phase, during which the endometrium continues to thicken and the glands within it start to secrete substances designed to nourish a fertilized egg. However, if no fertilized egg implants in the endometrium, hormone levels will continue to fall.

The decline in hormone levels at the end of the menstrual cycle leads to the shedding of the endometrium, signaling the onset of menstruation and the beginning of a new cycle. This periodic thickening and shedding of the endometrium is a crucial aspect of the menstrual cycle and plays a vital role in female fertility.
