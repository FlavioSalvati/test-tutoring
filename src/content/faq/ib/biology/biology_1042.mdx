Increased levels of atmospheric carbon are significantly contributing to global warming, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events.

The rise in atmospheric carbon, primarily in the form of carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), plays a crucial role in global warming. This phenomenon occurs due to the greenhouse effect, wherein $\text{CO}_2$ and other greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun within the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in a rise in global temperatures. The warming effect has numerous consequences for the planet's climate system, including the melting of polar ice caps and rising sea levels. These alterations can lead to habitat loss for many species, potentially resulting in a decline in biodiversity.

Another significant consequence of increased atmospheric carbon is ocean acidification. The world's oceans absorb approximately one-quarter of the $\text{CO}_2$ emitted by human activities. When $\text{CO}_2$ dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which decreases the pH of the water, rendering it more acidic. This acidification can adversely affect marine life, particularly species with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and shellfish. These organisms may struggle to build and maintain their shells in more acidic conditions, impacting their survival and disrupting the broader marine ecosystem.

Furthermore, elevated levels of atmospheric carbon can lead to more extreme weather events. Higher global temperatures are associated with intensified heatwaves and droughts, as well as more powerful storms and increased rainfall. These changes can significantly impact human societies by affecting agriculture, water supplies, and infrastructure. Additionally, they can lead to more frequent and severe natural disasters, such as wildfires and floods, which can result in considerable damage and loss of life.

Indirectly, increased atmospheric carbon can also affect human health. For example, rising temperatures can expand the range and activity of disease-carrying insects, potentially facilitating the spread of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Moreover, air pollution resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels—a major source of $\text{CO}_2$ emissions—can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues.

In summary, the impacts of increased atmospheric carbon are extensive and potentially severe, influencing not only the Earth's climate and ecosystems but also human health and societal well-being.
