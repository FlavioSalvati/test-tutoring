The law of independent assortment is a fundamental principle in genetics that applies to dihybrid crosses by predicting that two or more pairs of genes assort independently of one another.

More specifically, the law of independent assortment, one of Gregor Mendel's key principles of genetic inheritance, states that alleles for different traits segregate independently during the formation of gametes. This implies that the allele a gamete receives for one gene does not influence the allele it receives for another gene.

In a dihybrid cross, we examine the inheritance of two distinct traits, each represented by two alleles. For instance, consider the inheritance of seed shape (round or wrinkled) and seed color (yellow or green) in pea plants. According to the law of independent assortment, the allele a pea plant inherits for seed shape does not affect the allele it inherits for seed color.

This concept can be illustrated using a Punnett square, a diagram that predicts the outcomes of a specific genetic cross or breeding experiment. In the case of a dihybrid cross, the Punnett square is organized as a $4 \times 4$ grid, which represents the four possible combinations of alleles inherited from the parents for the two traits being studied. The law of independent assortment predicts that each of these combinations is equally likely to occur.

It is crucial to note that the law of independent assortment is applicable only to genes located on different chromosomes or genes that are situated far apart on the same chromosome. This limitation arises because genes that are closely located on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as genetic linkage.

In summary, the law of independent assortment is a crucial concept in genetics that predicts the independent inheritance of different traits. It plays a vital role in understanding dihybrid crosses, where the inheritance of two different traits is analyzed.
