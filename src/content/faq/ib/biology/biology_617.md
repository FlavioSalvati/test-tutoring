Contraceptive methods utilized in sexual reproduction can be categorized into several types: barrier methods, hormonal methods, intrauterine devices (IUDs), emergency contraception, and sterilization.

**Barrier Methods**  
Barrier methods prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Common examples include male and female condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps. Male condoms are worn over the penis during sexual intercourse, capturing sperm and preventing it from entering the vagina. Female condoms, which are inserted into the vagina prior to sex, serve a similar function. Diaphragms and cervical caps are also placed in the vagina; they cover the cervix to block sperm from entering the uterus.

**Hormonal Methods**  
Hormonal contraceptive methods utilize hormones to inhibit ovulation, thicken cervical mucus to block sperm, or thin the uterine lining to prevent implantation. These methods encompass birth control pills, patches, injections, vaginal rings, and implants. Birth control pills and patches release hormones into the bloodstream to prevent the ovaries from releasing eggs. Injections and implants function similarly but offer longer-lasting effects. Vaginal rings also release hormones that prevent ovulation while thickening cervical mucus.

**Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)**  
IUDs are small devices inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. There are two main types: copper IUDs and hormonal IUDs. Copper IUDs release copper ions into the uterus, creating an environment that is toxic to sperm. Hormonal IUDs release progestin, a hormone that thickens cervical mucus to hinder sperm from reaching the egg and thins the uterine lining to prevent implantation.

**Emergency Contraception**  
Emergency contraception is utilized after unprotected intercourse to avert pregnancy. This category includes the morning-after pill and copper IUDs. The morning-after pill contains a high dose of hormones that either prevent or delay ovulation or inhibit fertilization. Copper IUDs can also serve as emergency contraception if they are inserted within five days following unprotected sex.

**Sterilization**  
Sterilization represents a permanent form of contraception achieved through surgical procedures. In men, this method is referred to as a vasectomy, which involves cutting or blocking the tubes that transport sperm. In women, the procedure is known as tubal ligation, which entails cutting or blocking the fallopian tubes to prevent eggs from reaching the uterus.
