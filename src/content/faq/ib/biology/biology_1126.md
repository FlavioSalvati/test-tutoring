Simple diffusion is the passive movement of substances from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, whereas facilitated diffusion requires the assistance of carrier proteins.

Both simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion are forms of passive transport, meaning they do not consume energy to occur. They are both driven by the concentration gradient, which moves substances from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. The primary distinction between these two processes lies in the mechanisms by which substances traverse the cell membrane.

In simple diffusion, small, non-polar molecules, such as oxygen ($O_2$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), move directly through the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane. This process is solely driven by the concentration gradient, with molecules moving from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration until equilibrium is achieved. Because this mechanism does not require any assistance from proteins, it is referred to as 'simple' diffusion.

Conversely, facilitated diffusion involves the transport of larger, polar molecules or ions, such as glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) and sodium ions ($Na^+$), which cannot easily penetrate the lipid bilayer on their own. These substances require the help of specific carrier proteins or channel proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane. These proteins create a hydrophilic pathway, allowing the molecules to pass through more easily, effectively 'facilitating' their diffusion. Like simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion is also driven by the concentration gradient and does not require energy.

In summary, while both simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion are passive processes driven by the concentration gradient, simple diffusion involves the direct movement of small, non-polar molecules through the cell membrane, whereas facilitated diffusion necessitates the assistance of carrier or channel proteins to transport larger, polar molecules or ions. Understanding these processes is essential for comprehending how cells maintain homeostasis and regulate the transport of substances in and out of the cell.
