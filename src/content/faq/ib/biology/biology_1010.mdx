Carbon dioxide is an essential reactant in the process of photosynthesis, which enables plants to convert light energy into chemical energy.

Photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae, and certain bacteria, allowing them to transform light energy—predominantly from the sun—into chemical energy stored as glucose. This process is fundamental to life on Earth, as it serves as the primary source of organic compounds and the majority of oxygen required for respiration.

Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) plays a crucial role in photosynthesis. It enters the plant through tiny openings in the leaves known as stomata. Once inside the plant, CO$_2$ travels to the chloroplasts, which are the cellular organelles where photosynthesis takes place. Inside the chloroplasts, CO$_2$ combines with water (H$_2$O) in a series of reactions driven by sunlight. These initial reactions, referred to as the light-dependent reactions, generate oxygen (O$_2$) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which serves as the energy currency for the subsequent phase of photosynthesis.

The second phase, known as the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle, utilizes the ATP generated in the light-dependent reactions along with CO$_2$ to synthesize glucose. This glucose is essential for the plant's growth, repair, and energy storage. Any surplus oxygen produced during this process is released back into the atmosphere through the stomata.

The relationship between CO$_2$ and photosynthesis is therefore symbiotic. Without CO$_2$, plants would be unable to carry out photosynthesis and generate the glucose necessary for their survival. Conversely, without the process of photosynthesis, there would be no mechanism to remove CO$_2$ from the atmosphere, leading to an accumulation of this greenhouse gas and exacerbating global warming.

In summary, CO$_2$ is a vital component of photosynthesis. It serves as a raw material, alongside water and light energy, enabling plants to produce glucose and oxygen. This process not only sustains plant life but also plays a significant role in maintaining the balance of gases in the Earth's atmosphere.
