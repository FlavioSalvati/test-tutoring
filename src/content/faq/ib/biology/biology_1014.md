Deforestation significantly disrupts the carbon cycle by diminishing the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by trees and increasing carbon emissions.

Trees are essential components of the carbon cycle, a natural process that regulates the Earth's climate by managing the concentration of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere. Through photosynthesis, trees absorb carbon dioxide and convert it, along with sunlight, into oxygen and glucose. Remarkably, approximately $50\%$ of a tree's biomass consists of stored carbon. When trees are felled or burned during deforestation, this stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, thereby contributing to global warming.

Furthermore, deforestation diminishes the Earth's ability to absorb carbon dioxide. Forests function as "carbon sinks," meaning they absorb more carbon dioxide than they emit. When these vital ecosystems are destroyed, not only is the stored carbon released, but the potential for future carbon absorption is also lost. This results in a net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which exacerbates climate change.

Additionally, the decomposition of organic matter from deceased trees and plants also releases carbon dioxide. In a healthy forest ecosystem, this process is balanced, as new growth absorbs the carbon released during decomposition. However, in deforested regions, this balance is disrupted, leading to a net increase in carbon emissions.

In summary, deforestation has a profound impact on the carbon cycle. It elevates carbon emissions by releasing stored carbon and through the decomposition of organic matter, while simultaneously reducing the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. This disruption of the carbon cycle significantly contributes to climate change, underscoring the critical importance of forest conservation in mitigating global warming.
