A test cross in genetics is a method used to ascertain the genotype of an organism by crossing it with a homozygous recessive individual.

More specifically, a test cross is a fundamental technique in genetics designed to determine whether an organism displaying a dominant trait is homozygous dominant ($AA$) or heterozygous ($Aa$). This is accomplished by crossing the organism of interest with another that is homozygous recessive ($aa$) for the same trait. The choice of a homozygous recessive organism is crucial because it will consistently contribute a recessive allele to the offspring. This allows researchers to deduce the genotype of the other parent based on the phenotypes of the resulting offspring.

For instance, if you have a tall pea plant (a trait that is dominant) but are unsure if it is homozygous ($TT$) or heterozygous ($Tt$), you would cross it with a short pea plant ($tt$). If all the offspring are tall, it is likely that the unknown parent is homozygous dominant ($TT$). Conversely, if some of the offspring are short, then the unknown parent must be heterozygous ($Tt$), as it would have contributed a recessive allele.

The test cross is a valuable tool in genetics because it allows scientists to infer the genetic makeup of an organism based on its observable characteristics or phenotype. However, it is important to recognize that while a test cross can provide compelling evidence for a particular genotype, it does not guarantee absolute certainty. This uncertainty arises because the results rely on probability and the principles of inheritance, and variations may occur due to factors such as incomplete dominance or co-dominance.

In summary, a test cross is an effective method used in genetics to determine an organism's genotype by crossing it with a homozygous recessive individual. The phenotypes of the resulting offspring can be analyzed to infer the genotype of the parent in question.
