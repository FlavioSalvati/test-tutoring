Glial cells are essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system, providing various forms of support to neurons, including physical structure, insulation, nutrient supply, and waste removal.

Commonly referred to as neuroglia or simply glia, these non-neuronal cells perform critical functions that maintain the health and efficiency of neurons. Often dubbed the "supporting cells" of the nervous system, glial cells create a physical framework that holds neurons in place and preserves their structural integrity.

One of the primary functions of glial cells is to provide insulation for neurons. Specific types of glial cells, such as oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, wrap around neuronal axons to form a fatty layer known as the myelin sheath. This myelin sheath serves a purpose similar to that of insulation on electrical wires; it prevents electrical signals from dissipating and enhances the speed at which these signals are transmitted along the neuron.

In addition to insulation, glial cells are crucial for supplying neurons with essential nutrients. Astrocytes, a particular type of glial cell, extend their processes to encase blood vessels in the brain, forming a barrier known as the blood-brain barrier. This barrier regulates the passage of substances from the bloodstream into the brain, ensuring that neurons receive the necessary nutrients while protecting them from potentially harmful agents.

Glial cells are also instrumental in the removal of waste products from the brain. Microglia, another category of glial cells, function as the brain's immune cells, actively engulfing and degrading waste materials and dead cells. This process is vital for maintaining neuronal health and preventing the accumulation of toxic substances in the brain.

Moreover, emerging research suggests that glial cells may influence neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, although this area of study is still evolving. Overall, it is evident that while neurons may take center stage in the nervous system, glial cells play an indispensable supporting role, ensuring that neurons can operate effectively and efficiently.
