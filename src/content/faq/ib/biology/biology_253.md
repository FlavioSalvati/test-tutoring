Gender determination in humans is primarily governed by the X and Y chromosomes, with the combination of chromosomes denoting an individual's sex. Specifically, the presence of two X chromosomes ($XX$) indicates a female, while the presence of one X and one Y chromosome ($XY$) indicates a male.

In humans, gender is determined by the 23rd pair of chromosomes, commonly referred to as the sex chromosomes. Each individual possesses a total of 46 chromosomes, comprising 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. The sex chromosomes are distinct between males and females; females possess two identical sex chromosomes ($XX$) and are classified as the homogametic sex, whereas males possess two different sex chromosomes ($XY$) and are classified as the heterogametic sex.

The Y chromosome contains the SRY gene (Sex-determining Region Y), which plays a crucial role in male development. If an embryo possesses XY chromosomes and the SRY gene is activated, it will typically develop into a male. Conversely, if the SRY gene is absent, as is the case with XX chromosomes, the embryo will typically develop into a female. The activation of the SRY gene initiates the formation of testes in the embryo, which then produce male hormones that lead to the emergence of male secondary sexual characteristics.

It is important to recognize that while the presence of the Y chromosome and the SRY gene generally directs male development, there are notable exceptions to this rule. For instance, individuals with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) possess XY chromosomes but their bodies are unresponsive to male hormones, resulting in the development of female secondary sexual characteristics. On the other hand, individuals with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) have XX chromosomes but produce excessive male hormones, leading to the emergence of male secondary sexual characteristics.

In summary, while the X and Y chromosomes typically dictate gender, it is the presence or absence of the SRY gene and the body's response to sex hormones that ultimately influence the development of male or female characteristics. This process is complex and involves multiple genes, hormones, and biological pathways.
