Allosteric inhibition and competitive inhibition are two distinct mechanisms by which enzyme activity is regulated within a cell. They differ significantly in their interactions with enzymes and their effects on enzyme functionality.

In allosteric inhibition, an inhibitory molecule binds to a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the active site, referred to as the allosteric site. The binding of the inhibitor to this site induces a conformational change in the enzyme's structure, which subsequently alters the shape of the active site. This alteration prevents the substrate from binding effectively, thereby inhibiting the enzyme's activity. Allosteric inhibition is categorized as a form of non-competitive inhibition because the inhibitor does not compete with the substrate for access to the active site.

Conversely, competitive inhibition involves a molecule that closely resembles the enzyme's substrate. This molecule, known as the competitive inhibitor, directly competes with the substrate for binding at the active site. If the competitive inhibitor occupies the active site, it prevents the substrate from binding, thus inhibiting the enzyme's activity. Notably, this type of inhibition can be reversed by increasing the concentration of the substrate; as more substrate molecules are present, the likelihood of substrate binding outweighs that of the inhibitor binding to the active site.

In summary, the principal distinction between allosteric and competitive inhibition lies in their mechanisms. Allosteric inhibition entails the binding of an inhibitor to an allosteric site, leading to a structural change in the enzyme that inhibits substrate binding. In contrast, competitive inhibition is characterized by a direct competition between the substrate and the inhibitor for the active site of the enzyme.
