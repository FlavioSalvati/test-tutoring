The primary distinction between plant and animal cells lies in the presence of a large central vacuole in plant cells, contrasted with the smaller and more numerous vacuoles found in animal cells.

To elaborate, vacuoles are membrane-bound organelles present in both plant and animal cells. However, they differ significantly in terms of size, quantity, and function between these two types of cells. In plant cells, there is typically a single large central vacuole that can occupy up to $90\%$ of the cell's volume. This central vacuole is vital for maintaining turgor pressure, which helps the plant retain its shape and rigidity. Additionally, it serves as a storage site for waste products and various substances, including nutrients and water.

In contrast, animal cells contain multiple smaller vacuoles. While these vacuoles are also involved in storage, their primary functions are associated with the processes of endocytosis and exocytosis, which facilitate the transport of materials into and out of the cell. Unlike the central vacuole in plant cells, the vacuoles in animal cells do not contribute to the cell's structural integrity.

Another important difference pertains to the formation of these vacuoles. In plant cells, the central vacuole is typically formed through the fusion of smaller vacuoles produced by the Golgi apparatus. Conversely, in animal cells, vacuoles are formed during endocytosis, where the cell membrane invaginates to engulf external materials, creating a vesicle that subsequently develops into a vacuole.

In summary, although vacuoles are found in both plant and animal cells, they differ markedly in size, number, function, and formation processes. The large central vacuole in plant cells is essential for structural support and substance storage, whereas the smaller, numerous vacuoles in animal cells primarily facilitate material transport and storage.
