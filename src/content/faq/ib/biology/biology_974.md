Energy is transferred through various trophic levels in an ecosystem via consumption, with each level retaining approximately 10% of the energy received from the previous level.

In an ecosystem, the flow of energy begins with primary producers, which are typically plants. These organisms capture energy from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. When primary consumers, or herbivores, consume these plants, they absorb some of that energy. The transfer of energy continues as primary consumers are eaten by secondary consumers, and this pattern persists through higher trophic levels.

However, not all energy is efficiently transferred between levels. In fact, only about $10\%$ of the energy is passed on to the next trophic level, a concept known as the 10% rule in ecology. The remaining $90\%$ of the energy is lost primarily as heat due to various metabolic processes, including respiration, movement, and reproduction. This significant energy loss explains why fewer organisms are found at higher trophic levels.

The energy transfer between trophic levels can be visualized through an ecological pyramid. In this pyramid, the base represents the primary producers, while each subsequent level corresponds to higher trophic levels. The width of each level illustrates the amount of energy it contains, effectively demonstrating the energy loss occurring at each transfer.

This energy transfer is essential for the functioning of ecosystems. It drives nutrient cycling and the flow of energy, both of which are critical for the survival of all organisms. A thorough understanding of this process is fundamental for studying and conserving biodiversity.

In summary, energy is passed through different trophic levels via consumption, with each level retaining about $10\%$ of the energy from the preceding level. This energy transfer is crucial for maintaining the balance of ecosystems and ensuring the survival of all life forms.
