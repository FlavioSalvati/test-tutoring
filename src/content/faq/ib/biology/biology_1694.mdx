Okazaki fragments play a crucial role in DNA replication by facilitating the synthesis of the lagging strand in a discontinuous manner.

During DNA replication, the two strands of the DNA double helix are separated, with each strand serving as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. This process is orchestrated by the enzyme DNA polymerase. However, DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction. As a result, one of the strands, known as the leading strand, can be synthesized continuously, while the other strand, referred to as the lagging strand, must be synthesized in a more fragmented manner.

This is where Okazaki fragments come into play. Named after the Japanese scientists who discovered them, Okazaki fragments are short sequences of DNA nucleotides that are synthesized discontinuously on the lagging strand. In prokaryotes, these fragments are approximately $1000$ base pairs long, while in eukaryotes, they range from $100$ to $200$ base pairs. The synthesis of each Okazaki fragment begins with the formation of a short RNA primer, which is subsequently extended by DNA polymerase.

After an Okazaki fragment has been synthesized, the RNA primer at the beginning of the fragment is removed and replaced with DNA. This replacement is carried out by different enzymes: DNA polymerase I in prokaryotes and RNase H in eukaryotes. Once all RNA primers have been replaced, the gaps between these fragments are sealed by an enzyme called DNA ligase, resulting in a continuous DNA strand.

Through this mechanism, Okazaki fragments enable the lagging strand to be synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, even though the overall direction of replication on this strand is from 3' to 5'. This process ensures that both strands of the DNA molecule are accurately replicated, preserving the integrity of the genetic information and allowing it to be transmitted to the next generation of cells.
