Introns and exons play a vital role in RNA splicing, a process during which introns are excised and exons are concatenated.

RNA splicing is an essential step in gene expression whereby pre-mRNA, the initial transcript of a gene, undergoes modifications to transform into mature mRNA. This mature mRNA serves as a template for protein synthesis. The pre-mRNA consists of exons, which are the coding sequences, and introns, which are non-coding sequences. The relationship between introns, exons, and RNA splicing is evident in the fact that during splicing, introns are eliminated while exons are fused together.

The RNA splicing process commences with the assembly of a spliceosome, a large molecular complex composed of proteins and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). The spliceosome identifies specific sequences located at the boundaries of introns and exons, referred to as splice sites. Once the spliceosome is assembled on the pre-mRNA, it cleaves at these splice sites, removes the introns, and subsequently ligates the exons. The outcome is a mature mRNA molecule containing only the coding sequences, or exons.

The removal of introns and the joining of exons is not always a straightforward task. In certain instances, various combinations of exons may be joined together through a process known as alternative splicing. This mechanism enables a single gene to encode multiple distinct proteins, depending on which exons are incorporated into the mature mRNA. Such versatility enhances the diversity of proteins that can be generated from a single gene, contributing significantly to the complexity of higher organisms.

In conclusion, introns and exons are fundamental to the RNA splicing process. The excision of introns and the concatenation of exons yield a mature mRNA molecule that is essential for protein synthesis. This splicing process is crucial for gene expression and also facilitates protein diversity through alternative splicing.
