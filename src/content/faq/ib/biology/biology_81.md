Ecological efficiency across trophic levels is defined by the percentage of energy transferred from one level to the next.

Ecological efficiency specifically refers to how effectively energy is transferred between trophic levels in a food chain or food web. Understanding this concept is essential for grasping energy flow within ecosystems. Energy is invariably lost at each trophic level due to various factors, including respiration, excretion, and the consumption of non-edible parts of organisms. As a result, the energy available to the subsequent trophic level is consistently less than that available to the preceding one.

Typically, the efficiency of energy transfer is around $10\%$, though it can range between $5\%$ and $20\%$. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the '10% rule' in ecology. For instance, if a plant absorbs $1000$ units of energy from sunlight, a herbivore that consumes that plant would receive approximately $100$ units of energy. Subsequently, a carnivore that preys on the herbivore would obtain about $10$ units of energy. This energy loss contributes to the general observation that there are usually fewer organisms at higher trophic levels.

To compute ecological efficiency, you can use the formula:

$$ \text{Ecological Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Energy Output}}{\text{Energy Input}} \right) \times 100 $$

For example, if a plant captures $1000$ units of energy and a herbivore receives $100$ units, the ecological efficiency can be calculated as follows:

$$ \text{Ecological Efficiency} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% $$

The concept of ecological efficiency has profound implications for understanding the structure and function of ecosystems. It elucidates why food chains tend to be relatively short, typically comprising only $3$ to $5$ trophic levels, and why large carnivorous animals are rarer compared to smaller herbivorous species. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of conserving energy at lower trophic levels, as this energy serves as the foundational support for sustaining life at higher levels.
