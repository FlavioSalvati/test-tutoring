Viruses and cells are both fundamental units of life, but they exhibit significant differences in structure and complexity. 

A virus is an infectious agent that is considerably smaller than a cell, and it lacks the cellular components typically found in cells. Specifically, viruses do not possess a nucleus, mitochondria, or cytoplasm. Because they lack the machinery necessary for metabolic processes, viruses are often classified as 'acellular' or 'non-living' entities.

The structure of a virus is relatively straightforward. It consists of a protein coat, known as a capsid, which encases its genetic material. This genetic material can be either DNA or RNA, but not both at the same time. In some cases, viruses also possess an outer lipid envelope. The capsid, along with the envelope (when present), serves to protect the genetic material and facilitates the virus's attachment to and entry into host cells.

In contrast, a cell is a complex structure that contains various organelles, each serving a distinct function. Key organelles include the nucleus, which stores the cell's DNA; the mitochondria, responsible for energy production; and the cytoplasm, a jelly-like substance that fills the cell and houses the organelles. Additionally, cells are encased in a plasma membrane that regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell.

When it comes to reproduction, viruses and cells differ markedly. Viruses cannot reproduce independently; they must infect a host cell and hijack its cellular machinery to replicate. This is in stark contrast to cells, which can reproduce autonomously through a process known as cell division.

In summary, while both viruses and cells are essential to the study of biology, they are structurally distinct. A virus is a simple entity lacking the organelles found in cells, and it relies on host cells for reproduction. In contrast, a cell is a complex structure capable of performing a wide array of functions and can reproduce independently.
