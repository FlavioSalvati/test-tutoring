Cells interact with their environment and communicate with one another through a crucial process known as signal transduction. This process encompasses three main stages: reception, transduction, and response.

Cells are in constant communication with their surroundings, which is essential for their survival and proper functioning. This communication is facilitated by external signals, which may be physical (such as light or touch) or chemical (like hormones or neurotransmitters). Cells detect these signals through the mechanism of signal transduction.

The first stage, reception, involves the binding of an external signal, or ligand, to a specific receptor located on the cell surface. These receptors are typically proteins tailored to recognize and bind to specific signals. When a ligand binds to its corresponding receptor, it induces a conformational change in the receptor, enabling it to interact with other molecules within the cell.

The next phase is transduction. During this stage, the signal is transformed into a format that can elicit a specific cellular response. This transformation often entails a series of steps, each catalyzed by distinct molecules, primarily proteins. This sequence of events is referred to as a signal transduction pathway. Each step in this pathway amplifies the original signal, meaning that a single ligand-receptor interaction can lead to a significant cellular response.

Finally, the signal culminates in a specific cellular response. This response can vary widely, ranging from gene expression to cell division, depending on the nature of the signal and the type of cell involved. The final steps of the signal transduction pathway are typically mediated by 'effector' proteins, which execute the ultimate actions dictated by the signal.

In summary, cells respond to external signals through a well-orchestrated process of reception, transduction, and response. This intricate mechanism enables cells to sense and adapt to their environment, ensuring they perform their functions effectively and respond appropriately to changes.
