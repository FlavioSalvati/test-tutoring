Non-disjunction errors in meiosis are permanent and result in gametes that contain an abnormal number of chromosomes.

Non-disjunction refers to a specific error that occurs during meiosis, the type of cell division responsible for producing gametes (sperm and egg cells) necessary for sexual reproduction. In typical meiosis, chromosomes are expected to separate evenly into two daughter cells. However, during non-disjunction, this separation fails, resulting in one daughter cell receiving an extra chromosome while the other receives one less.

Once a non-disjunction error occurs, there is no mechanism to correct it. By the time the error is recognized, the cell has usually completed meiosis and formed a gamete. Consequently, the affected gamete will have an abnormal chromosomal composition, which can lead to genetic disorders if it participates in fertilization. A well-known example of this is Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome $21$, often resulting from non-disjunction.

While the body possesses mechanisms aimed at preventing non-disjunction, such as the accurate functioning of spindle fibers that pull chromosomes apart during meiosis, these systems are not infallible. Cells are equipped with checkpoint systems to ensure proper alignment of chromosomes prior to separation; however, errors can still occur.

In certain cases, organisms can survive with an abnormal number of chromosomes due to a phenomenon known as dosage compensation. This mechanism helps balance gene expression between males and females, as well as among individuals with varying chromosome numbers. It is important to note that dosage compensation does not rectify the non-disjunction error itself; rather, it serves as a coping strategy for the organism.

In summary, although the body has preventive measures against non-disjunction, there is currently no way to correct these errors once they occur. The resulting gametes will have an abnormal number of chromosomes, which can lead to genetic disorders if involved in fertilization.
