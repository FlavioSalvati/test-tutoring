Antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system to neutralize pathogens, while antigens are molecules that provoke this immune response.

Both antibodies and antigens are essential components of the immune system, yet they perform distinct roles. Antibodies, also referred to as immunoglobulins, are Y-shaped proteins synthesized by B cells, a type of white blood cell. Their primary function is to identify and neutralize foreign entities such as bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. They achieve this by binding to specific sites on the pathogens, known as antigens, effectively 'tagging' these invaders for destruction by other immune cells.

Conversely, antigens are molecules that can stimulate an immune response. They are typically located on the surface of pathogens but can also be produced by the body itself under certain conditions, such as during an allergic reaction or in the presence of cancer cells. When an antigen enters the body, it is recognized as foreign by the immune system, prompting the production of specific antibodies to neutralize it.

The interaction between antibodies and antigens is highly specific. Each antibody is designed to bind to a particular antigen, akin to a lock and key mechanism. This specificity arises from the unique structure of the antigen-binding site on the antibody, which varies for each type of antibody. Consequently, when a new antigen enters the body, a corresponding new type of antibody must be generated.

In summary, while both antibodies and antigens are vital to the immune response, they fulfill different functions. Antibodies act as the body's defense against foreign invaders, produced in response to the presence of antigens. In contrast, antigens serve as the triggers that activate this defensive response. Understanding the interaction between these two components is crucial to comprehending how the immune system protects the body against disease.
