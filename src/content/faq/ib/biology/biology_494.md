The Calvin cycle, also known as the light-independent reactions or the dark phase of photosynthesis, is a vital process through which plants convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This cycle relies on two primary energy sources: ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).

ATP is often referred to as the "energy currency" of the cell. It is a high-energy molecule that stores and transports chemical energy within cells. During the Calvin cycle, ATP provides the necessary energy for converting 3-PGA (3-phosphoglycerate) into 1,3-BPG (1,3-bisphosphoglycerate), a critical step in glucose synthesis.

NADPH serves as another essential component of the Calvin cycle. It acts as a reducing agent, donating electrons to facilitate the conversion of 1,3-BPG to G3P (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate), which ultimately leads to the formation of glucose. The NADPH utilized in the Calvin cycle is produced during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, where water is split and electrons are transferred through a series of proteins.

In summary, the Calvin cycle relies on ATP for energy and NADPH for reducing power. Both molecules are generated in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, effectively linking sunlight energy to glucose synthesis. This process is fundamental to life on Earth, as it provides the energy necessary for the growth and metabolism of plants, which in turn supports all organisms that depend on plants for sustenance.
