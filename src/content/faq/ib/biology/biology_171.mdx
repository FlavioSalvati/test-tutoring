Translation in protein synthesis refers to the process by which ribosomes decode messenger RNA (mRNA) to synthesize proteins.

To elaborate, translation is the second step of protein synthesis, occurring after transcription. This process takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell, specifically on ribosomes, which serve as the machinery for translation. It begins when a ribosome binds to an mRNA molecule. The ribosome is responsible for translating the genetic code carried by the mRNA into a polypeptide chain, ultimately forming a protein.

The mRNA molecule is read in sequences of three nucleotides known as codons, with each codon corresponding to a specific amino acid. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it interprets one codon at a time. When a codon is recognized, a molecule of transfer RNA (tRNA), which carries the appropriate amino acid, binds to that codon. Each tRNA molecule features an anticodon region that is complementary to the mRNA codon, ensuring that the correct amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain.

The ribosome facilitates the formation of a peptide bond between the newly arrived amino acid and the existing chain. After this bond is established, the tRNA that delivered the previous amino acid detaches from the ribosome, allowing the next tRNA and its associated amino acid to bind. This process continues sequentially until a stop codon is encountered on the mRNA. Stop codons do not correspond to any amino acid; instead, they signal the termination of protein synthesis.

Once the polypeptide chain is synthesized, it undergoes various modifications to become a fully functional protein. These modifications may include folding into a specific three-dimensional structure, the addition of other molecular groups, or the combination with other polypeptide chains.

In summary, translation is a sophisticated process involving the decoding of mRNA by ribosomes to produce proteins. It plays an essential role in protein synthesis, facilitating the expression of genetic information encoded in DNA as proteins, which perform a wide range of functions within the cell.
