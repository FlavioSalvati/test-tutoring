Multiple alleles play a significant role in the inheritance of blood types by providing more than two variant forms of a gene.

In the ABO blood group system, blood types are determined by a single gene that has three alleles: $I_A$, $I_B$, and $i$. These three alleles are responsible for the four observable blood types in humans: A, B, AB, and O. The $I_A$ and $I_B$ alleles exhibit co-dominance, meaning that when both alleles are present, they express their traits simultaneously, resulting in the AB blood type. In contrast, the $i$ allele is recessive to both $I_A$ and $I_B$; it only expresses its trait—type O blood—when neither of the dominant alleles is present.

The $I_A$ allele encodes for a specific antigen (a protein that can trigger an immune response) on the surface of red blood cells. If an individual inherits the $I_A$ allele from both parents, or inherits one $I_A$ allele and one $i$ allele, they will have type A blood. Similarly, the $I_B$ allele codes for a different antigen, and inheriting this allele from both parents, or one $I_B$ and one $i$ allele, results in type B blood.

The AB blood type is produced when an individual receives the $I_A$ allele from one parent and the $I_B$ allele from the other. Because these alleles are co-dominant, both types of antigens are present on the surface of the red blood cells. In contrast, type O blood arises when an individual inherits the $i$ allele from both parents. Since the $i$ allele does not code for any antigens, type O blood cells lack both A and B antigens.

This system of multiple alleles allows for a broader range of genetic combinations and phenotypes (observable traits), contributing to the diversity of blood types in humans. It also has critical implications for blood transfusions and organ transplants, as the immune system can react against foreign antigens. Therefore, understanding the role of multiple alleles in blood type inheritance is essential in both biological and medical contexts.
