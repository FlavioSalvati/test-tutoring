Neurotransmitters are essential chemical messengers that facilitate the transmission of signals across synapses, enabling communication between neurons. 

These substances are stored in vesicles located at the axon terminals of neurons. When an action potential, which is essentially a nerve impulse, reaches the axon terminal, it prompts the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft—the minute gap that separates adjacent neurons.

Once released, neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, which is the neuron receiving the signal. This binding event can either stimulate the generation of a new action potential or inhibit it, depending on the type of neurotransmitter and receptor involved. This intricate process is fundamental to the way neurons communicate, facilitating the flow of information throughout the nervous system.

There is a wide variety of neurotransmitters, each serving distinct functions. For instance, glutamate is primarily an excitatory neurotransmitter that enhances neuronal activity and is crucial for learning and memory. Conversely, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) typically acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, reducing neuronal excitability and promoting calmness.

Moreover, neurotransmitters influence numerous physiological processes and can significantly affect mood and behavior. For example, serotonin is instrumental in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep patterns, while dopamine plays a key role in reward mechanisms and motivation.

After fulfilling their function, neurotransmitters are either degraded by enzymes or reabsorbed into the pre-synaptic neuron—the neuron that initially released them—through a process known as reuptake. This mechanism ensures that neurotransmitters do not continue to influence the post-synaptic neuron once the signal has been successfully transmitted.

In conclusion, neurotransmitters are vital for the proper functioning of the nervous system. They enable the transmission of signals across synapses and are involved in a broad spectrum of physiological processes and behaviors.
