Carbon fixation in plants is the process through which inorganic carbon dioxide is transformed into organic compounds during photosynthesis.

This process is essential for photosynthesis, enabling plants to produce their own food. Carbon fixation takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically within an area known as the stroma. The primary enzyme facilitating this process is ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, commonly known as Rubisco, which is recognized as the most abundant protein on Earth.

The carbon fixation process begins when a molecule of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) reacts with a five-carbon sugar called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). This reaction is catalyzed by Rubisco, resulting in the formation of an unstable six-carbon compound. This compound rapidly decomposes into two molecules of a three-carbon compound known as 3-phosphoglycerate ($3\text{-PGA}$).

The $3\text{-PGA}$ molecules are subsequently converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ($G3P$) through a series of enzymatic reactions that require energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$) and reducing power in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ($NADPH$). Both $ATP$ and $NADPH$ are generated during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. One molecule of $G3P$ can be utilized to synthesize glucose and other organic compounds, while the remaining $G3P$ molecules are recycled to regenerate RuBP, thus allowing the cycle to continue.

This process is known as the Calvin cycle, named after Melvin Calvin, who elucidated its steps. It is also referred to as the light-independent or dark reactions of photosynthesis because it does not directly require light to occur. However, it is indirectly dependent on light, as the $ATP$ and $NADPH$ needed are products of the light-dependent reactions.

Carbon fixation is crucial for life on Earth, as it is the primary mechanism by which inorganic carbon is converted into organic compounds. This process not only supplies food for plants but also forms the foundation of the food chain for all other organisms. Additionally, by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, photosynthesis and carbon fixation play a significant role in mitigating climate change.
