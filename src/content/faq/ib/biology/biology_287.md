A dihybrid cross in genetics refers to a breeding experiment between two individuals that possess different alleles at two distinct genetic loci.

More specifically, a dihybrid cross is conducted between individuals that vary in two traits. The term "dihybrid" indicates that the parents in the initial generation, known as the P generation, are heterozygous for both traits. For instance, if we consider two traits in pea plants—seed shape (round or wrinkled) and seed color (yellow or green)—a typical dihybrid cross would involve plants that are heterozygous for both traits, represented as $RrYy$.

Interpreting a dihybrid cross involves predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring in the F1 and F2 generations, guided by the principles of Mendelian genetics. This includes the Law of Segregation, which asserts that the two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation, and the Law of Independent Assortment, which states that alleles for different traits assort independently of one another.

To analyze a dihybrid cross, a Punnett square is commonly employed. This grid serves as a visual tool that illustrates all possible genetic combinations of the offspring. For a dihybrid cross, a $4 \times 4$ Punnett square is utilized, yielding a total of $16$ possible combinations. The ratios of these combinations can then be used to anticipate the phenotypic ratios of the offspring. For example, when conducting a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents ($RrYy \times RrYy$), the expected phenotypic ratio is $9:3:3:1$, which corresponds to $9$ round yellow, $3$ wrinkled yellow, $3$ round green, and $1$ wrinkled green.

In summary, interpreting a dihybrid cross requires a solid understanding of Mendelian genetics and the application of a Punnett square to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring. This concept is foundational in genetics, as it elucidates how traits are inherited and how genetic variation arises.
