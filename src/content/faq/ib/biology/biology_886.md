Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates that are synthesized from monosaccharides through a process known as dehydration synthesis or condensation reaction.

To elaborate, polysaccharides consist of multiple monosaccharide units, which are simple sugars. The linking of these monosaccharides occurs via dehydration synthesis, a process that results in the formation of water ($H_2O$) as a byproduct, hence the term 'condensation reaction.'

The process begins when two monosaccharides approach each other closely. Each monosaccharide contains a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) and a hydrogen atom ($-H$) that are attracted to one another. When these two components come into contact, the hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide and the hydroxyl group from the other combine to produce a water molecule. This reaction results in the formation of a covalent bond between the two monosaccharides, yielding a disaccharide.

This process can be repeated, allowing additional monosaccharides to be added to the chain, ultimately leading to the formation of a polysaccharide. Each time a monosaccharide is incorporated, a new water molecule is generated. This is why this mechanism is termed dehydration synthesis, as water is removed with each bond formation.

The bonds created during this process are known as glycosidic bonds. These are covalent bonds, which means they involve the sharing of electrons between atoms. This characteristic endows glycosidic bonds with considerable strength and stability, allowing polysaccharides to exist as large and complex molecules.

The specific type of polysaccharide formed depends on the kinds of monosaccharides utilized and the manner in which they are linked together. For instance, both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides derived from glucose monosaccharides; however, their distinct structures and properties arise from the different ways in which the glucose units are connected.

In summary, the synthesis of polysaccharides from monosaccharides involves dehydration synthesis or a condensation reaction, during which a water molecule is produced and a glycosidic bond is formed every time a monosaccharide is added to the growing chain.
