Fossil fuels are intricately linked to the carbon cycle as they store carbon and release it into the atmosphere when burned for energy.

These fossil fuels—comprising coal, oil, and natural gas—are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. During their lifetimes, these organisms absorbed carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. After their death, they were buried under layers of sediment, and over time, heat and pressure transformed their remains into fossil fuels. This geological process effectively sequestered significant amounts of carbon within the Earth's crust, removing it from the carbon cycle for millions of years.

The carbon cycle itself is the series of processes through which carbon is exchanged among the Earth's various systems, including the atmosphere, oceans, land, and living organisms. This cycle is fundamental to life on Earth, as carbon is a key building block of all living organisms. During photosynthesis, plants absorb $CO_2$ from the atmosphere and convert it into glucose, a form of carbon that serves as a vital energy source for growth. Animals, in turn, consume these plants, assimilating the carbon and subsequently releasing it back into the atmosphere as $CO_2$ during respiration.

However, the combustion of fossil fuels for energy represents a significant disruption to this natural balance. By burning fossil fuels, we are effectively releasing the stored carbon back into the atmosphere as $CO_2$. This phenomenon has become increasingly pronounced over the last few hundred years, particularly since the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The rapid release of $CO_2$ is causing a rise in its atmospheric concentration, which in turn is contributing to global warming and climate change.

In summary, the burning of fossil fuels disrupts the equilibrium of the carbon cycle. Under natural conditions, the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is typically balanced by the amount absorbed by plants through photosynthesis. However, the large-scale combustion of fossil fuels is releasing $CO_2$ at a rate that exceeds the capacity of plants to absorb it. This imbalance is having a profound effect on our planet's climate and ecosystems, raising significant concerns among scientists and environmentalists around the world.
