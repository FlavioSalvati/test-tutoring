FADH$_2$ is an essential coenzyme in cellular respiration, particularly in the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain.

Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH$_2$) plays a significant role in cellular respiration, the process by which cells metabolize glucose and other molecules to generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This metabolic pathway consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.

Within the Krebs cycle, FADH$_2$ is generated during the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. In this redox reaction, the FAD molecule accepts two hydrogen atoms, which results in its reduction to FADH$_2$.

FADH$_2$ continues to play a vital role beyond the Krebs cycle. It is crucial during the final stage of cellular respiration, known as oxidative phosphorylation. In this phase, FADH$_2$ donates the electrons it acquired during the Krebs cycle to the electron transport chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As these electrons traverse the chain, they release energy that is utilized to pump protons across the membrane, thereby creating a proton gradient. This gradient is instrumental in driving ATP synthesis through a process called chemiosmosis.

In conclusion, FADH$_2$ is a key coenzyme in cellular respiration. It is produced in the Krebs cycle and is integral to the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation, ultimately facilitating the production of ATPâ€”the primary energy currency of the cell. Without FADH$_2$, cellular respiration would be significantly less efficient, and cells would be unable to produce sufficient ATP.
