Cells regulate the cell cycle through a complex interplay of checkpoints and signaling proteins known as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).

The cell cycle comprises a series of events that cells undergo during growth and division. It consists of four primary phases: G1 (Gap 1), S (Synthesis), G2 (Gap 2), and M (Mitosis). Proper regulation of the cell cycle is essential for accurate cell division and replication. This regulation is facilitated by an intricate system of checkpoints and protein signals.

The cell cycle is governed by a chemical control system that initiates and halts various phases of the cycle. This control system is composed of proteins called cyclins and CDKs. Cyclins are regulatory proteins that activate CDKs, which are enzymes capable of modifying other proteins through the addition of phosphate groups, a process known as phosphorylation. When a cyclin binds to a CDK, the CDK becomes active and can phosphorylate target proteins, thereby facilitating progression through the cell cycle.

Throughout the cell cycle, several checkpoints ensure that the cell is adequately prepared to transition to the next phase. The G1 checkpoint evaluates cell size, nutrient availability, growth factors, and checks for DNA damage. The G2 checkpoint verifies that all DNA has been accurately replicated and checks for any DNA damage. The M checkpoint assesses chromosome attachment to the spindle during metaphase. If a cell fails to meet the requirements of these checkpoints, it may enter a resting phase or undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death).

In addition to cyclins and CDKs, certain proteins act as 'brakes' within the cell cycle, known as tumor suppressor proteins. One of the most prominent tumor suppressors is p53, which can halt the cell cycle at the G1 checkpoint in response to detected DNA damage. If the damage is deemed irreparable, p53 can initiate apoptosis.

In summary, the regulation of the cell cycle is a complex process that involves a diverse array of proteins and checkpoints. This multifaceted regulation ensures that cells divide correctly, thereby maintaining the health and stability of the organism.
