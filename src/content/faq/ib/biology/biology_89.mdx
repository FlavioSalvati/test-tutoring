Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is primarily transported in the blood in the form of bicarbonate ions (HCO$_3^-$), but it is also carried bound to hemoglobin and dissolved in plasma.

In the human body, CO$_2$ is a waste product generated from cellular respiration, and its removal is essential for maintaining the body's pH balance and preventing respiratory acidosis. The transport of CO$_2$ in the blood is a multifaceted process that involves several mechanisms.

Approximately 70% of CO$_2$ is transported as bicarbonate ions (HCO$_3^-$). This process begins when CO$_2$ diffuses into red blood cells and reacts with water (H$_2$O) to form carbonic acid (H$_2$CO$_3$). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Subsequently, carbonic acid rapidly dissociates into a hydrogen ion (H$^+$) and a bicarbonate ion (HCO$_3^-$). The bicarbonate ions then diffuse out of the red blood cells into the plasma, where they are transported to the lungs.

Around 20% of CO$_2$ is carried in the blood bound to hemoglobin, a protein located in red blood cells. This method of CO$_2$ transport is referred to as carbaminohemoglobin. In this case, CO$_2$ binds to the amino groups in the hemoglobin molecule, forming a stable yet easily reversible compound. This allows the CO$_2$ to be transported to the lungs, where it is released and ultimately exhaled.

The remaining 10% of CO$_2$ is transported in the blood as dissolved gas in plasma. This represents the simplest form of CO$_2$ transport, where the gas simply dissolves in the plasma for transport to the lungs. However, due to its low solubility in water, only a small fraction of the total CO$_2$ can be transported in this manner.

In summary, CO$_2$ is carried in the blood through three primary mechanisms: as bicarbonate ions, bound to hemoglobin, and dissolved in plasma. Each of these pathways plays a vital role in maintaining the body's pH balance and facilitating the efficient removal of this metabolic waste product.
