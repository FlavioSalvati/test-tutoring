Environmental factors have a significant impact on phenotypic expression by interacting with an organism's genetic makeup, ultimately determining its physical traits.

Phenotypic expression, commonly referred to as phenotype, encompasses the observable physical and biochemical characteristics of an organism. These characteristics are influenced by both genetic factors and environmental conditions. While genes provide the foundational blueprint for an organism's traits, environmental factors can profoundly affect how these traits are manifested. This dynamic interplay between genes and environmental influences is known as gene-environment interaction.

One key environmental factor that affects phenotypic expression is temperature. For example, in certain reptile species, the temperature at which eggs are incubated can dictate the sex of the hatchlingsâ€”a phenomenon known as temperature-dependent sex determination. Similarly, in the Himalayan rabbit, fur color is influenced by temperature; the cooler regions of the rabbit's body, such as the ears and feet, exhibit darker fur due to the activation of a specific gene at lower temperatures.

Nutrition also plays a critical role in shaping phenotypic expression. For instance, an individual's height can be influenced by both their genetic predisposition and their nutritional intake during growth. A person who is genetically inclined to be tall may fail to reach their maximum height potential if they do not receive adequate nutrition during their developmental years.

Light exposure is another environmental factor that can affect phenotypic expression. Many plants exhibit a response known as photoperiodism, which involves their flowering processes being regulated by the duration of daylight or darkness. Some plant species will only flower when the length of daylight surpasses a certain threshold, while others will bloom when the night length exceeds a specific duration.

Moreover, environmental stressors such as toxins, radiation, and pathogens can also influence phenotypic traits. For instance, exposure to radiation can cause mutations in DNA, resulting in alterations to phenotypic characteristics. Similarly, certain pathogens can elicit immune responses that may modify the phenotype of the affected organism.

In conclusion, environmental factors play a vital role in shaping an organism's phenotype through their interactions with genetic components. This complexity underscores the intricate relationship between genes and the environment in determining an organism's traits.
