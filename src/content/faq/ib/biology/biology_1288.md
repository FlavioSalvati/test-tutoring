Cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division, occurs differently in plant and animal cells due to their distinct structural characteristics. In animal cells, this process is referred to as cleavage. It begins with the formation of a cleavage furrow, which appears as a shallow groove on the cell surface. As actin and myosin microfilaments contract, the furrow deepens, pulling the plasma membrane inward. This contraction continues until the parent cell is pinched into two daughter cells, each containing its own nucleus and identical sets of chromosomes.

In contrast, plant cells possess a rigid cell wall that prevents the cleavage process. Instead, plant cells achieve cytokinesis by forming a cell plate at the center of the cell. This cell plate is made up of vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus that align along the metaphase plate. These vesicles fuse to create a disc that expands outward until it reaches the existing cell wall. Subsequently, the cell plate matures into a new cell wall, effectively dividing the parent cell into two daughter cells.

It is crucial to understand that while the mechanisms of cytokinesis vary between plant and animal cells, the ultimate outcome is the same: the division of a single parent cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. This process is essential for growth, repair, and reproduction in both types of organisms. Despite the differences in their cytokinesis processes, both plant and animal cells ensure the accurate and even distribution of genetic material to the new cells.

In summary, the primary distinction between cytokinesis in plant and animal cells lies in their methods of division. Animal cells utilize a cleavage furrow to facilitate this process, while plant cells create a cell plate. These differences arise from the unique structural features of plant and animal cells, particularly the presence of a rigid cell wall in plant cells.
