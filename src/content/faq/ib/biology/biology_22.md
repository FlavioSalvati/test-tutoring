Animals acquire knowledge from their experiences and adjust their behavior through a process known as associative learning, often referred to as conditioning.

Associative learning is a fundamental mechanism through which animals learn and adapt. This process involves forming connections between events or stimuli that occur together in their environment. There are two primary types of associative learning: classical conditioning and operant conditioning.

Classical conditioning, first explored by Ivan Pavlov, occurs when an animal learns to associate a neutral stimulus with a significant one. For instance, a dog may learn to link the sound of a bell (the neutral stimulus) with the arrival of food (the significant stimulus). After multiple pairings, the dog will begin to salivate merely at the sound of the bell, indicating that it has learned from its experiences and modified its behavior accordingly.

In contrast, operant conditioning involves an animal learning to connect its own behavior with specific outcomes. This concept was famously examined by B.F. Skinner through the use of a 'Skinner box'. When an animal's behavior results in a positive outcome (a reward), it is more likely to repeat that behavior in the future. Conversely, if the behavior leads to a negative outcome (a punishment), the animal is likely to avoid that behavior. This process illustrates how animals learn from their experiences to maximize rewards and minimize punishments.

Beyond associative learning, animals also learn from experience through a process known as habituation. This simpler form of learning occurs when an animal reduces or ceases its response to a stimulus after repeated exposure. For example, a bird may initially be frightened by a scarecrow in a field; however, after recognizing that the scarecrow poses no real threat, it will eventually stop reacting to it. This demonstrates yet another way animals learn from their experiences and adapt their behavior.

Finally, animals can learn from one another through a process known as social learning. This involves observing and imitating the behaviors of others. For instance, young chimpanzees learn to use tools by watching older members of their group. This form of learning enables animals to acquire new behaviors without having to rely solely on their own experiences, thereby accelerating the process of behavioral adaptation.
