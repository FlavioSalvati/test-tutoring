The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is grounded in the principles of conservation, sustainable use, and equitable sharing of benefits derived from genetic resources.

Established in 1992, the CBD is a multilateral treaty that aims to achieve three primary goals: the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. These goals are intended to protect the planet's biodiversity and ensure that all nations can derive benefits from their natural resources.

The principle of conservation focuses on safeguarding the variety of life on Earth. This encompasses all forms of life, ranging from microscopic organisms to large mammals, along with the ecosystems they inhabit. The CBD acknowledges that biodiversity is vital not only for its intrinsic value but also for the essential services it provides to humanity, such as clean air and water, food security, and medicinal resources.

The principle of sustainable use emphasizes the importance of utilizing biological resources in a manner that does not jeopardize their long-term viability. This entails ensuring that the consumption of plants, animals, and other components of biodiversity is conducted sustainably, preserving the capacity of future generations to benefit from these resources. This principle recognizes that while humans depend on biodiversity for their well-being, overexploitation or misuse can lead to resource depletion and a decline in biodiversity.

The principle of fair and equitable sharing of benefits is aimed at guaranteeing that all nations, especially those rich in biodiversity, can reap the rewards of their natural resources. This includes the equitable distribution of benefits derived from the use of genetic resources, such as the development of new pharmaceuticals. This principle underscores that while all nations should have access to these resources, those that provide them should also share in the resultant benefits.

Additionally, the CBD highlights the significance of public participation and the inclusion of indigenous and local communities in decision-making processes. It recognizes that these communities often possess profound knowledge of biodiversity and are essential to its conservation and sustainable use.
