Trophic levels are directly related to biomass, as each level represents the total mass of organisms present at that stage in the food chain.

In an ecosystem, organisms are categorized into trophic levels based on their position within the food chain. The first trophic level consists of producers, such as plants, which harness sunlight to produce energy through the process of photosynthesis. The second trophic level is made up of herbivores that feed on these producers. The third level includes carnivores that prey on the herbivores. Each subsequent level consists of organisms that consume those in the level below.

Biomass refers to the total mass of all organisms within a specific group or geographical area. It is typically measured in grams of organic matter per square meter. In the context of trophic levels, biomass indicates the total mass of all organisms at each stage of the food chain.

There is a clear relationship between trophic levels and biomass. As one ascends the trophic levels, the biomass tends to decrease. This phenomenon is often illustrated by the concept of the "pyramid of biomass." The decrease in biomass at higher trophic levels can be attributed to energy loss that occurs at each level. When one organism consumes another, only a small fraction of the energy—approximately $10\%$—is transferred to the consumer. The remainder of the energy is dissipated as heat or utilized by the organism for its metabolic activities.

This energy loss accounts for the reduced number of organisms and lower biomass at higher trophic levels. For instance, a field may support a large population of plants (high biomass), which in turn sustains a smaller population of herbivores (lower biomass), and subsequently supports an even smaller population of carnivores (the lowest biomass).

In summary, trophic levels and biomass are interconnected concepts in ecology. The biomass at each trophic level reflects the energy available at that stage in the food chain, with progressively less energy—and consequently less biomass—available at higher levels. Understanding this relationship is essential for studying energy flow and nutrient cycling within ecosystems.
