The resting potential in neurons arises from the unequal distribution of ions across the neuronal membrane.

The resting potential is a crucial characteristic of neuronal function. It represents the electrical potential difference across the neuron's membrane when the neuron is not actively transmitting signals. This potential typically measures around $-70 \, \text{mV}$. The establishment of this resting potential is primarily due to the unequal distribution of key ions, particularly sodium ($\text{Na}^+$) and potassium ($\text{K}^+$), across the neuronal membrane.

The neuronal membrane is semi-permeable, allowing certain ions to pass through while restricting others. It exhibits greater permeability to $\text{K}^+$ ions compared to $\text{Na}^+$ ions, largely due to the presence of "leak channels." These protein channels facilitate the movement of $\text{K}^+$ ions across the membrane more readily than $\text{Na}^+$ ions. Consequently, there is a higher concentration of $\text{K}^+$ ions inside the neuron and a greater concentration of $\text{Na}^+$ ions outside the neuron.

Additionally, the sodium-potassium pump, a form of active transport, plays a vital role in maintaining this ion gradient. In each cycle, this pump utilizes one molecule of ATP to transport three $\text{Na}^+$ ions out of the neuron while bringing two $\text{K}^+$ ions into the neuron. This mechanism further enhances the concentration of $\text{Na}^+$ ions outside the neuron and $\text{K}^+$ ions inside.

The unequal distribution of these ions generates an electrical gradient across the membrane. Since ions are charged particles, their movement across the membrane can create an electrical potential. This results in the inside of the neuron being negatively charged relative to the outside, thus establishing the resting potential.

In summary, the resting potential in neurons is established by the unequal distribution of ions across the neuronal membrane, primarily driven by the membrane's selective permeability and the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This resting potential is essential for the neuron's ability to transmit signals, as fluctuations in this potential lead to the generation of action potentials, which serve as the neuron's method of communication.
