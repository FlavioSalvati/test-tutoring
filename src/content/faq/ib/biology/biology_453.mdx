Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are critical variations that can significantly influence gene expression and function by modifying the structure of proteins or their regulatory mechanisms.

SNPs represent variations at a single nucleotide position within a DNA sequence among different individuals. They are the most prevalent form of genetic variation, with humans typically possessing approximately $4$ to $5$ million SNPs. These variations can be found within the coding sequences of genes, in non-coding regions, or in the intergenic regions that lie between genes.

When SNPs occur within a gene's coding sequence, they can lead to alterations in the amino acid sequence of the resultant protein. Such changes can produce proteins with modified functions. A well-known example is sickle cell disease, which arises from a SNP that alters the sixth amino acid in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin, subsequently changing the protein's structure and functionality.

SNPs can also be located in non-coding regions, impacting the regulation of gene expression. For instance, SNPs situated in a gene's promoter region can influence the quantity of protein produced by that gene. If a SNP is present in a regulatory element, it can modify the timing and location of gene activity, leading to significant effects on the organism's phenotype.

Moreover, SNPs found in the intergenic regions between genes can also influence gene expression and function. These regions frequently harbor regulatory elements that control the expression of adjacent genes. Consequently, a SNP in these areas has the potential to alter the expression patterns of multiple genes.

In summary, SNPs can exert a diverse array of effects on gene expression and functionality, depending on their genomic location. They can modify the structure and function of proteins, impact gene regulation, and influence the expression of numerous genes. Understanding the implications of SNPs is essential for comprehending genetic variation and its contributions to health and disease.
