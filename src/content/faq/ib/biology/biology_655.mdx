Associative learning and non-associative learning are two fundamental forms of learning that differ primarily in how they involve associations between stimuli. 

**Associative Learning**  
Associative learning is a core type of learning where an animal forms connections between distinct events or stimuli. This process is most commonly exemplified in two paradigms: classical conditioning and operant conditioning. 

In classical conditioning, an animal learns to link a neutral stimulus with a significant one, resulting in a conditioned response. A classic example is Pavlov's experiment with dogs, where the dogs learned to associate the sound of a bell (the neutral stimulus) with food (the significant stimulus). As a result, the dogs would salivate (the conditioned response) at the mere sound of the bell.

Conversely, operant conditioning involves an animal learning to associate specific behaviors with their consequences. For instance, a dog may learn to sit on command because it associates this behavior with receiving a treat, reinforcing the behavior.

**Non-Associative Learning**  
In contrast, non-associative learning refers to changes in behavior that occur in response to a single type of stimulus over time, without forming associations between different stimuli. This form of learning is characterized by two primary processes: sensitization and habituation. 

For example, an animal may initially respond vigorously to a loud noise. However, with repeated exposure to that noise, it may gradually become habituated, leading to a reduced reaction over time. Alternatively, if a mild stimulus is consistently followed by an unpleasant one, the animal may experience sensitization, resulting in an increased response to the mild stimulus.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, the fundamental distinction between associative and non-associative learning lies in the formation of associations. Associative learning entails the animal linking different stimuli or events, which results in behavioral changes. In contrast, non-associative learning leads to behavioral modifications in response to a single stimulus, without any association being formed. Both types of learning are essential for an animal's survival, enabling it to adapt to its environment and respond appropriately to various situations.
