Habituation and sensitisation are two fundamental processes that significantly influence how organisms respond to stimuli. 

**Habituation** is a learning process whereby an organism reduces or entirely ceases its response to a stimulus following repeated or prolonged exposure. This phenomenon can be thought of as a means of "getting used to" a stimulus. For instance, if you live near a busy road, you may initially find the noise of traffic quite disturbing. However, over time, you become habituated to this noise, and it no longer bothers you. This occurs because your nervous system has learned to recognize the noise as non-threatening, thus deeming it unworthy of a response.

In contrast, **sensitisation** is a non-associative learning process characterized by an increased response to a strong or harmful stimulus upon repeated exposure. For example, if you accidentally touch a hot stove, the immediate pain will trigger a strong withdrawal response. Should you touch the stove again, your reaction will likely be quicker and more intense. This heightened response occurs because your nervous system has been sensitised to the stimulus, prompting it to react more vigorously in order to protect you from potential harm.

Both habituation and sensitisation serve as adaptive responses that enhance an organism's chances of survival in its environment. Habituation allows organisms to disregard irrelevant stimuli, thereby conserving cognitive resources for novel and potentially significant stimuli. Conversely, sensitisation ensures that organisms can respond more effectively to threatening stimuli, thereby increasing their likelihood of survival.

In summary, habituation and sensitisation are two essential processes that shape our responses to stimuli. Through habituation, we learn to ignore repetitive, non-threatening stimuli, while through sensitisation, we enhance our responses to potentially harmful stimuli. Together, these processes play a crucial role in helping us navigate and adapt to our environment.
