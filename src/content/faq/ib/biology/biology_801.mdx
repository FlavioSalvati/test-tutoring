Hypotonic solutions have a lower solute concentration compared to the cell, while hypertonic solutions possess a higher solute concentration.

To elaborate, a hypotonic solution is characterized by a lower concentration of solutes (such as salts and sugars) outside the cell than inside. This difference causes water to move into the cell through the process of osmosis, as water naturally flows from regions of lower solute concentration to regions of higher solute concentration. When a cell is immersed in a hypotonic solution, it may swell significantly and could ultimately burst due to the excessive influx of water.

Conversely, a hypertonic solution is defined by a higher concentration of solutes outside the cell than within. In this scenario, water will exit the cell and move into the surrounding solution, again driven by osmosis. When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, it may shrink or become shriveled as it loses water.

These concepts are essential for understanding how cells interact with their environment. For instance, red blood cells in the human body must maintain a careful balance between intracellular and extracellular fluid to avoid bursting or shriveling. This balance is achieved through osmoregulation, a process that involves the movement of water and electrolytes across cell membranes to sustain an optimal concentration of solutes.

In biological terminology, 'hypotonic' and 'hypertonic' are often used to describe the tonicity of a solution in relation to a cell. If the concentrations of solutes in the solution and the cell are equal, the solution is termed isotonic. Grasping the distinctions between hypotonic and hypertonic solutions is fundamental for understanding the principles of osmosis and cell behavior.
