Active transport is a crucial biological process that allows cells to move substances across their membranes, using energy to transport these substances against their concentration gradients.

This process is essential for maintaining a cell's internal environment, which often differs significantly from the external surroundings. Active transport involves the movement of molecules or ions from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration. Unlike passive transport, which occurs through natural diffusion, active transport requires energy, typically in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The mechanism of active transport is primarily facilitated by specialized proteins embedded within the cell membrane, known as carrier proteins or transport proteins. These proteins function as pumps: they bind to specific molecules or ions, and through the utilization of energy, they undergo conformational changes to move these substances across the membrane. This process is commonly referred to as primary active transport.

Active transport can be categorized into two main types: primary active transport and secondary active transport. 

- **Primary active transport** directly uses energy to move molecules across the membrane. A prominent example of this is the sodium-potassium pump found in animal cells, which employs ATP to transport sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) out of the cell while simultaneously bringing potassium ions ($\text{K}^+$) into the cell.

- **Secondary active transport**, in contrast, relies on the electrochemical gradient created by primary active transport. This gradient is utilized to drive the transport of other substances against their concentration gradients. Secondary active transport often occurs in conjunction with the movement of another molecule that is moving down its concentration gradient, thereby providing the necessary energy for the transport of the other molecule.

In summary, active transport is an essential cellular mechanism that employs energy to move substances against their concentration gradients, enabling cells to sustain their internal environments. This process is mediated by carrier proteins in the cell membrane and can involve either the direct use of energy (primary active transport) or the utilization of an electrochemical gradient (secondary active transport).
