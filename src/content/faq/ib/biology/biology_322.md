Volcanic eruptions significantly influence the carbon cycle by releasing substantial amounts of carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) into the atmosphere.

Volcanoes are integral to the carbon cycle, a dynamic process that circulates carbon among the Earth's lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. During an eruption, a volcano emits a variety of gases, including carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$). This emission contributes to the overall functioning of the carbon cycle.

The carbon cycle is a complex network of processes that facilitate the movement of carbon compounds through different compartments of the Earth. This cycle includes the absorption of carbon dioxide by plants during photosynthesis, the release of carbon dioxide through respiration and decay, and the storage of carbon in the Earth's crust and oceans. Volcanic eruptions introduce an additional element to this cycle by liberating carbon that has been stored in the Earth’s interior for millions of years.

The carbon dioxide released during volcanic eruptions originates from the Earth’s mantle. It accumulates there due to geological processes over extensive time periods. When intense heat and pressure within the Earth cause rocks to melt, magma forms. As this magma ascends toward the surface, a decrease in pressure allows dissolved gases, including carbon dioxide, to escape. When the volcano erupts, these gases are expelled into the atmosphere.

Although the total amount of carbon dioxide released by volcanoes is relatively small compared to emissions from human activities, such as the combustion of fossil fuels, large volcanic eruptions can have a notable impact on the carbon cycle. For instance, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 released approximately $42$ million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This amount represents about $0.05\%$ of global carbon emissions for that year.

In addition to releasing carbon dioxide, volcanic eruptions can influence the carbon cycle in other significant ways. The ash and dust ejected during an eruption can obstruct sunlight, which diminishes photosynthesis. This reduction in photosynthetic activity can lead to a temporary decline in the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants, thereby increasing the concentration of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

In summary, volcanic eruptions contribute to the carbon cycle by releasing $\text{CO}_2$ from the Earth's mantle into the atmosphere. This process is part of a broader system in which carbon circulates through different Earth compartments, including air, water, and land. While the carbon dioxide emissions from volcanoes are less than those from human activities, substantial eruptions can still significantly affect the carbon cycle, including altering the rates of plant photosynthesis.
