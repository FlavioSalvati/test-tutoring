Materials are transported across the cell membrane through two primary processes: passive transport and active transport.

**Passive Transport**  
Passive transport is a mechanism that does not require energy from the cell. It involves the movement of substances from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, following the concentration gradient. This process continues until equilibrium is achieved, meaning that the concentrations on both sides of the membrane become equal. There are three main types of passive transport: diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis.

1. **Diffusion**  
   Diffusion is the most straightforward form of passive transport. Small, non-polar molecules, such as oxygen ($O_2$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), can pass directly through the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane without assistance.

2. **Facilitated Diffusion**  
   In contrast, facilitated diffusion aids larger or polar molecules, such as glucose and ions, which cannot traverse the lipid bilayer directly. Instead, these molecules rely on protein channels or carriers to facilitate their movement across the membrane.

3. **Osmosis**  
   Osmosis is a specialized form of diffusion that pertains specifically to water molecules. In this process, water moves from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration, working to dilute the solute and achieve equilibrium.

**Active Transport**  
Conversely, active transport requires energy from the cell, typically in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This process enables cells to move substances against their concentration gradient, from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration. Active transport is vital for maintaining the cell's internal environment, or homeostasis. There are two primary types of active transport: primary and secondary.

1. **Primary Active Transport**  
   Primary active transport directly utilizes ATP to pump substances across the membrane. A well-known example of this is the sodium-potassium pump, which helps maintain the electrochemical gradient necessary for the transmission of nerve impulses.

2. **Secondary Active Transport**  
   Secondary active transport, also referred to as co-transport, indirectly uses ATP. It involves the movement of one substance down its concentration gradient, which in turn provides the energy needed to transport another substance against its gradient.

Additionally, cells employ **bulk transport** mechanisms to move large particles or substantial quantities of substances across the membrane. This process includes the formation of vesicles and occurs through endocytosis (the intake of substances) and exocytosis (the expulsion of substances).

In summary, cells utilize a variety of transport methods to move materials across their membranes, depending on the characteristics of the substance and the energy availability within the cell.
