Active transport is essential for phloem loading, facilitating the movement of sugars against a concentration gradient from source cells to sink cells.

Active transport is defined as the process that requires energy to move substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. In the context of phloem loading, this mechanism is vital for transporting sugars, primarily sucrose, from source cells—where they are synthesized through photosynthesis in the leaves—to sink cells, which are regions of the plant that require these sugars for growth and development.

The process begins in the mesophyll cells of the leaves, where photosynthesis generates sugars. These sugars are then actively transported into the companion cells of the phloem. This transport is facilitated by specific proteins known as sucrose transporters, which are embedded in the cell membranes. These proteins utilize energy derived from ATP to pump sucrose molecules into the companion cells against their concentration gradient.

Once inside the companion cells, sucrose is further transported into the sieve tube elements of the phloem. This process also relies on active transport, resulting in a high concentration of sugars within the phloem. The elevated concentration of sugars creates a water potential gradient, prompting water to move from the xylem into the phloem by osmosis. This influx of water increases the volume within the phloem, generating a pressure gradient that drives the bulk flow of sugars from the source cells to the sink cells.

The sink cells—such as roots, fruits, or other growing regions of the plant—then unload the sugars from the phloem. This unloading often involves active transport as well, moving the sugars from the phloem into the sink cells where they are utilized for growth, storage, or energy production.

In summary, active transport is a fundamental process in phloem loading. It enables the movement of sugars from the source cells where they are produced, into the phloem, and ultimately to the sink cells where they are utilized. This process is crucial for the overall growth and development of the plant, ensuring that all parts receive the necessary nutrients.
