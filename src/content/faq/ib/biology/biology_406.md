Translation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes exhibits significant differences primarily in terms of location, initiation factors, and the speed of the process.

In prokaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm and can begin even before transcription is complete, due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. This simultaneous occurrence of transcription and translation is referred to as "coupled transcription-translation." In contrast, eukaryotes possess a nuclear membrane that separates these two processes: transcription takes place in the nucleus, after which the mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm for translation.

The initiation of translation also varies between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, translation initiation occurs when the small ribosomal subunit binds to a specific sequence on the mRNA known as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. This sequence is located a few nucleotides upstream of the start codon ($AUG$). Conversely, in eukaryotes, translation initiation involves the binding of multiple initiation factors and the small ribosomal subunit to the $5'$ cap of the mRNA. The resulting complex then scans along the mRNA until it locates the start codon.

The speed of translation is another critical distinction. Prokaryotes exhibit a faster rate of translation compared to eukaryotes. This increased speed can be attributed to the smaller cell size and simpler cellular structure of prokaryotes, which enables a more rapid response to environmental changes. In contrast, eukaryotes have a slower rate of translation, likely due to their more complex cellular architecture and the need for tighter regulation of protein synthesis.

Finally, while the termination of translation is fundamentally similar in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes—relying on a stop codon and release factors—eukaryotes also engage in an additional mechanism known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This process degrades mRNAs that contain premature stop codons, thereby preventing the synthesis of defective proteins. Such a mechanism is absent in prokaryotes.

In summary, although the fundamental process of translation is conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes, notable differences exist in terms of location, initiation factors, speed, and mRNA surveillance mechanisms. These differences highlight the varying levels of complexity and regulatory control in protein synthesis between these two groups of organisms.
