When blood pH levels decrease, the kidneys respond by excreting more hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions.

The kidneys are essential for maintaining the body's acid-base balance. When blood pH levels fall, indicating an acidic condition known as acidosis, the kidneys activate mechanisms to restore balance. This process is referred to as renal compensation.

Renal compensation primarily involves two key processes: the excretion of hydrogen ions and the reabsorption of bicarbonate ions. The kidneys are composed of millions of tiny filtration units called nephrons. Each nephron contains a glomerulus and a tubule; the glomerulus filters the blood, while the tubule reabsorbs necessary substances back into the bloodstream and eliminates waste.

In situations where blood acidity increases, the cells lining the tubules can secrete additional hydrogen ions into the urine. This action decreases the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood, which in turn raises the blood's pH level. Concurrently, these tubular cells reabsorb more bicarbonate ions from the urine back into the bloodstream. Since bicarbonate ions are basic, their reabsorption aids in neutralizing the excess acid present in the blood.

Furthermore, the kidneys synthesize a compound known as ammonium ($\text{NH}_4^+$). When blood acidity is heightened, the kidneys can excrete more ammonium into the urine. Ammonium ions can bond with excess hydrogen ions, forming a weak acid that can be eliminated in the urine without significantly affecting its pH level.

In summary, the kidneys respond to low blood pH levels by excreting more hydrogen ions and reabsorbing additional bicarbonate ions. This process is crucial for decreasing blood acidity and restoring the body's acid-base equilibrium. The kidneys' ability to perform these functions is vital for our health, as even minor deviations from the normal blood pH range can lead to serious health consequences.
