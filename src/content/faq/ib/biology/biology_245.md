Genotype and phenotype are fundamental concepts in genetics, playing critical roles in inheritance by defining an organism's genetic makeup and observable traits, respectively.

To elaborate, the genotype refers to the specific set of genes present in an organism's DNA that are responsible for a particular trait. This genetic composition is inherited from an organism's parents. Each organism possesses two alleles for each traitâ€”one inherited from each parent. These alleles can be identical (homozygous) or different (heterozygous). The combination of these alleles, known as the genotype, establishes the organism's genetic potential and variability.

In contrast, the phenotype is the physical manifestation or expression of a trait. It encompasses the observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism, shaped by both its genetic makeup and environmental influences. Phenotypic traits include features such as appearance, development, and behavior.

Understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype is essential for grasping the principles of inheritance and genetic variation. The genotype serves as a set of instructions encoded in DNA that outlines the traits an organism can potentially exhibit. However, the actual expression of these traits, which results in the phenotype, can be affected by a variety of genetic and environmental factors.

For instance, a plant's genotype may indicate the potential to grow to a specific height. Nevertheless, the actual height (the phenotype) may be influenced by external factors such as nutrient availability, sunlight exposure, and disease presence.

In terms of inheritance, the genotype that an organism inherits from its parents lays the groundwork for the traits it may express. However, the traits that ultimately manifest (the phenotype) can also be shaped by the environment in which the organism develops. This is why genetically identical organisms, such as clones, can exhibit different phenotypes when raised in distinct environmental conditions.

In summary, genotype and phenotype are vital in understanding inheritance, as they define an organism's genetic potential and actual physical traits, respectively. The interaction between these two factors, influenced by environmental conditions, contributes to the unique characteristics of each individual organism.
