The rate of cellular respiration varies depending on the substrate utilized, with glucose generally producing the highest rate of ATP synthesis.

Cellular respiration is a biochemical process that occurs in the mitochondria of cells, where adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell, is generated. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of substrate being metabolized. Substrates are the molecules that are catabolized during respiration. While glucose is the most common substrate, other molecules such as fats and proteins can also serve this purpose.

Glucose is considered the preferred substrate for cellular respiration due to its ease of breakdown and high ATP yield. Through the processes of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, the catabolism of a single glucose molecule can produce up to $38$ ATP molecules. This high yield explains why the rate of cellular respiration is typically maximized when glucose is the substrate.

Nevertheless, other substrates can also participate in cellular respiration. Fats, for instance, are hydrolyzed into glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol can be converted into glucose and subsequently enter glycolysis, while fatty acids undergo a process known as beta-oxidation to form acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the Krebs cycle. Although the breakdown of fats results in a substantial ATP yield, the process is slower compared to glucose metabolism, leading to a lower rate of cellular respiration when fats are the primary substrate.

Proteins can also be utilized as substrates in cellular respiration, although this is less common due to the potential harm of degrading the body's own proteins. Proteins are catabolized into amino acids, which can be transformed into compounds that enter either glycolysis or the Krebs cycle. The ATP yield from protein breakdown is moderate; however, similar to fats, the process is slower than glucose metabolism, which results in the lowest rate of cellular respiration when proteins are used as the substrate.

In summary, the choice of substrate has a significant impact on the rate of cellular respiration. Glucose typically leads to the highest respiration rate, followed by fats, while proteins yield the lowest rate.
