Herd immunity plays a vital role in safeguarding individuals who are unable to be vaccinated by decreasing the overall prevalence of infectious diseases within the population.

Herd immunity, often referred to as community immunity, is a form of indirect protection from infectious diseases that occurs when a significant portion of a population becomes immune to an infection. This immunity provides a protective barrier for those who are not immune. In simpler terms, when a large percentage of the population is vaccinated, the disease finds it challenging to spread, as the pool of susceptible individuals becomes limited.

This concept is particularly crucial for protecting individuals who cannot be vaccinated. This group may include young children who are not yet eligible for vaccination, individuals with severe allergies to vaccine components, and those with specific medical conditions that compromise their immune systems, such as HIV or cancer. These individuals are at a higher risk of contracting diseases and rely on herd immunity for their protection.

The principle of herd immunity is particularly relevant to contagious diseases that are transmitted from person to person. When a person receives a vaccination, they not only reduce their own risk of contracting the disease but also lessen the likelihood of transmitting the disease to others. As more individuals within a community get vaccinated, the number of potential hosts for the disease decreases, thereby diminishing the overall amount of the virus or bacteria present in the community. This, in turn, lowers the risk of infection for everyone, including those who cannot be vaccinated.

For herd immunity to be effective, it is essential to achieve a specific threshold of vaccination coverage. This threshold varies depending on the disease but typically ranges from $80\%$ to $95\%$ of the population. If the proportion of immune individuals falls below this threshold, herd immunity may weaken, allowing the disease to spread more easily within the community.

In summary, herd immunity is an essential public health strategy that protects those who cannot be vaccinated. By ensuring that a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, we can reduce the overall prevalence of infectious diseases and provide safety for our most vulnerable members.
