Methane plays a significant role in global warming as it is a highly potent greenhouse gas with a remarkable ability to trap heat.

Methane (CH$_4$) is a colorless and odorless gas that naturally exists in the atmosphere. It is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted due to human activities, following carbon dioxide (CO$_2$). The impact of methane on the atmosphere is considerable, primarily due to its high global warming potential (GWP). The GWP quantifies the amount of heat a greenhouse gas can trap in the atmosphere over a specified time frame, relative to carbon dioxide. Over a 100-year period, methane has a GWP that is 25 times greater than that of carbon dioxide, indicating its superior effectiveness in heat retention.

Methane enters the atmosphere through both natural processes and human activities. Natural sources include wetlands, termites, and oceans, while human-induced sources encompass fossil fuel extraction, agricultural practices (notably rice cultivation and livestock), and waste management. Once released into the atmosphere, methane has an approximate atmospheric lifetime of 12 years, during which it can be transported by winds and undergo chemical reactions.

The reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere results in the production of water vapor and carbon dioxide. This process is crucial because it not only removes methane from the atmosphere but also increases the concentration of carbon dioxide, another significant greenhouse gas. Additionally, the atmospheric reactions involving methane can lead to the formation of ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant and potent greenhouse gas.

The rising concentration of methane in the atmosphere is a key contributor to global warming and climate change. This warming effect results in alterations to climate patterns, the melting of polar ice, rising sea levels, and an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Consequently, efforts to reduce methane emissions are vital for mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change. Strategies to achieve this include adopting improved agricultural practices, decreasing fossil fuel consumption, and enhancing waste management techniques.
