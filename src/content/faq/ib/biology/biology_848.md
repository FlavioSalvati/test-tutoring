The overall equation for cellular respiration can be expressed as:

$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 6\text{CO}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{ATP}.
$$

Cellular respiration encompasses a series of metabolic reactions occurring within the cells of organisms. These reactions convert biochemical energy derived from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), while simultaneously releasing waste products. The processes involved in cellular respiration are predominantly catabolic, meaning they break down larger molecules into smaller ones, thereby releasing energy in the process.

The equation provided above is a simplified representation of the intricate biochemical pathways involved in cellular respiration. It illustrates how one glucose molecule ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$) and six oxygen molecules ($6\text{O}_2$) are transformed into six carbon dioxide molecules ($6\text{CO}_2$), six water molecules ($6\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and energy in the form of ATP.

Cellular respiration can be divided into four distinct stages: glycolysis, the link reaction, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen, whereas the subsequent stages take place in the mitochondria and are dependent on the presence of oxygen.

During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, resulting in a net gain of two ATP molecules. Following this, the link reaction converts each pyruvate molecule into an acetyl CoA molecule, which then enters the Krebs cycle. Although the Krebs cycle produces a small amount of ATP directly, its primary purpose is to generate high-energy electron carriers that are utilized in the electron transport chain.

The electron transport chain is where the majority of ATP is synthesized. In this stage, high-energy electrons derived from the Krebs cycle are used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient is subsequently harnessed to drive the synthesis of ATP.

In summary, cellular respiration is a complex process that involves multiple stages and numerous biochemical reactions. Nevertheless, the overall equation provides a clear and simplified representation of how glucose and oxygen are utilized to produce ATP, carbon dioxide, and water.
