Inbreeding can significantly diminish genetic diversity and heighten the risk of deleterious genetic conditions within animal populations.

Inbreeding, defined as the mating of closely related individuals, can profoundly impact sexual reproduction in animal populations. This impact primarily arises from the reduction in genetic diversity that inbreeding induces. Genetic diversity is vital for the health and survival of a population; it acts as a buffer against environmental changes and diseases by enabling individuals with varying traits to endure and reproduce under diverse conditions. When animals breed with close relatives, their offspring are more likely to inherit the same alleles from both parents. This scenario increases the likelihood of homozygosity, a condition where an individual possesses two identical alleles for a specific gene.

The rise in homozygosity can lead to the manifestation of harmful recessive traits. Many detrimental conditions stem from recessive alleles, which only become apparent when an individual inherits identical recessive alleles from both parents. In genetically diverse populations, these harmful alleles are often masked by dominant alleles. However, in inbred populations, the likelihood of an individual receiving two copies of the same harmful recessive allele is notably heightened. This situation can result in a higher incidence of genetic disorders and a decline in the overall fitness of the population.

Inbreeding can also induce inbreeding depression, which is the reduction in the overall fitness of a population due to increased homozygosity. This phenomenon may lead to decreased fertility, elevated infant mortality rates, reduced body size, and diminished resistance to diseases and environmental stresses. Over time, these factors can contribute to a decline in population size and, in extreme cases, lead to extinction.

It is important to acknowledge that inbreeding can also have some beneficial effects. For instance, it can promote the fixation of advantageous traits and enhance the uniformity of a population, which may be beneficial in specific contexts. Nevertheless, the adverse effects of inbreeding typically outweigh the positive aspects, rendering it a significant concern for conservation efforts.
