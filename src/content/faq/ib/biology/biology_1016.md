Trophic levels are directly related to biomass, as each level signifies the total mass of organisms present at a specific stage within the food chain.

In an ecosystem, organisms are categorized into distinct trophic levels depending on their roles in the food chain. The first trophic level comprises producers, such as plants, which harness sunlight to generate energy through the process of photosynthesis. The second trophic level includes herbivores that feed on the producers, while the third level is made up of carnivores that consume the herbivores. Each successive level consists of organisms that prey on those in the level beneath them.

Biomass, in contrast, refers to the total mass of all organisms within a particular group or geographical area. It is typically measured in grams of organic matter per square meter. When discussing trophic levels, biomass indicates the cumulative mass of all organisms at each stage of the food chain.

There exists a clear relationship between trophic levels and biomass: as one ascends the trophic levels, the biomass tends to decrease. This phenomenon is often illustrated through the concept known as the "pyramid of biomass." The decreasing biomass at higher trophic levels is primarily attributed to energy loss at each stage. When one organism consumes another, only a small fraction of the energy—approximately $10\%$—is transferred to the consumer. The remainder is dissipated as heat or utilized by the organism for its metabolic functions.

This energy loss elucidates why fewer organisms and reduced biomass are found at elevated trophic levels. For instance, a typical field may support a vast number of plants (indicating high biomass), which in turn sustain a smaller population of herbivores (resulting in lower biomass), ultimately supporting an even smaller number of carnivores (yielding the lowest biomass).

In conclusion, trophic levels and biomass are interrelated concepts in ecology. The biomass present at each trophic level reflects the energy accessible at that stage of the food chain, with diminished energy—and consequently, less biomass—available at higher levels. Grasping this relationship is essential for comprehending energy flow and nutrient cycling within ecosystems.
