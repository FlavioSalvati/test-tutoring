Phosphorus is cycled within ecosystems through a series of processes including weathering, plant absorption, animal consumption, and decomposition.

Unlike other essential nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon, phosphorus does not exist in a gaseous form; its cycle is primarily confined to the lithosphere and oceans. The phosphorus cycle begins with the weathering or erosion of rocks, which releases phosphate ions and other minerals into the soil and water bodies. This weathering process is relatively slow and often serves as a limiting factor for ecosystem productivity, as phosphorus is a vital component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, all of which are essential for life.

In terrestrial ecosystems, plants absorb phosphate ions from the soil through their roots. These phosphate ions are then utilized in the formation of organic compounds that are crucial for plant growth. Animals acquire phosphorus by consuming these plants or by eating other animals that have fed on the plants. When plants and animals die, their bodies, along with their waste and any unused phosphorus, are decomposed by organisms such as bacteria and fungi. This decomposition process releases phosphorus back into the soil, making it available for reuse by plants. Additionally, some phosphorus leaches into groundwater, eventually being transported into rivers and ultimately the ocean.

In marine ecosystems, the phosphorus cycle is more intricate. Phosphorus enters the ocean from rivers and becomes incorporated into ocean sediments. Some of this phosphorus is utilized by marine organisms for their metabolic processes. When these organisms die, their remains sink to the ocean floor, where they are decomposed, returning phosphorus to the sediment. Over time, geological uplift can raise these ocean sediments back to the land surface, where weathering can occur again, thus completing the phosphorus cycle.

Human activities, such as mining and the application of phosphorus-rich fertilizers, can significantly disrupt the phosphorus cycle. These actions increase the rate of phosphorus input into ecosystems, which may result in an excess of phosphorus, leading to issues like eutrophication in water bodies. Therefore, understanding the phosphorus cycle is crucial for effectively managing and preserving the health of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
