DNA polymerase is an enzyme that synthesises new strands of DNA during the process of replication.

DNA polymerase plays a crucial role in the replication of DNA, a process that is fundamental to all life. This enzyme is responsible for creating new DNA strands by following the pattern of the existing DNA. It does this by adding nucleotides to the growing DNA strand in a 5' to 3' direction, ensuring the accurate copying of the genetic information.

The process begins when the double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds, separating into two single strands. This is facilitated by another enzyme called helicase. Each of these single strands then serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. DNA polymerase attaches to the single-stranded DNA and begins to move along it, reading the sequence of nucleotides.

As it moves along the template strand, DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to the growing DNA strand. For example, if it encounters an adenine (A) on the template strand, it will add a thymine (T) to the new strand, and vice versa. Similarly, if it encounters a cytosine (C), it will add a guanine (G), and vice versa. This ensures that the new DNA strand is an exact copy of the original.

However, DNA polymerase cannot initiate the synthesis of a new DNA strand on its own. It requires a short sequence of RNA, known as a primer, to provide a starting point. Once the primer is in place, DNA polymerase can add nucleotides to its end, extending the DNA strand.

In addition to its role in synthesising new DNA strands, DNA polymerase also has a proofreading function. It checks the newly synthesised DNA strand for errors and corrects any mistakes it finds. This ensures the high fidelity of DNA replication, maintaining the integrity of the genetic information.

In summary, DNA polymerase is a vital enzyme in the process of DNA replication, responsible for synthesising new DNA strands, ensuring the accurate copying of genetic information, and maintaining the integrity of the genetic code through its proofreading function.
