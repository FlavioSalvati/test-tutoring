Microtubules are vital components of the cytoskeleton, providing structural integrity, facilitating movement, and assisting in cell division. They are one of the three primary elements of the cytoskeleton, alongside actin filaments and intermediate filaments.

Microtubules are hollow, tube-like structures made up of protein subunits known as tubulins. These tubulins polymerize into long chains, which form the walls of the microtubules. As the largest components of the cytoskeleton, microtubules have a diameter of approximately $25$ nanometers.

One of the essential functions of microtubules is to offer structural support to the cell. They help maintain the cell's shape and serve as a framework that allows organelles to move within the cell. This structural role is particularly critical in neurons, where microtubules facilitate the transport of neurotransmitters and other materials along the length of the nerve cell.

Moreover, microtubules are crucial during cell division. In the process of mitosis, they form the mitotic spindle, a structure responsible for separating chromosomes into two daughter cells. Microtubules attach to chromosomes at the kinetochore, a protein complex located on the centromere of each chromosome, and move them toward opposite poles of the cell. This mechanism ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical complement of chromosomes.

In addition to their structural and divisional roles, microtubules are integral to various types of cell movement. They constitute the core of cilia and flagella, which are hair-like structures that extend from the cell surface and enable motility. The arrangement of microtubules in these structures follows a '9+2' pattern, consisting of nine doublets of microtubules surrounding a central pair. This specific organization allows cilia and flagella to bend and move in a coordinated manner.

In conclusion, microtubules are indispensable components of the cytoskeleton, providing structural support, facilitating movement, and playing a critical role in cell division. Their diverse functions underscore their significance in maintaining cellular structure and function.
