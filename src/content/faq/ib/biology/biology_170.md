The overall equation for cellular respiration can be expressed as follows:

$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 6\text{CO}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{ATP}
$$

Cellular respiration encompasses a series of metabolic reactions that occur within the cells of living organisms. This process is crucial for converting biochemical energy derived from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), while simultaneously releasing waste products. The reactions involved in cellular respiration are primarily catabolic, meaning they break down larger molecules into smaller ones, thereby releasing energy.

The aforementioned equation simplifies the intricate series of steps that comprise the biochemical pathways of cellular respiration. It illustrates how one molecule of glucose ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$) and six molecules of oxygen ($6\text{O}_2$) are transformed into six molecules of carbon dioxide ($6\text{CO}_2$), six molecules of water ($6\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and energy in the form of ATP.

Cellular respiration can be divided into four distinct stages: glycolysis, the link reaction, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and does not require oxygen, while the subsequent stages take place in the mitochondria and are oxygen-dependent.

During glycolysis, a single molecule of glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate, resulting in a net gain of two ATP molecules. Following this, the link reaction transforms each pyruvate molecule into an acetyl CoA molecule, which then enters the Krebs cycle. Although the Krebs cycle produces a small amount of ATP directly, its primary role is to generate high-energy electron carriers that are utilized in the electron transport chain.

The electron transport chain is the site where the majority of ATP is synthesized. In this stage, high-energy electrons derived from the Krebs cycle are used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, establishing a proton gradient. This gradient is then harnessed to facilitate the synthesis of ATP.

In summary, cellular respiration is a sophisticated process involving multiple stages and a variety of biochemical reactions. Despite its complexity, the overall equation offers a simplified depiction of how glucose and oxygen are utilized to produce ATP, carbon dioxide, and water.
