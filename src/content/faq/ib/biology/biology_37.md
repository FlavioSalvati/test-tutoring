Nanoparticles play a crucial role in targeted drug delivery, allowing for the precise transport of medication directly to diseased cells, which helps minimize side effects.

Nanoparticles are defined as extremely small particles that range in size from $1$ to $100$ nanometers. They have transformed the field of medicine, particularly in drug delivery applications. Their diminutive size and large surface area make them ideal carriers for delivering drugs straight to the disease site, such as a tumor. This targeted approach reduces the impact on healthy cells, thereby minimizing unwanted side effects.

Targeted drug delivery can be accomplished through two primary strategies: passive targeting and active targeting. 

In passive targeting, nanoparticles loaded with drugs tend to accumulate in tumor tissues. This occurs because tumors typically have leaky blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage, a phenomenon known as the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. This accumulation allows for a higher concentration of the drug to reach the tumor cells, thereby enhancing its therapeutic effect while reducing systemic toxicity.

Conversely, active targeting involves modifying the surface of the nanoparticles with specific ligands or antibodies that bind to receptors that are overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells. This modification enables the nanoparticles to selectively target diseased cells, delivering the drug payload directly where it is needed. This targeted delivery not only increases the drug's efficacy but also minimizes damage to healthy cells.

Nanoparticles utilized in drug delivery can be composed of various materials, including lipids, polymers, and metals. The choice of material significantly influences the properties of the nanoparticles, such as their size, shape, and surface charge. These properties, in turn, affect characteristics like drug loading capacity, stability, and release profiles. For instance, liposomes—spherical vesicles consisting of one or more phospholipid bilayers—are frequently employed due to their biocompatibility and capability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs.

In summary, the application of nanoparticles in targeted drug delivery presents a promising strategy for enhancing the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. By delivering drugs directly to the disease site, nanoparticles can improve the therapeutic effects of medications while minimizing side effects. Nonetheless, ongoing research is essential to fully comprehend the potential risks and challenges associated with this innovative technology.
