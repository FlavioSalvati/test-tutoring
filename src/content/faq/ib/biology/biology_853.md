Translation in protein synthesis is the process by which ribosomes decode messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce proteins.

To elaborate, translation is the second step in the overall process of protein synthesis, following transcription. This process takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell, specifically on ribosomes. It begins when a ribosome binds to an mRNA molecule, acting as the site where the genetic code carried by the mRNA is translated into a polypeptide chain (protein).

The mRNA is read in sequences of three nucleotides known as codons, with each codon corresponding to a specific amino acid. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it reads one codon at a time. For each codon, a molecule of transfer RNA (tRNA), which carries the corresponding amino acid, binds to the codon. Each tRNA molecule contains an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon it recognizes, ensuring the correct amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain.

The ribosome facilitates the formation of a peptide bond between the newly arrived amino acid and the existing chain. Once this bond is established, the tRNA that delivered the previous amino acid detaches from the ribosome and exits, allowing the next tRNA with its associated amino acid to bind. This cycle continues until a stop codon is encountered on the mRNA. Stop codons do not correspond to any amino acid; rather, they signal the termination of protein synthesis.

Following translation, the newly synthesized polypeptide chain undergoes several modifications to become a fully functional protein. These modifications may involve folding into a specific three-dimensional structure, the attachment of additional molecules, or the combination with other polypeptide chains.

In summary, translation is a sophisticated process in which ribosomes decode mRNA to synthesize proteins. This essential part of protein synthesis enables the expression of genetic information encoded in DNA, allowing proteins to perform a wide range of functions within the cell.
