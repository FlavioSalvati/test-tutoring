Sister chromatids are separated during mitosis by the pulling action of spindle fibers in the anaphase stage.

Mitosis is a vital process of cell division that results in the formation of two genetically identical daughter cells. It is an essential component of the cell cycle and consists of several distinct stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The actual separation of sister chromatids takes place during the anaphase stage.

In the initial phases of mitosis, the DNA within the cell's nucleus undergoes replication, resulting in two identical copies. These copies, referred to as sister chromatids, are connected at a region known as the centromere. As the cell progresses into metaphase, the sister chromatids align along the equatorial plane of the cell, where spindle fibers—protein structures—attach to the centromeres.

The critical events occur during anaphase. At this stage, the centromeres divide, and the spindle fibers begin to shorten, effectively pulling the sister chromatids apart. This pulling mechanism is supported by motor proteins that 'walk' along the spindle fibers, dragging the chromatids toward opposite poles of the cell. This process ensures that each new daughter cell will receive one copy of each chromosome.

By the conclusion of anaphase, the sister chromatids have been successfully separated and are now recognized as individual chromosomes. They are pulled to opposite ends of the cell, primed for the final phase of mitosis, telophase, during which two new nuclei will form around these chromosomes.

The separation of sister chromatids is a crucial event in cell division, guaranteeing that each daughter cell inherits an exact copy of the genetic material. Any mistakes in this process can lead to genetic abnormalities in the daughter cells, underscoring the significance of the precise and coordinated actions of spindle fibers and motor proteins during anaphase.
