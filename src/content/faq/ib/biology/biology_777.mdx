Cytokinesis in plant cells is the process by which the cytoplasm divides to form two daughter cells.

This process is an integral part of the cell cycle, specifically occurring at the final stage of cell division following mitosis. In contrast to animal cells, which separate through the formation of a cleavage furrow, plant cells achieve cytokinesis through the creation of a cell plate due to the presence of a rigid cell wall.

The process of cytokinesis initiates during the late stages of mitosis, particularly in telophase. During this phase, the Golgi apparatus generates vesicles filled with cell wall materials, such as cellulose. These vesicles transport along microtubules to the center of the cell, known as the equatorial plane, where they fuse to create a disc-like structure referred to as the cell plate or phragmoplast. This cell plate then expands outward toward the existing cell walls, facilitated by the microtubules.

As the cell plate continues to grow, additional vesicles are incorporated, and the materials contained within them are utilized to build the new cell walls. Ultimately, the cell plate merges with the pre-existing cell wall, effectively partitioning the original cell into two distinct cells. Each newly formed cell acquires its own plasma membrane and cell wall.

It is essential to understand that cytokinesis in plant cells is a highly regulated process. The orientation of the cell plate is influenced by the pre-prophase band, which is a ring of microtubules and actin filaments that forms prior to the onset of mitosis. This band serves to indicate the location for the future cell wall, ensuring that cell division occurs accurately.

In summary, cytokinesis in plant cells entails the formation of a cell plate that extends outward, dividing the cell into two. This process is orchestrated by microtubules and involves the transport of vesicles from the Golgi apparatus, which supply the necessary materials for constructing the new cell walls.
