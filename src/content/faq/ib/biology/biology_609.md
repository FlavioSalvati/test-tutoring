Penetrance in genetic inheritance refers to the proportion of individuals with a specific genotype who exhibit the expected phenotype.

Penetrance is a key concept in genetics that quantifies the probability that a particular gene will manifest its effects in an individual. This probability is typically expressed as a percentage, representing the fraction of individuals carrying a specific genotype who also display the corresponding phenotype. For example, if a gene has a penetrance of $80\%$, this indicates that $80\%$ of individuals who inherit that gene will exhibit the related trait or condition.

To assess penetrance, geneticists often conduct population studies. They identify individuals who carry a particular gene variant and evaluate whether these individuals express the associated trait or condition. The penetrance is then calculated by dividing the number of individuals expressing the trait by the total number of individuals with the gene variant. For instance, if $70$ out of $100$ individuals with a certain gene variant express the associated trait, the penetrance is $70\%$.

It is essential to recognize that penetrance can be classified as complete or incomplete. Complete penetrance signifies that every individual possessing the gene variant expresses the trait, whereas incomplete penetrance indicates that only a subset of these individuals expresses the trait. Factors contributing to incomplete penetrance may include the influence of other genes, environmental conditions, or random chance.

Additionally, penetrance can be age-dependent, meaning that the trait may not manifest until a certain age. This phenomenon is observed in certain genetic disorders, such as Huntington's disease, where symptoms typically do not emerge until adulthood, despite the individual carrying the gene from birth.

In summary, penetrance is a vital concept for understanding how genes influence traits and conditions. It is quantified by determining the proportion of individuals with a specific gene variant who express the corresponding trait, thus providing valuable insights into the likelihood of a gene's expression in an individual.
