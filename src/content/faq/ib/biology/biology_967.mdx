A nucleosome is the fundamental unit of chromatin, consisting of a segment of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins. This core is made up of eight histone proteins, specifically two each of four types: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Collectively, these histones form an octamer, which serves as a spool for the DNA strand. Approximately 147 base pairs of DNA are wound around this histone octamer.

The DNA segment wrapped around the histone octamer is not continuous; it is interrupted by a stretch of linker DNA. This linker DNA can vary in length, typically ranging from about 20 to 60 base pairs, and serves to connect one nucleosome to the next in the chromatin fiber. Associated with this linker DNA is a fifth type of histone, known as the linker histone, or H1. The H1 histone binds to the DNA as it enters and exits the nucleosome, contributing to the overall stability of the structure.

The nucleosome structure is essential for compacting long DNA molecules so that they can fit within the cell nucleus. Furthermore, it plays a critical role in gene regulation. The way DNA is wrapped around histones can prevent access to the genetic information by the cellular machinery responsible for reading and copying DNA. Importantly, the nucleosome structure is dynamic; histones can undergo various chemical modifications that change their interactions with DNA and other proteins, thereby regulating the accessibility of the DNA.

In summary, a nucleosome is a complex assembly formed from DNA and histone proteins. The DNA is wound around a core composed of eight histones, with a segment of linker DNA connecting adjacent nucleosomes. The linker histone H1 enhances the stability of the nucleosome structure. The arrangement and modifications of nucleosomes are crucial for both the compaction of DNA and the regulation of gene expression.
