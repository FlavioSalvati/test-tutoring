Hormones play a vital role in regulating glucose levels in the body, primarily through the actions of insulin and glucagon.

Insulin and glucagon are two hormones produced by the pancreas that are essential for maintaining normal blood glucose levels. These hormones function in tandem to ensure that cells receive the appropriate amount of glucose to meet their energy requirements.

Insulin is released in response to elevated blood glucose levels, such as after consuming a meal. It facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells, particularly in muscle and fat tissues, where it is utilized for energy. Additionally, insulin prompts the liver to convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage. This process effectively lowers the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream, returning it to normal levels.

Conversely, glucagon is released when blood glucose levels are low, such as during fasting or between meals. It stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen back into glucose, which is subsequently released into the bloodstream. This mechanism increases blood glucose levels, ensuring that cells have a consistent energy supply even in the absence of dietary glucose.

Beyond insulin and glucagon, other hormones also contribute to the regulation of blood glucose levels. For instance, the stress hormone cortisol elevates blood glucose levels by promoting glucose production in the liver while inhibiting glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Similarly, growth hormone raises blood glucose levels by decreasing glucose uptake in cells and enhancing glucose production in the liver.

In summary, hormones regulate glucose levels in the body by managing the production, storage, and uptake of glucose. Insulin and glucagon are the primary regulators in this dynamic process, while other hormones, such as cortisol and growth hormone, provide supplementary control. This intricate hormonal interplay ensures that blood glucose levels remain within a narrow range, supplying cells with a steady energy source while preventing the detrimental effects associated with excessively high or low blood glucose levels.
