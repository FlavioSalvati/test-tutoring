Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that transforms diploid cells into haploid cells through two sequential rounds of division, effectively halving the chromosome number.

During meiosis, a single diploid parent cell divides to produce four daughter cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes compared to the original parent cell. This process is essential for sexual reproduction and plays a significant role in increasing genetic diversity. Meiosis consists of two main stages: meiosis I and meiosis II, each comprising several phases.

In meiosis I, the diploid parent cell first undergoes DNA replication. This replication yields two identical copies of each chromosome, referred to as sister chromatids. Unlike mitosis, where sister chromatids are separated, meiosis I involves the pairing of homologous chromosomes—one inherited from each parent. These homologous chromosomes undergo a process called crossing over, where they exchange segments of genetic material. This genetic recombination is a key contributor to genetic variation among offspring. Following this, the homologous chromosomes are separated into two new cells, resulting in two haploid cells, each containing one complete set of chromosomes.

Meiosis II follows, during which the sister chromatids in each haploid cell are separated. This division yields a total of four haploid daughter cells, each possessing one copy of each chromosome, thus having half the chromosome number compared to the original diploid parent cell. This reduction in chromosome number is vital for sexual reproduction, as it enables the fusion of two haploid gametes—an egg and a sperm—to form a new organism with the correct diploid chromosome number.

In summary, meiosis produces haploid cells from diploid cells through two rounds of cell division, effectively reducing the chromosome number by half. The process encompasses DNA replication, the pairing and separation of homologous chromosomes, and the separation of sister chromatids. This mechanism not only ensures the proper chromosome count in sexually reproducing organisms but also enhances genetic diversity through recombination.
