Primary succession is the process of ecosystem development in newly formed, uninhabited areas, whereas secondary succession occurs in regions that have previously been inhabited but are now disturbed.

Primary succession describes the gradual sequence of community formation in environments that were once lifeless. Such environments may include newly formed volcanic islands or areas that have been stripped bare by geological events, such as landslides. The process begins with the colonization of pioneer species, typically lichens and mosses, which are capable of surviving in harsh conditions. These pioneer organisms contribute to soil formation by breaking down rocks and adding organic material as they die and decompose. As soil develops, it can support more complex plant species, which further modify the habitat and lead to a succession of diverse plant and animal communities over time. This entire process can span hundreds to thousands of years before reaching a stable climax community.

In contrast, secondary succession occurs in areas where a community has existed previously but has been disturbed or removed due to events such as wildfires, floods, or human activities like deforestation. Since the soil in these areas is already present, the process of succession is generally more rapid than in primary succession. It begins with the establishment of species that are quick to colonize disturbed areas, often including grasses and weeds. Over time, these initial species are gradually replaced by larger plants and trees, and the animal species present also change as the habitat evolves. The final climax community may resemble the original one, but this similarity depends on the nature of the disturbance and the subsequent environmental conditions.

In summary, the key distinction between primary and secondary succession lies in their starting conditions and the pace of development. Primary succession initiates in lifeless areas, requiring a long duration for soil development, while secondary succession takes place in disturbed areas where soil is already established, facilitating a quicker recovery and evolution of the ecosystem.
