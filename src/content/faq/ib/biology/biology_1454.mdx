Sensory receptors play a crucial role in converting stimuli into electrical signals through a process known as transduction.

Transduction refers to the mechanism by which sensory receptors transform physical or chemical stimuli into electrical signals that can be processed by the nervous system. This process is essential for how organisms perceive and interact with their surroundings.

Sensory receptors are specialized cells capable of detecting specific types of stimuli, such as light, sound, temperature, pressure, or chemical composition. These receptors are typically located in sensory organs, including the eyes, ears, skin, tongue, and nose. When a stimulus is detected, it induces a change in the receptor's membrane potential, known as the receptor potential.

The receptor potential is an electrical signal generated by the movement of ions across the receptor's membrane. This movement is usually initiated by the opening or closing of ion channels, which are protein structures embedded within the membrane. The specific type of ion channel that is activated, along with the direction of ion movement, determines whether the receptor potential results in depolarization (a decrease in membrane potential) or hyperpolarization (an increase in membrane potential).

If the receptor potential surpasses a specific threshold, it can trigger an action potential. An action potential is characterized by a rapid and substantial change in membrane potential that propagates along nerve fibers to the central nervous system. This mechanism enables the nervous system to receive information regarding the stimulus.

The intensity of the stimulus is encoded in the frequency of action potentials. A stronger stimulus leads the sensory receptor to generate action potentials more frequently, allowing the nervous system to differentiate between various intensities of stimuli.

In summary, sensory receptors facilitate the conversion of stimuli into electrical signals through transduction. This process involves generating a receptor potential, which may initiate an action potential if it exceeds a defined threshold. The frequency of these action potentials encodes the strength of the stimulus, enabling the nervous system to interpret and respond to sensory information effectively.
