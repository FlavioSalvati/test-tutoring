Innate behavior is instinctual and genetically programmed, whereas learned behavior is acquired through experience and interaction with the environment.

Innate behavior, often referred to as instinctual behavior, is a fundamental aspect of an animal's biology. It is genetically encoded and typically displayed by all individuals within a species. This type of behavior is automatic and reliable, requiring no prior experience or learning. For instance, a spider spinning a web or a bird constructing a nest are prime examples of innate behaviors. Such behaviors are essential for survival and reproduction, occurring in response to specific stimuli.

Conversely, learned behavior is not genetically predetermined; it is acquired through personal experiences and interactions with the surrounding environment. Unlike innate behaviors, learned behaviors can vary significantly among individuals within a species, as they depend on unique experiences. Furthermore, learned behaviors can evolve over time and be adapted to fit changing circumstances. For example, a dog that learns to sit on command or a bird that develops a new song exemplifies learned behaviors.

The distinction between innate and learned behavior is not always straightforward. Some behaviors may encompass elements of both. For example, many animals possess an inherent fear of predators, but the specific fears they develop and their reactions can be shaped by learning.

Innate behaviors are frequently examined within the field of ethology, which is the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethologists concentrate on behaviors that are genetically encoded and thus consistent across a species. In contrast, learned behaviors are often analyzed through the lenses of animal cognition and psychology, which explore how animals learn from their experiences and adapt their behaviors in response to environmental changes.

Grasping the difference between innate and learned behavior is vital in the field of biology. It enhances our understanding of how animals adapt to their environments, how they learn and evolve, and how various species have developed distinct survival strategies.
