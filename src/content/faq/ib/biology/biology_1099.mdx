Keystone species are essential for preserving the structure and function of their ecosystems.

These organisms exert a disproportionately large influence on their environment relative to their numbers. Keystone species are critical in maintaining the structural integrity of an ecological community, impacting numerous other organisms and helping to shape the types and populations of various species within that community.

The concept of a keystone species was first introduced by Robert T. Paine in 1969. He observed that certain species, such as the starfish *Pisaster ochraceus*, significantly influenced community structure. When these starfish were removed from their ecosystem, there was a dramatic surge in the population of mussels, their primary prey. This population explosion led to a substantial decline in the diversity of other species, highlighting the starfish's crucial role in maintaining the ecosystem's balance and diversity.

Keystone species can be predators, like the starfish, but they may also be herbivores or even plants. For example, elephants are regarded as keystone species in the African savannah because they help regulate the population of specific tree species. By doing so, they enable grasses to flourish, which supports a diverse array of grazing animals. Similarly, certain plants can be considered keystone species, as they provide vital resources—such as food and habitat—for a wide range of organisms.

The removal of a keystone species can trigger a cascade of changes within the ecosystem, often leading to a reduction in biodiversity and potentially resulting in ecosystem collapse. Consequently, identifying and protecting keystone species is a fundamental aspect of conservation biology. However, recognizing these species can be challenging, as their impact on the community may not become evident until they are removed or their populations significantly decline.

In summary, keystone species are vital in shaping their ecosystems and sustaining biodiversity. Their presence or absence can have profound effects on community structure and function, illustrating the complex interdependencies that characterize ecological communities.
