A eukaryotic chromosome is defined as a linear DNA molecule intricately associated with histone proteins, culminating in a compact structure known as chromatin.

Eukaryotic chromosomes reside within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Each chromosome consists of a lengthy, linear DNA molecule that is tightly coiled around proteins called histones. This complex of DNA and protein is termed chromatin. The primary function of chromatin is to efficiently compress DNA into a compact unit that can fit within the nucleus while also safeguarding the integrity of the DNA structure and sequence.

The DNA molecule is responsible for carrying the cell's genetic information and comprises two antiparallel strands that together form a double helix. Each strand is a polymer made up of nucleotides, which are the fundamental building blocks of DNA. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sequence of these nitrogenous bases along the DNA strand encodes the genetic instructions.

Histone proteins are essential to the architecture of a eukaryotic chromosome. They serve as spools around which DNA winds, facilitating its condensation. A group of eight histones forms a histone octamer, around which approximately $146$ base pairs of DNA are wrapped, creating a structure known as a nucleosome. These nucleosomes are further compacted to form a more condensed structure called chromatin fiber, which is subsequently coiled and folded to produce the chromosome.

The structure of chromosomes undergoes significant changes throughout the cell cycle. During interphase, chromosomes are less condensed and actively participate in gene transcription. In contrast, during cell division, chromosomes become highly condensed, allowing them to be visible under a light microscope. This increased condensation is crucial for the efficient separation of chromosomes during cell division.

In addition to DNA and histones, eukaryotic chromosomes also encompass various proteins that assist in DNA replication, repair, and gene expression. These proteins include enzymes such as DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase, as well as regulatory proteins.

In summary, the architecture of a eukaryotic chromosome is intricate and comprises a long DNA molecule, histone proteins, and additional proteins. This complex structure enables the cell to store substantial amounts of genetic information compactly, protect the DNA, and regulate gene expression effectively.
