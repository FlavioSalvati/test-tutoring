Nanoparticles are increasingly being utilized in targeted drug delivery systems to transport medications directly to diseased cells, thereby minimizing side effects.

These nanoparticles, which are incredibly small particles ranging from $1$ to $100$ nanometers in size, have transformed the field of medicine, particularly in drug delivery applications. Their diminutive size and large surface area make them exceptional carriers for delivering drugs straight to the site of disease, such as tumors. This targeted approach significantly reduces the impact on healthy cells and minimizes unwanted side effects.

Targeted drug delivery can be achieved through two primary mechanisms: passive targeting and active targeting. 

In passive targeting, drug-loaded nanoparticles accumulate in tumor tissues naturally due to the unique characteristics of tumor vasculature, which includes leaky blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage. This phenomenon is referred to as the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. As a result, a higher concentration of the drug is delivered to the tumor cells, enhancing its therapeutic impact while also reducing systemic toxicity.

Conversely, active targeting involves modifying the surface of the nanoparticles with specific ligands or antibodies that can bind to receptors that are overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells. This modification allows the nanoparticles to selectively locate and attach to the diseased cells, facilitating the direct delivery of the drug payload. This targeted delivery not only boosts the drug's efficacy but also minimizes damage to healthy cells.

Nanoparticles used in drug delivery can be constructed from a variety of materials, including lipids, polymers, and metals. The choice of material influences the properties of the nanoparticles—such as their size, shape, and surface charge—which in turn affects their drug loading capacity, stability, and release characteristics. For instance, liposomes, which are spherical vesicles formed from one or more phospholipid bilayers, are frequently employed due to their biocompatibility and ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs effectively.

In summary, the application of nanoparticles in targeted drug delivery presents a promising strategy for enhancing the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. By delivering drugs directly to the disease site, nanoparticles can improve the therapeutic effects of medications while minimizing adverse side effects. Nonetheless, further research is essential to fully understand the potential risks and challenges associated with this innovative technology.
