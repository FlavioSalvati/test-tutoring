Bacteria can be engineered to produce human hormones through a technique known as recombinant DNA technology, or genetic engineering.

Recombinant DNA technology involves manipulating DNA to create novel combinations of genes, which can then be introduced into organisms such as bacteria. This method is specifically employed to engineer bacteria for the production of human hormones.

The process begins with isolating the gene responsible for coding the desired hormone from human DNA. This is typically accomplished using enzymes called restriction endonucleases, which are capable of cutting DNA at specific sequences. Once the gene is isolated, it is inserted into a small, circular DNA molecule known as a plasmid, which naturally occurs in bacteria. This insertion is facilitated by another enzyme, DNA ligase, which joins together the fragments of DNA.

After incorporating the human gene into the plasmid, the next step is to introduce the plasmid into a bacterial cell through a process called transformation. Once inside the bacterial cell, the plasmid can replicate, leading to the production of numerous copies of both the plasmid and the human gene it carries. As the bacteria grow and divide, they also synthesize the human hormone, which can subsequently be harvested and purified for medical use.

This innovative process has enabled the production of various human hormones in bacteria, including insulin, growth hormone, and erythropoietin. For instance, prior to the advent of recombinant DNA technology, insulin was extracted from the pancreases of pigs and cowsâ€”a method that was not only costly but also posed the risk of allergic reactions in some patients. Today, thanks to genetic engineering, bacteria can produce human insulin that is identical to that produced by the human body, thereby enhancing safety and efficacy for individuals with diabetes.

In summary, recombinant DNA technology has transformed the production of human hormones, enabling their large-scale synthesis in a cost-effective and safe manner. This advancement has significantly impacted the treatment of various medical conditions, greatly improving the quality of life for many patients.
