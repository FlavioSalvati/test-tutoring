Competitive inhibitors decrease enzyme activity by blocking the active site, which prevents substrate binding.

These inhibitors are molecules that share a similar structure to the enzyme's substrate, allowing them to compete for the active site of the enzyme—hence the term "competitive." When a competitive inhibitor occupies the active site, it prevents the substrate from binding, thereby diminishing the enzyme's activity. This occurs because the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, essential for the reaction to proceed, cannot take place.

The inhibitory effect of competitive inhibitors can be mitigated by increasing the concentration of the substrate. As the substrate concentration rises, the probability of a substrate molecule colliding with the enzyme and binding to the active site—rather than the inhibitor—also increases. Consequently, the presence of a competitive inhibitor raises the apparent $K_m$ (Michaelis constant) of the enzyme, which is defined as the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of its maximum. However, the maximum reaction rate, denoted as $V_{max}$, remains unchanged, as it can still be achieved if the substrate concentration is sufficiently high.

It is crucial to understand that competitive inhibitors do not permanently bind to the enzyme; they attach and detach from the active site, allowing the substrate the opportunity to bind. This behavior contrasts with non-competitive inhibitors, which bind to an allosteric site (a location other than the active site) on the enzyme. This binding induces a conformational change in the enzyme structure, hindering substrate binding regardless of the substrate concentration.

In summary, competitive inhibitors decrease enzyme activity by competing with the substrate for the enzyme's active site, preventing the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex and thus inhibiting the reaction. However, this effect can be counteracted by increasing the substrate concentration, which enhances the likelihood of substrate binding over that of the inhibitor.
