Facilitated diffusion and active transport are two essential mechanisms that cells employ to transport substances across their membranes. Although both processes involve the movement of materials through proteins in the membrane, they function differently and have distinct characteristics.

**Facilitated Diffusion**  
Facilitated diffusion is a form of passive transport that allows substances to traverse cell membranes with the aid of carrier proteins. This process occurs naturally and does not require the cell to expend energy. Instead, substances move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, following their concentration gradient. This movement continues until the concentration of the substance becomes equal on both sides of the membrane, achieving equilibrium. Common examples of substances that utilize facilitated diffusion include glucose and ions, which cannot pass directly through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane without assistance.

**Active Transport**  
In contrast, active transport is a process that necessitates energy, typically in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to move substances against their concentration gradientâ€”from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration. This process is mediated by specific proteins in the cell membrane known as pumps. These pumps harness the energy from ATP to undergo conformational changes that enable them to transport substances across the membrane. Active transport is vital for maintaining the cell's internal environment, allowing it to accumulate essential nutrients while expelling waste products. A well-known example of active transport is the sodium-potassium pump, which is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient necessary for nerve impulse transmission.

**Summary**  
In summary, both facilitated diffusion and active transport involve the movement of substances across the cell membrane with the assistance of proteins, but they differ significantly in energy requirements and the direction of movement. Facilitated diffusion is a passive process that transports substances down their concentration gradient without energy input, while active transport is an energy-dependent process that moves substances up their concentration gradient.
