Bacterial cells and plant cells exhibit several fundamental differences in terms of size, complexity, organelle presence, and cell wall composition.

Firstly, bacterial cells are generally much smaller and simpler than plant cells. Their typical size ranges from $1$ to $5$ micrometres in length, while plant cells usually measure between $10$ and $100$ micrometres. Bacterial cells are classified as prokaryotic organisms, which means they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Instead, their genetic material is organized into a single circular chromosome located in the nucleoid region. In contrast, plant cells are eukaryotic; they possess a defined nucleus that contains multiple linear chromosomes. Additionally, plant cells are equipped with various membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, which are not found in bacterial cells.

Another significant distinction is the composition of their cell walls. Bacterial cell walls are primarily composed of peptidoglycan, a complex polymer made up of sugars and amino acids. This structure provides rigidity, helping to protect the cell and maintain its shape. In contrast, plant cell walls are mainly made of cellulose, a polysaccharide consisting of glucose units. While both types of cell walls provide structural support and protection, their compositions are markedly different.

Furthermore, bacterial cells reproduce through a process known as binary fission, which is a form of asexual reproduction. This process involves the replication of the bacterial chromosome followed by the division of the cell into two identical daughter cells. Plant cells, on the other hand, reproduce both sexually (through meiosis and fertilization) and asexually (via mitosis and cell division).

Lastly, bacterial cells can be categorized as either autotrophic or heterotrophic. Autotrophic bacteria derive their energy from sunlight or chemical reactions, while heterotrophic bacteria obtain energy from organic matter. In contrast, plant cells are predominantly autotrophic, utilizing photosynthesis to convert sunlight into chemical energy stored in glucose.

In summary, bacterial and plant cells differ significantly in their size, complexity, presence of organelles, cell wall composition, and methods of reproduction and energy acquisition. These differences illustrate their distinct evolutionary adaptations and the unique roles they play in their respective environments.
