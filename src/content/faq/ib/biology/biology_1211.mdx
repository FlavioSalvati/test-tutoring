The genetic code is interpreted during translation in groups of three nucleotides referred to as codons.

Translation is a crucial process in which the ribosome—a cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis—reads the genetic code. This process initiates with the initiation phase, where the ribosome attaches to the messenger RNA (mRNA) at the start codon, which is typically $AUG$. The ribosome interprets the genetic code in triplets of nucleotides known as codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or serves as a stop signal.

As the ribosome traverses the mRNA, it reads the codons in the 5' to 3' direction. For each codon read, a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule that carries the associated amino acid binds to the codon. Each tRNA has an anticodon region that is complementary to the mRNA codon, ensuring that the correct amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain.

This process continues through the elongation phase of translation. The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading the codons and facilitating the binding of tRNA molecules. The amino acids delivered by these tRNA molecules are linked together by peptide bonds, forming a polypeptide chain. This chain will ultimately fold into a functional protein.

The translation process concludes during the termination phase when the ribosome encounters a stop codon, which can be $UAA$, $UAG$, or $UGA$. These stop codons do not correspond to any amino acid and signal the termination of protein synthesis. At this stage, the polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome, and the translation machinery disassembles.

In summary, the genetic code is interpreted during translation in triplets of nucleotides, known as codons. The ribosome reads these codons and facilitates the binding of tRNA molecules carrying the corresponding amino acids. This process continues until a stop codon is recognized, marking the conclusion of protein synthesis.
