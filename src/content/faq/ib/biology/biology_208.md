Polysaccharides are synthesized from monosaccharides through a biochemical process known as dehydration synthesis or a condensation reaction.

To elaborate, polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates composed of more than two monosaccharides, which are the simplest forms of sugars. The mechanism that links these monosaccharides is termed dehydration synthesis, also referred to as a condensation reaction. This designation arises from the fact that a molecule of water ($H_2O$) is produced, or "condensed out," during the reaction.

The process initiates when two monosaccharides come into close contact. Each monosaccharide contains a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) and a hydrogen atom ($-H$) that are attracted to one another. As they approach, the hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide combines with the hydroxyl group from the other, resulting in the formation of a water molecule. This reaction leaves behind a covalent bond between the two monosaccharides, thus forming a disaccharide.

This synthesis can continue as additional monosaccharides are added to the chain, resulting in the formation of a polysaccharide. With each new monosaccharide incorporated into the chain, another molecule of water is released. This is the reason the process is termed dehydration synthesis; water is eliminated each time a bond is formed.

The bonds created during this process are known as glycosidic bonds. These are covalent bonds, which involve the sharing of electrons between atoms, rendering them strong and stable. This stability is a key factor that allows polysaccharides to exist as large and complex molecules.

Various polysaccharides can be generated depending on the types of monosaccharides utilized and the specific manner in which they are linked. For instance, both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides derived from glucose monosaccharides; however, they exhibit distinct structures and properties due to the different ways in which the glucose units are connected.

In summary, the formation of polysaccharides from monosaccharides is a process that involves dehydration synthesis or a condensation reaction, during which a molecule of water is released and a glycosidic bond is established each time a monosaccharide is added to the chain.
