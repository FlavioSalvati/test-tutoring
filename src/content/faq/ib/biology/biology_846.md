Enzymes serve as catalysts in metabolic reactions, accelerating the rate of these processes without being consumed in the reaction itself.

As biological catalysts, enzymes enhance the speed of chemical reactions within the body without undergoing any permanent changes. They achieve this by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur. Activation energy is defined as the minimum amount of energy necessary for reactants to transform into products during a chemical reaction. By reducing this energy barrier, enzymes facilitate the reaction, thereby increasing its rate.

Enzymes are specialized proteins that possess a unique shape, allowing them to interact with specific molecules known as substrates. The region of the enzyme where the substrate binds is referred to as the active site. The active site and the substrate fit together in a manner akin to a lock and key, ensuring that the enzyme can effectively catalyze its specific reaction.

When a substrate enters the active site of an enzyme, it forms a temporary structure known as an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex lowers the activation energy of the reaction by positioning the substrate in a way that enhances the likelihood of the reaction occurring. Additionally, the enzyme may exert stress on the bonds within the substrate, making it easier for those bonds to break and for new bonds to form. After the reaction takes place, the products are released, and the enzyme is free to catalyze additional reactions.

Enzymes are essential for life, as they enable metabolic reactions to occur at rates sufficient to sustain life. In the absence of enzymes, these reactions would proceed too slowly or might not occur at all, making life as we know it impossible. Enzymes participate in a vast array of biological processes, from digestion to DNA replication. Their activity can be influenced by various factors, including temperature, pH, and the presence of inhibitors or activators.
