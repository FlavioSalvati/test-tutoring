Consanguinity, defined as the marriage between close relatives, significantly influences genetic inheritance by increasing the risk of passing on genetic disorders. This heightened risk arises from the greater likelihood that both parents carry the same harmful recessive genes inherited from a common ancestor. When both parents possess the same recessive gene, there exists a $25\%$ chance in each pregnancy that their child will inherit the gene from both parents, potentially leading to the manifestation of a genetic disorder.

In populations where consanguinity is prevalent, certain genetic disorders may become more common. This phenomenon occurs because harmful recessive genes can proliferate within the gene pool of closely related individuals. For instance, in some Middle Eastern communities where cousin marriages are customary, there is a noted increase in the incidence of genetic disorders such as thalassemia and cystic fibrosis.

It is essential to understand that not all children born to consanguineous couples will develop genetic disorders. While the risk is indeed elevated, it is not inevitable. The actual likelihood of developing such disorders can vary based on several factors, including the specific genes involved and the degree of relatedness between the parents. For example, first cousins share approximately $12.5\%$ of their genes, which results in a higher risk of genetic disorder inheritance compared to individuals who are more distantly related.

Additionally, consanguinity can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity within a population. This diminished diversity may increase the population's vulnerability to certain diseases or changes in environmental conditions, as there is less genetic variation that could confer resistance.

In summary, while consanguinity raises the risk of inheriting genetic disorders, this risk is not absolute. The actual probability can vary significantly based on various factors. Nevertheless, understanding the implications of consanguinity is crucial for genetic counseling and public health initiatives, particularly in regions where intermarriage among relatives is common.
