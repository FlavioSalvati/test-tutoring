DNA is organized within the nucleus as chromatin, which becomes further condensed into chromosomes during cell division.

Within the nucleus of a cell, DNA is not merely free-floating; rather, it is intricately packaged into a compact and orderly structure known as chromatin. This meticulous packaging is essential for accommodating the lengthy DNA molecules within the confined space of the nucleus. The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of a segment of DNA wrapped around eight histone proteins. This structure can be visualized as 'beads on a string,' which is subsequently coiled and folded to form a fiber of packed nucleosomes, leading to the formation of chromatin.

During the interphase of the cell cycle, chromatin exists in a relaxed state, facilitating DNA replication and gene transcription. However, as a cell prepares for division during the mitosis phase, the chromatin undergoes further condensation to form distinct chromosomes. Each chromosome comprises two identical sister chromatids that are connected at a region known as the centromere. This high degree of organization and compaction is crucial for ensuring that the DNA is accurately and efficiently segregated into the two daughter cells during cell division.

The packaging of DNA into chromatin also significantly impacts gene regulation. The level of chromatin condensation can determine whether a gene is accessible for transcription, thereby influencing whether it is activated ('on') or silenced ('off'). For example, regions of DNA that are tightly packed into heterochromatin are generally transcriptionally inactive, while those in more loosely packed euchromatin are typically active. This dynamic nature of chromatin structure enables cells to modulate gene expression in response to various signals and environmental conditions.

In summary, the packaging of DNA within the nucleus is a highly organized and dynamic process. It not only allows the extensive DNA molecules to fit into the limited space of the nucleus but also plays a pivotal role in gene regulation and cell division.
