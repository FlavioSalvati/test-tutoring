The hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle involves a complex interaction among hormones produced by the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the ovaries.

The menstrual cycle is a multifaceted process governed by a series of hormonal changes. It begins with the hypothalamus, a brain region that secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone prompts the pituitary gland to release two critical hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

FSH plays a vital role in stimulating the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles. Each follicle contains an immature egg, and as the follicles mature, they begin to produce estrogen. Estrogen serves two main functions. First, it aids in the thickening of the uterine lining (endometrium) in preparation for a potential pregnancy. Second, it inhibits the production of FSH, thereby preventing the simultaneous maturation of multiple follicles.

Approximately midway through the cycle, a surge in estrogen levels triggers the pituitary gland to release an increased amount of LH. This LH surge causes the most mature follicle to rupture and release its eggâ€”an event known as ovulation. The remnants of the ruptured follicle develop into a structure called the corpus luteum, which subsequently produces progesterone.

Progesterone further prepares the endometrium for pregnancy by enhancing its thickness and vascularization. Additionally, progesterone inhibits the release of FSH and LH, preventing further ovulation within the same cycle. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum disintegrates, resulting in a decline in progesterone levels. This decrease triggers the shedding of the endometrium, leading to menstruation.

The reduction in progesterone levels also lifts the inhibition on FSH and LH, allowing the cycle to begin anew. This intricate interplay of hormones ensures the release of a single egg per cycle and readies the uterus to support a possible pregnancy. The complexity of this hormonal control system is essential for successful sexual reproduction.
