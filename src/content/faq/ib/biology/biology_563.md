X-linked recessive disorders are inherited when a mutated gene located on the X chromosome is transmitted from a parent to their offspring.

To elaborate, X-linked recessive disorders are medical conditions that arise from mutations in genes situated on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in humans, the other being the Y chromosome. Females possess two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).

In the context of X-linked recessive disorders, if a female carries the mutation on one of her X chromosomes, she can pass this affected chromosome to her children. Should she transmit the affected X chromosome to her son, he will express the disorder since he has only one X chromosome. Conversely, if she passes the affected X chromosome to her daughter, the daughter will become a carrier, provided that the other X chromosome (inherited from the father) is unaffected.

For a female to manifest an X-linked recessive disorder, she must inherit two copies of the mutated geneâ€”one from each parent. This scenario is relatively rare, as it necessitates that the father has the disorder and that the mother is at least a carrier.

In contrast, a male requires only one copy of the mutated gene from his mother to exhibit the disorder. This is due to the fact that males possess a single X chromosome, and the Y chromosome typically lacks a corresponding gene to mitigate the effects of the mutated gene located on the X chromosome.

Consequently, X-linked recessive disorders are more prevalent in males than in females. Notable examples of X-linked recessive disorders include hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

From a genetic counseling perspective, it is crucial to recognize that a mother who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder has a 50% probability of passing the affected gene to each of her offspring. If the child is a son, there is a 50% chance he will inherit the disorder. If the child is a daughter, there is a 50% chance she will become a carrier.

It is important to remember that while the inheritance of X-linked recessive disorders involves intricate genetic principles, understanding these mechanisms can aid in the prediction and management of such conditions.
