Biotechnology plays a crucial role in mitigating air pollution by developing cleaner energy sources and enhancing waste management practices.

Biotechnology is defined as the use of living organisms or their components to produce beneficial, often commercial, products. It has the potential to significantly reduce air pollution through several key avenues. One prominent approach is the development of cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. For instance, biofuels—derived from organisms such as plants or algae—serve as viable alternatives to fossil fuels. The combustion of biofuels emits fewer harmful pollutants, including carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$), which are leading contributors to air pollution and climate change.

Additionally, biotechnology can improve waste management processes, further reducing air pollution. Bioremediation, a method that employs microorganisms to degrade harmful substances, can treat industrial waste before its release into the environment. This practice helps prevent the emission of hazardous gases, thereby reducing air pollution. For example, methane ($CH_4$), a potent greenhouse gas, can be captured from landfill sites and converted into electricity, thereby diminishing its atmospheric release.

Moreover, biotechnology can facilitate the development of air-cleaning technologies. Certain bacteria and fungi have the capability to absorb and decompose airborne pollutants, effectively 'cleaning' the air. These microorganisms could be integrated into air filtration systems to lower pollutant levels in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Furthermore, biotechnology can be harnessed to engineer plants that are more efficient at sequestering carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), a significant greenhouse gas. This process, known as biosequestration, aids in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and air pollution reduction.

In conclusion, biotechnology presents a variety of innovative solutions for combating air pollution, ranging from cleaner energy sources and enhanced waste management practices to air purification technologies and biosequestration. However, it is essential to recognize that many of these technologies are still in their developmental stages, and their effectiveness and environmental impacts require thorough evaluation.
