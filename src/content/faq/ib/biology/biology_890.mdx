Enzymes play a vital role in biological processes by acting as catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions within living organisms. They achieve this by lowering the activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to take place. Specifically, enzymes provide an alternative reaction pathway that necessitates less energy than the original pathway.

These enzymes are large proteins characterized by a unique three-dimensional shape, which includes a specific region known as the active site. The active site is the location where the substrate—the molecule upon which the enzyme acts—binds. This binding results in the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex. The precise shape of the active site and its compatibility with the substrate are essential for the enzyme's functionality, a principle that can be illustrated by the 'lock and key' model.

When the substrate binds to the enzyme, it induces changes in the distribution of electrons within the substrate, increasing its likelihood of undergoing a reaction. This phenomenon is referred to as the induced fit model. Additionally, the enzyme may exert strain on the bonds within the substrate, facilitating the breaking of old bonds and the formation of new ones. This process effectively reduces the energy barrier needed for the reaction, thereby lowering the activation energy.

Furthermore, enzymes can decrease activation energy by positioning substrates in close proximity to one another, particularly in reactions involving two substrates. This spatial arrangement enhances the probability of collisions between substrates, consequently increasing the reaction rate.

Enzymes can also modify the microenvironment within the active site to promote the reaction. For instance, certain enzymes can alter the pH level within the active site, making it either more acidic or alkaline, which can further facilitate the reaction.

In summary, enzymes lower activation energy by providing an alternative reaction pathway with reduced energy requirements. They employ various mechanisms, including inducing changes in the substrate, straining bonds, bringing substrates closer together, and creating a favorable microenvironment. This remarkable ability to lower activation energy is critical for sustaining life, as it enables essential biochemical reactions to occur rapidly and efficiently under the temperature and pressure conditions present in living organisms.
