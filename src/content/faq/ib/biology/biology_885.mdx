The cohesion and adhesion properties of water are essential, as they enable capillary action, surface tension, and water's function as a universal solvent.

Water molecules are polar, meaning they possess a positive end and a negative end. This polarity facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules, resulting in cohesion. Cohesion refers to the tendency of water molecules to adhere to one another, which gives rise to many of water's distinctive characteristics. For example, cohesion is responsible for surface tension, which allows small insects to walk on the surface of water without breaking it. Additionally, this property enables water to resist external forces, resulting in the formation of droplets when water is placed on a non-polar surface.

In contrast, adhesion is the property that allows water to stick to other substances, again due to its polarity. This trait is crucial in numerous biological processes. A prime example is the ability of water to move against gravity in plants through capillary action. In this phenomenon, the adhesive forces between water and the walls of the plant's xylem tubes surpass the cohesive forces that exist among the water molecules. Consequently, when water molecules evaporate from the top of the tube (a process known as transpiration), they exert a pull on the water molecules below them, facilitating the upward movement of water from the roots to the leaves.

Furthermore, the interplay between cohesion and adhesion makes water an exceptional solvent. The polarity of water molecules allows them to surround and separate ions in salts and other compounds, leading to their dissolution. This characteristic is vital for life, as it enables water to transport and distribute nutrients, waste products, and other substances within organisms and across the environment.

In conclusion, the properties of cohesion and adhesion in water are fundamental to numerous biological processes and environmental phenomena. They play a crucial role in water's unique capacity to support life on Earth, from facilitating nutrient transport in living organisms to influencing the planet's climate and landscapes.
