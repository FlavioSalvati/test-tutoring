The perception of color in the visual system occurs through the intricate interaction of light with photoreceptor cells located in the retina.

The human eye perceives color through a multifaceted process that begins when light enters the eye and reaches the retina, which is a thin layer of tissue situated at the back of the eye. The retina houses millions of photoreceptor cells, specifically rods and cones, that are essential for detecting light and color. Rods are more sensitive to variations in light and dark, as well as to shapes and movement, but they do not contribute to color vision. In contrast, cones are responsible for color perception and become activated under bright light conditions.

There are three distinct types of cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light: short (S), medium (M), and long (L). These correspond to sensitivity to blue, green, and red light, respectively. When light hits these cones, it initiates a chemical reaction that transmits a signal to the brain. The brain then interprets these signals to create our perception of color, a process known as the trichromatic theory of color vision.

However, the trichromatic theory alone does not account for all aspects of color perception. For example, it does not explain why some individuals can perceive a greater range of colors than others, nor does it clarify how we can see colors that are not present in the light spectrum, such as pink. To address these phenomena, Ewald Hering proposed the opponent-process theory. According to this theory, the cones send signals to the brain that are processed by opponent neurons. These neurons function in pairs of colors: red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white. When one color in a pair is activated, the other is inhibited, allowing us to perceive a broad spectrum of colors.

In summary, the perception of color in the visual system is a complex process that involves the interaction of light with photoreceptor cells in the retina and the subsequent interpretation of these signals by the brain. Both the trichromatic theory and the opponent-process theory are integral to our understanding of this captivating process.
