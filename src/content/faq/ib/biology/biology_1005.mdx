Combustion and decay are two natural processes that significantly impact the carbon cycle by breaking down organic matter and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Both processes involve the decomposition of organic matter, which is rich in carbon, and the subsequent release of this carbon back into the environment. 

**Combustion** is a chemical reaction that occurs when a substance reacts with oxygen. This exothermic process releases energy in the form of heat and light. When organic materials—such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), wood, or other biomass—undergo combustion, the carbon contained within them reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. The resulting carbon dioxide is then emitted into the atmosphere, thereby increasing the concentration of atmospheric carbon.

In contrast, **decay** is a biological process predominantly performed by decomposers, including bacteria and fungi. These organisms break down dead organic matter, such as fallen leaves, deceased animals, and other waste products. During decay, the carbon within the organic material is transformed into various compounds, including carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is subsequently released into the atmosphere or soil, further contributing to the carbon cycle.

Both combustion and decay are vital for recycling carbon within Earth's ecosystems. They help maintain the balance of carbon across the atmosphere, soil, and oceans, which is essential for sustaining life on our planet. However, human activities—such as the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation—can disrupt this balance, leading to elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and exacerbating global warming. Consequently, understanding these processes and their roles in the carbon cycle is critical for effectively addressing climate change.
