Fats provide more energy than carbohydrates during the process of cellular respiration.

In cellular respiration, both carbohydrates and fats are metabolized to produce ATP, the primary energy currency of cells. However, the energy yield from these two macronutrients differs significantly. Specifically, fats, particularly triglycerides, yield more energy per gram compared to carbohydrates. This increased energy yield is attributed to the greater number of hydrogen-carbon bonds in fats, which are more reduced than those in carbohydrates. When these bonds are broken, they release more energy.

Carbohydrates, especially glucose, are generally the body's preferred energy source. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose, which is a six-carbon sugar, is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, a three-carbon compound. This metabolic pathway results in a net gain of two ATP molecules. The pyruvate molecules subsequently enter the mitochondria, where they undergo further breakdown in the Krebs cycle, generating an additional 36 ATP molecules. Therefore, the total ATP yield from one molecule of glucose amounts to $38$ ATP molecules.

In contrast, fats are metabolized into glycerol and fatty acids through a process known as lipolysis. The glycerol can be converted into glucose and then enter the glycolytic pathway. Meanwhile, the fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation, which produces a substantial amount of acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle, as well as NADH and FADH2, which are utilized in the electron transport chain. The total ATP yield from a fat molecule varies based on the length of the fatty acid chain but is typically much higher than that from glucose. For instance, the breakdown of a $16$-carbon fatty acid can yield over $100$ ATP molecules.

In summary, while carbohydrates serve as the body's preferred energy source, fats yield more energy per gram during respiration. This increased energy production is due to the higher number of hydrogen-carbon bonds in fats, which release more energy upon being broken down. However, the metabolism of fats is more complex and slower compared to that of carbohydrates, which is why carbohydrates are often utilized first for energy.
