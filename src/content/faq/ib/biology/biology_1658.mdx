The products of the Krebs cycle are carbon dioxide, ATP, NADH, and FADH2.

The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is a key component of cellular respiration, the process by which cells generate energy. It takes place in the mitochondria, the 'powerhouse' of the cell, and is the second stage of aerobic respiration, following glycolysis and preceding the electron transport chain.

The cycle begins with the combination of a molecule of acetyl CoA, derived from the breakdown of glucose, with a molecule of oxaloacetate to form citrate. This is then converted back into oxaloacetate in a series of reactions, producing two molecules of carbon dioxide, one molecule of ATP, three molecules of NADH, and one molecule of FADH2 per cycle.

The carbon dioxide produced is a waste product and is expelled from the cell and eventually from the body via the lungs. The ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is a direct source of energy for the cell. It can be used immediately to power various cellular processes, from muscle contraction to the synthesis of proteins.

The NADH and FADH2, on the other hand, are not used directly. Instead, they are carriers of high-energy electrons, which they transport to the electron transport chain, the final stage of aerobic respiration. Here, these electrons are used to power the creation of a much larger amount of ATP. This is why the Krebs cycle is so important: while it only produces a small amount of ATP directly, it sets up the conditions for the production of a much larger amount of ATP in the electron transport chain.

In summary, the Krebs cycle is a crucial part of the process of cellular respiration, producing carbon dioxide, ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These products each have important roles to play in the cell, from providing immediate energy to setting up the conditions for the production of even more energy.
