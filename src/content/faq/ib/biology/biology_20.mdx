Photoreceptors in the eye play a crucial role in vision by converting light stimuli into electrical signals that the brain can interpret.

These specialized cells are located in the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer situated at the back of the eye. There are two primary types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low-light conditions, whereas cones facilitate color vision and detail perception in brighter environments.

When light enters the eye, it first passes through the cornea and then the lens, which focus the light onto the retina. Upon reaching the retina, the light strikes the photoreceptors. These cells contain a pigment known as photopigment, which undergoes a chemical transformation upon absorbing light. This transformation initiates the generation of an electrical signal.

In rods, the predominant photopigment is called rhodopsin. When rhodopsin absorbs light, it undergoes a process known as bleaching, where it splits into two components: opsin and retinal. This bleaching process triggers a cascade of chemical reactions that ultimately generate an electrical signal. This signal is then relayed to the brain via the optic nerve.

Cones operate on a similar principle, but they contain three distinct types of photopigments, each sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths. This diversity allows us to perceive various colors. When light strikes a cone, the associated photopigment undergoes a chemical change, resulting in an electrical signal that is dispatched to the brain.

The brain interprets these electrical signals to create a visual image. It is essential to understand that photoreceptors do not "see" the image; rather, they simply convert light into electrical signals. The actual process of vision, which involves interpreting these signals into a coherent visual representation, occurs within the brain.

In summary, photoreceptors in the eye react to light stimuli by undergoing a chemical change that triggers an electrical signal. This signal is subsequently transmitted to the brain, where it is interpreted to form a visual image.
