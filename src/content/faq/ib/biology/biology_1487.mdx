Chemical senses, such as taste and smell, operate by detecting chemical molecules present in our environment and relaying this information to our brain.

Taste, also referred to as gustation, and smell, known as olfaction, are two of the five traditional senses. They are categorized as chemical senses because they are responsible for detecting chemical substances around us. These senses are essential for our survival; they enable us to enjoy food, identify potential dangers (such as smoke or spoiled food), and even influence our social interactions.

The process of taste involves the detection of chemicals that are dissolved in substances like food and beverages. This process begins when food is placed in the mouth, where it dissolves in saliva. The resulting dissolved substances then interact with the taste buds located on the tongue. Each taste bud contains a group of gustatory cells, which are the sensory cells responsible for detecting taste. These cells feature hair-like extensions known as microvilli, which protrude through a pore in the taste bud and come into contact with the dissolved chemicals. When these chemicals bind to receptors on the microvilli, they generate electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via sensory nerves, allowing us to perceive different tastes.

In contrast, the sense of smell involves the detection of volatile chemicals present in the air. This process commences when we inhale, allowing airborne chemicals to enter the nasal cavity. These chemicals then interact with the olfactory epithelium, a specialized tissue located in the upper part of the nasal cavity that houses the sensory cells responsible for smell. These sensory cells also possess hair-like extensions called cilia, which are coated in mucus. When the airborne chemicals dissolve in the mucus and bind to receptors on the cilia, they generate electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the olfactory nerve, enabling us to perceive various scents.

Taste and smell are intricately connected and often work in tandem to shape our perception of flavor. For instance, the aroma of food can significantly enhance its taste. This explains why food may seem bland when you have a cold and your nasal passages are blocked. In conclusion, our chemical senses are crucial for how we interact with and interpret our environment.
