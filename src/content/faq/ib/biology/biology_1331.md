Invasive species significantly impact native communities by disrupting ecosystems, outcompeting indigenous species, and altering habitats.

Often introduced through human activities, invasive species are typically non-native organisms that thrive in new environments where they lack natural predators or regulatory controls. This absence allows them to proliferate unchecked, often outcompeting native species for essential resources such as food and habitat. Consequently, this leads to disruptions in local ecosystems and a decline in biodiversity.

One of the primary mechanisms by which invasive species affect native communities is through competition. Invasive species frequently possess advantages over their native counterparts, including higher reproduction rates, a broader dietary range, and greater resistance to diseases. These advantages enable them to outcompete native species for vital resources, resulting in decreased populations of indigenous organisms. A pertinent example is the grey squirrel, which was introduced to the UK from North America. It has successfully outcompeted the native red squirrel for food and habitat, causing a significant decline in red squirrel populations.

In addition to competition, invasive species can modify habitats, rendering them unsuitable for native species. A notable example is the invasive water hyacinth, which is native to South America but has spread to various regions, including Africa and Asia. This plant grows rapidly, creating dense mats on the surfaces of water bodies. Such growth blocks sunlight and reduces oxygen levels in the water, which can lead to the death of native aquatic plants and animals.

Moreover, invasive species can introduce new diseases to native communities. For instance, the invasive Asian longhorned beetle, which has spread to Europe and North America, carries a fungus that is lethal to numerous tree species. The proliferation of this beetle and its associated fungus has resulted in the death of millions of trees.

In summary, invasive species exert profound effects on native communities by outcompeting local species for resources, altering habitats, and introducing new diseases. These impacts can lead to significant reductions in biodiversity and disrupt the delicate balance of local ecosystems.
