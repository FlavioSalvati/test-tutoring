Exosomes are vital mediators in gene expression, functioning by transporting RNA and proteins that can significantly alter cellular functions.

These tiny vesicles, measuring approximately $30-150$ nanometers in diameter, are released by cells into the extracellular environment. Exosomes are formed within the cell in a region known as the endosome. As the endosome matures, it develops into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that contain numerous small vesicles. These MVBs can either be degraded by lysosomes or fuse with the cell membrane to release the vesicles, which are then referred to as exosomes, into the extracellular space.

Importantly, exosomes are not merely byproducts of cellular metabolism; they serve as carriers of a specific cargo derived from their cell of origin. This cargo can include proteins, lipids, and various RNA types, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). These molecules can be absorbed by recipient cells, thereby influencing their functions. For instance, mRNA can be translated into proteins, while miRNA and lncRNA play crucial roles in regulating gene expression.

The involvement of exosomes in gene expression is particularly noteworthy. They can transport miRNA and lncRNA between cells. Although these types of RNA do not encode proteins, they can modulate gene expression in the recipient cell. For example, miRNA can bind to mRNA, inhibiting its translation into protein and effectively silencing the associated gene. LncRNA also influences gene expression, although the exact mechanisms are less clearly defined.

As a result, exosomes can modify the gene expression profile of recipient cells, subsequently influencing their behavior. This phenomenon has been observed in various contexts, including cancer, where tumor cells release exosomes that affect the behavior of neighboring cells. For instance, exosomes can promote angiogenesis—the formation of new blood vessels—which supplies tumors with essential nutrients, or they can suppress the immune response, allowing the tumor to evade detection.

In conclusion, exosomes play a pivotal role in gene expression by transporting RNA and proteins that can modify cellular functions. They are integral to intercellular communication, and their implications in health and disease continue to be a focus of ongoing research.
