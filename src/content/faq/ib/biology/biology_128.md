Microtubules are vital components of the cytoskeleton, providing structural integrity, facilitating movement, and assisting in cell division.

Microtubules, along with actin filaments and intermediate filaments, represent one of the three main components of the cytoskeleton. These structures are hollow tubes made up of protein subunits known as tubulins. Tubulins polymerize to form long chains that constitute the walls of the microtubule, giving them a diameter of approximately $25 \, \text{nm}$, making them the largest of the cytoskeletal elements.

One of the primary functions of microtubules is to offer structural support to the cell. They help maintain the cell's shape and serve as a scaffold for the movement of organelles. This function is especially critical in neurons, where microtubules facilitate the transport of neurotransmitters and other essential materials along the length of the nerve cell.

In addition to providing structural support, microtubules are pivotal during cell division. During mitosis, they assemble to form the mitotic spindle, a structure responsible for segregating chromosomes into the two daughter cells. Microtubules attach to the chromosomes at the kinetochore, which is a protein complex located at the centromere of each chromosome, and they pull the chromosomes toward opposite poles of the cell. This process ensures that each daughter cell receives an equal complement of chromosomes.

Microtubules also play a significant role in various types of cellular movement. They are the fundamental components of cilia and flagellaâ€”hair-like projections that extend from the cell surface and enable motility. In these structures, microtubules are arranged in a characteristic '9+2' pattern, consisting of nine doublets of microtubules surrounding a central pair. This specific arrangement allows cilia and flagella to bend and move in a coordinated manner, facilitating movement.

In summary, microtubules are essential components of the cytoskeleton that provide structural support, enable movement, and are crucial for cell division. Their diverse roles underscore their importance in maintaining cellular structure and function.
