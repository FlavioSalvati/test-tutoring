Economic growth can indeed serve as a predictor of leisure time availability; however, it is not the only factor at play.

Economic growth is typically quantified by the increase in a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As economies expand, productivity often rises, which can lead to higher wages and potentially shorter working hours, thereby increasing leisure time. This phenomenon is particularly evident in developed nations, where labor laws and regulations frequently promote a balance between work and leisure.

Nonetheless, the connection between economic growth and leisure time is not always linear. In some rapidly growing economies, the competitive pressure to succeed may result in longer working hours, ultimately diminishing leisure time. This situation is commonly observed in emerging economies, where the pursuit of economic growth can foster a culture of overwork.

Additionally, the distribution of economic growth within a society plays a pivotal role. If the benefits of economic growth are not shared equitably, individuals in lower income brackets may not experience an increase in their leisure time. Instead, they may be compelled to work longer hours or hold multiple jobs to make ends meet, even in the context of overall economic growth.

Moreover, the nature of work and prevailing societal norms also significantly impact leisure time. In certain cultures, there may be an ingrained expectation to work extended hours, even when economic conditions improve, thereby constraining leisure time. Furthermore, the emergence of the gig economy and flexible working arrangements can blur the boundaries between work and leisure, complicating the definition and measurement of leisure time.

In conclusion, while economic growth can potentially indicate the availability of leisure time, this relationship is influenced by various factors, including income distribution, work culture, and societal expectations. Thus, it is essential to take these elements into account when examining the interplay between economic growth and leisure time.
