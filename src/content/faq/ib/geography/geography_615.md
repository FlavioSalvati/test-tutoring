A periglacial landscape is characterized by distinct features such as frost heaving, patterned ground, and ice wedges.

Periglacial landscapes typically occur in cold environments, often near the poles or at high altitudes. These landscapes are shaped by the freeze-thaw cycle, a process in which water in the ground freezes and thaws repeatedly, leading to the development of unique geological features. One notable feature is frost heaving, which occurs when the freezing of water in the soil causes the ground to expand and push upwards. This process can create small mounds or hummocks on the surface.

Another prominent characteristic of periglacial landscapes is patterned ground. This term describes the geometric formations that can emerge on the ground due to the movement of soil and stones caused by frost heave. These patterns can take various forms, including circles, polygons, stripes, and nets, and may range in size from a few centimeters to several meters in diameter.

Ice wedges are also a distinctive element of periglacial landscapes. These vertical, wedge-shaped bodies of ice form in the ground as a result of the freeze-thaw cycle. During winter, the ground contracts in response to the cold, leading to the formation of cracks. When the snow melts in spring, water seeps into these cracks and subsequently freezes, producing ice wedges. Over time, these wedges can grow to several meters in both width and depth.

In addition to ice wedges, periglacial landscapes may also feature other forms of ground ice, such as pingos and palsas. Pingos are large, dome-shaped mounds consisting of earth-covered ice, whereas palsas are smaller mounds that contain a core of ice. Both of these features develop due to the freezing of groundwater.

Lastly, periglacial landscapes often exhibit sparse vegetation due to the extreme climatic conditions. This lack of vegetation can lead to the formation of permafrost, a layer of permanently frozen ground that can reach several meters in thickness. The presence of permafrost significantly influences the landscape, causing the ground to buckle and warp as it undergoes the freeze-thaw cycle.
