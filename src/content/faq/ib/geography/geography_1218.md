The primary factors contributing to global water scarcity include the overuse of water, pollution, climate change, and population growth.

**Overuse of Water**  
Overuse of water is a critical driver of water scarcity, particularly in agricultural regions where water consumption accounts for approximately $70\%$ of global freshwater use. The excessive extraction of groundwater for irrigation can result in declining water levels, making access to this vital resource increasingly difficult and costly. Furthermore, inefficient irrigation techniques can lead to substantial water wastage.

**Pollution**  
Another significant contributor to water scarcity is pollution. Industrial activities often discharge harmful chemicals into water bodies, rendering the water unsafe for human consumption. Additionally, improper waste disposal can contaminate water sources, further diminishing the availability of clean water and posing severe health risks.

**Climate Change**  
Climate change is also playing a crucial role in exacerbating water scarcity. Alterations in weather patterns can result in more frequent and severe droughts, which diminish the availability of water. Rising temperatures contribute to increased evaporation rates, further lowering water levels. Moreover, the melting of glaciers and ice caps, which serve as vital freshwater reserves, raises additional concerns.

**Population Growth**  
Lastly, population growth intensifies the issue of water scarcity. As the global population continues to rise, so does the demand for water, particularly in regions where water resources are already strained. Rapid urbanization can place additional pressure on existing water infrastructure, leading to challenges regarding both water supply and quality.

In summary, water scarcity is a multifaceted issue with various interrelated causes. It is a pressing challenge that demands immediate attention and action. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective solutions to mitigate water scarcity.
