Global environmental treaties can indeed be effective in mitigating transboundary pollution; however, their success varies significantly based on several factors.

Global environmental treaties are agreements between nations aimed at protecting the environment and reducing pollution. Transboundary pollution refers to pollution that originates in one country but impacts another, making these treaties crucial for global environmental health. The effectiveness of such treaties depends on various elements, including the commitment of the participating countries, the enforcement mechanisms established, and the specific characteristics of the pollution being addressed.

A notable example of a successful global environmental treaty is the Montreal Protocol. Signed in 1987, this treaty sought to reduce the production and consumption of substances that deplete the ozone layer. It has achieved remarkable success, resulting in a $98\%$ decrease in the global production of ozone-depleting substances. The effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol can be attributed to a strong scientific consensus regarding the harm caused by these substances, the clear and enforceable targets established by the treaty, and the dedication of the participating countries.

In contrast, not all global environmental treaties have experienced the same level of success. The Kyoto Protocol, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has shown mixed results. For instance, some countries, such as Canada, chose to withdraw from the treaty, while others struggled to meet their emission reduction targets. This situation underscores the challenges associated with enforcing global environmental treaties and ensuring commitment from all involved nations.

Moreover, the effectiveness of global environmental treaties can be constrained by the nature of the pollution they aim to address. For example, transboundary air pollution is particularly difficult to manage due to its dependence on wind patterns and other natural phenomena. Similarly, regulating marine pollution poses challenges because it often arises from multiple sources and encompasses various types of pollutants.

In conclusion, while global environmental treaties hold the potential to effectively reduce transboundary pollution, their success hinges on a multitude of factors. These include the commitment and cooperation of the participating countries, the robustness of the enforcement mechanisms, and the specific characteristics of the pollution in question.
