Global power plays a pivotal role in shaping international law and governance by influencing the norms, rules, and decision-making processes that govern international relations.

The concept of global power is often embodied by influential nations that possess substantial economic, political, and military strength. These powerful states significantly impact the creation, interpretation, and enforcement of international laws. Their influence enables them to craft norms and rules that often prioritize their own interests, frequently at the expense of less powerful countries.

A prime example of this dynamic is the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which is tasked with maintaining international peace and security. The council is dominated by five permanent members: the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom. Each of these nations wields the power to veto any resolution, thereby exerting considerable control over the council's decisions. This power imbalance often results in the formulation and enforcement of international laws that disproportionately benefit these influential states.

In addition to impacting international law, global power also plays a significant role in international governance. Dominant nations frequently exert substantial influence over international organizations and institutions, allowing them to shape agendas, policies, and decision-making processes. For instance, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)—two of the most prominent international financial institutions—are heavily influenced by the United States and other powerful countries. This influence often translates into policies and decisions that reflect the interests of these nations.

Moreover, global power can lead to the establishment of new international norms and rules. Influential states can leverage their power to promote standards that align with their objectives. A notable example is the United States, which has actively championed liberal democratic norms and free-market capitalism on the global stage. These principles have become deeply entrenched in international law and governance, significantly shaping the behavior of states and other international actors.

In summary, global power profoundly impacts international law and governance. It determines the creation, interpretation, and enforcement of international laws, influences the policies and decision-making processes of international organizations, and facilitates the emergence of new international norms and rules.
