Government-led strategies for climate adaptation encompass a variety of initiatives, such as the implementation of green infrastructure, the promotion of sustainable agriculture, and the development of climate-resilient urban planning.

One of the primary strategies is the establishment of green infrastructure. This approach involves the creation and maintenance of natural or semi-natural environments that offer essential ecosystem services, including air and water purification, carbon sequestration, and temperature regulation. For instance, the UK government has adopted a green infrastructure strategy that features the development of green roofs, green walls, and urban forests. These initiatives not only contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but also help mitigate the impacts of climate change by providing shade, alleviating urban heat island effects, and managing stormwater runoff.

Another vital strategy is the promotion of sustainable agriculture. This entails the adoption of farming practices that enhance resilience to climate change, such as crop diversification, agroforestry, and organic farming. For example, the government of India has initiated the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), aimed at fostering climate-resilient agricultural practices. This mission includes efforts to improve soil health, optimize water resource management, and encourage the use of climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds.

Climate-resilient urban planning is also essential. This strategy focuses on designing and managing urban areas to minimize their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Key measures may include the construction of flood-resistant infrastructure, the implementation of heatwave action plans, and the promotion of energy-efficient buildings. A notable example is the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which has developed a comprehensive climate adaptation strategy that incorporates innovative solutions such as water squares, green roofs, and floating buildings to address challenges posed by sea-level rise and increased rainfall.

Moreover, governments can introduce policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon pricing and renewable energy targets. These measures not only help mitigate the effects of climate change but also contribute to building resilience against its impacts. For instance, the German government has set an ambitious target to generate $65\%$ of its electricity from renewable sources by $2030$. This goal not only seeks to decrease the nationâ€™s carbon footprint but also aims to enhance the resilience of its energy system in the face of climate change challenges.
