Numerous civil society initiatives are actively addressing climate change, including organizations such as 350.org, Greenpeace, and the Sierra Club.

**350.org** is an international movement comprised of ordinary individuals committed to ending the reliance on fossil fuels and creating a world powered by community-led renewable energy. The organization's name is derived from the safe level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is $350$ parts per million. They organize global action days, launch online campaigns, and directly confront fossil fuel projects. Additionally, they advocate for society to divest from fossil fuels and invest in sustainable alternatives.

**Greenpeace** is a non-governmental environmental organization with a presence in over $40$ countries. Their approach combines direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve their objectives. Since its founding in $1971$, Greenpeace has campaigned against environmental degradation, beginning with a group of volunteers and journalists who sailed into Amchitka, an area north of Alaska where the U.S. government was conducting underground nuclear tests. This tradition of non-violent 'bearing witness' continues today, as they campaign on various issues, including climate change.

**The Sierra Club** is one of the oldest and largest environmental organizations in the United States. Established in $1892$, it boasts over $3.5$ million members and supporters. The Sierra Club's efforts focus on promoting clean energy, protecting public lands, and addressing climate change. They engage in grassroots activism, lobbying, and litigation to achieve their goals. Notably, the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign has been particularly effective, leading to the retirement of over half of the United States' coal plants since $2010$.

Another significant initiative is the **Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL)**, a non-profit, non-partisan grassroots advocacy organization dedicated to influencing national policies to combat climate change. CCL trains and empowers volunteers to build relationships with their elected representatives, aiming to shape climate policy. Their primary policy proposal is a carbon fee and dividend system, which would impose a price on carbon emissions and return the generated revenue to households.

These examples illustrate just a few of the many civil society initiatives actively working to tackle the urgent issue of climate change. They exemplify the power of collective action and highlight the vital role that civil society plays in advancing climate solutions.
