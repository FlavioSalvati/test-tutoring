Urban deprivation is a multifaceted issue primarily driven by factors such as unemployment, inadequate housing, insufficient education and health services, and elevated crime rates.

Unemployment plays a crucial role in urban deprivation. When job opportunities are limited, especially in densely populated areas, poverty levels tend to rise. This situation often stems from the decline of traditional industries, globalization, and the transition to a service-based economy, which can leave certain segments of the population—particularly those with lower levels of education—struggling to secure employment. The consequences of unemployment extend beyond financial hardship; it can adversely affect individuals' self-esteem and mental health, thereby intensifying the overall deprivation.

Inadequate housing is another significant contributor to urban deprivation. Many urban regions, particularly in developing countries, face a severe shortage of affordable and quality housing. This deficiency results in overcrowding and the proliferation of slums, where living conditions are frequently substandard, with limited access to clean water, sanitation, and essential amenities. In developed nations, housing challenges may manifest as homelessness or the presence of 'sink estates', which are areas of concentrated social housing often linked to high levels of poverty and crime.

The lack of quality education and health services further exacerbates urban deprivation. In disadvantaged neighborhoods, schools often lack the resources necessary to deliver a high standard of education, which results in poor academic performance and restricted future employment opportunities. Similarly, health services in these areas may suffer from underfunding and staff shortages, leading to suboptimal health outcomes for residents. These intertwined factors can create a cycle of deprivation that is difficult to escape.

High crime rates serve as both a cause and a consequence of urban deprivation. Areas characterized by high levels of deprivation frequently experience elevated crime rates due to factors such as unemployment, lack of opportunities, and social exclusion. This can result in a 'spiral of decline', where crime deters investment and further entrenches deprivation.

In summary, urban deprivation is a complex phenomenon with multiple interconnected causes. Effectively addressing this issue necessitates a comprehensive approach that targets not only the symptoms but also the fundamental social and economic factors at play.
