Large-scale dam construction can result in the displacement of communities, alterations to local economies, and increased social inequality.

One of the primary consequences of large-scale dam projects is the necessity to relocate individuals residing in areas designated for flooding. This forced displacement can lead to profound social disruption, as communities are fragmented and residents are compelled to abandon their homes. Often, those affected do not receive adequate compensation for their losses, which can exacerbate poverty and social disparity. For instance, the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China resulted in the displacement of over $1,000,000$ people, many of whom faced insufficient compensation and were not provided with appropriate new housing.

In addition to the issue of displacement, dam construction can significantly impact local economies. Many communities in regions affected by dams depend on agriculture or fishing for their livelihoods. The inundation of farmland and the alteration of river ecosystems can have devastating consequences for these populations. A notable example is the Aswan High Dam in Egypt, which has led to reduced fertility in the Nile Delta due to the loss of natural flood cycles, thereby diminishing agricultural productivity.

Moreover, large-scale dams can contribute to social inequality. The advantages of dams, such as electricity generation and improved water supply, frequently benefit urban areas and industrial sectors, while the associated costs disproportionately affect rural communities. This inequity can exacerbate existing social divides and foster tensions among different groups. In India, the construction of the Narmada Dam has sparked ongoing conflict between the government, which views the dam as a vital development initiative, and local communities that endure the negative consequences.

Lastly, dam construction can also have cultural repercussions. Many indigenous groups possess deep cultural and spiritual connections to their land and waterways. The flooding of these territories can lead to a loss of cultural heritage, further intensifying the social impacts of dam projects. For example, the Belo Monte Dam in Brazil has faced substantial criticism for its detrimental effects on indigenous populations, including the submersion of sacred sites and the disruption of traditional lifestyles.
