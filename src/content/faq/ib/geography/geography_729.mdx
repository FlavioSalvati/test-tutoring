Case studies from Japan, Chile, and California illustrate the significant impact of technology in reducing earthquake risks.

Japan is well-known for its cutting-edge earthquake preparedness technologies. A notable example is the Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system, which was launched in 2007. This system detects the initial, less destructive P-waves of an earthquake and provides warnings before the more damaging S-waves arrive. As a result, individuals receive critical seconds to take cover, while trains and factory operations can be automatically halted to prevent accidents. During the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, the EEW system was especially effective, offering warnings of up to $90$ seconds in advance. In addition, Japan boasts some of the world's most rigorous building codes and construction technologies, ensuring that structures are designed to absorb seismic energy and prevent catastrophic failures.

Chile, another country highly susceptible to earthquakes, has also harnessed technology to mitigate risks. In response to the catastrophic earthquake in $2010$, the Chilean government established a national seismic monitoring network, which includes GPS stations and seismographs. This network delivers real-time data on seismic activity, enabling swift responses and evacuations when necessary. Chile has also adopted building practices from Japan, focusing on earthquake-resistant structures that employ flexible materials and base isolation techniques to minimize damage.

In California, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has created the ShakeAlert system, which utilizes seismic data collected from across the state to provide early warnings of earthquakes. This system can send alerts directly to people's mobile phones, granting them valuable seconds to seek safety. Furthermore, the USGS has collaborated with Google to integrate earthquake alerts into Android operating systems, thereby broadening the scope of these warnings. California's stringent building codes require that new constructions are designed to endure severe earthquakes, which has proven essential in reducing the risk of structural collapse during seismic events.

These case studies underscore the vital role of technology in minimizing earthquake risk. Early warning systems can provide individuals with crucial time to take protective measures, while advancements in construction technology can significantly lessen the damage caused by earthquakes. By investing in these technologies, nations can substantially bolster their resilience against seismic hazards.
