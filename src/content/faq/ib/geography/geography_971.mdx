Fast fashion greatly exacerbates resource consumption, particularly in terms of water and energy, while also contributing to environmental pollution.

The term "fast fashion" refers to the rapid production of inexpensive clothing by mass-market retailers, responding swiftly to the latest trends. This sector of the fashion industry is one of the largest consumers of water worldwide. For instance, it takes approximately $2,700$ liters of water to produce a single cotton t-shirt, which is equivalent to the amount an average person drinks over a span of three years. Such excessive water usage stems from the extensive irrigation needed for cotton farming, as well as the water-intensive processes involved in dyeing and finishing fabrics.

In addition to its water consumption, fast fashion is responsible for substantial energy use. The entire production process—ranging from raw material cultivation to manufacturing and transportation—demands significant energy, predominantly sourced from fossil fuels. This reliance on fossil fuels leads to the emission of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. Furthermore, the rapid turnover of clothing encourages consumers to frequently discard and replace their garments, resulting in increased energy consumption associated with the production of new items.

Fast fashion also plays a role in environmental pollution. The dyeing and finishing processes often utilize hazardous chemicals, which can be released into the environment, contaminating water sources and endangering ecosystems. Additionally, a majority of fast fashion products are crafted from non-biodegradable materials such as polyester, which can take hundreds of years to decompose in landfills, during which time they release harmful gases.

In conclusion, the fast fashion industry significantly impacts resource consumption, contributing to water scarcity, increased energy use, and environmental pollution. As consumers, it is crucial to recognize these effects and consider adopting more sustainable choices when purchasing clothing.
