An Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a designated maritime area where a state holds specific rights related to the exploration and utilization of marine resources.

The principle of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is established in international law, granting a state exclusive rights to explore and exploit both living and non-living marine resources within a zone that extends up to $200$ nautical miles from its coastline. This principle is codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which became effective in $1994$.

The EEZ encompasses not only the water column above but also the seabed and subsoil beneath it. Within this zone, the state has the authority to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage living resources, such as fish, as well as non-living resources, including oil and gas. However, the rights of the state over these resources are not without limitations. They come with specific conditions and obligations, including the duty to protect and preserve the marine environment and to respect the rights of other states to navigate and conduct overflights.

In the realm of chemistry, the EEZ is particularly significant for the extraction of marine resources. The seabed within the EEZ may harbor valuable minerals and hydrocarbons, and their extraction typically necessitates sophisticated chemical processes. Moreover, the management and conservation of living resources, such as fish stocks, involve chemical considerations as well. For instance, understanding the chemical composition of the marine environment, including pollutant levels, is vital for the sustainable management of these resources.

In summary, the EEZ is an important concept in international law, granting a state exclusive rights over the exploration and utilization of marine resources within a defined maritime zone. Its implications for the extraction and management of these resources are substantial, making it particularly relevant to the field of chemistry.
