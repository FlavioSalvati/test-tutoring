The main causes of undernutrition globally are poverty, lack of access to healthy food, and poor health infrastructure.

Poverty is a significant factor contributing to undernutrition. Many people in low-income countries cannot afford to buy nutritious food, leading to a diet that is high in calories but low in essential nutrients. This is often exacerbated by economic instability and inflation, which can make food prices skyrocket, making it even harder for the poor to afford a balanced diet. Additionally, poverty can also limit access to clean water and sanitation, leading to diseases that can further exacerbate undernutrition.

Lack of access to healthy food is another major cause of undernutrition. This can be due to a variety of reasons, including geographical isolation, lack of transportation, and lack of local markets selling fresh produce. In many rural areas, people may have to travel long distances to buy food, which can be both time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, in urban areas, there may be 'food deserts' where there are few supermarkets or other sources of fresh food, leading to a reliance on processed, nutrient-poor foods.

Poor health infrastructure also plays a significant role in undernutrition. In many developing countries, health services are inadequate or inaccessible, making it difficult for people to receive the medical care they need. This can lead to a vicious cycle of illness and undernutrition, as diseases can reduce appetite and interfere with the body's ability to absorb nutrients, while undernutrition can weaken the immune system and make people more susceptible to illness. Additionally, lack of education about nutrition can also contribute to undernutrition, as people may not know what types of food are most nutritious or how to prepare them in a healthy way.

In conclusion, undernutrition is a complex issue with multiple causes. However, by addressing poverty, improving access to healthy food, and strengthening health infrastructure, it is possible to make significant progress in reducing undernutrition globally.
