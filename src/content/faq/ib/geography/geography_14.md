Health indicators commonly used in geography include life expectancy, infant mortality rate, and disease prevalence.

**Life Expectancy**  
Life expectancy is a widely recognized health indicator in geography. It represents the average number of years an individual is expected to live, based on current mortality rates. This metric provides valuable insights into the overall health and wellbeing of a population and is often employed to compare the health statuses of different countries or regions. Generally, a higher life expectancy suggests better healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions.

**Infant Mortality Rate**  
The infant mortality rate is another crucial health indicator. It quantifies the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births within a given year. This rate is frequently used to assess a country's health level, as it correlates with various factors such as maternal health, access to quality medical care, socioeconomic conditions, and public health practices.

**Disease Prevalence**  
Disease prevalence is also an important health indicator in geography. It denotes the total number of cases of a specific disease within a population at a particular time. This metric can help identify areas with high disease rates, which may suggest inadequate healthcare services or poor living conditions. Additionally, it can reveal trends and patterns in disease spread, aiding public health planning and intervention efforts.

In addition to the indicators mentioned above, other health metrics utilized in geography include the incidence of specific diseases (such as HIV/AIDS or malaria), vaccination rates, access to clean water and sanitation, and the availability of healthcare services. These indicators can paint a more comprehensive picture of a population's health status and highlight areas where interventions may be necessary to enhance health outcomes.

It's essential to recognize that these health indicators are often shaped by a variety of geographical factors, including climate, location, and the physical environment. For instance, disease prevalence may be higher in regions with inadequate sanitation or in areas susceptible to certain diseases due to their climate or environmental conditions. Consequently, understanding these geographical influences is vital when analyzing health indicators.
