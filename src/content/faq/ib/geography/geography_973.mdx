Countries around the world adopt diverse strategies, legislative frameworks, and public awareness initiatives to tackle the challenge of recycling.

In Europe, nations such as Germany and Sweden are at the forefront of recycling efforts. Germany employs a comprehensive waste management system that features the Green Dot initiative. Under this system, manufacturers and retailers must pay a fee for placing a green dot on their products; this fee increases with the amount of packaging used. This approach incentivizes businesses to minimize packaging and enhances recycling efforts. Conversely, Sweden boasts a remarkable statistic: less than $1\%$ of household waste ends up in landfills. The country has established an integrated national recycling policy, ensuring that recycling stations are located no more than $300$ meters from any residential area, thereby making recycling convenient for citizens.

In Asia, Japan has developed a distinctive method for recycling. The country enforces a stringent waste sorting system, categorizing waste into groups such as burnable, non-burnable, and various specific recycling categories for plastic bottles, cans, and paper. This meticulous sorting process has resulted in a high recycling rate. Similarly, South Korea employs a volume-based waste fee system, where residents are charged based on the amount of waste they dispose of. This system encourages both waste reduction and increased recycling.

In contrast, developing countries like India and Kenya face significant hurdles due to insufficient infrastructure and limited public awareness. Nonetheless, they are making progress in enhancing their recycling initiatives. For instance, India has launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), which aims to promote cleanliness and encourage recycling. Meanwhile, Kenya has enacted a ban on the use and manufacture of plastic bags, which have been a major source of environmental pollution.

In the Americas, Canada benefits from a well-established curbside recycling program. The United States, however, presents a mixed picture, with recycling policies that differ greatly from state to state. Some states, such as California, have robust recycling programs, while others are less advanced.

In Australia, the government has introduced the National Waste Policy, which outlines a framework for coordinated action among businesses, governments, communities, and individuals through the year $2030$. This policy includes a ban on waste exportation to ensure that Australia responsibly manages its own waste.

In summary, approaches to recycling vary significantly between countries, influenced by factors such as economic development, infrastructure, legislative measures, and public awareness. Despite these differences, the shared objective remains clear: to reduce waste and foster a more sustainable future.
