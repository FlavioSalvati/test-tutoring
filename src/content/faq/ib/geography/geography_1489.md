International policies play a vital role in enhancing resilience to geophysical hazards by establishing frameworks for disaster risk reduction and fostering international cooperation.

These policies are essential for developing comprehensive disaster risk reduction strategies, which encompass understanding risks, minimizing risks, managing residual risks, and reinforcing mechanisms for disaster recovery. A prime example is the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, adopted by United Nations member states. This framework aims to significantly reduce disaster risks and associated losses in lives, livelihoods, and health. It delineates four key priorities for action: 

1. Understanding disaster risk,
2. Strengthening disaster risk governance,
3. Investing in disaster risk reduction, and 
4. Enhancing disaster preparedness.

International policies also facilitate cooperation and collaboration among nations. Geophysical hazards, by their nature, transcend national borders, impacting multiple countries simultaneously. Consequently, effective management of these hazards necessitates international collaboration. For instance, the Paris Agreement on climate change encourages countries to unite in efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change, which can intensify geophysical hazards.

Moreover, international policies play a crucial role in resource allocation for disaster risk reduction. They can guide the distribution of international aid and technical assistance to nations that are particularly vulnerable to geophysical threats. A notable example is the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015, which preceded the Sendai Framework. This framework emphasized the importance of leveraging knowledge, innovation, and education to cultivate a culture of safety and resilience at all levels, leading to increased investments in research, development, education, and training in disaster risk reduction.

Furthermore, international policies ensure that disaster risk reduction is integrated into sustainable development and climate change adaptation strategies. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), acknowledges that reducing disaster risk is crucial for sustainable development. It advocates for the incorporation of disaster risk considerations into national and local development planning.

In conclusion, international policies profoundly shape resilience to geophysical hazards. They provide essential frameworks for disaster risk reduction, promote cooperative international efforts, guide resource allocation, and ensure the integration of disaster risk reduction into broader development strategies.
