Policies aimed at addressing informal activities in urban environments can take the form of legalisation, regulation, and the provision of social protection.

**Legalisation** is one of the most effective strategies for managing informal activities in cities. This approach entails recognizing the informal sector as a legitimate component of the economy and granting it the same rights and protections as the formal sector. For example, in many countries, street vendors are often deemed illegal and face frequent harassment or eviction. However, if their activities were legalised, these vendors could be allocated designated areas for operation, which would not only secure their income but also enhance contributions to the local economy. Furthermore, legalisation can simplify the process of starting a business, thereby facilitating the transition of informal enterprises into the formal sector.

**Regulation** serves as another critical policy instrument. This may involve establishing standards for informal businesses to ensure that they operate safely and ethically. For instance, in the construction sector, informal workers often lack essential training and equipment, which compromises their safety. By implementing regulations, governments can mandate that these workers receive proper training and are equipped with the necessary tools, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and enhancing the quality of their work. Additionally, regulation can enforce labor laws to protect informal workers from exploitation.

Lastly, the **provision of social protection** is vital for effectively addressing informal activities in cities. Informal workers frequently do not have access to social security benefits such as healthcare, pensions, and unemployment insurance. By extending these benefits to the informal sector, governments can create a safety net for these workers, decreasing their vulnerability to economic shocks and improving their overall well-being. This can be accomplished through various mechanisms, such as contributory schemes where workers pay into a fund in exchange for benefits, or non-contributory schemes funded by the government or other sources.

In summary, addressing informal activities in urban areas necessitates a multifaceted approach that includes legalisation, regulation, and social protection. These policies not only enhance the lives of informal workers but also contribute significantly to the overall development of cities.
