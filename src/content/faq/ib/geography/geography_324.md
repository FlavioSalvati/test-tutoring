Globalization processes amplify the social responsibilities of Transnational Corporations (TNCs) by broadening their influence across various communities and environments around the globe.

Globalization encompasses the interaction and integration of individuals, businesses, and governments on a worldwide scale. Consequently, TNCs operate in multiple countries, impacting not only the global economy but also the societies and environments across national borders. This expanded reach inherently heightens their social responsibilities.

One significant way in which globalization affects TNCs' social responsibilities is through the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). CSR is a self-regulating business model that ensures a company remains socially accountable to itself, its stakeholders, and the public. As TNCs engage in operations across different countries, they are expected to respect and comply with local laws, customs, and societal expectations, which can vary widely from one location to another. This necessitates that TNCs be adaptable and sensitive to the diverse social norms and values they encounter, thereby increasing their social responsibilities.

Furthermore, globalization has led to heightened scrutiny of TNCs' operations. With the advent of digital media and instantaneous communication, any negative impact a TNC has on a community or the environment can quickly become global news. This enhanced visibility compels TNCs to be more accountable for their actions and to carefully consider the social and environmental consequences of their operations.

Additionally, globalization has fostered a stronger emphasis on sustainable practices. Given that TNCs often have a considerable environmental footprint, there is mounting pressure from consumers, governments, and non-governmental organizations for these corporations to adopt sustainable practices. This includes reducing their carbon emissions, minimizing waste, and ensuring that their operations do not harm local ecosystems. The focus on sustainability further intensifies TNCs' social responsibilities.

In summary, globalization processes profoundly influence the social responsibilities of TNCs. By operating in multiple countries, TNCs exert a broader impact on diverse communities and environments, which enhances their social responsibilities. This includes respecting local customs and laws, being accountable for their actions, and committing to sustainable practices.
