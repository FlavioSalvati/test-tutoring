Life expectancy around the world is generally on the rise, driven by advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and overall living conditions.

Life expectancy is defined as the average number of years a person is expected to live, influenced by their year of birth, current age, and various demographic factorsâ€”including gender. Over the past century, there has been a remarkable increase in global life expectancy, primarily due to enhancements in healthcare, nutrition, sanitation, and living conditions.

In the early 20th century, the global average life expectancy was approximately $30$ years. By the end of that century, this figure had more than doubled to $67$ years. This upward trend has persisted into the 21st century, with the World Health Organization reporting a global average life expectancy of $73.2$ years in $2020$.

Several key factors contribute to the rise in life expectancy. First and foremost, advancements in healthcare have had a profound impact. The development and widespread implementation of vaccines and antibiotics have significantly lowered mortality rates from infectious diseases. Additionally, improvements in medical technology and treatment options have enhanced survival rates for serious conditions such as cancer and heart disease.

Secondly, better nutrition has played a crucial role in increasing life expectancy. A deeper understanding of nutritional needs, along with greater access to a diverse array of food, has helped to combat malnutrition and its related health issues.

Thirdly, living conditions have improved dramatically over the past century. Access to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities has increased, which has helped reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. Housing conditions have also seen significant enhancements, with more individuals enjoying safe and comfortable living environments.

Despite these advancements, it is important to recognize that substantial disparities in life expectancy still exist between different regions and countries. Generally, high-income countries report higher life expectancies, while low-income countries tend to have lower averages. These differences are largely attributable to variations in access to healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. Furthermore, within countries, disparities in life expectancy can arise from factors such as socioeconomic status, race, and gender.

In summary, while global life expectancy is on the rise, addressing the existing disparities is crucial to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to lead a long and healthy life.
