Coastal erosion is closely linked to ocean-atmosphere interactions, which are influenced by climate change and shifting weather patterns.

Ocean-atmosphere interactions are fundamental to shaping the Earth's climate and weather systems. These interactions involve the exchange of energy, moisture, and momentum between the ocean and the atmosphere, which can subsequently affect weather phenomena, sea levels, and ocean currents. When natural or human-induced climate changes disrupt these factors, the consequences can significantly exacerbate coastal erosion.

A primary mechanism through which this occurs is the rise in sea levels. As global temperatures increase due to elevated greenhouse gas emissions, the oceans absorb a substantial amount of this heat, leading to thermal expansion. Additionally, the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers contributes to rising sea levels. Elevated sea levels result in more frequent and severe coastal flooding, which accelerates the erosion of coastlines.

Changes in weather patterns, another consequence of ocean-atmosphere interactions, can further intensify coastal erosion. For example, the increasing frequency and severity of storms can produce higher waves and storm surges, which erode coastal areas. Furthermore, alterations in precipitation patterns can affect the volume of sediment delivered to the coastline. A reduction in sediment supply can accelerate coastal erosion, while an increase can help to bolster the shoreline.

Additionally, shifts in ocean currents—driven by changes in wind patterns and temperature gradients—can also impact coastal erosion. For instance, if a current that traditionally deposits sediment along a coastline alters its course due to changes in wind patterns, this can result in increased erosion as the sediment supply diminishes.

In summary, ocean-atmosphere interactions, particularly those modified by climate change, are crucial factors in the dynamics of coastal erosion. Understanding these interactions and their implications is vital for developing effective strategies to manage and mitigate the impacts of coastal erosion.
