Ocean acidification poses a serious threat to fish populations, which in turn affects the productivity and sustainability of fisheries.

This phenomenon is primarily driven by increased carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) emissions. The oceans absorb approximately one-third of the $\text{CO}_2$ released into the atmosphere, resulting in a decrease in seawater pHâ€”a process referred to as ocean acidification. This change in chemistry has profound implications for marine life, especially for shellfish and other organisms that depend on calcium carbonate for their shells and skeletons.

Fisheries rely heavily on these species, both directly as a source of catch and indirectly as integral components of the food web. As ocean acidification hampers the ability of these organisms to form and maintain their shells, their populations may decline. This decline can lead to reduced availability of these species for fishing, resulting in decreased catches and potentially significant economic losses for the fishing industry.

Furthermore, research indicates that ocean acidification can directly influence the behavior and physiology of fish. For example, studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of $\text{CO}_2$ can disrupt a fish's sense of smell, which is critical for locating food, evading predators, and finding suitable habitats. Such sensory impairments could lead to increased mortality rates and reduced population sizes, further affecting fishery yields.

Additionally, ocean acidification can alter the composition of marine ecosystems. Some species exhibit greater tolerance to acidic conditions than others, leading to potential shifts in species dominance. This shift may favor harmful algal blooms and jellyfish over commercially valuable fish and shellfish species, further diminishing the productivity and sustainability of fisheries.

In conclusion, the long-term impacts of ocean acidification on fisheries are likely to be significant and potentially catastrophic. It is therefore imperative to reduce $\text{CO}_2$ emissions and mitigate the effects of ocean acidification to safeguard the health of our oceans and the livelihoods of those who depend on them.
