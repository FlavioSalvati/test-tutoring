Land-use change significantly impacts hazard vulnerability by modifying the natural environment and enhancing exposure to various risks.

Land-use change refers to the transformation of land from one purpose to another. This may involve converting a forest into an agricultural field, a wetland into a residential area, or a rural landscape into an urban environment. Such transformations can substantially affect hazard vulnerability in multiple ways.

Firstly, land-use changes frequently entail the removal of natural vegetation. This deforestation can heighten vulnerability to hazards such as landslides and flooding. For example, trees and plants are essential for stabilizing soil and absorbing rainwater. When these natural barriers are removed, the soil becomes more prone to erosion and landslides, while the risk of flooding escalates due to diminished water absorption capacity.

Secondly, land-use changes can create new areas that are prone to hazards. Constructing residential or commercial developments in floodplains or on unstable slopes places both people and property at greater risk. Similarly, converting natural landscapes into agricultural fields may lead to soil degradation, which in turn increases vulnerability to drought conditions.

Thirdly, land-use changes can amplify the effects of climate change, thereby increasing hazard vulnerability. For instance, deforestation contributes to global warming by releasing stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This process can intensify weather-related hazards such as storms, heatwaves, and rising sea levels.

Additionally, land-use changes can indirectly influence hazard vulnerability through socio-economic factors. Urbanization often results in higher population density, which can exacerbate the impacts of hazards. Furthermore, changes in land use may lead to socio-economic disparities, with marginalized communities often facing greater vulnerability due to inadequate housing and limited access to vital resources.

In summary, land-use changes can profoundly affect hazard vulnerability by altering the natural environment, creating new hazard-prone areas, exacerbating climate change impacts, and influencing socio-economic conditions. Therefore, it is essential to engage in careful planning and management of land-use changes to minimize hazard vulnerability effectively.
