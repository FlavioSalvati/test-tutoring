Transnational corporations (TNCs) significantly contribute to the global proliferation of fast food by expanding their operations across international borders.

Prominent TNCs, such as McDonald's, KFC, and Burger King, have been instrumental in the globalization of fast food. They achieve this through a strategy known as "glocalisation," which involves adapting their menu offerings to align with local tastes while preserving their global brand identity. For example, McDonald's features the McSpicy Paneer in India and the Teriyaki McBurger in Japan, effectively catering to regional preferences while still delivering the recognizable McDonald's experience.

The economic strategies employed by these TNCs also facilitate the global spread of fast food. Many TNCs establish franchises, allowing local entrepreneurs to open branches of their fast food chains. This approach not only helps TNCs expand their global presence but also fosters a sense of local ownership. Additionally, TNCs invest heavily in advertising and marketing campaigns to enhance their brand visibility and attract a global audience.

TNCs further benefit from the liberalisation of trade and investment policies in numerous countries. This environment enables them to launch operations in new markets, particularly in developing nations, where they can leverage lower production and labor costs. The rise of free trade agreements has further diminished barriers to international trade, promoting the global spread of fast food.

Moreover, TNCs enhance the global reach of fast food through their supply chains. They source ingredients from diverse locations worldwide, ensuring product consistency while integrating local producers into global markets. This practice can lead to substantial economic impacts, including job creation and infrastructure development in the countries supplying these ingredients.

In conclusion, TNCs have been pivotal in the global dissemination of fast food. Through strategies such as glocalisation, franchising, targeted advertising, leveraging liberal trade policies, and establishing global supply chains, they have successfully established a presence in markets around the world.
