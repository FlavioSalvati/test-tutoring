Malthusian and Boserupian theories present contrasting perspectives on stewardship, particularly concerning population growth and resource management.

The Malthusian theory, formulated by Thomas Robert Malthus, posits that population growth will inevitably outstrip the capacity to produce sufficient resources, potentially resulting in societal collapse. This theory underscores the necessity of stewardship—defined as the careful management of resources—to avert such a disaster. Malthusians advocate for controlling population growth and utilizing resources more sustainably to prevent their depletion. This viewpoint resonates with the concept of stewardship, emphasizing humanity's responsibility to manage resources wisely and sustainably.

Conversely, the Boserupian theory, introduced by Ester Boserup, asserts that population growth can stimulate innovation and enhance productivity, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of resource scarcity. Proponents of the Boserupian perspective believe that as populations increase, humans will devise new methods to boost resource production and efficiency, thereby overcoming limitations. While this theory also relates to stewardship, it does so from a different angle. It suggests that human creativity and technological progress are crucial for effective resource management. In a Boserupian context, stewardship involves fostering innovation and promoting sustainable technological advancements.

Although these theories diverge in their interpretations of population growth and resource scarcity, both underscore the significance of stewardship. They highlight the necessity for careful resource management—whether through controlling population growth and advocating for sustainable practices (as in the Malthusian view) or by encouraging innovation and technological progress (as in the Boserupian perspective). Together, these theories offer valuable insights into how we can act as stewards of our planet, ensuring that its resources remain available for future generations.
