Urban development has a profound impact on hydrograph characteristics by increasing runoff, decreasing infiltration, and shortening lag time.

The hydrological cycle is significantly influenced by urban development, which consequently alters the characteristics of a hydrograph. A hydrograph is a visual representation that illustrates the rate of flow (discharge) over time at a specific point in a river or other channel. It serves as a valuable tool in hydrology for analyzing the relationship between rainfall events and river water levels.

One of the primary ways urban development modifies hydrograph characteristics is through an increase in surface runoff. This phenomenon occurs due to the creation of impermeable surfaces, such as roads, pavements, and buildings, which inhibit water from penetrating the ground. Instead, rainwater is diverted into storm drains and subsequently into rivers, resulting in a more pronounced and rapid peak in river discharge after rainfall. On the hydrograph, this change is depicted as a steeper rising limb and a higher peak discharge.

Additionally, urban development reduces the process of infiltration, which is the mechanism by which water on the surface enters the soil. In urban environments, the natural landscape is often replaced with impermeable materials, significantly limiting the amount of water that can infiltrate the ground. Consequently, this leads to an increased volume of water available for surface runoff, resulting in a quicker rise in river levels following precipitation. This effect is represented on a hydrograph as a shorter lag timeâ€”the interval between peak rainfall and peak discharge.

Moreover, urban development frequently involves the straightening and deepening of rivers to enhance navigation and facilitate flood control. This alteration can accelerate water flow, further diminishing the time it takes for rainwater to reach the river. As a result, the lag time on a hydrograph is reduced even more.

In summary, urban development can dramatically change the characteristics of a hydrograph by increasing surface runoff, decreasing infiltration, and shortening lag time. These modifications can have significant implications for flood risk management in urban areas.
