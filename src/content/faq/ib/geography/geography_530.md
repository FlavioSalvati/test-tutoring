Coastal vegetation plays a vital role in the formation and stabilization of sand dunes by binding sand and promoting accumulation.

Plants such as grasses, shrubs, and trees are essential for the development and preservation of sand dunes. These species have adapted to thrive in challenging coastal environments characterized by high winds, salt spray, and shifting sands. Their root systems effectively anchor the sand, providing stability and preventing erosion. This stabilization is particularly critical during the early stages of dune formation, when loose sand is easily displaced by wind and waves.

As vegetation establishes itself, it captures and stabilizes increasing amounts of sand, leading to the growth of the dune. The plants function as natural windbreaks, slowing down the wind and causing it to deposit some of its sand load. This process, referred to as sand accretion, results in the formation of larger and more stable dunes. Furthermore, the vegetation fosters a microclimate on the dune, offering shelter and shade for various plants and animals.

In addition to stabilizing existing dunes, coastal vegetation can initiate the creation of new dunes. Seeds or fragments of these plants can be transported by wind or water to bare sandy areas. If they successfully establish themselves, they can begin the dune formation process by trapping and stabilizing the sand.

However, the relationship between coastal vegetation and dune formation is delicate. Human activities, such as urban development, tourism, and the impacts of climate change, can severely damage or destroy coastal vegetation, leading to increased dune erosion and degradation. Therefore, the protection and management of coastal vegetation are crucial for the preservation of sand dunes and the ecosystems they support.
