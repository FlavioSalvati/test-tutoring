Stakeholder power can differ significantly between developed and developing countries, primarily due to variations in economic stability, regulatory frameworks, and societal norms.

In developed countries, stakeholders generally enjoy greater power due to the existence of well-established legal systems, robust corporate governance structures, and a stable economic environment. These elements equip stakeholders with the necessary tools to express their concerns and impact corporate decisions. For instance, shareholders in developed nations can utilize their voting rights to sway a company's strategic direction. Similarly, employees can benefit from strong labor laws and unions, which empower them to negotiate for better working conditions. Additionally, customers can exert considerable influence through their purchasing choices and public opinions, particularly in the era of social media.

Conversely, stakeholders in developing countries often face limitations in their power due to weaker legal frameworks, lax corporate governance, and economic volatility. These conditions can hinder stakeholders' ability to affect corporate decisions. For example, shareholders may possess restricted voting rights, or their rights might not be adequately safeguarded by law. Employees in these environments often lack the protections afforded by robust labor laws or unions, complicating their ability to negotiate improved working conditions. Moreover, customers may encounter fewer choices and diminished influence over corporations, especially in markets characterized by limited competition.

Additionally, societal norms and cultural contexts can significantly shape stakeholder power. In various societies, certain stakeholder groups may be marginalized, or their opinions may not carry significant weight. For example, in some developing nations, women or minority groups may experience reduced influence as stakeholders, often due to prevailing societal biases or discrimination.

It is important to recognize that these trends are generalizations; substantial variations can exist within both developed and developing countries. Factors such as the specific industry, the size and structure of the company, and the characteristics of the stakeholder group can all influence the dynamics of stakeholder power. Furthermore, globalization and technological advancements are progressively altering the landscape of stakeholder influence, rendering it a complex and continuously evolving arena.
