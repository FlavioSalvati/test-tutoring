Deposition and erosion are essential processes in the formation of various river landforms, including meanders, floodplains, and deltas.

Erosion is defined as the process through which soil, rock, and other materials are worn away and transported by natural forces such as wind or water. In the context of rivers, erosion primarily occurs due to the movement of water and the sediment it carries. This process plays a significant role in shaping river valleys and creating features such as cliffs and riverbanks. The rate of erosion is influenced by several factors, including the river's flow speed and volume, the type and amount of sediment present, and the characteristics of the riverbed and adjacent landscape.

Conversely, deposition refers to the process by which eroded materials are deposited or settled in a new location. In rivers, deposition typically occurs in areas where the water flow slows down, such as on the inner bend of a meander or at the river's mouth where it meets the sea. Over time, the accumulated sediment can give rise to new landforms such as floodplains, deltas, and alluvial fans. The size and shape of these features can vary significantly, depending on factors such as the quantity and type of transported sediment, the speed and direction of the water flow, and the topographical characteristics of the surrounding area.

Together, erosion and deposition are crucial to the dynamic nature of river landscapes. They are responsible for both the destruction and creation of landforms, contributing to the continuous change and evolution of the Earth's surface. A comprehensive understanding of these processes can aid in predicting and managing the impacts of natural events like floods and landslides, as well as the consequences of human activities such as deforestation and urban development.
