Earthquakes exhibit significant differences between oceanic and continental crust in terms of their location, intensity, depth, and frequency.

The Earth's lithosphere is composed of two primary types of tectonic plates: oceanic crust and continental crust. These plates interact at their boundaries, resulting in seismic activities known as earthquakes. The characteristics of these earthquakes can vary widely depending on whether they occur in oceanic or continental crust.

Oceanic crust is generally thinner and denser than continental crust. It is predominantly made up of basalt, a rock type that forms from the rapid cooling of lava. Due to its higher density, when oceanic crust converges with continental crust, it is forced beneath the continental crust in a process called subduction. This subduction can lead to deep-focus earthquakes, which occur at depths greater than $70 \text{ km}$ below the Earth's surface. These earthquakes are frequently associated with volcanic activity, as the subducting oceanic crust melts and generates magma. A notable example of this tectonic activity is the Pacific Ring of Fire, a major area of seismic activity encircling the Pacific Ocean.

Conversely, continental crust is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust, primarily composed of granite, which forms from the slow cooling of magma. When two continental plates collide, neither plate is dense enough to subduct beneath the other. Instead, they crumple and fold, leading to the formation of mountain ranges. This process can result in shallow-focus earthquakes, which occur at depths of less than $70 \text{ km}$ below the Earth's surface. Such earthquakes can be particularly destructive, as their epicenters are closer to the surface and therefore more likely to impact populated areas. A prominent example of this tectonic activity is the Himalayan range, formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates.

In terms of frequency, earthquakes are more prevalent in oceanic crust due to the higher rate of tectonic activity in these regions. However, earthquakes in continental crust, while less frequent, tend to be more destructive due to their shallower depths and proximity to human settlements. The intensity of earthquakes can vary significantly in both types of crust, largely depending on the specific conditions present at the plate boundaries.
