Coastal management practices play a crucial role in shaping maritime sovereignty by establishing territorial boundaries and regulating maritime activities.

These practices encompass a range of measures implemented by coastal states to manage and safeguard their coastal and marine resources effectively. Maritime sovereignty refers to the exclusive rights a state holds over the marine resources within its territorial waters, and these coastal management strategies can significantly impact that sovereignty.

One key way coastal management practices influence maritime sovereignty is through the establishment of territorial boundaries. Coastal states have the authority to define the extent of their territorial sea, which can reach up to a limit of $12$ nautical miles from baselines determined in accordance with international law. The determination of these baselines can be affected by coastal management actions, such as the construction of artificial islands and installations. Such developments can effectively extend a state's territorial sea, thereby enhancing its maritime sovereignty.

In addition to boundary delineation, coastal management practices regulate various maritime activities within a state's territorial waters. These activities include navigation, fishing, the construction of artificial structures, and the exploration and exploitation of marine resources. By imposing regulations on these activities, coastal states can assert their sovereignty over their territorial waters. For instance, a state might implement fishing restrictions in specific areas to protect marine biodiversity or require foreign vessels to obtain authorization before conducting scientific research in its waters. These regulations not only serve to protect the marine environment but also reinforce the state's sovereign rights over its maritime resources.

Moreover, coastal management practices can significantly influence the resolution of maritime disputes. Conflicts over maritime boundaries and resources are not uncommon, and effective coastal management can be instrumental in addressing these issues. For example, a state may utilize environmental impact assessments to highlight the potential damage caused by proposed activities from another state in contested waters. This evidence can serve as a foundation for negotiations, helping to assert the state's sovereignty over the disputed region.

In summary, coastal management practices have a profound impact on maritime sovereignty. By delineating territorial boundaries, regulating maritime activities, and facilitating the resolution of disputes, these practices empower coastal states to exercise their sovereignty over their territorial waters and protect their valuable marine resources.
