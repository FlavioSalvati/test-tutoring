Earthquakes are classified into three main types based on their epicentres: tectonic, volcanic, and artificial (or induced) earthquakes.

Tectonic earthquakes are the most prevalent type and occur when the Earth's crust fractures due to geological forces acting on rocks and adjacent tectonic plates. These forces result in physical and chemical changes that lead to seismic activity. Tectonic earthquakes typically take place along fault lines, which are the boundaries between tectonic plates. The epicentre of a tectonic earthquake is defined as the point on the Earth's surface that is directly above the focus, the actual point where the earthquake initiates. The intensity of these earthquakes can vary significantly, ranging from minor tremors that are barely perceptible to major quakes that can result in extensive destruction.

Volcanic earthquakes are linked to active volcanic processes and occur in tandem with volcanic activity. These earthquakes are triggered by the movement of magma beneath the Earth's crust. As magma ascends toward the surface, it can cause the surrounding rocks to fracture, leading to an earthquake. The epicentre of a volcanic earthquake is usually situated near the volcano, and such earthquakes can serve as an early warning indicator of potential volcanic eruptions.

Artificial or induced earthquakes arise from human activities that modify the stress and strain within the Earth's crust. Examples of these activities include mining operations, reservoir-induced seismicity (which occurs due to the filling of large reservoirs behind dams), oil and gas extraction, and geothermal energy production. The epicentre of an artificial earthquake typically lies close to the site of the activity responsible for it. While these earthquakes are generally less intense than natural earthquakes, they can still lead to significant damage, especially when they occur in densely populated regions.

In summary, categorizing earthquakes based on their epicentres offers valuable insights into their underlying causes and potential impacts. By understanding the different types of earthquakes and their epicentres, geographers and scientists can better predict future seismic activity and formulate strategies to mitigate the damage caused by these natural disasters.
