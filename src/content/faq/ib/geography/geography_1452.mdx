Socio-economic factors significantly intersect with geophysical hazard risks by influencing community vulnerability, exposure, and capacity to cope with disasters.

Geophysical hazards—such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis—pose substantial risks to human societies. However, the impact of these hazards is not dictated solely by their physical characteristics. Instead, socio-economic factors play a vital role in determining the vulnerability and exposure of communities to these hazards, as well as their capacity for response and recovery.

**Vulnerability** refers to the susceptibility of a community to harm from exposure to hazards. Socio-economic conditions such as poverty, limited education, and social inequality can exacerbate vulnerability by restricting individuals' abilities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. For instance, impoverished communities often reside in hazard-prone areas due to their inability to afford safer housing. Additionally, they may lack the resources necessary for implementing hazard mitigation strategies, such as retrofitting buildings to withstand earthquakes.

**Exposure** denotes the presence of people, livelihoods, and assets in locations that could be adversely affected by physical hazards. Socio-economic factors significantly influence exposure by shaping settlement patterns and land use. For example, rapid urbanization in developing countries frequently leads to the proliferation of informal settlements in hazardous zones, such as floodplains and steep slopes, thereby increasing these communities' exposure to geophysical hazards.

The **capacity to cope with disasters**, often referred to as resilience, is another critical aspect of disaster risk. This capacity reflects a community's ability to absorb the impacts of a hazard, adapt to changing conditions, and recover efficiently and promptly. Socio-economic factors—including levels of economic development, quality of governance, and strength of social networks—can greatly affect a community's resilience. For example, more affluent communities typically possess greater resources to invest in disaster preparedness and recovery efforts, while robust social networks can facilitate collective action and mutual support in the aftermath of disasters.

In summary, socio-economic factors intricately intersect with geophysical hazard risks, influencing the vulnerability, exposure, and resilience of communities. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing effective strategies to manage disaster risk and enhance community resilience.
