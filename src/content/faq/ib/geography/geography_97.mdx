China's population management policies have successfully controlled population growth, but they have also resulted in considerable social implications.

One of the most notable policies is the One-Child Policy, which was implemented in 1979 to address the rapidly increasing population. This policy proved largely effective, as evidenced by the decline in the fertility rate from $2.8$ births per woman in 1979 to $1.5$ by 2014. The One-Child Policy has significantly contributed to the slowdown of China's population growth, helping to mitigate various social, economic, and environmental challenges associated with overpopulation.

Nevertheless, the One-Child Policy has given rise to several social issues. The cultural preference for male children has led to a pronounced gender imbalance, with a disproportionately higher number of males compared to females. This imbalance has resulted in complications such as difficulties for men in finding spouses and an increase in human trafficking and the kidnapping of women. Furthermore, the policy has contributed to an aging population, with a shrinking number of young individuals available to support the elderly. This demographic shift presents substantial challenges for China's social security and healthcare systems.

In response to these emerging issues, China enacted the Two-Child Policy in 2016, permitting all couples to have two children. This policy aims to rectify the gender imbalance and address the challenges posed by an aging population that arose from the One-Child Policy. However, the effectiveness of the Two-Child Policy is still being evaluated. Early indicators show a rise in the number of births, but the increase has fallen short of expectations, suggesting that other factors—such as the high cost of raising children in China—are also influencing families' decisions regarding childbearing.

In conclusion, while China's population management policies have effectively curbed population growth, they have also led to significant social challenges. The impact and effectiveness of the recent policy changes continue to unfold.
