Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is a comprehensive approach to managing coastal areas, taking into account all facets of the coastal environment.

ICZM is a dynamic, multidisciplinary, and iterative process aimed at promoting sustainable management of coastal zones. It encompasses the entire cycle of information collection, planning (broadly defined to include both policy and regulation), decision-making, management, and monitoring of implementation. This approach relies on the informed participation and collaboration of all stakeholders to evaluate societal goals within a coastal area and to take actions that align with these objectives. Over the long term, ICZM seeks to balance environmental, economic, social, cultural, and recreational goals, all while respecting the natural limitations imposed by coastal dynamics.

The concept of ICZM emerged from the necessity to manage the complex and often conflicting uses of coastal zones. These areas are characterized by high biological productivity, biodiversity, and endemism, but they also face significant human pressures due to settlement, resource utilization, and development. Coastal zones are increasingly challenged by population growth, economic development, and natural phenomena such as climate change and sea level rise. These pressures can lead to the degradation of coastal ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and conflicts among various coastal users.

ICZM aims to tackle these challenges by integrating the management of land, water, and living resources in a way that promotes conservation and sustainable use equitably. This involves the coordination of different policy areas, sectors, and levels of government that have a stake in coastal zone management. Additionally, ICZM integrates various management tools and instruments, such as spatial planning, regulatory measures, economic incentives, voluntary agreements, and educational initiatives.

In summary, ICZM focuses on managing the interactions between human activities and the coastal environment to ensure the long-term sustainability of both. It adopts a holistic approach that recognizes the interconnections among the various components of the coastal system, striving for coordinated, sustainable, and equitable management practices.
