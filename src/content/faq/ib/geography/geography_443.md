Oxbow lakes are formed through the processes of erosion and deposition in meandering rivers.

The development of an oxbow lake begins with a meandering river, characterized by its numerous curves and bends. These bends are dynamic and change over time due to the continual processes of erosion and deposition. Erosion refers to the wearing away of the riverbanks and riverbed by the flowing water, while deposition involves the accumulation of material that has been eroded from other areas.

Along the outer bend of a meander, where the water flows most rapidly, erosion occurs, causing that bend to become more pronounced. In contrast, on the inner bend, where the flow is slower, deposition takes place. This differential process leads to an increasingly exaggerated meander shape over time.

Eventually, the neck of the meander becomes so narrow—due to the ongoing erosion on the outer bends and deposition on the inner bends—that the river may break through during a period of high water flow, such as during a flood. This breach results in the formation of a new, straighter river channel, while the original meander loop becomes isolated from the main flow of the river.

The cut-off section of the meander loop, now a distinct body of water separated from the river, is referred to as an oxbow lake. Over time, this oxbow lake may either dry up and become a meander scar or remain as a lake if it is replenished by rainfall or groundwater.

In summary, the formation of an oxbow lake is a natural process that unfolds over an extended period due to the interplay of erosion and deposition in a meandering river. This phenomenon serves as a fascinating example of how water can sculpt the landscape and illustrates the power of natural forces.
