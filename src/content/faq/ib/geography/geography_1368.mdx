Permafrost plays a critical role in shaping periglacial landscapes by influencing processes such as soil movement, erosion, and deposition.

Permafrost is defined as a layer of soil, rock, or sediment that remains frozen for extended periods. It is typically found in regions adjacent to glaciers or in high-latitude areas characterized by cold climatic conditions. The presence of permafrost significantly affects the behavior of soil and other materials, resulting in distinctive landforms unique to periglacial environments.

A key mechanism by which permafrost influences landscape formation is through a phenomenon known as frost heaving. This process occurs when water within the soil freezes and expands, causing the soil to be pushed upward. Over time, such movements can lead to the development of patterned ground, which is a characteristic feature of periglacial landscapes. These patterns can manifest in various forms, including circles, polygons, stripes, and nets, depending on the prevailing local conditions and the specific characteristics of the soil and permafrost.

In addition to frost heaving, permafrost is instrumental in the formation of other notable periglacial features, such as pingos. Pingos are large, ice-cored hills that emerge in regions of continuous permafrost. They form when the pressure from freezing groundwater forces a layer of unfrozen soil upward. Furthermore, permafrost contributes to the development of thermokarst landscapes, which are characterized by irregular surfaces of marshy depressions and small hummocks created by the thawing of ice-rich permafrost or the melting of massive ice bodies.

Erosion and deposition processes are also influenced by permafrost. In areas with discontinuous permafrost, the freeze-thaw cycle can lead to a process called solifluction. This involves the slow, downslope movement of water-saturated soil, resulting in the formation of solifluction lobes and sheets, which are frequently observed in periglacial regions.

In summary, permafrost has a profound impact on the formation of periglacial landscapes. The processes associated with permafrost—such as frost heaving, the creation of pingos and thermokarst landscapes, and solifluction—contribute to the unique features of these cold-climate environments. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting potential changes in periglacial landscapes, especially in light of climate change and the anticipated thawing of permafrost.
