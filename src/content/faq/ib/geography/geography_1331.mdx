Security concerns in contested ocean areas encompass a range of issues, including territorial disputes, piracy, illegal fishing, and the potential for military conflicts.

Territorial disputes represent a prominent security challenge in these regions. Such disputes typically arise from the abundance of valuable resources found in these waters, including oil, gas, and fish. Nations may assert exclusive rights to these resources, leading to conflicts with neighboring countries. A notable example is the South China Sea, where multiple countries, such as China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei, hold overlapping territorial claims. These disputes can escalate into diplomatic tensions or even military confrontations, posing significant threats to both regional and international stability.

Piracy is another critical security issue. Pirates frequently operate in contested ocean areas, exploiting ambiguous jurisdiction to conduct illegal activities. Their actions may involve hijacking vessels, kidnapping crew members for ransom, or stealing cargo. Piracy not only endangers the safety of seafarers but also disrupts global trade and maritime transportation. The Gulf of Aden, located off the coast of Somalia, is particularly infamous for its high incidence of piracy.

Furthermore, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing presents a substantial security concern in these contested waters. IUU fishing depletes fish stocks, damages marine ecosystems, and threatens the livelihoods of legitimate fishers. It can also instigate conflicts between nations, as fishers from one country may illegally operate in the territorial waters of another. The East and South China Seas are particularly affected by IUU fishing activities.

Lastly, contested ocean areas can serve as flashpoints for military conflicts. Nations may deploy naval forces to assert territorial claims, potentially leading to tense standoffs and confrontations. The presence of military assets can exacerbate existing disputes and spark new ones. For instance, the escalating tensions in the Arctic Ocean, where several countries are competing for control over newly accessible resources due to melting ice, have resulted in a heightened military presence in the region.
