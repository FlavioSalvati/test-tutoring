There are several compelling case studies illustrating how hazard mapping has significantly mitigated the impacts of mass movements.

One prominent example is the town of La Conchita in California, USA. In 1995, a large landslide struck, resulting in extensive property damage. In response to this disaster, a hazard map was developed to pinpoint areas at high risk for future landslides. This map played a crucial role in guiding development and land use planning, imposing restrictions on construction in those high-risk zones. When another landslide occurred in 2005, the damage was markedly less severe compared to the 1995 event, primarily due to the informed planning facilitated by the hazard map.

Another noteworthy case comes from the Philippines, where hazard mapping has been instrumental in reducing the impacts of mass movements triggered by typhoons. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau created hazard maps that identified regions particularly vulnerable to landslides and flooding. During Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018, these maps were utilized to direct evacuation efforts, resulting in a significant reduction in both loss of life and property damage.

In Italy, the town of Nocera Inferiore experienced a catastrophic landslide in 1998, which led to fatalities and considerable property destruction. In the aftermath, a comprehensive hazard map was produced to highlight areas susceptible to landslides. This map informed the relocation of residents from high-risk regions and aided in the design of mitigation strategies, including retaining walls and drainage systems. Consequently, when another landslide occurred in 2005, the impacts were significantly diminished.

These case studies collectively underscore the effectiveness of hazard mapping in alleviating the consequences of mass movements. By accurately identifying high-risk areas, these maps can guide land use planning and inform the design of mitigation measures, ultimately helping to safeguard lives and protect property.
