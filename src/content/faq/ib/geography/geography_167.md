Climate change significantly contributes to rising sea levels primarily through two processes: the melting of ice caps and glaciers, and the thermal expansion of seawater.

Climate change, often linked to global warming, is a major driver of sea-level rise. The two principal mechanisms by which this occurs are the melting of ice caps and glaciers, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater. Both processes are directly associated with the increase in global temperatures, a fundamental characteristic of climate change.

The melting of ice caps and glaciers occurs as global temperatures increase. Warmer temperatures cause ice from polar regions and mountain glaciers to melt, leading to additional meltwater entering the oceans. This influx of water contributes to the overall volume of the oceans, resulting in higher sea levels. Currently, this process accounts for approximately half of the observed sea-level rise. It is important to clarify that not all ice contributes equally to sea-level rise. For example, ice that is already floating in the ocean, such as sea ice or ice shelves, does not raise sea level when it melts, since it has already displaced its own weight in water. Conversely, ice that is situated on land, including glaciers and ice caps, does contribute to sea-level rise when it melts and flows into the sea.

The second mechanism, thermal expansion, arises from the physical properties of water. As water heats up, it expands. With the Earth's temperature increasing due to climate change, the oceans absorb a significant amount of this heat. As a result, the water molecules become more active, occupying more space, which leads to a rise in sea level. This process is responsible for the other half of the observed sea-level rise.

In addition to these two primary mechanisms, climate change can also influence sea-level rise through alterations in land water storage. Human activities, such as irrigation and dam construction, can change the amount of water retained on land, which in turn affects sea levels.

In summary, climate change and sea-level rise are closely interconnected. The increase in global temperatures associated with climate change drives both the melting of ice caps and glaciers and the thermal expansion of seawater, both of which contribute to rising sea levels.
