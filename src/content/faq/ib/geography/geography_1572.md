The epidemiological transition refers to a significant shift in the patterns of health and disease within a population, driven by societal and technological advancements.

This concept, first introduced by Abdel Omran in the 1970s, outlines how the primary causes of death evolve as societies develop. It is an integral aspect of the broader demographic transition model, which examines changes in birth and death rates over time as a result of development.

In the initial stage of the epidemiological transition, commonly known as the "Age of Pestilence and Famine," mortality rates are high and exhibit considerable fluctuation. Life expectancy is low and varies significantly, with the predominant causes of death being infectious and parasitic diseases. This stage is typically associated with pre-industrial societies.

The subsequent stage, termed the "Age of Receding Pandemics," marks a gradual decline in mortality rates. This decline is attributed to advancements in sanitation, nutrition, and medicine, leading to a reduction in infectious and parasitic diseases. As a result, life expectancy rises, and the population begins to grow rapidly.

The third stage, referred to as the "Age of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases," is characterized by a continued decline in mortality rates and a transition in the leading causes of death. Here, the focus shifts from infectious diseases to chronic and degenerative conditions, such as heart disease and cancer. This stage is typically associated with industrialized societies.

Some scholars propose a fourth stage known as the "Age of Delayed Degenerative Diseases," where life expectancy continues to rise due to medical advancements that postpone the onset of chronic diseases. Others suggest a fifth stage, in which infectious diseases re-emerge as significant health threats due to factors like antibiotic resistance and globalization.

The epidemiological transition is assessed using various health metrics, including mortality rates, cause of death statistics, and life expectancy figures. Analyzing these data allows researchers to identify patterns and trends, as well as to compare different societies and time periods. For instance, a society in the initial stage of the epidemiological transition would exhibit a high mortality rate, a low life expectancy, and a significant proportion of deaths attributed to infectious diseases. In contrast, a society in the third stage would show a low mortality rate, a high life expectancy, and a predominant share of deaths resulting from chronic diseases.
