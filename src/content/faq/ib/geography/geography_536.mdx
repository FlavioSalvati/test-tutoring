Coastal barriers play a critical role in altering sediment transport dynamics, resulting in changes to beach morphology and potentially exacerbating coastal erosion.

Coastal barriers, which include seawalls, groynes, and breakwaters, are engineered structures designed to safeguard coastlines from the destructive forces of waves and currents. However, these constructions can significantly disrupt the natural processes of sediment transport, which refers to the movement of sand and other materials along the coastline driven by wave action and currents.

One of the primary consequences of coastal barriers is the disruption of longshore drift, a natural process in which sediment is moved along the coastline by the energy of waves. This disruption can lead to alterations in beach morphology, defined as the shape and configuration of the beach. For example, a groyne, which is constructed perpendicular to the shoreline, can trap sediment on one side, resulting in a sand accumulation and a widening of that beach area. Conversely, the opposite side of the groyne may experience a reduction in beach width due to a lack of incoming sediment.

Another notable impact of coastal barriers is the potential for increased coastal erosion. Seawalls, which are intended to shield the land behind them from wave action, can inadvertently reflect wave energy back towards the sea. This reflection can intensify wave action, leading to increased sediment removal and a steepening of the beach profile. Consequently, this process may result in a reduction of beach area, further heightening the vulnerability of the coastline to erosion.

Additionally, coastal barriers can influence sediment transport in offshore regions. Breakwaters, which are structures built to diminish wave intensity, can cause sediment to accumulate in their lee, forming features such as tombolos or spits. These changes can modify seabed morphology and potentially impact local marine habitats.

In summary, while coastal barriers are essential for safeguarding coastlines, their effects on sediment transport can lead to significant alterations in both beach and seabed morphology, as well as an increased risk of coastal erosion. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the design and placement of these structures to minimize their impact on natural coastal processes.
