A shield volcano is defined by its broad, flat shape, gentle slopes, and eruptions consisting of low-viscosity lava.

The name "shield volcano" is derived from its unique appearance, which resembles a warrior's shield resting on the ground. These volcanoes are characterized by their expansive, gently sloping surfaces, which result from the flow of highly fluid, low-viscosity lava during eruptions. This type of lava, known as basaltic lava, is capable of traveling great distances before it cools and solidifies, contributing to the wide, expansive profile of shield volcanoes.

In contrast, composite volcanoes, also referred to as stratovolcanoes, are recognized for their steep, conical shapes. This steepness is attributed to the more viscous lava they produce, which cools and solidifies quickly, building up around the vent and resulting in a sharper slope. Composite volcanoes are also known for their explosive eruptions, which can project ash and pyroclastic materials high into the atmosphere, further accentuating their steep structures.

Another distinguishing feature of shield volcanoes is their eruption style. They typically experience effusive eruptions, where lava flows steadily and relatively calmly from the volcano. This stands in stark contrast to the explosive eruptions frequently associated with composite volcanoes, which can be far more violent and destructive.

The geographical location of shield volcanoes is also a significant characteristic. These volcanoes are predominantly found in oceanic environments, particularly in regions where tectonic plates are diverging or pulling apart. The magma that feeds shield volcanoes is primarily generated by the partial melting of the Earth's mantle, a process that occurs more readily in these tectonic settings. A prime example of shield volcanoes can be seen in the Hawaiian Islands, which are predominantly formed by such geological structures.

In summary, shield volcanoes are identifiable by their broad, flat shape, gentle slopes, and eruptions of low-viscosity lava. They are typically located in oceanic settings and are characterized by effusive eruption styles. These features sharply contrast with those of composite volcanoes, which exhibit steeper slopes, more viscous lava, and often explosive eruptions.
