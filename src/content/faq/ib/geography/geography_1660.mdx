Social deprivation in urban areas is assessed through a range of indicators, including income, employment, health, education, and housing conditions. 

Social deprivation is a multifaceted issue that encompasses various dimensions of life. It is typically evaluated using a combination of indicators that reflect the socio-economic environment of a given area. The primary indicators include income, employment, health, education, and housing conditions.

**Income** serves as a crucial indicator of social deprivation. Low income levels can signify an inability to meet basic needs, thereby contributing to social deprivation. This can be quantified by examining average income levels within an area, the percentage of individuals living below the poverty line, or the degree of income inequality present.

**Employment** is another significant indicator. Elevated rates of unemployment or underemployment can contribute to social deprivation, as individuals may find it challenging to fulfill basic needs without a reliable source of income. This can be measured by analyzing the unemployment rate, the percentage of individuals in low-wage or precarious jobs, or the number of people dependent on social welfare benefits.

**Health** plays a vital role as well. Poor health can be both a cause and a consequence of social deprivation. This can be assessed through health outcomes such as life expectancy, infant mortality rates, or the prevalence of specific health conditions. Moreover, access to healthcare services can also serve as an important indicator of social deprivation.

**Education** is a key determinant of future socio-economic status. Insufficient educational attainment can result in social deprivation, as it restricts individuals' opportunities for employment and income generation. This can be measured by evaluating educational attainment levels, school dropout rates, or the quality of local educational institutions.

**Housing conditions** can also reflect social deprivation. Inadequate housing can adversely affect individuals' health and wellbeing and may indicate underlying issues such as low income and poverty. This can be measured by assessing the quality of housing, the proportion of people living in overcrowded conditions, or the number of individuals experiencing homelessness.

In addition to these primary indicators, other factors such as crime rates, access to essential services, and levels of social cohesion can also be utilized to assess social deprivation. These additional factors provide a more comprehensive understanding of the social conditions in a given area and can aid in identifying regions with high levels of deprivation.
