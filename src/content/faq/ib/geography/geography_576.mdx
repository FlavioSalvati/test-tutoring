International law is vital for effective ocean management, as it establishes the rules and standards necessary for the sustainable use and conservation of marine resources.

A key component of international law is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides a comprehensive legal framework governing the utilization, conservation, and management of the world's oceans. UNCLOS delineates the legal context within which all maritime activities must be conducted. This encompasses regulations pertaining to navigation, overflight, scientific research, fishing, pollution control, and the installation of cables and pipelines.

Often referred to as the "constitution for the oceans," UNCLOS categorizes the oceans into various zones, each governed by distinct legal provisions. For instance, the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extends $200$ nautical miles from a country's coastline. Within this zone, the coastal state possesses exclusive rights to explore and exploit both living and non-living marine resources. Beyond the EEZ lies the high seas, which are accessible to all states—coastal and landlocked alike—allowing for freedom of navigation, overflight, and the laying of submarine cables and pipelines.

International law also addresses the protection and preservation of the marine environment by imposing obligations on states to prevent, reduce, and control pollution originating from various sources, including land-based activities, vessels, waste dumping, and seabed operations. Additionally, it mandates the protection of rare or fragile ecosystems and the habitats of depleted, threatened, or endangered species.

Furthermore, international law establishes mechanisms for resolving disputes that may arise between states regarding ocean-related issues. These mechanisms include negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or adjudication before an international tribunal, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

In summary, international law is instrumental in ocean management. It lays down the foundational rules, facilitates cooperation and dispute resolution, and strives to balance the rights and interests of diverse states while ensuring the protection and preservation of the marine environment.
