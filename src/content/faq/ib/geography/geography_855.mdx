Gender-specific challenges in achieving food security stem from women's limited access to resources, prevailing gender norms, and restricted decision-making power.

Women play a vital role in agriculture and food production globally; however, they frequently encounter substantial barriers that impede their effective contributions to food security. A primary challenge is their restricted access to essential resources such as land, credit, agricultural inputs, and training. In numerous societies, women are less likely than men to own land. Even when they do possess land, their plots are often smaller and less fertile. This not only constrains their productivity but also limits their access to credit since land is commonly used as collateral. Additionally, women are less likely to receive agricultural training or have access to critical inputs like seeds and fertilizers, which can significantly affect their ability to produce food.

Furthermore, gender norms and societal roles present considerable challenges. In many cultures, women are expected to shoulder the majority of household chores and caregiving responsibilities, which leaves them with reduced time to engage in agricultural activities. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that women's contributions to agriculture are frequently undervalued and considered secondary to men's efforts, despite being equally crucial for food security. Such norms can also restrict women's mobility and their ability to participate in market activities, further limiting their productivity.

Moreover, women often possess less decision-making power than men, both within their households and in the broader community. This lack of power can impede their ability to make choices regarding what to grow, how to cultivate it, and how to utilize the produce. It can also prevent them from participating in community discussions about resource allocation, which significantly influences food security. For instance, if women are excluded from decisions regarding water usage, they may find it challenging to irrigate their crops effectively.

In summary, the gender-specific challenges associated with achieving food security are complex and deeply embedded in societal norms and structures. Addressing these issues necessitates a comprehensive approach that not only enhances women's access to resources but also confronts detrimental gender norms and empowers women in decision-making roles.
