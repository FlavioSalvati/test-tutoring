Stewardship strategies for non-renewable resources comprise several key approaches, including efficient use, recycling, substitution, and technological innovation.

**Efficient Use**  
Efficient use is a fundamental strategy in the stewardship of non-renewable resources. This approach focuses on minimizing waste while maximizing output. For instance, when dealing with fossil fuels, efficient use might involve employing energy-efficient appliances and vehicles, or enhancing industrial processes to consume less energy. By doing so, we not only conserve the resource itself but also mitigate the environmental impact associated with its extraction and consumption.

**Recycling**  
Recycling is another critical strategy in resource stewardship. Many non-renewable resources, such as metals, can be recycled and reused, thus decreasing the demand for new extraction. This practice is not only more sustainable but often more cost-effective as well. However, it is essential to note that recycling is not always feasible or practical for all resources, and it can sometimes require significant energy input.

**Substitution**  
Substitution involves replacing non-renewable resources with renewable or less environmentally detrimental alternatives. For example, renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power can often replace fossil fuels in various applications. Similarly, biodegradable materials can serve as substitutes for petroleum-based plastics. Nevertheless, the process of substitution frequently necessitates considerable technological and infrastructural changes. Moreover, the alternatives may not always match the performance or convenience of the resources they replace.

**Technological Innovation**  
Technological innovation plays a vital role in the stewardship of non-renewable resources. New technologies can enhance the efficiency of resource extraction and usage, reduce environmental impacts, or enable the utilization of resources that were previously inaccessible or uneconomical. For instance, advancements in drilling technology have made it possible to extract oil and gas from deep-sea reserves that were once beyond reach.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, the stewardship of non-renewable resources presents a complex and multifaceted challenge that necessitates a blend of strategies. These strategies—efficient use, recycling, substitution, and technological innovation—each possess unique strengths and limitations. The most effective approach will often depend on the specific resource in question and the context in which it is being managed.
