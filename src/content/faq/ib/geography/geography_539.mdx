Biotic factors significantly influence the formation and development of coastal dunes, primarily through the processes of sand accumulation and stabilization facilitated by plant growth.

Coastal dunes are created when wind-blown sand is trapped by obstacles such as plants or rocks. In this context, the role of vegetation is particularly vital. As wind carries sand particles along the beach, these particles can become lodged in the vegetation near the shoreline. Over time, the accumulation of sand around these plants contributes to the formation of dunes.

Plants not only initiate the formation of dunes but also play a crucial role in their growth and stabilization. The root systems of dune plants bind the sand together, enhancing the stability of the dune and making it more resistant to erosion. This stabilization is especially important in coastal regions, where dunes are consistently subjected to strong winds and wave action. Furthermore, as these plants grow, they can trap additional sand, promoting further dune development.

Various plant species contribute to different stages of dune development. Pioneer species, the first to colonize newly formed dunes, are typically resilient plants that can withstand the harsh conditions of the coastal environment. These initial colonizers stabilize the dunes and create favorable conditions for less hardy species to establish themselves. Over time, a succession of diverse plant species can lead to the evolution of a mature dune system, rich in flora.

In addition to plants, other biotic factors such as animals and microorganisms can also play a role in dune development. For instance, burrowing animals can aerate the soil and enhance its structure, while microorganisms contribute to nutrient cycling and soil formation. However, the impact of these factors is generally less pronounced than that of plants.

In summary, biotic factors, especially plants, are essential for the development of coastal dunes. They facilitate sand accumulation, promote dune stabilization, and create conditions conducive to a diverse array of plant life.
