Point bars are formed in rivers through the deposition of sediment on the inner side of a meander, where the water flow is slower.

Commonly referred to as meander bars, point bars are prominent features in meandering rivers. They come into existence through a process called lateral accretion, which falls under the broader field of fluvial geomorphologyâ€”the study of how flowing water shapes the Earth's surface.

As a river flows, it does not travel in a straight line; instead, it meanders, curving back and forth across its floodplain. This meandering occurs due to the uneven distribution of energy within the river, which leads to erosion of the outer banks and deposition of sediment on the inner banks. The outer side of a meander bend is known as the cut bank, where the water flows fastest because it has a longer distance to cover. This rapid flow erodes the bank, transporting sediment downstream.

Conversely, the inner side of a meander bend is where the point bar develops. Here, the water flow is slower due to the shorter distance it must travel. This reduced flow is unable to carry as much sediment, resulting in the deposition of material on the inner bank. Over time, this accumulation of sediment leads to the formation of a point bar.

The creation of point bars is an ongoing process. As long as the river continues to flow and erode material from the cut bank, it will also deposit sediment on the point bar. This ongoing deposition can cause the river to change its course over time as the point bar expands and the cut bank retreats.

The sediment that constitutes a point bar is typically well-sorted, meaning it is comprised of particles of similar size. This uniformity arises because the slower water flow on the inner side of the meander can only transport smaller particles. In contrast, larger particles are left behind on the cut bank, where the water flow is more vigorous.

In summary, point bars are formed in rivers through the deposition process, where slower water flow on the inner side of a meander bend accumulates sediment over time. This continuous process can lead to changes in the river's course as the point bar develops.
