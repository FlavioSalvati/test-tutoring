Malnutrition is assessed and mapped globally using several key indicators, particularly focusing on children under the age of five. This age group is critical for growth and development. The three primary indicators employed are stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence. These indicators serve to evaluate the nutritional status of children and provide a comprehensive overview of malnutrition severity within specific populations.

**Stunting** is an indicator of chronic malnutrition, reflecting a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition. It is determined by comparing a child's height to the World Health Organization's (WHO) child growth standards. Specifically, children whose height is below $-2$ standard deviations from the median of the WHO's reference population are classified as stunted.

In contrast, **wasting** measures acute malnutrition and signifies a recent and severe loss of weight, often linked to acute starvation or severe illness. Like stunting, wasting is assessed by comparing a child's weight-for-height against the WHO's growth standards. Children falling below $-2$ standard deviations from the WHO reference median are considered wasted.

The **underweight** indicator encompasses aspects of both stunting and wasting, offering a broader measure of undernutrition. It is calculated by comparing a child's weight-for-age to the WHO's child growth standards. Children who are below $-2$ standard deviations from the median of the WHO reference population are classified as underweight.

Data for these indicators is gathered through national surveys, including the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), which are frequently conducted in many low and middle-income countries. The information collected from these surveys is utilized to create global maps that illustrate malnutrition prevalence, highlighting regions with high rates and identifying trends over time. These maps are essential tools for policymakers and aid organizations, aiding in the targeting of interventions and monitoring progress in the ongoing battle against malnutrition.
