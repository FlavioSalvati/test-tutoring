Birth rates typically decline as economic development progresses, indicating a negative correlation between the two variables.

This trend can be attributed to several interrelated factors associated with economic advancement. As countries achieve higher levels of economic development, there is often a corresponding increase in educational attainment, particularly among women. Higher education tends to delay the age at which women have their first child and reduces the overall number of children they have throughout their lives. Educated women are more likely to be informed about and have access to family planning methods. Additionally, they may pursue greater employment opportunities outside the home, which can diminish the desire or necessity for larger families.

Moreover, economic development frequently leads to enhancements in healthcare, including improved access to reproductive health services. These advancements can result in lower infant and child mortality rates, thereby reducing the perceived need for larger families as a safeguard against child loss.

Another key factor is the transition from agrarian economies to industrial and service-based economies that often accompanies economic growth. In agrarian societies, children are viewed as economic assets, contributing to the family’s income through work. In contrast, in industrial and service-based economies, children are perceived more as economic liabilities, requiring significant investment in education and not providing economic contribution until they reach adulthood. This change in perspective can lead to a decline in birth rates.

Finally, urbanization—commonly linked to economic development—also plays a role in lowering birth rates. In urban settings, the cost of living tends to be higher, and space is often limited, both of which can discourage families from having many children.

In conclusion, while there are exceptions to this trend, there is generally a negative correlation between birth rates and economic development. This relationship is driven by a combination of factors, including increased education, enhanced healthcare, shifts in economic structures, and urbanization.
