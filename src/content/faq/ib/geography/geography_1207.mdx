A mature river is typically characterized by prominent features such as meanders, floodplains, and oxbow lakes.

A mature river, often referred to as a "stage two" river, exhibits distinct characteristics that differentiate it from youthful or older rivers. One of the most striking features of a mature river is the presence of meanders. These large, looping bends form as the water erodes the outer banks while depositing sediment on the inner banks. This process, known as lateral erosion, is a defining characteristic of mature rivers and results in the development of a wide, flat valley floor.

Another notable feature of a mature river is the existence of a floodplain. This flat area of land flanking the river is prone to flooding and is created as the river erodes its banks and deposits sediment during periods of high water flow. Over time, this ongoing process results in a wide, fertile area that is often rich in nutrients, making it ideal for agricultural activities.

Oxbow lakes are also commonly associated with mature rivers. These lakes form when a meander becomes so pronounced that the river cuts through the narrow neck of land between the bends, creating a new, straighter channel. The abandoned meander then becomes a crescent-shaped lake known as an oxbow lake.

In addition to these features, mature rivers typically have well-developed tributary systems. These smaller rivers and streams feed into the main river, increasing its volume and enhancing its erosive power. The presence of a complex tributary system serves as another indicator of a river's maturity.

Finally, mature rivers are characterized by a balanced load of sediment and water. This equilibrium allows the river to transport the sediment it erodes without becoming clogged or obstructed. This balance is a hallmark of river maturity and is essential for the ongoing development of features like meanders and floodplains.
