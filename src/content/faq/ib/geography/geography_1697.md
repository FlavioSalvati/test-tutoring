The global trend in plastic consumption has led to a significant increase in both the volume and complexity of waste disposal challenges.

Over the past few decades, the surge in plastic use has profoundly impacted waste management systems worldwide. Due to its durability and resistance to degradation, plastic presents a unique challenge for effective waste management. When not disposed of properly, plastic waste can persist in the environment for hundreds to thousands of years, resulting in severe environmental pollution.

The rise in plastic consumption has correspondingly increased the amount of plastic waste generated. In 2015, the world produced $242$ million tonnes of plastic waste, which accounted for $12\%$ of all municipal solid waste. This represents a dramatic increase from the $1950$s, when plastic waste comprised less than $1\%$ of municipal waste. Projections indicate that this trend will continue, with estimates suggesting that the proportion of plastic in municipal waste could rise to $20\%$ by $2050$.

The growing volume of plastic waste has placed significant strain on waste management systems. Many countries, especially those in the developing world, lack the necessary infrastructure and resources to cope with the increasing amounts of plastic waste. As a result, environmental pollution has become widespread, with plastic waste littering natural landscapes and clogging waterways. Furthermore, improper disposal of plastic can lead to the release of harmful chemicals into the environment, posing risks to both human health and ecosystems.

Additionally, the trend in plastic consumption has altered the composition of waste. Plastics are composed of various polymers, each possessing distinct properties and recycling requirements. This diversity complicates the management of plastic waste compared to other types of waste. For instance, while some plastics can be recycled, others cannot, adding to the challenges associated with waste disposal.

In conclusion, the growing trend in plastic consumption has had a significant impact on waste disposal. It has increased the volume of waste, strained waste management systems, and introduced complexity into waste composition. These challenges highlight the urgent need for more sustainable approaches to plastic use and waste management.
