Health indicators around the world show significant variations based on gender. Generally, women have longer life expectancies than men, but they also face a higher prevalence of health issues throughout their lives.

Globally, women tend to have a longer lifespan compared to men. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the average life expectancy at birth for women was $74.2$ years in $2016$, while for men, it was $69.8$ years. This disparity can be attributed to a combination of biological, social, and lifestyle factors. Biologically, women are less susceptible to some of the leading causes of death, such as heart disease. Socially, men are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, including smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, which can contribute to various health problems.

Despite their longer life spans, women frequently encounter more health issues during their lives. They are more likely to suffer from non-fatal chronic conditions and disabilities, such as arthritis, osteoporosis, and depression. This trend is partly a consequence of their increased longevity, as these conditions tend to be more prevalent with age. Furthermore, women face unique health challenges associated with reproduction, including complications during pregnancy and a higher risk of cervical cancer.

In many regions of the world, gender inequality significantly influences health outcomes. In societies where women have limited access to education, income, and healthcare resources, their health tends to suffer. For instance, in certain developing countries, women often struggle to receive necessary medical care due to financial barriers or cultural norms that prioritize men's health.

Conversely, men's health is adversely affected by societal expectations regarding masculinity. Men are generally less inclined to seek medical assistance when needed, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment of health conditions. They are also more likely to succumb to preventable causes of death, such as accidents and violence, which are often associated with risk-taking behaviors.

When examining specific diseases, men are at a higher risk of dying from various types of cancer, whereas women are more likely to die from strokes. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for both genders, but men typically develop this condition at a younger age.

In summary, although women generally enjoy longer life expectancies than men, they often experience a lower quality of health. Both biological and social factors play critical roles in contributing to these gender differences in health outcomes.
