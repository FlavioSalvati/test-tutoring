Tourism can significantly heighten the vulnerability of areas to geophysical hazards by contributing to environmental degradation and exerting pressure on local resources.

Mass tourism, in particular, can lead to substantial environmental harm. This degradation not only compromises the local ecosystem but also amplifies the susceptibility of the region to geophysical hazards. For instance, deforestation for the development of hotels and other tourist infrastructures can elevate the risk of landslides and soil erosion. Additionally, the construction of essential infrastructure, such as roads and airports, may disrupt natural drainage systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of flooding.

Moreover, the influx of tourists can strain local resources, complicating communities' ability to effectively respond to geophysical threats. In regions where water resources are already limited, the added demand from tourists can worsen water shortages, thereby heightening community vulnerability to droughts. Similarly, the increased energy demand from tourism can overload local power grids, potentially resulting in power outages during critical geophysical events such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.

Tourism can also displace local communities, further increasing their vulnerability to geophysical hazards. For example, in popular coastal tourist destinations, local residents may be forced to relocate inland, often to areas that are more susceptible to flooding or landslides. These displaced communities may also lose access to traditional knowledge and coping strategies that are vital for managing geophysical risks.

Furthermore, tourists themselves are often particularly susceptible to geophysical hazards. Many lack awareness of local risks and appropriate responses, and language barriers can impede their comprehension of warnings or safety instructions. The transient nature of tourism results in a continuous influx of new visitors who are unfamiliar with the local environment and its associated dangers.

Lastly, economic dependency on tourism can exacerbate vulnerability to geophysical hazards. In numerous tourist hotspots, the local economy is heavily reliant on the tourism sector. Consequently, a geophysical event that disrupts tourist activities can lead to severe economic repercussions, hindering community recovery and increasing their susceptibility to future hazards.
