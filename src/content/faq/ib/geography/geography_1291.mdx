Coastal engineering has a profound impact on natural coastal processes, including erosion, sediment transport, and tidal flow.

Coastal engineering is a specialized branch of civil engineering that addresses the unique challenges presented by coastal environments. This field involves the design and construction of various structures, such as seawalls, breakwaters, and groynes, which are specifically intended to protect coastlines from the detrimental effects of natural forces like erosion and flooding. However, these engineered structures can also significantly alter the natural processes that shape the coastline.

One of the primary ways coastal engineering influences natural coastal processes is by modifying erosion patterns. Erosion is a natural phenomenon characterized by the gradual wearing away of the coastline due to the action of waves, wind, and water currents. Structures like seawalls and groynes can obstruct the lateral movement of sediment along the coast, which may lead to increased erosion in some areas while causing sediment accumulation in others. This disruption can transform the natural contour of the coastline.

Another critical effect of coastal engineering is on sediment transport, which refers to the movement of sand and other materials along the shoreline driven by waves and currents. Coastal engineering structures can hinder this natural flow of sediment, resulting in altered sediment distribution along the coast. Such changes can lead to the formation of new landforms, like sandbars and spits, while simultaneously causing the erosion or disappearance of existing features, such as beaches and dunes.

Additionally, coastal engineering can disrupt the natural tidal flow of water along the coast. Tidal flow, which is influenced by the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun, can be altered by the presence of structures such as breakwaters and seawalls. This disruption may lead to significant changes in tidal patterns, which can affect various aspects of the coastal ecosystem, including the distribution of marine life and the overall coastal landscape.

In summary, while coastal engineering is essential for safeguarding coastal regions against the impacts of natural processes, it also introduces significant alterations to these processes. Such changes can reshape the coastline's natural form and character, with potential ramifications for both the environment and human activities in coastal areas.
