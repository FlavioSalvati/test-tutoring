Sea-level rise significantly amplifies the potential impact and reach of tsunamis, intensifying coastal flooding and damage.

Primarily driven by climate change, sea-level rise poses a critical threat to coastal communities around the globe. As the sea level elevates, it raises the baseline water level, which subsequently heightens the potential effects of tsunamis. Tsunamis are powerful sea waves capable of traveling vast distances; when they approach the shore, they can inflict extensive flooding and destruction. With a higher sea level, tsunami waves commence from an increased elevation, allowing them to penetrate further inland and cause greater devastation than they would at lower sea levels.

The ramifications of sea-level rise on tsunami hazards are complex and multifaceted. 

Firstly, it amplifies the vulnerability of coastal communities. Many of these areas are already at risk due to their proximity to the ocean, and a rise in sea level only exacerbates this danger. Structures, infrastructure, and residences are more likely to sustain damage, leading to increased expenses related to repairs and recovery efforts.

Secondly, sea-level rise can transform the coastal landscape, making regions more susceptible to tsunamis. For instance, it can result in coastal erosion, altering the coastline's shape and potentially creating new areas where tsunami waves can funnel and increase in height.

Thirdly, sea-level rise has implications for tsunami warning systems, which are designed based on existing sea levels and tsunami behavior. As sea levels continue to rise, these systems may require adjustments to accommodate the evolving dynamics of tsunami behavior, potentially incurring significant costs and technical challenges.

Lastly, the impacts of sea-level rise can compound the effects of other natural disasters. For example, a coastal area that is already grappling with the consequences of rising sea levels may find it increasingly difficult to cope with a tsunami, leading to a heightened risk of loss of life and property.

In conclusion, the implications of sea-level rise on tsunami hazards are profound and far-reaching. They underscore the urgent need for continued research and proactive planning to mitigate risks and safeguard vulnerable coastal communities.
