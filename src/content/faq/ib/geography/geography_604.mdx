The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) serves as the principal framework governing resource extraction in the world's oceans.

Often referred to as the "constitution for the oceans," UNCLOS is the fundamental international treaty that regulates the use and conservation of marine resources. Adopted in 1982, it has garnered ratification from over 160 countries, establishing a comprehensive legal framework that guides all maritime activities, including resource extraction.

UNCLOS categorizes marine areas into several distinct zones, each possessing different legal statuses. These zones include the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and the high seas. A coastal state holds sovereignty over its territorial sea, which extends up to $12$ nautical miles from its coastline, allowing it to exploit resources within this area. In the EEZ, which extends up to $200$ nautical miles from the shore, the coastal state enjoys special rights to explore and exploit both living and non-living natural resources.

The convention also establishes the International Seabed Authority (ISA), responsible for overseeing deep-sea mining activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The ISA issues licenses for exploration and mining, ensuring that these activities are conducted in a manner that minimizes environmental impact.

In addition to UNCLOS, several other international agreements influence ocean resource extraction. For instance, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) aims to conserve biological diversity, promote sustainable use of its components, and ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. The CBD has a specific program focused on marine and coastal biodiversity, which includes guidelines for sustainable marine resource extraction.

Moreover, the London Convention and its 1996 Protocol regulate the disposal of wastes and other materials at sea, which can result from resource extraction activities. These agreements aim to prevent marine pollution and protect the marine environment from the adverse effects of human activities.

In summary, while UNCLOS serves as the primary legal framework governing resource extraction in the oceans, it is complemented by other international agreements that seek to ensure the sustainable use and conservation of marine resources.
