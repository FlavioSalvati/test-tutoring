Cities actively monitor and enhance air quality through the establishment of air quality monitoring stations and the implementation of pollution control measures.

Globally, cities have set up air quality monitoring stations that continuously measure the concentrations of various pollutants in the atmosphere. These stations are equipped with advanced sensors capable of detecting and quantifying pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$), sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$), carbon monoxide ($CO$), ozone ($O_3$), and particulate matter (PM). The data collected from these stations is analyzed to derive the Air Quality Index (AQI), which serves as a standardized indicator of air quality.

The AQI is a numerical scale designed to convey the cleanliness or pollution level of the air, along with the potential health risks associated with it. This index ranges from $0$ to $500$, where a higher AQI value indicates a greater level of air pollution and an increased risk of adverse health effects. The AQI is commonly reported in real-time or near real-time, providing city officials and the public with insights into the current air quality conditions.

To improve air quality, cities adopt a range of pollution control strategies. These measures may include regulations aimed at limiting emissions from industrial sources, traffic management initiatives to reduce vehicle emissions, and programs promoting cleaner transportation options, such as cycling and public transit. For instance, London has implemented a congestion charge zone, where vehicles are required to pay a fee to enter the city center during peak hours, thereby reducing traffic congestion and associated pollution levels.

Moreover, cities often introduce policies to encourage the use of renewable energy sources and enhance energy efficiency, as the combustion of fossil fuels for energy generation is a significant contributor to air pollution. This can involve initiatives that promote solar and wind energy usage, as well as efforts to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.

Additionally, urban planning and design play crucial roles in enhancing air quality. This may include the development of green spaces, which can help absorb pollutants and generate clean air, as well as designing buildings and streets to minimize the accumulation of pollutants.

In summary, the process of monitoring and improving air quality in urban areas involves a multifaceted approach that combines continuous monitoring, regulatory actions, and thoughtful urban design.
