The impact of environmental risks on global health is profound, resulting in millions of deaths and illnesses every year.

Environmental hazards, including air pollution, water contamination, and climate change, represent a serious threat to health worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately $12.6$ million deaths annually can be attributed to unhealthy environments, which accounts for nearly one in four deaths globally. The majority of these fatalities are linked to non-communicable diseases, such as stroke, heart disease, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases.

Air pollution stands out as a significant environmental risk to health, contributing to a variety of diseases. Outdoor air pollution, primarily stemming from industrial emissions and vehicular exhaust, is responsible for around $3$ million deaths each year. In addition, indoor air pollution—often a result of using solid fuels for cooking and heating—contributes to approximately $4$ million deaths annually. These pollutants can lead to respiratory diseases and worsen pre-existing conditions, such as asthma.

Water contamination is another critical environmental concern. Unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices result in numerous diseases, including diarrhoea, cholera, and typhoid fever. These health issues are particularly prevalent in low-income countries where access to clean water and sanitation facilities is severely limited. The WHO estimates that $829,000$ people die each year from diarrhoea linked to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene practices.

Climate change also significantly affects global health. Rising temperatures can lead to an increase in heat-related illnesses and fatalities. Additionally, alterations in weather patterns can influence the spread of infectious diseases. For instance, warmer climates can expand the habitats of disease-carrying insects, resulting in a rise in diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.

Beyond the direct health implications, environmental risks carry substantial economic costs. These costs include healthcare expenses for treating diseases caused by environmental factors, as well as the economic repercussions of lost productivity due to illness and premature death. The World Bank estimates that air pollution alone incurs a cost exceeding $5$ trillion annually in welfare losses for the global economy.

In summary, the burden of environmental risks on global health is significant, leading to millions of deaths and illnesses each year, coupled with considerable economic consequences. Therefore, addressing these environmental threats is essential for safeguarding global health.
