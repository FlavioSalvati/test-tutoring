Transnational corporations (TNCs) play a crucial role in shaping sustainable tourism practices by establishing standards, promoting responsible travel, and investing in local communities.

TNCs possess the capacity to set benchmarks and guidelines for sustainability within the tourism sector. For example, industry leaders such as Marriott International and Hilton Worldwide have adopted comprehensive sustainability policies that encompass energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste reduction initiatives. These corporations can influence their suppliers, partners, and customers to embrace similar sustainable practices, thereby fostering sustainability throughout the entire tourism value chain.

In addition to setting standards, TNCs actively promote responsible travel among tourists. They achieve this by offering eco-friendly travel packages, highlighting local cultures and traditions, and educating tourists on the importance of respecting both the environment and local communities. A noteworthy example is TUI Group, a prominent player in the tourism industry, which has been dedicated to promoting sustainable tourism through initiatives like offering "greener and fairer" holiday experiences. This includes options such as carbon offsetting for flights, promoting local excursions that benefit host communities, and providing travelers with valuable information on how to travel responsibly.

Investment in local communities represents another vital way in which TNCs can influence sustainable tourism practices. By channeling resources into local infrastructure, education, and healthcare, TNCs can significantly enhance the living standards of local populations, which, in turn, contributes to a more sustainable tourism industry. For instance, AccorHotels, a French multinational hospitality company, has established the 'Accor Foundation' to support local development projects in the areas where it operates. This initiative not only benefits local communities but also enhances the overall attractiveness of the destination, thereby promoting sustainable tourism.

Furthermore, TNCs can exert influence over government policies related to sustainable tourism. Given their economic significance, these corporations often possess considerable lobbying power, which they can leverage to advocate for policies that support sustainable tourism. For example, TNCs can lobby for stricter environmental regulations, improved labor standards, and a more equitable distribution of tourism revenues.

In conclusion, TNCs have a profound impact on sustainable tourism practices. Through their policies, initiatives, investments, and lobbying efforts, they can foster sustainability within the tourism sector and contribute to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals.
