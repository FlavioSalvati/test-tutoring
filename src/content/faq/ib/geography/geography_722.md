Economic disparities significantly heighten a community's vulnerability to volcanic hazards, as economically disadvantaged groups often lack the necessary resources for effective preparation and recovery.

The role of economic disparities in determining a community's susceptibility to volcanic risks cannot be overstated. Typically, poorer communities face greater exposure to the catastrophic impacts of volcanic eruptions. This heightened vulnerability is largely due to their limited access to essential resources for preparedness, response, and recovery.

For example, wealthier communities generally have better access to early warning systems, evacuation plans, and emergency shelters. They can invest in constructing buildings designed to withstand volcanic hazards, such as pyroclastic flows and ash fall. Additionally, their financial resources enable them to recover and rebuild more swiftly following an eruption.

Conversely, economically disadvantaged communities often reside in areas that are more prone to volcanic hazards, such as the slopes of volcanoes or low-lying valleys susceptible to lahars (volcanic mudflows). While these locations may be more affordable, they also pose greater risks. Furthermore, limited access to education and communication infrastructure can hinder their ability to receive critical information about impending eruptions, leading to delayed or insufficient evacuation measures and an increased risk of casualties.

Moreover, poorer communities typically possess fewer resources to recuperate after a volcanic eruption. Many lack insurance to cover property damage, and their meager savings can be quickly exhausted. The destruction of livelihoods, such as farmland buried under volcanic ash, can further intensify their economic struggles.

At a national level, the effects of economic disparities on vulnerability to volcanic hazards are also evident. Developing countries with constrained financial resources often find it challenging to invest in disaster risk reduction initiatives, such as hazard mapping, land-use planning, and public education campaigns. Their capacity to respond effectively to volcanic emergencies—such as providing timely evacuations, emergency healthcare, and post-disaster support—tends to be limited.

In summary, economic disparities substantially elevate the vulnerability of communities to volcanic hazards. This reality highlights the critical need to address these disparities within comprehensive disaster risk reduction strategies.
