Current stewardship strategies often encounter several limitations, including insufficient resources, inadequate enforcement, and a lack of public awareness.

One of the primary challenges is the scarcity of resources. Many stewardship programs require substantial financial investment for effective implementation and ongoing maintenance. This investment covers various expenses such as research, monitoring, enforcement, and public education. Unfortunately, available funding often falls short of meeting these needs, particularly in developing countries where resources are already limited. Without sufficient financial backing, these programs struggle to achieve their intended objectives.

In addition to funding issues, inadequate enforcement presents a significant hurdle. Stewardship strategies typically involve regulations and guidelines that must be adhered to by various stakeholders. However, enforcing these rules can be quite challenging, particularly when the regulations are complex or when there is insufficient manpower to monitor compliance. Furthermore, political will can be lacking, especially when these regulations are perceived as hindering economic growth or are unpopular with certain groups.

Another critical limitation is the insufficient public awareness and understanding of stewardship initiatives. For these strategies to be successful, the public must comprehend their importance and actively support them. Unfortunately, many individuals are unaware of how these strategies impact their lives or how they can contribute to their success. This lack of awareness can lead to diminished support for stewardship programs, hindering their effectiveness. Even when people are aware of these strategies, they may not fully grasp their significance or understand how to incorporate them into their daily routines.

Lastly, the inherent complexity of environmental issues can pose a substantial challenge to stewardship strategies. Environmental problems are often intricate and interconnected, making them difficult to tackle with isolated approaches. For instance, addressing climate change requires a multifaceted strategy that includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to ongoing changes, and developing technologies for carbon capture and storage. This complexity complicates the development and implementation of effective stewardship strategies.

In conclusion, while stewardship strategies are essential for the management and protection of our environment, they face several significant limitations, including a lack of resources, inadequate enforcement, insufficient public awareness, and the complexity of environmental issues.
