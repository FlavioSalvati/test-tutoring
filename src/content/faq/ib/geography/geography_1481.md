The Aberfan disaster, which occurred in Wales in 1966, serves as a poignant case study in the field of hazard risk management.

On October 21, 1966, a catastrophic collapse of a colliery spoil tip occurred in the village of Aberfan, located near Merthyr Tydfil. This spoil tip, positioned on a mountain slope above the village, was composed of glacial material that exhibited high permeability and instability. Following several weeks of heavy rainfall, the tip became saturated, leading to a landslide that buried a farm, twenty houses, and a school. Tragically, the disaster resulted in the loss of 144 lives, including 116 children.

The Aberfan disaster exemplifies severe deficiencies in hazard risk management. Despite numerous warnings and concerns voiced by the local community regarding the tip's location, the National Coal Board (NCB) failed to take appropriate action. The NCB neglected to conduct a proper risk assessment of the site and did not implement any necessary risk management strategies. This negligence and failure to prioritize safety ultimately resulted in the disastrous landslide.

In the wake of the catastrophe, the UK government established the Aberfan Disaster Tribunal to investigate the underlying causes and circumstances surrounding the landslide. The tribunal concluded that the NCB was culpable due to its negligence and disregard for the safety of the local residents. This finding prompted significant reforms in UK legislation concerning the management of spoil tips and underscored the critical importance of hazard risk management.

The Aberfan disaster serves as a stark reminder of the vital need for effective hazard risk management. It underscores the importance of conducting thorough risk assessments, implementing appropriate risk management strategies, and actively listening to the concerns of local communities. This tragedy also illustrates the severe consequences that can arise from a failure to adequately manage hazard risks. As a result, this case study is frequently referenced in geography and environmental science curricula to demonstrate the principles of hazard risk management and the potential impacts of human negligence on both the environment and local populations.
