Realism, liberalism, and constructivism are key political theories that explain current global interactions.

Realism is a political theory that views international relations as a constant struggle for power among nations. It suggests that states are the primary actors in international politics and that their actions are driven by self-interest and the pursuit of power. This theory can be seen in the ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts, such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where nations are vying for control and influence.

Liberalism, on the other hand, emphasises cooperation and mutual benefits in international relations. It posits that global interactions are not solely about power struggles, but also about creating a global order that promotes peace, prosperity, and human rights. This theory is evident in the formation and operation of international organisations like the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation, which aim to foster cooperation and dialogue among nations.

Constructivism is a more contemporary theory that focuses on the role of ideas, norms, and identities in shaping global interactions. It argues that state behaviour is not just determined by material interests, but also by their identities and the norms they uphold. For instance, the global response to climate change is largely shaped by the norm of environmental responsibility, which influences how states perceive their roles and responsibilities in addressing this issue.

In summary, realism, liberalism, and constructivism provide different perspectives on global interactions. Realism highlights the power dynamics and conflicts, liberalism underscores the importance of cooperation and mutual benefits, and constructivism emphasises the role of ideas, norms, and identities. Understanding these theories can help us make sense of the complex and ever-changing landscape of international relations.
