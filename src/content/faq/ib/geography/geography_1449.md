Megacities in developing countries face a heightened risk of earthquakes due to insufficient infrastructure and inadequate preparedness.

Defined as urban areas with populations exceeding $10$ million people, megacities are frequently situated in geologically active regions. This is especially true for developing countries, where rapid urbanization often occurs in areas prone to seismic activity. However, the primary factor contributing to the increased risk in these megacities is not merely their geographical location; it is primarily their lack of resources and infrastructure to effectively prepare for and respond to such disasters.

In many developing nations, the swift pace of urbanization frequently surpasses the ability of governments to deliver adequate infrastructure and enforce building codes. Consequently, numerous buildings in these megacities are not designed to withstand seismic forces. This is particularly evident in informal settlements or slums, where construction practices are often unregulated, and structures are built using materials that lack earthquake resistance. In the event of an earthquake, these buildings are at a high risk of collapse, resulting in substantial loss of life and property.

Moreover, developing countries typically lack the necessary resources and systems for effective disaster management. Critical components such as early warning systems, emergency response capabilities, and well-structured evacuation and shelter plans are often absent. The absence of these systems can exacerbate the devastation caused by an earthquake. For instance, following the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in $2010$, the lack of coordination and resources led to a slow and ineffective response, worsening the humanitarian crisis.

Additionally, the high population density characteristic of megacities can further escalate the risk. In the aftermath of an earthquake, the concentration of individuals in a limited area can result in higher casualty rates and complicate rescue operations. This situation is aggravated by the fact that many residents in these cities live in poverty and lack the means to prepare for or recover from such disasters.

In summary, while the geological positioning of many megacities in developing countries does expose them to earthquake risks, it is primarily the deficiencies in infrastructure, resources, and preparedness that render them particularly vulnerable.
