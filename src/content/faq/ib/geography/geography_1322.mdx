International treaties have a profound impact on the management of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) by establishing essential rules and guidelines.

One of the most significant treaties in this context is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). UNCLOS provides the legal framework necessary for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources. It delineates the rights and responsibilities of nations regarding the utilization of the world's seas and oceans.

For example, UNCLOS permits coastal states to claim an EEZ that extends up to $200$ nautical miles from their coastlines. Within this zone, the coastal state enjoys exclusive rights to explore and exploit the marine resources, while also bearing the responsibility to conserve and manage both the water column and the seabed beneath it. This includes the authority to regulate fishing activities, conduct scientific research, and protect the marine environment.

Nevertheless, these rights are accompanied by specific responsibilities. The treaties often mandate that states ensure the sustainable use of marine resources and take measures to prevent over-exploitation. Additionally, nations may be required to collaborate with one another to manage shared fish stocks or migratory species. A pertinent example is the Straddling Stocks Agreement, which obliges states to work together—either directly or through appropriate international organizations—to ensure the conservation and management of fish stocks that traverse both EEZs and the high seas.

Moreover, international treaties often include mechanisms for dispute resolution. In instances where states have overlapping claims to an EEZ or disagreements regarding resource management, these treaties provide a structured framework for peaceful resolution. Such mechanisms are vital for preventing conflicts and ensuring the sustainable and equitable use of marine resources.

In conclusion, international treaties are crucial for the effective management of EEZs. They outline the regulations and guidelines for the exploration, exploitation, conservation, and management of marine resources within these zones. Additionally, they facilitate cooperation and provide avenues for dispute resolution, thereby promoting the peaceful and sustainable use of the world's oceans.
