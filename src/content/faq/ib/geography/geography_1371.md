Inselbergs, also referred to as monadnocks, are prominent geological features characterized by their abrupt rise from relatively flat or gently sloping terrain. These isolated hills or mountains are commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they primarily consist of resistant rock that has been revealed through the combined processes of weathering and erosion.

The formation of inselbergs is a multifaceted process involving both physical and chemical weathering. Physical weathering, often termed mechanical weathering, refers to the breakdown of rocks into smaller fragments without altering their chemical composition. This type of weathering can occur through various mechanisms, including freeze-thaw cycles, thermal expansion and contraction, as well as the effects of wind and water.

In arid landscapes, the extreme heat experienced during the day causes rocks to expand, while cooler nighttime temperatures lead to contraction. This continuous cycle of expansion and contraction can induce cracks in the rock, which are subsequently widened by erosive forces from wind and water.

Conversely, chemical weathering entails the decomposition of rocks through chemical reactions. In arid environments, this process can involve mechanisms such as oxidation, hydration, and carbonation. For instance, iron within the rock can react with atmospheric oxygen, forming iron oxide, which is more brittle and more prone to erosion than the original rock material.

Over extended periods, these weathering and erosion processes gradually remove the less resistant rock, leaving behind the more durable rock formations. This resistant rock is then sculpted further by the ongoing erosive action of wind and water, ultimately resulting in the characteristic shape of an inselberg.

It is essential to recognize that the formation of inselbergs occurs over millions of years, making it a slow geological process. The specific rate of formation is influenced by various factors, including the type of rock, local climatic conditions, and the intensity of the weathering and erosion processes at play.
