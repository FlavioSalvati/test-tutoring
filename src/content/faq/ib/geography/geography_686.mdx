A rockfall refers to the vertical descent of individual rocks, whereas a rockslide involves the movement of a mass of rock down a slope.

Both rockfalls and rockslides are classified as types of mass wasting events, which denote the gravitational movement of rock, soil, and other earth materials down a slope. Despite their common classification, they exhibit distinct differences in terms of the nature of movement and the scale of the event. A rockfall typically occurs when individual rocks break free from a cliff or steep slope, often as a result of physical weathering processes, such as freeze-thaw cycles, or biological activity. Upon reaching the ground, these rocks may bounce or roll, forming a cone-shaped accumulation known as talus at the base of the slope.

In contrast, a rockslide is a more extensive phenomenon, characterized by a mass of rock sliding down a slope along a plane of weakness, such as a bedding plane or fault line. The movement of a rockslide tends to be more horizontal than vertical, and can vary in speed from slow to rapid. Common triggers for rockslides include heavy rainfall, seismic activity from earthquakes, or human interventions like mining and construction. The damage caused by rockslides can be significant, often affecting large areas and potentially burying buildings, roads, or other infrastructure.

Both rockfalls and rockslides present considerable hazards. Although rockfalls typically involve smaller volumes of material, their high speeds and unpredictability make them particularly dangerous. They pose a significant risk in mountainous regions, where they can lead to road closures or structural damage. Conversely, rockslides, due to their larger scale and generally slower movement, can result in widespread destruction. They can obstruct rivers, creating temporary lakes and increasing the likelihood of flooding.

In summary, while both rockfalls and rockslides are forms of mass wasting that involve the downward movement of rock materials, they differ substantially in their scale, movement characteristics, and potential impacts. Understanding these distinctions is essential for effective hazard assessment and management in regions susceptible to these geological events.
