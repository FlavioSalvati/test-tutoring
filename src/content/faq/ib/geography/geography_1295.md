Mangrove swamps are essential for coastal protection as they effectively absorb wave energy and mitigate erosion caused by storms, tides, and rising sea levels.

Known as mangrove forests, these coastal wetlands are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions. They are characterized by the presence of mangrove trees, which possess unique adaptations that enable them to thrive in saline, oxygen-depleted soils. These ecosystems play a pivotal role in safeguarding coastlines primarily through their capacity to absorb wave energy and reduce erosion.

Mangroves feature a complex root system that extends both above and below the water's surface, forming a dense network that acts as a natural barrier against wave action. This intricate root structure dissipates wave energy, thereby lessening the impact of storm surges and preventing coastal soil erosion. Research indicates that mangrove forests can reduce wave height by as much as $66\%$ over a distance of $100$ meters.

Additionally, mangroves enhance coastal protection by trapping sediments and nutrients within their root systems. This process not only stabilizes the coastline but also promotes soil formation and helps counteract the effects of sea-level rise. Over time, the accumulated sediments can enable the coastline to gradually build up, allowing it to keep pace with increasing sea levels.

Beyond their physical protective role, mangroves significantly contribute to carbon sequestration. These highly productive ecosystems can store substantial amounts of carbon both in their biomass and in the underlying soil. This capability helps mitigate the impacts of climate change, a major factor driving sea-level rise and intensifying storm events.

In conclusion, mangrove swamps serve as a crucial natural defense against coastal erosion and the challenges posed by rising sea levels. Their ability to absorb wave energy, trap sediments, and sequester carbon renders them invaluable assets in the context of climate change. Nevertheless, these ecosystems face significant threats from deforestation and land conversion, underscoring the urgent need for their conservation and sustainable management.
