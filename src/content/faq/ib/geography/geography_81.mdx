Populations in high-income countries typically exhibit lower fertility rates, higher life expectancy, and a larger proportion of elderly individuals.

According to the World Bank, high-income countries are defined as those with a gross national income (GNI) per capita of at least $12,536. These nations tend to share several distinct demographic characteristics. One of the most prominent features is their lower fertility rates. This trend can be attributed to various factors, including higher levels of education—especially among women—enhanced access to contraception, and the considerable expenses associated with raising children. Consequently, families in high-income countries are generally smaller.

Another defining characteristic of populations in these countries is their higher life expectancy. This phenomenon is primarily a result of superior healthcare systems, improved living conditions, and greater access to nutritious food. These factors collectively contribute to reduced infant mortality rates and longer lifespans. However, the implications of increased longevity include a larger proportion of elderly individuals within the population, which can place significant strain on healthcare and social security systems. As the number of working-age individuals who pay taxes declines relative to the growing number of people requiring support, challenges may arise.

Additionally, populations in high-income countries tend to possess higher levels of education. This is facilitated by the availability of quality educational institutions and the financial means for individuals to pursue advanced studies. A more educated populace often results in a more skilled workforce, which can, in turn, contribute to the high income levels of these countries.

Moreover, there is a trend towards greater urbanization in high-income nations. This shift results from industrialization, leading to movement from rural areas to urban centers. Urbanization often results in higher population densities in cities, which may give rise to challenges such as overcrowding and increased demand for resources.

Finally, high-income countries frequently boast more diverse populations. This diversity is largely a consequence of increased immigration, as individuals from lower-income countries migrate in search of better opportunities. While this cultural richness can foster innovation and societal benefits, it may also present challenges related to social cohesion and integration.
