A floodplain is geomorphologically created through the processes of erosion and deposition by a meandering river over time.

A floodplain is a flat expanse of land situated adjacent to a river, primarily formed by sediments that the river deposits over extended periods. The development of a floodplain is a dynamic process that incorporates both erosion and deposition, predominantly influenced by the meandering action of the river.

The process begins when a river flows across a relatively level landscape. As the river meanders—forming bends—it erodes the outer banks of each bend while depositing sediment on the inner banks. This occurs because the water flows more rapidly along the outer bend, leading to erosion, and flows more slowly on the inner bend, resulting in deposition. Over time, this continuous cycle of erosion and deposition gradually widens the river valley.

During periods of heavy rainfall or snowmelt, the river may exceed its banks in a phenomenon known as flooding. When flooding occurs, the river deposits a layer of sediment across the floodplain. This sediment, referred to as alluvium, is often highly fertile, making floodplains ideal for agricultural activities.

Over thousands of years, the repetitive processes of flooding, sediment deposition, and lateral erosion by the meandering river can lead to the formation of an extensive, flat floodplain. The size and configuration of the floodplain are influenced by various factors, including the gradient of the surrounding land, the volume and velocity of the river, and the type and quantity of sediment carried by the river.

In addition to the primary floodplain, secondary features may also emerge. For instance, during a flood, the river may carve a new, shorter channel across the neck of a meander. The old meander, now isolated from the river, transforms into an oxbow lake. Over time, this oxbow lake may fill with sediment, eventually evolving into a marsh or swamp.

In summary, the development of a floodplain is a complex and long-term process characterized by the interplay of erosion, deposition, and flooding. It serves as a prime example of the dynamic nature of Earth's surface, which is continually shaped and reshaped by the forces of water.
