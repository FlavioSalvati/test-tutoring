Hot arid environments, commonly referred to as deserts, are typically located at specific latitudes due to global atmospheric circulation patterns.

The Earth's atmospheric circulation significantly influences the climate of various regions. These circulation patterns arise from the uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the sun, resulting in the formation of three primary circulation cells in each hemisphere: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, and the Polar cell. The Hadley cell, situated between the equator and approximately $30^\circ$ latitude, plays a crucial role in the development of hot arid environments.

Deserts are predominantly found in the subtropical high-pressure zones, which are located around $30^\circ$ north and south of the equator. These regions are characterized by descending air from the Hadley cell, which leads to high pressure. As the air descends, it warms and increases its capacity to hold moisture, resulting in low humidity and minimal rainfall. This phenomenon contributes to the hot and dry conditions typical of desert environments.

In addition to atmospheric circulation, the presence of mountain ranges can further influence the formation of hot arid environments. This effect is known as the rain shadow phenomenon. When moist air encounters a mountain range, it is forced to rise and cool, leading to precipitation on the windward side of the mountains. Conversely, the leeward side experiences significantly less rainfall, creating a 'shadow' of dry conditions that can facilitate desert formation.

Moreover, the distribution of ocean currents also affects the location of hot arid environments. Cold ocean currents, such as the Benguela Current along the west coast of Southern Africa, can contribute to desert conditions. The cold water cools the air above it, diminishing its ability to retain moisture and resulting in reduced rainfall on the adjacent land.

In summary, the positioning of hot arid environments at specific latitudes is primarily influenced by global atmospheric circulation patterns. However, geographical features such as mountain ranges and ocean currents also play a significant role in shaping these climates.
