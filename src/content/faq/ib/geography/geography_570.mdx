The use of biotic resources can result in overfishing, habitat destruction, and species extinction, all of which disrupt the balance of marine ecosystems.

Biotic resources within marine ecosystems encompass living organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and various other sea creatures. These resources are essential for human survival, as they provide food, medicine, and a range of materials. However, excessive and unsustainable exploitation of these resources—often driven by commercial interests—can have devastating effects on marine ecosystems.

One of the most significant consequences of biotic resource exploitation is overfishing. This occurs when fish are caught at a rate that exceeds their ability to reproduce, leading to a decline in fish populations. Such declines can disrupt the food chain, as species that depend on fish for nourishment may also experience population decreases or even extinction. Additionally, overfishing can reduce genetic diversity within fish populations, making them more susceptible to diseases and environmental changes.

Habitat destruction is another serious outcome of biotic resource use. Many marine habitats, such as coral reefs and seagrass beds, are damaged or destroyed to accommodate fishing activities, aquaculture farms, and other human endeavors. These habitats are vital for the survival of numerous marine species, providing essential food, shelter, and breeding grounds. The destruction of these habitats can lead to significant biodiversity loss, resulting in the extinction of species that rely on them.

Species extinction represents yet another critical impact of biotic resource exploitation. The combination of overfishing, habitat destruction, and various human activities can lead to the extinction of marine species. The loss of these species disrupts the balance of marine ecosystems, as each species fulfills a unique role within the ecosystem. For instance, the extinction of a predator can result in an overpopulation of its prey, leading to overconsumption of their food sources and further ecological disruptions.

In conclusion, the use of biotic resources can have dire consequences for marine ecosystems. It can lead to overfishing, habitat destruction, and species extinction, all of which threaten the stability of these ecosystems. Therefore, it is imperative to manage and utilize these resources sustainably in order to preserve the health and biodiversity of marine environments.
