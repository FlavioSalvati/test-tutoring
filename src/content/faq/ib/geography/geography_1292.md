An advancing coastline is characterized by sediment deposition, while a retreating coastline is marked by erosion and land loss.

An advancing coastline, also known as a prograding coastline, extends outward toward the sea. This phenomenon typically occurs due to the accumulation of sediment, which can be transported to the shoreline by rivers, ocean currents, or wind. Over time, this sediment builds up, resulting in the creation of new land. The process is often gradual but can be accelerated by human interventions, such as the construction of breakwaters or groynes. These structures trap sediment and prevent it from being eroded away by ocean waves. The type of sediment that accumulates can vary widely, ranging from fine sand to larger pebbles and rocks, which in turn influences the coastline's shape and characteristics. For instance, sandy coastlines usually appear flatter and smoother, whereas rocky coastlines tend to be more jagged and irregular.

Conversely, a retreating coastline, also referred to as an eroding coastline, loses land to the sea. This process is primarily driven by the action of waves, tides, and currents that gradually wear away the land. Erosion can occur naturally, as a result of constant wave action, or it can be intensified by human activities, such as the removal of coastal vegetation, which destabilizes the land and increases its vulnerability to erosion. The rate at which a coastline retreats can vary significantly, influenced by factors including wave strength, land composition (e.g., soft sand versus hard rock), and the presence of protective structures like sea walls. In some instances, the coastline may retreat rapidly, leading to considerable land loss and the displacement of local communities.

In summary, the defining characteristics of a coastline as either advancing or retreating are fundamentally linked to the processes of sediment deposition and erosion, respectively. These processes are shaped by a variety of natural and human factors and can lead to significant alterations in the coastline's shape and size over time.
