International sporting events can have substantial environmental consequences, including pollution, habitat destruction, and excessive resource consumption.

Events like the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup often necessitate the construction of extensive infrastructure, which can lead to significant habitat destruction and a reduction in biodiversity. For example, the construction of the Olympic Park for the 2012 London Olympics resulted in the loss of $100$ hectares of wildlife habitat. Similarly, the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia caused the destruction of a national park and led to the displacement of local wildlife.

These large-scale events also contribute to pollution. The influx of spectators increases waste production, which can overwhelm local waste management systems. Additionally, the transportation of athletes, officials, and fans adds to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, it was estimated that the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa generated approximately $2.8$ million tons of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to the annual emissions produced by $1.2$ million cars.

Resource consumption is another critical environmental concern. These events demand vast quantities of water and energy for the operation of venues, accommodations, and transportation. Such demands can strain local resources, particularly in regions where these are already limited. The 2016 Rio Olympics, for example, faced criticism for their high water usage during a severe drought in Brazil.

Moreover, the environmental impacts of these events can be long-lasting. The infrastructure built for these occasions can contribute to urban sprawl and alterations in land use, which may have enduring effects on local ecosystems. In some situations, these infrastructures become 'white elephants'â€”facilities that are expensive to maintain and often underutilized after the event concludes.

Despite these challenges, there is an increasing awareness of the environmental issues linked to such events, and many organizers are implementing measures to mitigate their impact. Initiatives include the use of renewable energy sources, the establishment of recycling programs, and the design of infrastructure with future utility in mind. For instance, the London 2012 Olympics aimed to be "the greenest games ever," with a strong emphasis on sustainability throughout its planning and operations.
