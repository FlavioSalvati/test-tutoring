The effectiveness of stewardship policies can be assessed by monitoring their impact on both environmental sustainability and societal well-being.

Stewardship policies are crafted to encourage the responsible management and utilization of resources, with the ultimate goal of fostering long-term sustainability and enhancing well-being. Consequently, their success can be measured by evaluating how well these policies achieve these objectives. This assessment involves monitoring and analyzing various indicators related to environmental health and societal well-being.

For example, when considering environmental sustainability, one might examine indicators such as biodiversity levels, air and water quality, and the rate of resource depletion. A successful stewardship policy should lead to measurable improvements in these areas over time. For instance, a policy designed to promote sustainable forestry practices could be deemed effective if it results in an increase in forest cover and biodiversity, alongside a reduction in soil erosion and water pollution.

In terms of societal well-being, indicators such as public health statistics, education and employment levels, and measures of social equity can be analyzed. A successful stewardship policy should contribute positively to these indicators. For example, a policy that promotes sustainable agriculture might be considered successful if it enhances food security, improves health outcomes through better nutrition, and increases farmers' incomes.

Moreover, assessing the cost-effectiveness of stewardship policies is crucial. This evaluation involves comparing the implementation costs of the policies—such as economic impacts like potential profit losses or job reductions—with the benefits they provide in terms of environmental sustainability and societal well-being. A successful policy should yield a net benefit when these costs and benefits are carefully weighed.

Finally, the acceptability of stewardship policies among stakeholders is an important criterion for evaluating their success. This assessment considers the degree of support from the public, industry, and other key stakeholders. A policy that enjoys broad support is more likely to be effectively implemented and to achieve its intended outcomes.
