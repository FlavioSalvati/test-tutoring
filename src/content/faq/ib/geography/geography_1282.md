The oceans play an essential role in global carbon storage, serving as the largest active carbon sink on Earth.

Oceans significantly contribute to the global carbon cycle by absorbing, storing, and releasing carbon dioxide (CO₂). Their vast size and depth enable them to hold a substantial amount of carbon, with approximately $93\%$ of the Earth's carbon dioxide being stored in these bodies of water. This remarkable capacity makes the oceans the most significant active carbon sink on our planet.

The mechanisms involved in carbon storage within the oceans are complex and multifaceted. One primary process is the physical dissolution of carbon dioxide in seawater. When CO₂ from the atmosphere interacts with the ocean surface, it dissolves and reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This acid then dissociates into bicarbonate and carbonate ions, a process commonly referred to as the solubility pump.

Another vital mechanism is the biological pump, which encompasses the absorption of CO₂ by marine plants and algae through photosynthesis. These organisms convert carbon dioxide into organic matter. When they die, this organic matter can sink to the ocean floor, effectively sequestering carbon in the deep ocean layers for hundreds to thousands of years.

It is important to note that the oceans' capacity to store carbon is not infinite and is influenced by various factors, including temperature, salinity, and biological activity. For example, warmer waters tend to hold less dissolved CO₂ compared to colder waters. Consequently, as global temperatures rise due to climate change, the efficiency of the oceans as a carbon sink may diminish.

Additionally, the increased absorption of CO₂ by the oceans is resulting in ocean acidification, a process that can have harmful effects on marine life, particularly organisms that form shells. This disruption can adversely impact the biological pump and affect the overall capacity of oceans to sequester carbon.

In conclusion, the oceans play a critical role in global carbon storage. Understanding the processes involved is vital for predicting future climate scenarios and developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
