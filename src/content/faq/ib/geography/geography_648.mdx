Coral reef restoration techniques encompass various methods, including coral gardening, artificial reefs, larval seeding, and direct transplantation.

**Coral Gardening**  
Coral gardening is a widely employed method for restoring coral reefs. This technique involves cultivating corals in nurseries before transplanting them to degraded areas. Typically, coral fragments are collected from healthy reefs and attached to underwater structures to promote growth. Once these corals reach a sufficient size, they are transplanted to the affected reef. This method has shown success in numerous locations around the world, particularly in the Caribbean and the Great Barrier Reef.

**Artificial Reefs**  
Another technique for restoring degraded coral reefs is the use of artificial reefs. These are man-made structures placed on the seabed to create a substrate for coral larvae to attach and grow. Artificial reefs can be constructed from various materials, including concrete, metal, and even recycled items such as tires. In addition to providing a habitat for corals, artificial reefs support a diverse range of marine species, thereby enhancing biodiversity.

**Larval Seeding**  
Larval seeding is a relatively recent technique that involves collecting coral larvae and dispersing them over degraded reefs. These larvae are typically collected during mass spawning events, which occur annually for many coral species. They are reared in laboratories until they are ready for release. This method has the potential to restore large areas of reef rapidly; however, it remains in the experimental phase, and its long-term effectiveness is still uncertain.

**Direct Transplantation**  
Direct transplantation is another approach to coral reef restoration. This method entails physically relocating healthy corals from one site to another. While it can be an efficient way to restore small areas of reef, it is labor-intensive and may inadvertently damage the donor reef.

In addition to these restoration techniques, there are ongoing efforts to mitigate threats to coral reefs, such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change. These initiatives include establishing marine protected areas, implementing sustainable fishing practices, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Such measures are essential for ensuring the long-term survival of coral reefs.
