The global nutrition transition has resulted in rising rates of obesity, non-communicable diseases, and malnutrition.

The term "nutrition transition" describes the changes in dietary habits and energy expenditure that occur alongside economic, demographic, and epidemiological developments. This transition is characterized by a significant increase in the consumption of processed foods, sugars, fats, and animal-source products, while there is a concurrent decline in the intake of fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The combination of this dietary shift and a more sedentary lifestyle has led to a worldwide rise in overweight and obesity rates. Obesity itself is a significant risk factor for a variety of non-communicable diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers.

In addition to the rise in obesity and non-communicable diseases, the nutrition transition contributes to what is known as the double burden of malnutrition. This phenomenon refers to the coexistence of undernutrition alongside overweight, obesity, or diet-related non-communicable diseases within individuals, households, and populations throughout the lifespan. Undernutrition arises from inadequate nutrient intake, while overnutrition stems from excessive consumption. Both forms of malnutrition can lead to serious health issues; for example, undernutrition can result in stunted growth, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies, whereas overnutrition can lead to obesity and associated health complications.

Moreover, the nutrition transition has implications for mental health. Recent studies indicate a connection between diet and mental well-being, with poor dietary quality being linked to the onset of depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. This is particularly concerning given the global trend towards diets high in processed foods and sugars, which are typically low in essential nutrients crucial for maintaining good mental health.

Finally, the nutrition transition has also led to increased environmental impacts related to diet. The production of processed foods, animal-source products, and sugars is resource-intensive and contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, and loss of biodiversity. Such environmental degradation poses a threat to sustainability and has further implications for human health, as it can exacerbate malnutrition and disease.

In summary, the global nutrition transition has far-reaching health implications, contributing to increased rates of obesity, non-communicable diseases, malnutrition, mental health disorders, and environmental degradation.
