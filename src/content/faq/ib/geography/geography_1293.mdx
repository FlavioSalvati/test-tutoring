The primary stakeholders involved in coastal margin management include local communities, government agencies, environmental organizations, and businesses.

Local communities are vital stakeholders in the management of coastal margins, as they are directly impacted by decisions made regarding these areas. Their livelihoods often depend on coastal resources, whether through fishing, tourism, or other activities associated with the coast. Furthermore, they are the first to experience adverse effects, such as erosion or flooding, which may result from inadequate management practices. Consequently, their input and collaboration are essential for developing effective management strategies.

Government agencies, both at local and national levels, play a significant role in coastal margin management. These agencies are tasked with implementing and enforcing regulations and policies that govern coastal management. They also possess the authority to allocate resources and funding to support management efforts. Their responsibility is to balance the diverse needs and interests of all stakeholders while ensuring the sustainability and protection of the coastal environment.

Environmental organizations represent another critical group of stakeholders. These groups advocate for the preservation and conservation of coastal ecosystems. They often conduct valuable research and provide insights into the current state of the coast, as well as the potential impacts of various management strategies. Additionally, they work to raise public awareness and advocate for stronger environmental regulations.

Businesses, especially those based along the coast, are also key stakeholders in coastal margin management. This category includes industries such as tourism, fishing, and shipping. These enterprises depend on coastal resources for their operations and are significantly influenced by management decisions. Moreover, they bear a responsibility to conduct their activities in a manner that does not harm the coastal environment.

Additionally, there are other important stakeholders, such as researchers and scientists, who offer valuable data and insights, and international organizations that provide guidelines and support for coastal management. Each of these stakeholders brings unique interests and perspectives to the table, and effective coastal margin management necessitates their active participation and collaboration.
