Microplastics have emerged as a significant transboundary pollution issue due to their pervasive presence and potential threats to ecosystems and human health.

Microplastics are defined as tiny plastic fragments measuring less than $5 \, \text{mm}$ in size, and they have become a critical environmental challenge. These particles originate from various sources, including the degradation of larger plastic debris into smaller fragments, microbeads found in personal care products, and synthetic fibers that are released from clothing during washing. Due to their small size, microplastics can be easily transported by wind and water currents, resulting in their widespread distribution across the globe. Consequently, microplastic pollution is a transboundary problem, impacting not only the regions where plastic waste is generated but also remote areas far removed from the pollution sources.

The potential dangers posed by microplastics further underscore their growing significance as an environmental concern. These particles can be ingested by a diverse array of organisms, ranging from microscopic plankton to large mammals, leading to physical harm, such as blockages in the digestive system. Additionally, microplastics can serve as carriers for harmful chemicals, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which have the potential to accumulate within organisms and subsequently ascend the food chain. Such dynamics could have profound implications for both ecosystems and human health.

Moreover, the inherent properties of microplastics complicate their management. Their minute size makes them challenging to remove from the environment, and their resistance to many forms of degradation allows them to persist for extended periods. This issue is exacerbated by the ongoing increase in plastic production and usage worldwide, which continually introduces more microplastics into the environment.

In summary, the widespread presence of microplastics, their potential hazards to ecosystems and human health, and the challenges associated with their management render microplastics a pressing transboundary pollution concern. This situation underscores the urgent need for global collaboration and action aimed at reducing plastic waste and seeking more sustainable alternatives.
