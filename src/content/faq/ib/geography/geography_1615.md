Food-sharing apps play a vital role in reducing food waste by enabling the redistribution of surplus food among individuals, businesses, and organizations.

These digital platforms connect those who have excess food with those in need, ensuring that edible food that would otherwise go to waste is consumed. This initiative is critical, especially considering that approximately one-third of all food produced globally is wasted, as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Food-sharing apps operate in various ways. For instance, OLIO allows individuals to share unwanted food items with their neighbors, fostering community connections. In contrast, apps like Too Good To Go collaborate with restaurants, cafes, and shops to sell surplus food at discounted prices. This approach not only mitigates food waste but also assists businesses in recovering some costs associated with unsold food.

The environmental impact of food-sharing apps is significant as well. Food waste is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about $8\%$ of total global emissions. By curbing food waste, these apps contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.

Additionally, food-sharing apps foster a culture of sharing and sustainability. They encourage users to reflect on their consumption habits and the consequences of food waste. This awareness can lead to lasting behavioral changes that further enhance waste reduction efforts.

In summary, food-sharing apps have a profound impact on waste reduction. They facilitate the redistribution of surplus food, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable consumption practices.
