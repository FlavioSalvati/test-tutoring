Poverty markedly heightens vulnerability to geophysical hazards due to limited resources available for preparedness, response, and recovery efforts.

Poverty is a crucial factor that intensifies the susceptibility of individuals and communities to geophysical hazards. This is largely because impoverished areas often lack the essential resources and infrastructure required to effectively prepare for, respond to, and recover from such events.

Firstly, poverty constrains the capacity of individuals and communities to prepare for geophysical hazards. Preparedness typically necessitates financial resources, such as funds for constructing hazard-resistant buildings or purchasing insurance. In impoverished areas, these resources are frequently scarce, hindering proactive measures. Furthermore, poverty can limit access to crucial information regarding potential hazards, which further impedes preparedness initiatives.

Secondly, poverty also impacts the ability of individuals and communities to respond effectively to geophysical hazards. In the immediate aftermath of a hazardous event, resources are needed to provide emergency relief, including food, water, and medical care. However, in poverty-stricken regions, these resources are often insufficient, complicating efforts to meet the immediate needs of those affected. Additionally, limited access to transportation can hinder individuals' ability to evacuate or seek assistance.

Finally, poverty can obstruct recovery efforts that follow a geophysical hazard. Recovery typically involves rebuilding infrastructure, providing ongoing medical care, and fostering economic recovery. Yet, in areas suffering from poverty, the lack of financial resources can impede funding for these recovery efforts. This often results in an extended recovery period, during which individuals and communities remain vulnerable to subsequent hazards.

Beyond these direct impacts, poverty can also increase vulnerability to geophysical hazards in indirect ways. For instance, poverty can lead to overpopulation in hazard-prone areas, as individuals may be compelled to reside in these locations due to a shortage of affordable housing elsewhere. This situation can amplify the potential impact of a hazardous event, as more people become exposed to the risks. Additionally, poverty can contribute to environmental degradation, exacerbating the effects of certain hazards, such as landslides or floods.

In summary, poverty significantly contributes to increased vulnerability to geophysical hazards, both directly and indirectly. This underscores the necessity of addressing poverty as a fundamental component of strategies aimed at reducing vulnerability to these hazards.
