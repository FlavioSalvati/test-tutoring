Central banks play a crucial role in addressing deflationary pressures through the implementation of expansionary monetary policies and the reduction of interest rates.

These institutions have a range of tools at their disposal to tackle deflation. One of the most widely used methods is the execution of expansionary monetary policies. This strategy involves increasing the money supply within the economy, often achieved through open market operations, such as purchasing government bonds. By acquiring these bonds, central banks inject additional money into the economy, which can stimulate spending and investment. This increase in demand can help raise prices.

Another essential tool is the adjustment of interest rates. By lowering the base interest rate, central banks make borrowing more affordable. This reduction encourages both businesses and consumers to take out loans and increase their spending, which can further elevate demand and contribute to rising prices. Additionally, lower interest rates tend to make saving less appealing, further promoting spending.

Quantitative easing (QE) is another approach utilized by central banks. This strategy involves the central bank creating new money electronically to purchase financial assets, such as government bonds, from banks. By doing so, the money supply increases, encouraging banks to lend more. This can stimulate both spending and investment, subsequently driving up prices.

Furthermore, central banks can utilize forward guidance as a tool against deflation. This involves openly communicating future monetary policy intentions to the public. If a central bank indicates its plans to maintain low interest rates for an extended period, it can incentivize businesses and consumers to borrow and spend more, which can enhance demand and support price increases.

It is important to recognize that these measures carry inherent risks. For instance, excessively increasing the money supply may lead to hyperinflation, while maintaining low interest rates for too long can create asset bubbles. Therefore, central banks must carefully manage these tools to effectively combat deflationary pressures, all while avoiding the emergence of other economic challenges.
