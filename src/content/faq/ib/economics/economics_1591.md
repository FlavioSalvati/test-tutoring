Markets frequently underprovide public goods due to their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature, which gives rise to free-rider problems.

Public goods possess distinct characteristics that set them apart. They are **non-excludable**, meaning that once a public good is made available, no individual can be prevented from using it, regardless of whether they have contributed to its cost. Additionally, they are **non-rivalrous**, indicating that one person's consumption of the good does not diminish its availability for others. These traits create a scenario where individuals lack the incentive to pay for public goods, resulting in what is known as the **free-rider problem**.

The free-rider problem occurs when individuals recognize that they can derive benefits from a public good without incurring any costs. For instance, a person can enjoy the advantages of a clean environment or national defense without contributing to their funding. Consequently, this leads to a situation where everyone expects someone else to bear the burden of payment, culminating in the underprovision of public goods by the market.

Moreover, the provision of public goods often involves substantial costs. Constructing infrastructure such as roads, bridges, or public parks necessitates significant investment. However, due to the non-excludable and non-rivalrous attributes of these goods, firms are unable to charge individuals directly for their usage. This inability to recoup costs or generate profits discourages private enterprises from providing these essential goods.

Additionally, markets face challenges in determining the optimal level of public goods provision. In standard markets, prices function as indicators of demand and supply, facilitating efficient resource allocation. However, because public goods are not traded in conventional markets, there is no price mechanism to reflect their societal value. This absence complicates the process for markets to ascertain the appropriate quantity of a public good that should be supplied.

In conclusion, the unique characteristics of public goods—non-excludability and non-rivalry—combined with the free-rider problem, high provision costs, and the difficulty in establishing optimal provision levels, contribute to their underprovision by markets.
