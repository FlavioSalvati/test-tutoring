When both demand and supply increase simultaneously, the equilibrium quantity will rise, but the equilibrium price may remain unchanged, increase, or decrease, depending on the relative magnitudes of the shifts in demand and supply.

In economics, equilibrium is defined as the point at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This equilibrium point is represented by the intersection of the demand and supply curves on a graph. When both demand and supply increase, it indicates that consumers are willing and able to purchase more of a product at the same time that producers are willing and able to supply more. This simultaneous increase results in a rightward shift of both the demand and supply curves.

The impact on the equilibrium price, however, depends on how significant the shifts in demand and supply are relative to one another. If the increase in demand is greater than the increase in supply, the demand curve will shift to the right by a larger extent than the supply curve. Consequently, this will lead to an increase in the equilibrium price. Conversely, if the increase in supply is greater than the increase in demand, the supply curve will experience a more substantial rightward shift than the demand curve, resulting in a decrease in the equilibrium price.

If the increases in demand and supply are equal, both curves will shift to the right by the same amount. In this scenario, the equilibrium price will remain unchanged, while the equilibrium quantity will increase. This occurs because, at the new equilibrium point, consumers are willing and able to purchase more of the product, and producers are also willing and able to supply more.

In summary, when both demand and supply increase simultaneously, the equilibrium quantity will always rise. The effect on the equilibrium price, however, varies based on the relative shifts in demand and supply. If the increase in demand is greater, the price will rise. If the increase in supply is greater, the price will fall. If the increases are equal, the price will remain the same.
