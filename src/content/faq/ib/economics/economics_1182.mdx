Trade protectionism can significantly impede global economic growth by restricting free trade and escalating production costs.

Trade protectionism encompasses government actions and policies designed to limit international trade, aiming to shield local businesses and jobs from foreign competition. Such measures are typically implemented through tariffs, quotas, subsidies, or other trade barriers. Though these strategies may safeguard domestic industries in the short run, they can adversely affect global economic growth over the long term.

Firstly, protectionism tends to reduce trade volumes. By imposing tariffs or quotas, countries make foreign goods more expensive, diminishing consumer demand for these products. This decline in demand can result in a reduction of international trade volumes, which is essential for fostering global economic growth. For instance, the World Trade Organization has estimated that the trade wars initiated by the United States in 2018 could potentially decrease global trade by as much as $17\%$.

Secondly, protectionism can lead to increased production costs. When nations impose tariffs on imported raw materials or intermediate goods, this raises the production costs for domestic industries. Consequently, higher production costs can lead to elevated prices for consumers, which may reduce overall consumption and slow economic growth. Furthermore, increased production costs can undermine the competitiveness of domestic industries in the global marketplace, further diminishing trade volumes.

Thirdly, protectionism can instigate trade wars and retaliatory actions. When one country enacts trade barriers, other countries may respond with similar measures, creating a cycle of escalating trade barriers that further constrains international trade. This scenario fosters uncertainty in the global economy, which can deter investment and impede economic growth.

Lastly, protectionism can stifle technological advancement and productivity growth. Free trade promotes competition and innovation, compelling firms to continually enhance their products and processes to remain competitive in the global market. By insulating domestic industries from foreign competition, protectionism reduces the incentive for innovation, ultimately slowing productivity growth and, consequently, global economic growth.

In summary, while trade protectionism may yield short-term advantages for domestic industries, it can have detrimental effects on global economic growth in the long run by curtailing trade volumes, raising production costs, provoking trade wars, and obstructing technological advancement.
