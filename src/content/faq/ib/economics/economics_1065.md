Fiscal sustainability is closely aligned with macroeconomic objectives, as it plays a vital role in ensuring long-term economic stability, growth, and the efficient allocation of resources.

At its core, fiscal sustainability refers to the government's ability to maintain its current spending, taxation, and other policies over the long term without jeopardizing its solvency or defaulting on its liabilities and promised expenditures. This concept is essential for macroeconomic stability, as it enables the government to continue providing public goods and services, investing in infrastructure and human capital, and meeting its debt obligations.

One of the primary macroeconomic objectives is economic growth, defined as the increase in the output produced by an economy over a specified period. Fiscal sustainability bolsters this objective by ensuring that the government possesses the financial means to invest in sectors that drive growth, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. By upholding a sustainable fiscal stance, the government can foster a stable and predictable business environment, thereby encouraging private investment and further contributing to economic growth.

Another important macroeconomic goal is price stability, which entails maintaining a low and stable rate of inflation. Fiscal sustainability aids in achieving this aim by preventing excessive government borrowing, which can lead to inflationary pressures. Excessive borrowing tends to crowd out private investment, resulting in higher interest rates and inflation. By ensuring fiscal sustainability, the government can maintain a stable macroeconomic environment that supports low inflation.

Fiscal sustainability also correlates with the macroeconomic objective of full employment. By maintaining a sustainable fiscal position, the government can invest in job creation programs, education and training, and other initiatives that promote employment opportunities. Additionally, fiscal sustainability helps mitigate the risk of economic crises, which often result in job losses and elevated unemployment rates.

Finally, fiscal sustainability contributes to the macroeconomic objective of equitable income distribution. Through responsible fiscal policies, the government can finance social safety nets, implement progressive taxation, and introduce measures aimed at reducing income inequality. Thus, fiscal sustainability is not solely about maintaining economic stability; it is also about advancing social justice and equity.
