Inequality can significantly undermine economic stability by inciting social unrest and diminishing aggregate demand.

Inequality is defined as the uneven distribution of income and wealth within a society. Elevated levels of inequality can destabilize the economy in several ways. First and foremost, it can ignite social unrest and political instability. When a significant portion of the population perceives that they are not reaping the benefits of economic growth, they may engage in protests or other forms of civil disorder. Such disruptions can interfere with economic activities and deter investment, ultimately leading to economic instability.

Furthermore, high levels of inequality can reduce aggregate demand. The marginal propensity to consume, which represents the fraction of additional income that individuals spend, tends to be higher among lower-income groups. Consequently, if a larger share of national income is concentrated in the hands of the wealthy—who typically have a lower marginal propensity to consume—overall consumption may decline. This decrease in consumption can slow economic growth and potentially lead to further instability.

Additionally, inequality can result in the inefficient allocation of resources. In a society characterized by high inequality, the affluent wield disproportionate influence over economic and political decisions. This power can lead to the implementation of policies that favor the wealthy at the expense of the less fortunate, culminating in a misallocation of resources. For instance, wealthy individuals may lobby for tax breaks or subsidies that benefit them personally, even if such measures are detrimental to the broader economy. This misallocation can obstruct economic growth and stability.

Moreover, significant inequality can contribute to financial instability. Research indicates that periods of pronounced inequality often precede financial crises. One reason for this correlation is that individuals in lower-income brackets may incur excessive debt in efforts to maintain their living standards, which can result in a buildup of financial risk.

It is important to recognize that the relationship between inequality and economic stability is complex and shaped by various factors. For example, a certain degree of inequality can incentivize individuals to work diligently and innovate, which may, in turn, foster economic growth. Therefore, the challenge for policymakers lies in finding a balance between preserving incentives for economic activity and mitigating excessive inequality that could jeopardize economic stability.
