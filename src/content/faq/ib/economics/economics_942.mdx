The income approach calculates Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by summing all the incomes generated by households and businesses within a country.

This method, also referred to as the factor income approach, is one of the three primary methods for determining GDP. It operates on the principle that the total output of an economy is equivalent to the total income earned by all factors of production, which include labor, capital, and land. Essentially, this approach examines GDP from the perspective of income received by all producers in the economy.

The income approach encompasses several key components:

1. **Compensation of Employees**: This includes wages, salaries, and supplementary labor income earned by individuals from their employment. It not only covers direct payments such as wages and salaries but also includes benefits like pensions and health insurance.

2. **Gross Operating Surplus of Corporations**: This component reflects the profits generated by companies. It includes net income from corporate operations as well as capital consumption allowances, which account for the depreciation of capital goods.

3. **Gross Mixed Income**: This represents the income earned by unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. It comprises both labor and capital income.

4. **Taxes Less Subsidies on Production and Imports**: Taxes on production and imports are included because they contribute to the cost of producing goods and services. Conversely, subsidies are subtracted, as they reduce production costs.

To compute GDP using the income approach, these components are aggregated. The formula can be expressed as:

$$
GDP = \text{Compensation of Employees} + \text{Gross Operating Surplus} + \text{Gross Mixed Income} + \text{Taxes Less Subsidies on Production and Imports}
$$

It is important to note that, in theory, the income approach should yield the same GDP figure as the expenditure approach, which calculates GDP by totaling all spending on goods and services within the economy. However, in practice, discrepancies often arise due to statistical inaccuracies, inventory changes, and the existence of the underground economy.
