The income approach to calculating Gross Domestic Product (GDP) involves summing all the incomes generated by households and businesses within a country.

Also referred to as the factor income method, the income approach is one of the three primary methods used to compute GDP. It is founded on the principle that the total output produced by an economy is equivalent to the total income received by all factors of production, which include labor, capital, and land. This method essentially examines GDP from the perspective of income recipientsâ€”the earnings garnered by all producers in the economy.

The income approach encompasses several key components:

1. **Compensation of Employees**: This includes wages, salaries, and supplementary labor income. It captures not only direct payments made to workers but also additional benefits such as pensions and health insurance.

2. **Gross Operating Surplus**: This component represents the profits earned by corporations. It encompasses both the net income of companies and capital consumption allowances, which account for the depreciation of capital assets.

3. **Gross Mixed Income**: This refers to the income accrued by unincorporated businesses, including sole proprietorships and partnerships. It combines both labor income and capital income.

4. **Taxes Less Subsidies on Production and Imports**: Taxes on production and imports are included as they contribute to the cost of producing goods and services. Conversely, subsidies are deducted because they lower production costs.

To compute GDP using the income approach, these components are aggregated. The formula is expressed as:

$$
GDP = \text{Compensation of Employees} + \text{Gross Operating Surplus} + \text{Gross Mixed Income} + \text{Taxes less Subsidies on Production and Imports}
$$

It is crucial to note that, in theory, the income approach should yield the same GDP figure as the expenditure approach, which calculates GDP by adding up all expenditures on goods and services within the economy. However, in practice, discrepancies often arise due to statistical errors, inventory changes, and the presence of the underground economy.
