A price ceiling disrupts the equilibrium of a competitive market by establishing a maximum price that is lower than the equilibrium price.

In a competitive market, equilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers at a specific price level, known as the equilibrium price. However, when a price ceiling—a government-imposed limit on the maximum price that can be charged for a product—is set below this equilibrium price, it disrupts this balance.

When a price ceiling is imposed below the equilibrium price, it results in a shortage of goods. This occurs because the lower price increases the quantity demanded by consumers while simultaneously decreasing the quantity that producers are willing to supply at that price. Producers may find it unprofitable to produce more at the reduced price, leading to a decline in supply. This mismatch between demand and supply creates a market shortage.

Furthermore, a price ceiling can introduce inefficiencies into the market. In a competitive environment, prices function as signals to efficiently allocate resources, directing goods and services to those who value them the most. However, a price ceiling distorts these signals by preventing prices from rising to the level where supply equals demand, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources. Consequently, some consumers who place a lower value on the good may be able to purchase it, while those who value it more may be unable to do so due to the shortage.

Additionally, price ceilings can lead to unintended consequences. For example, they may result in lower-quality goods as producers attempt to cut costs in response to the reduced price. They can also give rise to black markets, where goods are sold illegally at prices higher than the ceiling.

In conclusion, a price ceiling disrupts competitive market equilibrium by establishing a maximum price that is below the equilibrium price. This action leads to shortages of goods, market inefficiencies, and potential unintended consequences. While price ceilings are often intended to assist consumers by making goods more affordable, they can ultimately cause more harm than good in the long run.
