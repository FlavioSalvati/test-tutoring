Predatory pricing is a strategy employed by firms that possess significant market power to eliminate competition and enhance their dominance in the market.

In essence, predatory pricing involves a firm setting its prices extremely low—often below its own production costs—with the objective of driving competitors out of the market. Once these rivals are eliminated, the firm can then raise its prices and increase its profits. This strategy is typically utilized by firms with considerable market power, as they have the financial capacity to endure short-term losses.

The underlying rationale for predatory pricing is rooted in the principle of economies of scale. Firms that hold market power usually operate on a larger scale, allowing them to produce goods at a lower cost per unit compared to their smaller competitors. By drastically lowering their prices, these firms compel their rivals to either match the low prices or risk losing market share. Smaller firms, unable to sustain such low prices without incurring losses, may ultimately be forced to exit the market.

Additionally, predatory pricing can serve as a significant barrier to entry for potential new competitors. The prospect of engaging in a price war with a dominant firm can dissuade new entrants from joining the market, thereby maintaining the existing firm's market power.

However, it is crucial to recognize that predatory pricing is generally deemed anti-competitive and is illegal in many jurisdictions. This practice is viewed as detrimental to consumer welfare in the long run, as it can lead to the establishment of monopolies or markets characterized by reduced competition. Such outcomes can result in higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.

In summary, predatory pricing is a tactic used by firms with substantial market power to eliminate competition and solidify their market dominance. It hinges on the firm's ability to absorb short-term losses and capitalize on economies of scale, but it is often criticized for its negative impact on long-term consumer welfare.
