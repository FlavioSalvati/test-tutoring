Price discrimination can emerge when a firm possesses substantial market power, enabling it to influence prices and segment its market.

In a competitive market, firms act as price takers, meaning they lack control over the prices of the goods or services they offer. However, when a firm holds significant market power, it becomes a price maker, capable of setting its own prices. This capacity to influence prices can lead to price discrimination, which is the practice of charging different prices to different consumers for the same good or service.

For price discrimination to occur, three conditions must be satisfied:

1. **Market Power**: The firm must possess market power, which allows it to influence the price of its product. This situation is often found in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets, where there are only a few competitors.
  
2. **Market Segmentation**: The firm must be able to segment its market, which means it can categorize its customers into distinct groups based on specific characteristics such as location, age, or income level.
  
3. **Prevention of Resale**: The firm must have mechanisms in place to prevent resale, ensuring that customers who buy a product at a lower price cannot sell it to those who are charged a higher price.

Market power enables a firm to adjust prices according to the price elasticity of demand within different market segments. If a segment exhibits higher price sensitivity (elastic demand), the firm will set a lower price. Conversely, for segments that are less price sensitive (inelastic demand), the firm will charge a higher price. This strategy is known as third-degree price discrimination.

For instance, a firm with considerable market power might charge higher prices in affluent neighborhoods (where demand is inelastic) while offering lower prices in less wealthy areas (where demand is elastic). Additionally, the firm may provide discounts for students or seniors, who typically exhibit greater price sensitivity.

In summary, substantial market power allows a firm to practice price discrimination by influencing prices, segmenting markets, and preventing resale. While this can enhance the firm's profits, it may also lead to a loss of consumer welfare, particularly for those consumers facing higher prices.
