A devaluation refers to a deliberate downward adjustment of a country's currency value, whereas depreciation is a decrease in value driven by market forces.

Both devaluation and depreciation indicate a decline in a country's currency value relative to other currencies. However, the primary distinction between the two lies in their causes. 

**Devaluation** is a strategic decision made by a government or central bank to intentionally lower the value of its currency. This action typically occurs within fixed exchange rate systems, where authorities maintain control over currency valuation. Governments often implement devaluation as a tool to address trade imbalances, as it renders exports cheaper and imports more expensive. This shift encourages domestic consumption and production.

In contrast, **depreciation** is a phenomenon that arises in floating exchange rate systems and is driven by market dynamics. It results from fluctuations in supply and demand, inflation rates, interest rates, and the overall economic and political stability of a country. When a currency depreciates, it loses value compared to other currencies. Various factors can contribute to this, including a country's economic performance, political instability, or shifts in global market conditions.

For instance, if investors lose confidence in a country's economic prospects, they may sell their holdings in that currency. This can lead to an increase in supply and a decrease in demand for the currency, ultimately resulting in depreciation. Conversely, a government or central bank might opt to devalue its currency to stimulate exports and reduce a trade deficit.

In summary, while both devaluation and depreciation lead to a decline in a currency's value, the fundamental difference lies in their origins: devaluation is a deliberate policy decision, whereas depreciation is a market-driven process.
