The government tackles the challenge of non-excludability associated with public goods by either directly providing these goods and services or regulating their provision.

Public goods are defined by two key characteristics: non-excludability and non-rivalry. Non-excludability means that once a good is made available, it is impossible to prevent anyone from using it. This trait often leads to what economists refer to as the 'free-rider problem.' In this situation, individuals have little incentive to pay for the good since they can benefit from it without contributing, relying on others to bear the cost. To mitigate this issue, the government intervenes to guarantee the provision of these goods and services.

One approach the government employs is the direct provision of public goods. This is commonly seen in areas such as national defense, public parks, and street lighting. The government utilizes tax revenue to finance the production and ongoing maintenance of these goods. By doing so, it ensures that every individual, regardless of their tax contributions, has access to these essential services. This practice is prevalent in numerous countries, where the government plays a pivotal role in delivering vital services to its citizens.

Alternatively, the government may regulate the provision of public goods. In some instances, private companies offer these goods, but they do so under government oversight. For example, in the United Kingdom, water and sewerage services are supplied by private firms, yet the government regulates these services to ensure equitable access and fair pricing. The government establishes standards and guidelines that these companies must adhere to, ensuring that the services remain accessible to all and that no individual can be excluded from utilizing them.

In certain cases, the government adopts a hybrid approach, combining direct provision with regulation. An illustrative example of this is the healthcare sector, where the government may directly offer some services through public hospitals, while other services are provided by private entities under government regulation.

In summary, the government plays a vital role in addressing the non-excludability of public goods. Through direct provision, regulation, or a combination of both methods, the government ensures that these goods and services are accessible to everyone, effectively mitigating the free-rider problem and promoting social welfare.
