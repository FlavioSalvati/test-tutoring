Nominal exchange rates indicate the value of one currency in relation to another, whereas real exchange rates adjust this value for inflation.

**Nominal Exchange Rates**  
Nominal exchange rates represent the rates at which one currency can be exchanged for another. For instance, if the nominal exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar is $1.3$, this implies that you can exchange $1$ pound for $1.3$ dollars. These rates are the ones typically quoted in the foreign exchange market and are commonly used in various international financial transactions.

**Real Exchange Rates**  
In contrast, real exchange rates consider the relative purchasing power of the two currencies by adjusting the nominal exchange rate for differences in price levels or inflation rates between the countries involved. This adjustment is essential because inflation can diminish the value of money over time. If prices are increasing at a faster rate in one country compared to another, the real value of its currency will decline, even if the nominal exchange rate remains constant.

For example, suppose the nominal exchange rate between the pound and the dollar remains at $1.3$, but inflation in the UK is outpacing that in the US. In this case, a pound would purchase fewer goods in the UK than it did previously, indicating a decrease in its real value. Consequently, the real exchange rate would be lower than the nominal rate, reflecting this loss of purchasing power.

**Importance in International Trade and Investment**  
Grasping the distinction between nominal and real exchange rates is vital for international trade and investment. While nominal rates inform you of how much of one currency you can obtain in exchange for another, real rates provide insight into how much you can actually purchase with that currency in another country. A high real exchange rate indicates that your currency has significant purchasing power abroad, making foreign goods and investments appear more affordable. Conversely, a low real exchange rate suggests that foreign goods and investments may seem more expensive.

In summary, nominal exchange rates reveal the conversion rates between currencies, akin to exchanging pounds for dollars at a specified rate. Real exchange rates, however, take inflation into account, illustrating the actual purchasing power of your currency in another country. While nominal rates provide the raw exchange figures, real rates inform you about the value of your currency in terms of what it can buy abroad.
