Economic growth refers to the increase in a country's output, typically measured by the growth of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while economic development encompasses improvements in living standards, education, and health.

Although the terms "economic growth" and "economic development" are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings in economics. Economic growth is a more specific concept, representing an increase in a country's real national output. This growth can result from various factors, including enhancements in the quality of resources, increases in the quantity of resources, or advancements in technology. It is commonly quantified by the rate of change in GDP.

In contrast, economic development is a broader concept that focuses on enhancing the quality of life and living standards, fostering economic health, and promoting sustainable growth. Economic development can be viewed as a process through which the overall well-being, health, and educational attainment of the general population improve. Key aspects of economic development include reducing both relative and absolute poverty, lowering infant mortality rates, increasing employment opportunities, and elevating educational standards.

While economic growth can facilitate economic development by generating the capital necessary for public services and infrastructure, it is important to note that economic growth can occur without corresponding economic development. For instance, a country may experience rapid GDP growth while the wealth remains concentrated among a small elite, leaving the majority of the population without any significant improvement in their standard of living. This scenario is often observed in resource-rich countries, such as those dependent on oil, where the wealth generated does not benefit the broader population.

On the other hand, economic development emphasizes sustainable growth, ensuring that future generations can achieve similar or improved standards of living. This includes enhancing the quality of education, healthcare, and job opportunities, as well as maintaining a clean and safe environment. Therefore, while economic growth is an important indicator of an economy's success, it is not the sole measure. Economic development, with its broader and more inclusive perspective on progress, plays a crucial role in fostering a sustainable and equitable future.
