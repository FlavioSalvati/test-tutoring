Inflation significantly intensifies income inequality by disproportionately diminishing the purchasing power of lower-income households compared to their higher-income counterparts.

Inflation is defined as the general rise in prices over time. When inflation rates are elevated, the value of money decreases, meaning that a fixed amount of money can purchase fewer goods and services. This reduction in purchasing power tends to impact lower-income households more severely, thereby worsening income inequality.

Lower-income households typically allocate a larger share of their income to essential expenses, such as food, housing, and utilities. As inflation drives up prices, these households may find it increasingly difficult to afford their basic needs. In contrast, higher-income households generally have more disposable income, enabling them to better absorb rising costs. Additionally, they may benefit from inflation if they own assets like property or stocks, which often appreciate in value during inflationary periods.

Furthermore, lower-income households are less likely to possess savings or investments that could act as a buffer against inflation. They also tend to have limited access to credit, which could help smooth consumption over time. This lack of financial flexibility makes it more challenging for lower-income households to navigate the effects of inflation, further widening the income gap.

Inflation also exacerbates income inequality by influencing wage dynamics. In theory, wages should rise in tandem with inflation to preserve workers' purchasing power. However, in practice, this is frequently not the case. Lower-income workers, in particular, often have less negotiating power and may struggle to secure wage increases that match inflation rates. As a result, these workers may experience a real decline in their income, thereby increasing income inequality.

Finally, inflation can impact income inequality through its effects on interest rates. When inflation is high, central banks typically increase interest rates in an attempt to control it. While this can benefit savers—who earn more interest—it can negatively affect borrowers, as their interest payments rise. Given that lower-income households are more likely to have debts and less likely to have savings, they are disproportionately impacted by changes in interest rates.

In summary, inflation can exacerbate income inequality in multiple ways: by eroding the purchasing power of lower-income households, making it more difficult for them to manage rising costs, reducing their real income, and increasing their interest payments.
