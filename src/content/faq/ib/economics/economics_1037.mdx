Changes in productivity significantly impact Aggregate Supply (AS) by influencing production costs and potential output levels.

In economic terms, productivity refers to the efficiency with which inputs are transformed into outputs. An increase in productivity means that a given quantity of inputs can generate more outputs. This change directly affects the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve, which illustrates the total quantity of goods and services that firms are willing and able to supply at various price levels.

When productivity improves, firms can produce a greater volume of goods and services using the same amount of inputs. This enhancement lowers the cost of production per unit, enabling firms to supply more at every price level. Consequently, the AS curve shifts to the right, indicating an increase in aggregate supply. This shift is often linked to economic growth, as it allows the economy to produce more goods and services without increasing resource utilization.

Conversely, if productivity declines, firms require more inputs to produce the same quantity of goods and services. This increase in input requirements raises the cost of production per unit, which in turn diminishes the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price level. As a result, the AS curve shifts to the left, signaling a decrease in aggregate supply. This situation can lead to economic contraction, as the economy produces less with the same amount of resources.

Additionally, changes in productivity can also affect an economy's potential output, defined as the maximum amount of goods and services that can be produced when all resources are fully employed. Higher productivity raises potential output, shifting the long-run AS curve to the right. In contrast, lower productivity diminishes potential output, resulting in a leftward shift of the long-run AS curve.

In summary, fluctuations in productivity are crucial in determining the position and shape of the AS curve. They impact production costs and potential output, which in turn influence the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing and able to supply at different price levels. Therefore, understanding the relationship between productivity and AS is essential for analyzing the dynamics of an economy.
