Price elasticity of demand is a key concept in economics that measures how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good or service is to changes in its price.

This concept quantifies the responsiveness of consumers to price fluctuations. Specifically, price elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. This relationship is expressed mathematically as:

$$
E_d = \frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P}
$$

where $E_d$ represents the price elasticity of demand, $\%\Delta Q_d$ is the percentage change in quantity demanded, and $\%\Delta P$ is the percentage change in price.

When interpreting the value of price elasticity of demand, we distinguish between elastic and inelastic demand. If $E_d > 1$, we categorize demand as elastic. In this case, consumers are highly responsive to price changes, meaning that a small decrease in price leads to a significant increase in quantity demanded. Conversely, if $E_d < 1$, demand is considered inelastic. This indicates that consumers are less responsive to price changes; thus, a substantial increase in price results in only a minor decrease in quantity demanded.

Understanding price elasticity of demand is essential for both businesses and policymakers. For businesses, this knowledge can aid in forecasting how changes in pricing strategies will impact sales and revenue. For instance, if a company determines that the demand for its product is elastic, it may opt to lower prices to boost sales and enhance total revenue. Conversely, if the demand is inelastic, the company might choose to raise prices, confident that this will not significantly diminish sales but will increase overall revenue.

From a policymaking perspective, comprehending price elasticity of demand is vital for predicting the effects of changes in taxes or subsidies on the market. For example, if a government aims to decrease the consumption of a harmful product, it may consider raising taxes on that item. However, if the demand for that product is inelastic, the effectiveness of this strategy may be limited, as consumers are unlikely to significantly alter their consumption habits in response to the increased price.
