Quasi-public goods occupy a unique position between private and public goods, as they exhibit characteristics of both types.

Also referred to as semi-public goods, quasi-public goods are neither completely non-excludable nor entirely non-rivalrous, which are the defining traits of public goods. They are considered non-excludable to some extent because, while it is challenging to prevent individuals from using them once they are made available, it is not entirely impossible. Additionally, they are not fully rivalrous; although one person's consumption does not drastically diminish the resource's availability for others, congestion can occur if too many individuals use the good simultaneously.

A classic example of a quasi-public good is a toll road. While it is largely non-excludable—once constructed, anyone can access it—it is not completely non-rivalrous. If an excessive number of vehicles use the road at once, traffic congestion can arise. Similarly, a public park serves as another example of a quasi-public good. While it is accessible to everyone, it can also become overcrowded if too many visitors gather at the same time.

In contrast, private goods are characterized by being both excludable and rivalrous. They are excludable because individuals can be prevented from using them unless they have paid for access. Furthermore, they are rivalrous, meaning that one person's consumption of a private good diminishes its availability for others. For instance, consider a chocolate bar: it is excludable, as someone can be stopped from consuming it unless they pay, and it is rivalrous because if one person eats it, there is none left for others.

In summary, quasi-public goods blur the lines between private and public goods due to their mixed characteristics. They do not fully embody the non-excludability and non-rivalry of public goods, nor do they completely align with the excludability and rivalry of private goods. This complexity makes quasi-public goods a distinct and sometimes challenging category to classify.
