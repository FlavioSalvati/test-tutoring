Income elasticity of demand (YED) is a crucial concept in economics that helps differentiate between normal and inferior goods by analyzing how demand shifts in response to changes in consumer income.

YED quantifies the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to changes in income. It is calculated using the formula:

$$
YED = \frac{\%\ \text{change in quantity demanded}}{\%\ \text{change in income}}.
$$

The value derived from this calculation provides insight into whether a good is classified as normal or inferior.

**Normal Goods**  
Normal goods are characterized by an increase in demand when consumer income rises. This means that as people become wealthier, they tend to purchase more of these goods. In terms of YED, normal goods exhibit a positive income elasticity of demand. This occurs because the percentage change in quantity demanded exceeds the percentage change in income, yielding a YED value greater than zero. Common examples of normal goods include vacations, automobiles, and dining at restaurants.

**Inferior Goods**  
Conversely, inferior goods are defined by a decrease in demand as consumer income increases. As individuals gain wealth, they typically buy less of these goods, opting instead for higher-quality or more expensive alternatives. Inferior goods possess a negative income elasticity of demand, as the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in income, resulting in a YED value less than zero. Examples of inferior goods may include products from discount supermarkets or second-hand clothing.

By calculating the YED for a specific good, one can effectively determine its classification as either normal or inferior. If the YED is positive, the good is considered a normal good, indicating that demand rises alongside income. Conversely, if the YED is negative, the good is classified as inferior, suggesting that demand declines as income increases. This analysis is particularly valuable for businesses as it allows them to anticipate how shifts in the economy, such as fluctuations in average income, might influence the demand for their products.
