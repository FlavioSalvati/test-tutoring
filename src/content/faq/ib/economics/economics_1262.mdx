Biodiversity conservation holds significant economic importance because it underpins ecosystem services that are essential for human survival and economic activities.

Biodiversity, defined as the variety of life on Earth, is crucial for the proper functioning of ecosystems and the array of services they provide, which form the foundation of human economies. These services can be categorized into several types:
- **Provisioning services**, which include essential resources such as food, water, timber, and fiber.
- **Regulating services**, which influence climate, manage floods, control disease, process waste, and maintain water quality.
- **Cultural services**, which offer recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits.
- **Supporting services**, which encompass critical processes such as soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling.

The economic value of these ecosystem services is substantial, yet frequently underestimated. For example, pollination by insects—an ecosystem service deeply reliant on biodiversity—is vital for crop production, with an estimated global economic value of £153 billion per year. Likewise, forests, teeming with biodiversity, play a pivotal role in carbon sequestration, thereby mitigating climate change and its potential economic ramifications.

In addition to these services, biodiversity itself is a source of economic value. Numerous sectors, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and cosmetics, depend on genetic resources derived from biodiversity. The sustainable utilization of these resources can yield significant economic advantages. For instance, the global market for genetic resources was estimated to be worth between £22.6 billion and £39.5 billion in 2010.

Biodiversity conservation also fosters job creation and contributes to local and national economies through ecotourism. In 2018, the global ecotourism market was valued at £15.8 billion and is projected to grow in the coming years. This growth not only generates income but also encourages the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems.

However, it is crucial to note that biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates globally, jeopardizing these vital ecosystem services and the economies that rely on them. This reality positions biodiversity conservation as not merely an environmental issue but a significant economic concern. Investing in biodiversity conservation can be viewed as an investment in the natural capital that supports our economies. It represents a cost-effective strategy for ensuring the long-term sustainability of economies, especially when compared to the potential costs associated with biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.
