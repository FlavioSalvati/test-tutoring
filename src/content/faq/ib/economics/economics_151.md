National defense and street lighting serve as quintessential examples of public goods, primarily because they exhibit two key characteristics: non-excludability and non-rivalry.

Public goods are those provided by the government or the public sector for the collective benefit of society. They are defined by two principal features:

1. **Non-excludability**: Once a public good is provided, no one can be excluded from its use.
2. **Non-rivalry**: One individual's consumption of the good does not diminish its availability for others.

**National Defense** is a prime example of a public good. It is considered non-excludable because, once the government ensures national defense, all citizens benefit from the protection it offers, irrespective of their financial contributions toward its provision. Furthermore, it is non-rivalrous; the protection afforded to one citizen does not diminish the protection available to others. In essence, the safeguarding of one individual does not come at the expense of another. This inherent quality is why national defense is typically the responsibility of the government, as it would be challenging for a private entity to exclude those who do not pay or to bill individuals for their personal protection.

**Street Lighting** also exemplifies a public good. It is non-excludable since, once the street lights are illuminated, everyone can benefit from the light, regardless of their payment status. Additionally, it is non-rivalrous; one person's enjoyment of the light—such as walking under it at night—does not lessen the light available to others. Consequently, street lighting is usually managed by local governments, as it would be impractical for a private company to charge individuals for using the light.

In summary, national defense and street lighting exemplify public goods due to their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature. They are provided for the benefit of all members of society, ensuring that the use of these resources by one individual does not reduce their availability to others.
