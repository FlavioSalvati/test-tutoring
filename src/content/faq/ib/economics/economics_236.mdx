Public goods are defined by two key characteristics: non-excludability and non-rivalry. These properties ensure that such resources are accessible to everyone and are not depleted through individual use.

**Non-excludability** means that once a public good is made available, it is impossible to prevent anyone from using it. Public goods are often provided by government entities or other organizations that serve the public interest, and access is not limited to those who pay for the service. For example, once a public park is established, all individuals can enjoy its amenities, irrespective of whether they have contributed to its upkeep. This feature can lead to the 'free-rider problem,' wherein individuals benefit from the good without contributing to its costs, potentially resulting in insufficient provision of the good.

**Non-rivalry** indicates that one person's use of a public good does not diminish its availability to others. In other words, public goods can be consumed by many individuals simultaneously without reducing their supply. For instance, when one person listens to a public radio broadcast, it does not prevent others from enjoying the same broadcast. This contrasts with private goods, where consumption by one individual lowers the amount available for others.

Together, these traits—non-excludability and non-rivalry—distinguish public goods from other types of goods. Public goods are universally accessible, regardless of individual contributions, and their use by one person does not affect their availability to others. In contrast, private goods are both excludable and rivalrous, while club goods are excludable but non-rivalrous.

Understanding these characteristics is essential for effective policy-making. Due to the issues of free-riding and the potential for under-provision, government intervention is often necessary to ensure the availability of public goods. This intervention may take the form of direct provision of the goods or the implementation of taxes and other funding mechanisms to support their production and maintenance. Thus, the concepts of non-excludability and non-rivalry are fundamental to the study of public economics and the essential role of government in the economy.
