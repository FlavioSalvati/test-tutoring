A market shortage disrupts the equilibrium, resulting in increased prices and a decreased quantity demanded.

In economic terms, equilibrium signifies a state of balance between supply and demand within a market. A market shortage, also referred to as excess demand, occurs when the quantity demanded for a product or service surpasses its available supply at a given price. This imbalance generates upward pressure on prices, as consumers compete to acquire the limited goods or services available.

According to the law of demand, as prices rise, the quantity demanded typically declines. This decline occurs because consumers become less willing or able to purchase a good or service at higher prices. Conversely, the increased price incentivizes producers to elevate their supply, in accordance with the law of supply. Higher prices motivate producers to offer more of a good or service, as they are more willing and able to sell at these elevated price levels.

The market will continue to adjust until a new equilibrium is established. This new equilibrium will be characterized by a higher price and a lower quantity demanded compared to the pre-shortage conditions. This adjustment process is termed market adjustment.

It is crucial to recognize that this adjustment process operates under the assumption that other factors remain constant. In reality, various elements such as shifts in consumer preferences, changes in income levels, and fluctuations in production costs can also influence supply and demand, thereby affecting the equilibrium.

In summary, a market shortage disrupts equilibrium by exerting upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on the quantity demanded. The market responds to this disruption by moving towards a new equilibrium characterized by a higher price and a lower quantity demanded. This process exemplifies the dynamic nature of markets and the continuous interplay between supply and demand.
