Governments frequently step in to provide public goods because private companies often find it unprofitable to do so. This is largely due to the inherent characteristics of public goods, specifically their non-excludability and non-rivalry.

Public goods are defined as goods that are both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludability means that once a public good is made available, it is impossible to prevent individuals from utilizing it. Non-rivalry indicates that one person's consumption of the good does not diminish its availability for others. These traits create challenges for private enterprises seeking to charge consumers for public goods, making it difficult for them to achieve profitability. Consequently, the government typically takes on the responsibility of providing these goods.

To illustrate, consider the example of a lighthouse. Once constructed, it is impossible to exclude any ship from benefiting from the lighthouse's light (non-excludability), and the use of this light by one ship does not reduce its availability for others (non-rivalry). As a result, a private company would struggle to impose charges on ships for using the lighthouse, and would likely find it unprofitable to build and maintain such a structure. This is where government intervention is crucial, as it can provide the lighthouse as a public good.

Moreover, the provision of public goods often involves large-scale infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, and public parks. These initiatives require substantial investment and long-term planning, which may exceed the capabilities or interests of private firms. In contrast, governments can distribute the costs of these projects across a broad tax base and engage in long-term planning, making them more equipped to deliver such goods.

Additionally, the provision of public goods frequently generates positive externalities, which are societal benefits that are not reflected in the market price of the good. For instance, public parks can enhance public health and foster community cohesionâ€”advantages that are not captured in the costs associated with maintaining the park. Private companies, motivated primarily by profit, may overlook these external benefits when considering whether to provide a good. Governments, however, can take into account these wider societal advantages when determining the necessity of public goods.

In summary, due to the unique characteristics of public goods, the substantial investment required for their provision, and the potential for positive externalities, governments are generally better positioned than private firms to supply these essential goods.
