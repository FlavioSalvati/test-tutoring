Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a key indicator of economic activity within a country, representing the total value of all goods and services produced over a specified time period. GDP can be calculated using one of three approaches: the output (or production) approach, the income approach, or the expenditure approach. Among these, the expenditure approach is the most widely used.

The expenditure approach determines GDP by summing all expenditures on final goods and services produced within a country during a given period. This includes four main components: consumption ($C$), investment ($I$), government spending ($G$), and net exports ($X - M$), where $X$ represents exports and $M$ represents imports. The formula for GDP can be expressed as:

$$
\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - M)
$$

- **Consumption** ($C$): This component encompasses private consumption expenditures, which represent all goods and services purchased by households and non-profit institutions.
- **Investment** ($I$): This includes business expenditures on equipment and the purchase of new housing.
- **Government Spending** ($G$): This refers to total government expenditures on final goods and services, which includes salaries for public servants, military equipment purchases, and any investment spending by the government.
- **Net Exports** ($X - M$): This figure reflects the difference between a country's exports and imports. A positive net export indicates that exports exceed imports, contributing positively to GDP, while a negative net export indicates that imports surpass exports, which detracts from GDP.

Another method for calculating GDP is the income approach, which sums all income earned by households and firms within the country. This includes wages, rents, interest, and profits. Conversely, the output approach calculates GDP by assessing the total value of all goods and services produced in the country.

It is crucial to understand that GDP only accounts for the value of final goods and services to prevent double counting. For instance, the value of steel used in the production of a car is not counted separately because it is already included in the final value of the car itself. Additionally, GDP does not include transactions that lack a formal market, such as household chores or illegal activities.
