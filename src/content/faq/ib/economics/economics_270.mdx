Adverse selection is a phenomenon that arises from information asymmetry, which occurs when one party involved in a transaction possesses more or superior information than the other party.

More specifically, adverse selection is an economic concept that describes situations where sellers possess information about a product's quality that buyers lack, or vice versa. This disparity in information creates a condition known as 'information asymmetry'. The party with less information is at a distinct disadvantage, as they cannot make informed decisions regarding the transaction. This imbalance can result in inefficient market outcomes.

For instance, let's examine the market for used cars. Sellers typically have a better understanding of the quality of the car they are offering compared to prospective buyers. This knowledge may include details about the car's maintenance history, any hidden defects, or overall condition. In contrast, buyers often struggle to accurately assess a car's value due to this lack of information. Consequently, this scenario may lead to a market dominated by low-quality cars, often referred to as 'lemons'. Buyers, uncertain about the car's quality, are hesitant to pay a premium price, which exemplifies the 'lemons problem'—a quintessential illustration of adverse selection.

A similar situation can be observed in the insurance market, where adverse selection manifests when individuals who are aware of their high likelihood of making claims are more inclined to purchase insurance compared to those who perceive themselves as lower risk. For example, a smoker may be more likely to seek life insurance than a non-smoker. In this case, the insurance company, lacking complete information about an individual's smoking habits, may charge the same premium to both types of clients. This situation could ultimately result in the insurance company attracting a higher proportion of high-risk clients, leading to increased payouts and potentially incurring losses.

In both examples, the party with less information—the car buyer or the insurance company—bears a greater risk due to the underlying information asymmetry. This can culminate in market failure, as resources are not allocated efficiently. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend adverse selection and explore strategies to mitigate information asymmetry to ensure the effective functioning of markets.
