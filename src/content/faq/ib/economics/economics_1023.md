Negative externalities can lead to inequalities in societal well-being by disproportionately impacting specific groups more than others.

In economic terms, negative externalities refer to the costs incurred by a third party as a consequence of an economic transaction. These costs are not reflected in the market price of a good or service. When such costs are overlooked, it can result in market failure and a decline in overall societal well-being.

For example, consider a factory that emits pollutants into the local environment as a by-product of its production process. This pollution can have various detrimental effects on the surrounding community, including health issues, property damage, and a decline in the quality of life. Since these adverse effects are not included in the price of the factory's products, the factory has little incentive to mitigate its pollution. This scenario exemplifies a negative externality.

The issue is that these negative externalities frequently have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of society. In the case of the polluting factory, it is often the local community that suffers the most from the pollution, yet they may not be the ones purchasing the factory's goods. This creates a disparity in societal well-being, where one group reaps the benefits of the produced goods while another group bears the associated costs.

Moreover, the groups adversely affected are typically those least equipped to handle these costs. For instance, lower-income communities are often situated in areas with higher pollution levels due to reduced property values. These communities may also lack adequate access to healthcare, rendering them more susceptible to the health consequences of pollution. This situation further intensifies the inequalities in societal well-being stemming from negative externalities.

In conclusion, negative externalities can generate significant disparities in societal well-being, resulting in a scenario where the advantages of economic activities are enjoyed by one group, while another group endures the burdens. This situation is a clear illustration of market failure and underscores the necessity for government intervention to address these imbalances.
