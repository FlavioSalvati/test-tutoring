Nominal GDP measures a country's economic output without adjusting for inflation, whereas real GDP accounts for inflation.

Nominal GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, represents the total value of all goods and services produced by a country within a specific time frame, typically one year, without any adjustments for inflation. It is calculated by summing the current market prices of all final goods and services produced in an economy during that period. As a result, if prices rise due to inflation, nominal GDP will also increase, even if the actual quantities of goods and services produced remain unchanged.

In contrast, real GDP considers the effects of inflation, providing a more accurate representation of a country's economic growth. It measures the value of economic output adjusted for price changesâ€”whether due to inflation or deflation. This adjustment converts the monetary value represented by nominal GDP into an index that reflects the quantity of total output. Thus, real GDP serves as a superior indicator of changes in the production of goods and services from one year to the next.

Understanding the difference between nominal and real GDP is essential for determining whether a country's economic growth results from an actual increase in goods and services or merely reflects rising prices. For example, if nominal GDP increases by $5\%$ from one year to the next, but inflation is also $5\%$, the growth in real GDP would be $0\%$, indicating that there has been no genuine economic growth.

In summary, while nominal GDP provides a general overview of a country's economic size, real GDP offers a more accurate measure of economic growth by accounting for inflation. This distinction is crucial for economists, policymakers, and students seeking to grasp the true health and trajectory of an economy.
