Movement along the supply curve refers to a change in the quantity supplied as a result of price fluctuations, while a shift in the supply curve indicates a change in supply driven by non-price factors.

When we discuss movement along the supply curve, we refer to a change in quantity supplied that occurs due to a change in the price of the good or service itself. For example, if the price of a product increases, suppliers are generally motivated to produce more of it, which results in a movement upward along the supply curve. Conversely, if the price decreases, suppliers may reduce their production, leading to a movement downward along the supply curve. This type of movement is a direct response to price changes and does not involve any alteration in the position of the supply curve itself.

In contrast, a shift in the supply curve, also known as a change in supply, occurs due to factors unrelated to the price of the good or service. These factors may include changes in production costs, advancements in technology, fluctuations in the prices of related goods, expectations regarding future prices, and changes in government policies such as taxes or subsidies. For instance, if the cost of raw materials for a product declines, the overall supply of that product will increase, resulting in a rightward shift of the supply curve. Conversely, if a tax is levied on a product, the supply may decrease, causing a leftward shift of the curve. Unlike movement along the supply curve, a shift involves a change in the curve's position on the graph.

In summary, movement along the supply curve occurs when the price of a product changes, prompting suppliers to adjust the quantity they produce. In contrast, a shift in the supply curve arises from non-price factors—such as production costs or government policies—that alter the overall supply. Thus, price changes lead to movement along the curve, while other factors result in a shift in the curve's position.
