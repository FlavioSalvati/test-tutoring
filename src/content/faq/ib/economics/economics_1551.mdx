Firms that possess market power typically achieve supernormal profits due to their capacity to influence prices and restrict competition.

**Market Power Defined**

Market power is defined as a firm's ability to affect the price of its product or service. This capability often arises in scenarios where competition is limited, enabling the firm to set prices higher than they would be in a perfectly competitive market. Consequently, such firms can generate supernormal profits, which are defined as profits that exceed the normal level expected in a competitive environment.

**Price Setting Ability**

A primary factor that allows firms with market power to realize supernormal profits is their ability to set prices. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are considered price takers; they must accept the market price for their products or services. Conversely, firms endowed with market power are price makers, meaning they have the authority to establish their own prices. This ability to set higher prices results in increased revenues, potentially leading to supernormal profits.

**Limited Competition**

Another critical reason firms with market power can earn supernormal profits is the scarcity of competition. These firms often operate in markets characterized by high barriers to entry, such as substantial start-up costs or stringent regulations. Such barriers restrict the number of competitors, which reduces the competitive pressure to lower prices. As a result, these firms can sustain elevated prices and, in turn, achieve supernormal profits.

**Unique Offerings**

Moreover, firms with market power frequently offer unique products or services that provide them with a competitive edge. This uniqueness can stem from various factors, such as patents, strong brand recognition, or advanced technology. This distinctiveness allows the firm to charge a premium for its offerings, thereby increasing revenues and contributing to supernormal profits.

**Cost Advantages**

Lastly, firms with market power may also secure supernormal profits through cost advantages. They might benefit from access to less expensive inputs, superior technology, or economies of scale, which enable them to produce at a lower cost than their competitors. This situation allows these firms to either maintain competitive pricing while securing higher profits or to undercut competitors and gain a larger market share, both of which can lead to supernormal profits.
