Market power can significantly contribute to income inequality within an economy by enabling firms to generate higher profits at the expense of consumers.

Market power is defined as the ability of a firm to influence the price of a product or service within the market. This situation often arises in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets, where few competitors exist. When a firm possesses considerable market power, it can set prices above the competitive equilibrium, resulting in increased profits. These profits are typically distributed among the firm's owners and shareholders, who are usually wealthier individuals. Consequently, this dynamic can worsen income inequality within the economy.

Conversely, consumers—especially those with lower incomes—are adversely affected by market power. They are forced to pay higher prices for goods and services, which diminishes their disposable income and purchasing power. This scenario can further widen the income gap between the affluent and the economically disadvantaged.

Additionally, market power can lead to wage inequality. Firms that hold significant market power often have the ability to suppress wages, as they encounter less competition for labor. This can create a situation where workers receive compensation that is below their marginal product, defined as the additional output generated by an additional unit of labor. As a result, a larger share of income accrues to the owners of capital, while a smaller share is allocated to labor, thereby exacerbating income inequality.

Furthermore, market power can influence income distribution through its effects on innovation and economic growth. Firms with substantial market power may lack the incentive to innovate or invest in research and development, as they can sustain high profits without needing to enhance their products or services. This stagnation can hinder economic growth and curtail overall income levels, while simultaneously concentrating income and wealth among the owners of these firms.

In summary, market power has profound implications for income distribution within an economy. It can lead to increased profits for firms and wealthier individuals, while negatively affecting consumers and workers, thereby intensifying income inequality.
