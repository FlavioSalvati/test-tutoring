The natural rate of output plays a vital role in Aggregate Supply (AS) as it signifies the economy's potential output level.

The natural rate of output, often referred to as potential output or full-employment output, represents the quantity of real GDP that the economy could produce if all its resources were fully utilized. In essence, it indicates the maximum amount of goods and services the economy can generate while operating at full capacity, without triggering inflation or increasing unemployment.

Aggregate Supply (AS) denotes the total volume of goods and services that firms in an economy are willing and able to sell at a given price level. The natural rate of output significantly influences AS because it reflects the economy's productive capacity. When the actual output is below the natural rate, a negative output gap occurs, signaling that the economy is underperforming and has unused capacity. This situation typically leads to a rightward shift in the AS curve, indicating an increase in supply. Conversely, when actual output exceeds the natural rate, a positive output gap arises, suggesting that the economy is overheating and resources are being overutilized. This scenario generally results in a leftward shift of the AS curve, indicating a decrease in supply.

Furthermore, the natural rate of output is essential for defining the shape of the AS curve. In the short run, the AS curve is upward sloping, which means that firms are inclined to produce more as prices rise. However, in the long run, the AS curve becomes vertical at the natural rate of output. This indicates that, over time, output is determined by the economy's productive capacity rather than the price level.

Consequently, understanding the natural rate of output is critical for comprehending the behavior of AS and the overall performance of the economy. It equips policymakers with the necessary insights to design effective fiscal and monetary policies aimed at ensuring that the economy operates at its full potential and achieves sustainable growth.
