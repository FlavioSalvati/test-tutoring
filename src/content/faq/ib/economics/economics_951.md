Negative externalities illustrate a discrepancy between private and social costs, as they represent additional costs incurred by society that are not accounted for by individual consumers or producers.

Negative externalities arise when the production or consumption of a good or service imposes costs on third parties that are not reflected in the private costs. The private cost encompasses the expenses directly borne by the producer or consumer, while the social cost includes both the private cost and the external costs imposed on society. Consequently, when negative externalities are present, the social cost of production or consumption exceeds the private cost.

For example, consider a factory that produces goods while also emitting pollution as a by-product. The private costs of production may comprise raw materials, labor, and other direct expenses. However, the pollution generated by the factory incurs additional societal costs, such as healthcare expenses for those affected by the pollution and environmental cleanup costs. These represent the negative externalities, as they are not borne by the factory but rather imposed on society. Therefore, the social cost of production—calculated as the sum of the private cost and the costs associated with the negative externality—is greater than the private cost alone.

This divergence between private and social costs can lead to market failure. When negative externalities are present, the market price fails to accurately reflect the true cost of production or consumption. As a result, goods or services may be overproduced or overconsumed from a societal standpoint, leading to a reduction in overall social welfare.

In summary, negative externalities highlight the gap between private and social costs by representing the additional burdens on society that are overlooked in private cost calculations. This gap can result in market failure, as the market price does not faithfully represent the true cost of production or consumption.
