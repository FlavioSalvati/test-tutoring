The Aggregate Demand (AD) curve is characterized by a downward slope, which can be attributed to three primary effects: the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect.

The AD curve illustrates the total demand for goods and services within an economy at various price levels. This downward slope indicates that as the price level decreases, the quantity of goods and services demanded increases, and conversely, as the price level rises, the quantity demanded decreases. The three key reasons for this negative relationship between the price level and aggregate demand are as follows:

1. **Wealth Effect**: This effect describes how fluctuations in the price level impact the purchasing power of money. When the price level declines, the real value or purchasing power of money increases, allowing consumers to purchase more goods and services with the same amount of money. This increase in consumption subsequently raises aggregate demand. Conversely, if the price level rises, the real value of money diminishes, leading to reduced consumption and a decline in aggregate demand.

2. **Interest Rate Effect**: This effect focuses on how changes in the price level influence the demand for money and, consequently, interest rates. A decrease in the price level means that individuals require less money to purchase goods and services, which reduces the demand for money. As a result, interest rates tend to fall. Lower interest rates stimulate both investment and consumption, which are essential components of aggregate demand. In contrast, when the price level increases, the demand for money rises, resulting in higher interest rates that discourage investment and consumption.

3. **International Trade Effect**: This effect concerns the relationship between the price level and net exports. When the domestic price level falls in comparison to other countries, domestic goods and services become more affordable for foreign consumers. This situation leads to an increase in exports and a decrease in imports, thereby enhancing net exports and aggregate demand. Conversely, if the domestic price level rises relative to other countries, exports decline, and imports increase, resulting in a reduction in net exports and, consequently, aggregate demand.

In summary, the downward slope of the AD curve can be explained by three main effects: a decrease in the price level increases the real value of money (wealth effect), lowers interest rates (interest rate effect), and enhances net exports (international trade effect), all contributing to an increase in aggregate demand. Conversely, an increase in the price level has the opposite effects, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand.
