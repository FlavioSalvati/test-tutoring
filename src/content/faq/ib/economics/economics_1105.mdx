The neutral interest rate is defined as the interest rate that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth, thus maintaining a balanced economy.

Also referred to as the natural, equilibrium, or neutral real interest rate, the neutral interest rate is a fundamental concept in monetary economics. It represents the hypothetical interest rate at which the economy operates in a state of equilibrium, growing at its natural rate without causing inflationary or deflationary pressures. In essence, it is the rate that keeps the economy balanced, neither promoting nor hindering economic growth.

The significance of the neutral interest rate can be understood through several key points. First and foremost, it serves as a benchmark for central banks when formulating monetary policy. By comparing the actual interest rate with the neutral rate, central banks can ascertain whether their monetary policy stance is expansionary or contractionary. If the actual interest rate is below the neutral rate, the monetary policy is considered expansionary, which can stimulate economic growth but may also lead to inflation. Conversely, if the actual rate exceeds the neutral rate, the monetary policy is viewed as contractionary, potentially slowing down economic growth while helping to control inflation.

In addition, the neutral interest rate can be a useful predictor of future economic conditions. If the actual interest rate is anticipated to remain below the neutral rate for an extended period, this may signal a forthcoming phase of economic expansion. Conversely, if the actual rate is expected to stay above the neutral rate for a prolonged duration, it could indicate an impending economic slowdown.

Lastly, the neutral interest rate offers insights into the overall health of an economy. A low neutral rate may suggest that the economy's long-term growth potential is weak, while a high neutral rate could indicate strong growth prospects. However, estimating the neutral interest rate is inherently challenging, as it is influenced by a variety of factors, including productivity growth, demographic changes, and global economic conditions. Furthermore, the neutral rate can fluctuate over time. Consequently, it should be utilized with caution and regarded as one of many tools for understanding and managing the economy.
