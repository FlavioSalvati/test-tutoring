Aggregate Demand (AD) and Aggregate Supply (AS) are fundamental concepts in macroeconomics that help determine the equilibrium point in an economy, where the total quantity of goods and services produced equals the total quantity demanded. This equilibrium is represented graphically by the intersection of the AD and AS curves at a specific price level and output level.

In macroeconomic terms, equilibrium occurs when the aggregate supply (AS) of goods and services produced matches the aggregate demand (AD) for those goods and services. This point of intersection indicates both the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium output.

The AD curve illustrates the total demand for goods and services in an economy at various price levels. It is typically downward sloping, which means that as the price level decreases, the quantity of goods and services demanded increases. This behavior can be attributed to several factors, including the wealth effect, interest rate effect, and international trade effect.

Conversely, the AS curve reflects the total supply of goods and services that firms are willing and able to produce at different price levels. In the short run, the AS curve is upward sloping, indicating that as the price level rises, the quantity of goods and services supplied also increases. This relationship occurs because higher prices can enhance firms' profits, incentivizing them to increase production. In the long run, however, the AS curve becomes vertical, signifying that the economyâ€™s output is determined by its productive capacity rather than the prevailing price level.

When the AD and AS curves intersect, the economy achieves equilibrium. At this juncture, the quantity of goods and services demanded is equal to the quantity supplied, which means there is no inherent pressure for either the price level or output to change. If the economy deviates from this equilibrium point, it will experience either excess supply (a surplus) or excess demand (a shortage), which will create pressures on the price level to adjust and guide the economy back toward equilibrium.

For instance, if the price level exceeds the equilibrium price, an excess supply of goods and services will occur. This surplus creates downward pressure on prices, prompting firms to reduce their output and causing the economy to move down along the AD curve towards the equilibrium point. Conversely, if the price level is below the equilibrium price, an excess demand for goods and services will arise. This shortage generates upward pressure on prices, leading firms to increase their output and causing the economy to move up along the AD curve toward equilibrium.
