Wealth inequality tends to be more pronounced than income inequality, primarily due to the cumulative nature of wealth and its transfer across generations.

Unlike income, which is earned over time, wealth can accumulate and be inherited. This characteristic allows individuals or families who have enjoyed wealth for an extended period to continue expanding their resources, resulting in a substantial disparity between them and those who are less fortunate. Such a gap is especially evident in societies where barriers to social mobility exist, including limited access to quality education and discrimination based on race or gender.

In contrast, income is a flow variable that denotes the amount of money an individual or household earns within a specific timeframe, typically a year. Although income can contribute to wealth accumulation, it is not the sole determinant. Other crucial factors, such as savings rates, investment returns, and inheritances, also significantly influence wealth. Consequently, even in a scenario where income distribution is perfectly equal, wealth distribution can remain highly unequal because of these additional factors.

Furthermore, wealth generates income through mechanisms such as interest, dividends, and capital gains, which can further intensify wealth inequality. Wealthy individuals have greater resources available for investment, enabling them to earn more income from their accumulated wealth. This phenomenon, often referred to as the "wealth-income feedback loop," can create a self-reinforcing cycle that exacerbates wealth inequality.

Tax policies also play a significant role in wealth inequality. In many countries, tax systems are structured in ways that disproportionately favor the wealthy, such as lower tax rates on capital gains compared to ordinary income or loopholes that facilitate the transfer of wealth across generations with minimal or no taxation. These policies can widen the gap between the rich and the poor, further entrenching wealth inequality.

In summary, while income inequality is a pressing issue, wealth inequality is frequently more severe due to the cumulative nature of wealth, its intergenerational transfer, the wealth-income feedback loop, and tax policies that disproportionately benefit the affluent.
