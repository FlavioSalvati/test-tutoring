Firms that possess market power often achieve supernormal profits due to their capability to influence prices and restrict competition.

Market power is defined as a firm’s ability to affect the price of its product or service. This power typically arises from limited competition within the market, enabling the firm to set prices higher than they would be in a perfectly competitive environment. Consequently, these firms can earn supernormal profits, which are profits exceeding the normal levels anticipated in a competitive market.

One of the primary reasons firms with market power can generate supernormal profits is their ability to set prices. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are considered price takers; they must accept the prevailing market price for their offerings. In contrast, firms endowed with market power act as price makers, allowing them to establish their own prices. This flexibility enables them to charge higher prices, resulting in increased revenues and the potential for supernormal profits.

Additionally, the absence of competition plays a significant role. Firms with market power typically operate in markets characterized by high barriers to entry, such as substantial startup costs or stringent regulations. These barriers limit the number of competitors, thereby reducing the competitive pressure on prices. As a result, these firms can sustain elevated prices and realize supernormal profits.

Moreover, firms with market power often offer a unique product or service, which provides them with a competitive edge. This uniqueness may stem from factors such as patents, strong brand recognition, or advanced technology. Such distinctive attributes allow the firm to charge a premium for its offerings, leading to increased revenues and supernormal profits.

Finally, firms possessing market power may also achieve supernormal profits through cost advantages. They might have access to lower-cost inputs, superior technology, or economies of scale, enabling them to produce goods or services at a lower cost than their competitors. This advantage allows them to either maintain the same price as their competitors while securing higher profits, or to undercut competitors on price to capture a larger market share—both strategies can ultimately result in supernormal profits.
