In microeconomics, a public good is defined by two key characteristics: non-excludability and non-rivalry in consumption.

To elaborate, public goods play a crucial role in economic theory and are identified by these two main properties. The first characteristic, non-excludability, implies that once a public good is produced, it is impossible to prevent individuals from using or benefiting from it. Typically, public goods are supplied by the government and financed through taxpayer contributions, meaning they are accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they have paid for them. Examples of non-excludable goods include public parks, street lighting, and national defense.

The second characteristic, non-rivalry in consumption, indicates that one individual's use of a public good does not diminish its availability to others. In other words, the consumption of public goods is not depleted by additional users. For instance, when one person enjoys the scenic view of a public park, this does not hinder others from enjoying the same view. Similarly, when one individual benefits from national defense, it does not reduce the level of protection available to anyone else.

It is important to recognize that not all goods provided by the government qualify as public goods. To be classified as a public good, a good must exhibit both non-excludability and non-rivalry. If a good is excludable but non-rivalrous, it is categorized as a club good. Conversely, if a good is non-excludable but rivalrous, it is deemed a common resource. Finally, if a good is both excludable and rivalrous, it is classified as a private good.

Public goods pose significant challenges in economics due to the phenomenon known as the free-rider problem. Since individuals can benefit from public goods without contributing to their cost, they have an incentive to avoid payment and instead rely on the contributions of others. This behavior can result in the under-provision of public goods, as the expenses associated with their provision are not fully covered by those who benefit from them. Consequently, public goods are often supplied by the government, which can fund their provision through taxation.
