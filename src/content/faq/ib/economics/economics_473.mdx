Exchange rate policies in regions aiming for monetary integration typically progress towards fixed or unified exchange rates.

In the quest for monetary integration, regions often implement policies designed to stabilize exchange rates, minimize exchange rate risk, and foster economic stability. This evolution is generally a gradual process, characterized by multiple stages of policy adjustments and economic transformations.

Initially, countries may adopt a managed float exchange rate system. In this system, the currency's value is allowed to fluctuate within a specified range, but central banks intervene in the foreign exchange market to curb excessive volatility. This arrangement allows for a degree of monetary policy independence while also providing a level of exchange rate stability.

As integration advances, countries may transition to a fixed exchange rate system, where the currency's value is pegged to another currency or a basket of currencies. This system enhances exchange rate stability but sacrifices monetary policy independence. In such cases, countries are required to maintain substantial reserves of foreign currency to defend the peg, and their monetary policy becomes largely influenced by the central bank of the currency to which they are pegged.

The final stage of monetary integration involves the adoption of a common currency, such as the Euro in the European Union. This step completely eliminates exchange rate risk within the integrated region; however, it also entails that countries relinquish their independent monetary policy. Instead, monetary policy is managed by a central bank that oversees the entire region, such as the European Central Bank.

The evolution of exchange rate policies in regions pursuing monetary integration is motivated by the aspiration for enhanced economic stability and integration. Nonetheless, this process involves trade-offs, particularly concerning monetary policy independence. The selection of an exchange rate system at each stage of integration is influenced by various factors, including the extent of economic convergence among countries, the stability of their economies, and their willingness to forfeit monetary policy autonomy.
