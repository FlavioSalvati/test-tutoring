A monetary union is a type of economic arrangement in which two or more countries share a common currency, whereas an economic union encompasses a broader spectrum of shared policies regarding economic matters.

A monetary union facilitates trade and economic integration by allowing member countries to use the same currency, thereby eliminating costs associated with currency exchange and mitigating exchange rate risks. The Eurozone serves as a prominent example of a monetary union, where $19$ out of $27$ member states of the European Union have adopted the Euro as their official currency. However, this arrangement comes with a significant trade-off: member countries relinquish control over their individual monetary policies. Decisions regarding interest rates and money supply are centralized, typically managed by an authority such as the European Central Bank for the Eurozone.

In contrast, an economic union represents a more extensive form of economic integration. It not only includes a common market for goods, services, and factors of production but also necessitates the harmonization of economic policies among member states. This coordination encompasses various areas, such as trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. The primary objective is to reduce or eliminate trade barriers and synchronize economic policies to foster growth and stability. The European Union exemplifies an economic union, as it integrates various policies while promoting trade among its members.

Importantly, while a monetary union can exist within an economic union—such as the Eurozone within the European Union—this is not a prerequisite. Some economic unions operate without a shared currency. For example, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) serves as an economic union that does not utilize a common currency.

In summary, although both monetary and economic unions aim to enhance trade and stimulate economic growth, they differ in their scope and the extent of policy coordination involved. A monetary union is primarily concerned with currency integration, while an economic union encompasses a wider range of economic policy integration.
