Macroeconomists define inequality as the uneven distribution of income or wealth among various groups within a society.

In more detail, inequality in macroeconomics refers to the disparity in the distribution of economic assets and income across a population. This disparity can be quantified in several ways, with the Gini coefficient being the most widely used measure. The Gini coefficient is a statistical indicator that reflects income or wealth inequality within a nation. A Gini coefficient of $0$ signifies perfect equality, where every individual has the same income, while a Gini coefficient of $1$ (or $100\%$) indicates maximum inequality among the values.

Inequality can also be assessed through the lens of wealth distribution. Wealth inequality pertains to the unequal distribution of assets among different segments of the population. The wealth gap between various population groups is a significant aspect of the broader socio-economic landscape. Economic inequality encompasses disparities in wealth, income, and consumption.

It is important to note that inequality is not inherently negative; a certain level of inequality can motivate individuals to work harder and foster innovation. However, extreme levels of inequality can lead to social instability and hinder economic growth. For example, when a small segment of the population holds a disproportionately large share of a country's wealth, it can result in slower GDP growth and reduced social mobility.

Several factors can influence inequality, including education, discrimination, power imbalances, and global market dynamics. Government policies also play a crucial role in either mitigating or exacerbating inequality. For instance, progressive tax systems and social safety nets can help reduce inequality, whereas regressive tax systems and austerity measures may contribute to its increase.

In summary, macroeconomists define inequality as the uneven distribution of income or wealth among different groups in a society. This issue is complex, with numerous contributing factors and significant implications for economic growth and stability.
