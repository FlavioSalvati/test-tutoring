Countries often pursue dollarisation or euroisation as strategies to stabilize their economies, attract foreign investment, and facilitate international trade.

Dollarisation or euroisation refers to the process of adopting a foreign currency—specifically, the US dollar or the Euro—as legal tender. This approach is frequently adopted by nations with weak or unstable economies, with the primary goal of achieving economic stability. When a country’s currency exhibits high volatility, it can lead to inflation or even hyperinflation, eroding the value of money and potentially resulting in economic turmoil. By adopting a stable foreign currency, countries can effectively curb inflation and promote economic stability.

Another significant motivation for dollarisation or euroisation is the attraction of foreign investment. Investors tend to be cautious about placing their capital in countries with unstable currencies due to the associated exchange rate risks. By embracing a stable and internationally recognized currency, countries can mitigate these risks, making their economies more appealing to foreign investors. This influx of foreign capital can subsequently be utilized for economic development initiatives.

Moreover, dollarisation or euroisation simplifies international trade. When countries engage in trade, they typically need to convert their currencies, which introduces exchange rate risks. By using a common currency, these risks can be significantly reduced, thereby enhancing the ease and efficiency of trade. This improvement can lead to increased trade volumes and contribute to overall economic growth.

Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential downsides of dollarisation or euroisation. Countries that adopt a foreign currency relinquish control over their monetary policy, which means they cannot utilize tools such as interest rates or money supply to regulate their economies. Additionally, these countries become susceptible to the economic conditions of the nation whose currency they have adopted. For instance, if the US economy experiences a downturn, countries that have dollarised may also suffer negative repercussions.

In summary, while dollarisation or euroisation can foster economic stability, attract investment, and streamline trade, it also carries significant risks. Therefore, nations must carefully evaluate these factors before deciding to adopt a foreign currency.
