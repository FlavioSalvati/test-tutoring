Negative externalities result in market inefficiencies by contributing to the overproduction or overconsumption of goods and services.

A negative externality refers to costs that affect third parties who did not choose to bear those costs. These externalities arise when the consumption or production of a good or service imposes disadvantages on individuals who are not directly involved in the transaction. Common examples include pollution, noise, and other forms of environmental degradation.

In a perfectly competitive market, the price of a good or service is determined by the intersection of supply and demand. However, the presence of negative externalities distorts this balance. Specifically, the social cost of production—which encompasses both private costs and external costs—exceeds the private cost. Consequently, the market price fails to reflect the true cost of production, leading to market failure.

This discrepancy results in overproduction or overconsumption of the affected goods or services. Producers neglect to consider the external costs they impose on society, while consumers do not pay the full social cost associated with their consumption choices. As a result, the quantity produced and consumed exceeds the socially optimal level.

For instance, consider a factory that emits pollutants into the air as a by-product of its production process. This pollution imposes a cost on society through diminished air quality, yet this cost is not reflected in the prices of the factory's goods. Consequently, the factory produces more than it would if it were held accountable for the pollution it generates, and consumers purchase more goods than they would if prices accurately reflected the true costs of production.

Thus, negative externalities lead to a misallocation of resources, as an excessive amount of resources is devoted to producing goods or services associated with these externalities. This situation is inefficient because those resources could be better utilized in other areas that would yield greater benefits for society.

In summary, negative externalities create market inefficiencies by fostering overproduction or overconsumption and resulting in a misallocation of resources. Ultimately, this leads to a decline in social welfare, as the social cost of production surpasses the social benefit derived from these goods and services.
