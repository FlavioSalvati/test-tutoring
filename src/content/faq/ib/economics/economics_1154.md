Trade protection is primarily advocated to safeguard domestic industries, preserve jobs, enhance national security, and prevent unfair competition.

Trade protection measures, such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies, are often employed to shield domestic industries from foreign competition. This is particularly relevant for developing or "infant" industries that may struggle to compete on equal terms with established foreign rivals. By imposing tariffs or quotas on imported goods, governments can make domestically produced products more competitive, encouraging consumers to choose local options. This, in turn, can stimulate domestic production and foster economic growth.

Another significant argument for trade protection is the preservation of jobs. When domestic industries face international competition, there is a risk that cheaper foreign products will inundate the market, leading to a decline in local production and potential job losses. Trade protection measures can mitigate this risk by increasing the cost of foreign goods or limiting their availability, thereby helping to protect domestic employment.

National security is also a crucial consideration. Certain industries, such as defense, energy, and food production, are deemed essential for national security. By protecting these sectors from foreign competition, a country can ensure it remains self-sufficient in these vital areas, reducing dependence on other nations. This is especially important during times of international conflict or crisis when supply chains may be disrupted.

Finally, trade protection can help prevent unfair competition. This situation arises when foreign companies benefit from cheaper labor or materials, or when they receive subsidies from their governments, enabling them to sell products at lower prices. By implementing tariffs or quotas, a country can create a more level playing field, ensuring that domestic industries are not placed at a disadvantage.

However, it is important to recognize that while trade protection can offer these advantages, it may also result in higher prices for consumers, inefficiencies in production, and the potential for trade wars. Therefore, the decision to implement trade protection measures should be carefully evaluated, weighing the potential benefits against these possible drawbacks.
