Every society encounters three fundamental economic questions: What to produce? How to produce? For whom to produce?

The first question, "What to produce?" involves determining which goods and services should be created and in what quantities. This question is critical because resources are finite, while human desires are virtually limitless. Consequently, societies must make informed choices regarding production based on the resources at their disposal and the needs and wants of their population. For instance, should a society allocate more resources to healthcare or education? Should it prioritize the production of consumer goods or capital goods? These decisions often mirror the values and priorities of the society in question.

The second question, "How to produce?" pertains to the methods and resources employed in the production of goods and services. This encompasses decisions regarding the utilization of labor, land, capital, and entrepreneurship. For example, should production be primarily labor-intensive or capital-intensive? Should a society lean towards renewable resources or rely on non-renewable ones? The answers to these inquiries are influenced by the society's available resources, technological capabilities, and its economic and environmental objectives.

The third question, "For whom to produce?" addresses the distribution of goods and services among the members of society. This involves making decisions about who receives what and in what amounts. For instance, should income and wealth be distributed equally, or should there be disparities based on factors such as effort, skill, and risk? Should a society prioritize the needs of the less fortunate over those of the affluent? These considerations are shaped by the society's political and economic systems.
