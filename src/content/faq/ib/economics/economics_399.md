Discretionary stabilisers and automatic stabilisers are two distinct types of mechanisms that governments use to manage economic fluctuations. 

**Discretionary Stabilisers**  
Discretionary stabilisers refer to intentional economic policies enacted by the government to stabilize the economy. These policies typically manifest as fiscal or monetary measures, including adjustments to government spending, taxation, or interest rates. For instance, during a recession, the government may choose to increase its spending to stimulate economic activity or reduce taxes to enhance households' disposable income, thereby encouraging consumption. The term "discretionary" highlights that these actions require conscious decisions by policymakers, as they are not automatically triggered by prevailing economic conditions.

**Automatic Stabilisers**  
In contrast, automatic stabilisers are built-in mechanisms within the economy that function without the need for deliberate government intervention. These stabilisers are designed to counteract fluctuations in economic activity autonomously. Common examples include unemployment benefits and progressive taxation. When the economy enters a downturn and unemployment rises, more individuals automatically qualify for unemployment benefits, which helps sustain their income and spending levels. Furthermore, in a progressive tax system, as individuals' incomes decline during a recession, they transition into lower tax brackets. This shift reduces their overall tax burden, allowing them to retain more disposable income.

**Key Differences**  
The fundamental distinction between discretionary and automatic stabilisers lies in the degree of government intervention required. Discretionary stabilisers necessitate active decision-making and policy modifications by the government, while automatic stabilisers operate independently to mitigate economic cycles. Both forms of stabilisers are vital for managing the economy and alleviating the effects of economic volatility. However, they also come with their own limitations and potential drawbacks. For instance, discretionary policies can be influenced by political considerations and may take time to implement effectively. In contrast, automatic stabilisers might not be adequate to address severe economic downturns. 

In summary, understanding the roles and functions of both discretionary and automatic stabilisers is essential for effective economic management.
