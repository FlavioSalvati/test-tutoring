The primary types of trade protection mechanisms include tariffs, quotas, and non-tariff barriers.

**Tariffs** are taxes levied on imported goods and represent the most prevalent form of trade protection. By raising the price of imports, tariffs reduce their competitiveness relative to domestic products, thereby safeguarding local industries from foreign competition. Tariffs can be classified as either specific, which impose a fixed amount per unit, or ad valorem, which charge a percentage of the product's value. For instance, a country may impose a tariff of $20\%$ on imported cars, resulting in higher prices that encourage consumers to opt for domestically produced vehicles.

**Quotas** are limits set on the quantity of a specific good that can be imported within a given timeframe. These restrictions are typically enforced by issuing import licenses to a limited number of importers. For example, a country might permit the importation of only $1,000$ tonnes of foreign cheese each year. Once this quota is reached, no additional imports are allowed, regardless of market demand. This measure is intended to protect domestic producers from being overwhelmed by an influx of cheaper or higher-quality foreign goods.

**Non-tariff barriers** encompass a variety of measures that restrict international trade beyond traditional tariffs and quotas. These barriers can take many forms, including import bans, regulatory standards, subsidies for domestic industries, and excessive bureaucratic procedures. For example, a country may prohibit the importation of certain goods for health or environmental reasons, or it may provide subsidies to its farmers to help them compete against lower-priced foreign products. Non-tariff barriers can be particularly effective, as they may completely exclude foreign goods or create significant challenges for them to compete in the market.

While all these measures aim to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, they can also result in inefficiencies and provoke trade disputes. Although such protectionist policies might safeguard jobs in the short term, they can stifle competition, hinder innovation, and ultimately lead to increased prices for consumers in the long run. Consequently, while trade protection may offer certain advantages in specific situations, it is generally viewed as a barrier to free trade and economic growth.
