A supply shock can indirectly influence Aggregate Demand (AD) by affecting prices and the expectations surrounding future prices.

A supply shock refers to an unexpected event that abruptly alters the supply of a product or commodity, resulting in a swift change in its price. These shocks can be classified as either positive, which leads to a sudden increase in supply, or negative, which causes a sudden decrease. Such shocks can significantly impact the economy, particularly in terms of Aggregate Demand (AD), defined as the total demand for all goods and services within an economy.

When a negative supply shock occurs—such as a natural disaster or a sharp rise in the cost of a critical input—there is a reduction in the supply of certain goods or services. This reduction typically causes prices to increase. As prices rise, consumers' purchasing power diminishes, which results in a decline in consumption, a key component of AD. Consequently, this decrease in consumption can lead to a reduction in AD overall.

Conversely, a positive supply shock, such as a technological breakthrough or the discovery of new resources, enhances the supply of certain goods or services. This increase in supply generally results in lower prices. As prices decline, consumers' purchasing power improves, prompting an increase in consumption and potentially boosting AD.

Additionally, supply shocks can also impact AD through changes in expectations regarding future prices. If consumers and businesses anticipate that a negative supply shock will lead to higher prices in the future, they may choose to increase their current consumption and investment, thereby raising AD. On the other hand, if they expect that a positive supply shock will result in lower future prices, they may reduce their current consumption and investment, leading to a decrease in AD.

In summary, supply shocks can substantially influence Aggregate Demand, primarily by altering prices and shaping expectations about future prices. The nature of the impact depends on whether the supply shock is positive or negative.
