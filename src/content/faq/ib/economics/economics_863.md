Free riders pose a significant challenge in the provision of public goods by benefiting from them without contributing to their costs.

Public goods are characterized as non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that they can be accessed by anyone without reducing their availability to others. Examples of public goods include street lighting, public parks, and national defense. The issue arises when individuals, referred to as free riders, exploit these goods without making any financial contribution. This situation occurs because public goods are accessible to all, regardless of their participation in funding.

The free rider problem complicates the provision of public goods in several key ways. Firstly, it can lead to the under-provision of these goods. If a significant number of people choose to free ride, the government or other providers may struggle to gather sufficient funding to maintain or enhance public goods. Consequently, this can result in a decline in quality or even the complete elimination of these goods. For example, if not enough individuals contribute through taxes, the government may lack the necessary funds to upkeep public parks or provide adequate street lighting.

Secondly, the free rider problem can create a sense of inequity. Individuals who do contribute to public goods may perceive it as unjust that others are able to benefit without contributing. This feeling can foster resentment and social tension. For instance, when some individuals evade taxes yet continue to enjoy public services funded by those taxes, it can lead to a significant sense of unfairness among taxpayers.

Lastly, the free rider problem can result in market failure. In a perfectly competitive market, goods and services are allocated efficiently. However, the presence of free riders disrupts this equilibrium. Since public goods are non-excludable, providers cannot prevent free riders from utilizing them. Consequently, they are unable to charge all beneficiaries, leading to insufficient revenue and potential under-provision of these essential goods.

In summary, free riders present a substantial challenge to the provision of public goods. They can result in under-provision, inequity, and market failure, complicating efforts to ensure that everyone can access the benefits these goods offer.
