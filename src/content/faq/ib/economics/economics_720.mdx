Economics is classified as a social science because it examines human behavior and its effects on wealth and resource allocation.

As a branch of social science, economics primarily focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It investigates how individuals, institutions, and societies utilize the limited resources provided by nature and earlier generations. The fundamental characteristic that qualifies economics as a social science is its emphasis on human behavior and its ramifications. It analyzes how individuals make choices regarding their work hours, purchasing decisions, savings, and investment strategies.

Additionally, economics explores interpersonal interactions and the functioning of markets. It assesses the exchange of goods and services and the mechanisms by which their prices are established. Moreover, it seeks to understand the factors that lead to economic fluctuations—both downturns and upturns—and investigates strategies for enhancing economic stability and overall welfare. All these elements necessitate an examination of human behavior and social structures, reinforcing the classification of economics as a social science.

Economics employs scientific methodologies such as observation, hypothesis formulation, prediction, and testing to comprehend and elucidate economic phenomena. However, unlike the natural sciences, economics cannot conduct controlled experiments to validate its theories. Instead, economists rely on historical data, statistical analysis, and mathematical models to evaluate their hypotheses. This integration of scientific methods alongside a focus on social behavior further emphasizes the social science nature of economics.

Furthermore, economics intersects with various other social sciences, including sociology, psychology, and political science. For instance, behavioral economics merges insights from economics and psychology to investigate how cognitive biases affect decision-making processes. Political economy examines the influence of political institutions and decisions on economic outcomes. These interdisciplinary approaches underscore the inherently social dimension of economics.

In summary, economics is termed a social science not merely because it involves numbers and graphs, but because it fundamentally deals with people, their choices, behaviors, and how these factors interact to shape economies. It is a discipline deeply rooted in social contexts, making it an essential component of the social sciences.
