Free riders take advantage of the inequities in the market by reaping benefits without contributing to the associated costs.

The term "free rider" refers to individuals or entities that benefit from resources, goods, or services without incurring any costs for those benefits. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in the context of public goods, which possess two key characteristics: they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that one person's consumption of a public good does not diminish its availability for others, and it is impossible to prevent individuals who do not pay from accessing the good.

In terms of market equity, free riders exploit existing challenges by enjoying the advantages offered by the market while failing to contribute their fair share. This behavior can manifest in various ways, such as using public goods without paying taxes, benefiting from a team's efforts without participating equally, or enjoying a clean environment without contributing to its upkeep.

Market equity refers to the fairness in the distribution of goods and services within a marketplace. It poses a significant challenge in economics because ensuring that everyone receives their fair share can be difficult, particularly when certain individuals or entities are able to exploit the system for their own benefit. Free riders exacerbate this dilemma by increasing the burden on those who do contribute, ultimately undermining the sustainability of the system.

For instance, consider a public park that is funded by taxpayers. A free rider might frequently enjoy the park while avoiding tax payments. This exploitation of market equity means that the financial responsibility for maintaining the park falls on a smaller group of taxpayers, potentially leading to inadequate funding for the park's upkeep or higher tax rates for those who do contribute.

In a team project scenario, a free rider may benefit from the hard work of their teammates without making an equal contribution. This can create feelings of resentment and conflict within the team, ultimately resulting in a diminished quality of the group's output.

In an environmental context, a company might pollute without bearing the costs of cleanup, effectively shifting the financial burden onto society. This not only damages the environment but also places an unfair strain on those who actively contribute to environmental protection.

In all these instances, free riders exploit the challenges of market equity, thereby undermining fairness and sustainability.
