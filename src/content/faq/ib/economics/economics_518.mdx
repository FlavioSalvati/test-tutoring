Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) serves as a valuable framework for analyzing exchange rates by comparing the cost of a standardized basket of goods across different countries.

PPP is grounded in a theory that posits that, in the absence of transaction costs and trade barriers, the exchange rate between two currencies should adjust so that a basket of identical goods costs the same in both countries. This principle is commonly referred to as the "law of one price." When the prices of this basket differ between countries, it indicates that one currency may be overvalued or undervalued relative to the other.

To utilize PPP for exchange rate analysis, economists begin by selecting a representative basket of goods that reflects typical consumption patterns in both countries. This basket may comprise a variety of items, including food, clothing, and household goods. The total cost of this basket is then compared in each country using the prevailing exchange rate. If the basket is more expensive in one country, it suggests that the currency in that country is overvalued. Conversely, if the basket is cheaper, it indicates that the currency is undervalued.

For instance, consider a scenario where a basket of goods costs Â£100 in the United Kingdom and $130 in the United States. The PPP exchange rate would be calculated as:

$$
\text{PPP Exchange Rate} = \frac{130}{100} = 1.3 \text{ dollars per pound}
$$

If the actual exchange rate is found to be 1.5 dollars per pound, this discrepancy suggests that the pound is overvalued, as one would receive more dollars for each pound than necessary to purchase the same basket of goods in the United States.

PPP is a useful analytical tool for assessing exchange rates, offering a straightforward method for comparing the relative value of different currencies. However, it is essential to recognize that PPP is a theoretical construct. In reality, various factors can lead to deviations between actual exchange rates and PPP rates. These factors include differences in taxation, transportation costs, trade barriers, consumer preferences, and the availability of goods.
