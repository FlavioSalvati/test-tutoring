Public goods are characterized by two key features: non-excludability and non-rivalry. These properties mean that these resources are available to everyone and that their consumption by one individual does not diminish their availability to others.

**Non-Excludability**  
Non-excludability indicates that once a public good is provided, no one can be barred from using it. This is often the result of public goods being supplied by the government or other public entities. Their use is not limited to those who pay for them or belong to specific groups. For example, once a public park is created, anyone can access its facilities, regardless of whether they have contributed to its upkeep. This feature can lead to the 'free-rider problem', where individuals benefit from the good without contributing to its cost, potentially resulting in under-provision of the good.

**Non-Rivalry**  
Non-rivalry means that one person's consumption of a public good does not reduce its availability for others. In other words, public goods can be used by multiple individuals simultaneously without being depleted. For instance, when one person listens to a public radio broadcast, others can do so as well without affecting each other's experience. This contrasts with private goods, where consumption by one person reduces the quantity available for others.

Together, these two characteristics—non-excludability and non-rivalry—distinguish public goods from other types of resources. Public goods are universally accessible to all members of society, irrespective of their contribution to the good's provision, and their use by one individual does not detract from others' ability to use them. This sets them apart from private goods, which are both excludable and rivalrous, and club goods, which are excludable but non-rivalrous.

Understanding these characteristics is essential for effective policy-making. Due to the potential for free-riding and under-provision, governments often need to intervene to ensure the availability of public goods. This intervention may involve direct provision of the goods or employing taxes and other mechanisms to fund their production and maintenance. Thus, the concepts of non-excludability and non-rivalry are fundamental to the study of public economics and the government's role in the economy.
