When both Aggregate Supply (AS) and Aggregate Demand (AD) increase simultaneously, the economy can experience growth without the pressure of inflation.

In economic terms, Aggregate Supply (AS) refers to the total quantity of goods and services that firms in an economy are willing and able to produce at a given price level. Conversely, Aggregate Demand (AD) represents the total demand for goods and services within an economy at a specific price level. A simultaneous increase in both AS and AD indicates that production and demand are rising together, which is often a sign of a healthy and expanding economy.

An increase in AS signifies that firms are enhancing their production capabilities. This growth may stem from various factors, including technological advancements, an increase in available resources, or improved operational efficiencies. This expanded production capacity enables firms to satisfy higher demand without raising prices, thereby mitigating the risk of inflation.

At the same time, an increase in AD indicates that consumers, businesses, the government, and foreign entities are eager to purchase more goods and services. This heightened demand could result from rising income levels, increased consumer confidence, or favorable economic conditions. The surge in demand encourages firms to ramp up production, leading to greater output and overall economic growth.

It is crucial to recognize that this scenario assumes a proportionate increase in both AS and AD. If AD rises more rapidly than AS, it could result in demand-pull inflation, where demand surpasses supply, causing prices to escalate. Conversely, if AS grows at a faster rate than AD, it may lead to an oversupply, resulting in falling prices.

In summary, simultaneous increases in AS and AD can foster economic growth without inflation, provided that the increases are balanced. This scenario is generally viewed as favorable for an economy, as it reflects a healthy equilibrium between production and demand.
