The introduction of a new substitute product can significantly alter market equilibrium by influencing demand, supply, and consequently, prices.

When a new substitute product becomes available, it offers consumers an alternative option. This typically results in a decline in the demand for the original product, as some consumers may choose to switch to the substitute. Consequently, the demand curve for the original product shifts to the left, reflecting a decrease in demand at every price level. This shift can establish a new market equilibrium characterized by a lower price and quantity for the original product.

On the supply side, the emergence of a new substitute can also have a notable impact. If the same firms that produce the original product also manufacture the substitute, they may divert resources from the original product to focus on the substitute. This reallocation would reduce the supply of the original product, causing its supply curve to shift to the left. Conversely, if the substitute is produced by new firms entering the market, the supply of the original product may remain unchanged.

The overall effect on market equilibrium hinges on the relative shifts in demand and supply. If the reduction in demand is greater than the reduction in supply, the price of the original product will decrease. However, if the decrease in supply outpaces the decrease in demand, the price of the original product may actually increase, despite the introduction of the substitute. Nevertheless, in most scenarios, the introduction of a new substitute product is likely to result in lower prices and quantities for the original product.

Additionally, the elasticities of demand and supply play a critical role in this process. If the demand for the original product is inelastic, the decrease in price will be modest while the decrease in quantity will be substantial. In contrast, if demand is elastic, the reduction in price will be more pronounced, while the fall in quantity will be less severe. Similarly, the elasticity of supply influences how significantly the supply curve shifts in response to the introduction of the substitute product.

In summary, the introduction of a new substitute product can lead to significant shifts in market equilibrium. The precise effects depend on various factors, including the relative shifts in demand and supply, as well as their respective elasticities.
