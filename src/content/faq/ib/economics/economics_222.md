The free market often fails to adequately supply goods and services that generate positive externalities because these societal benefits are not incorporated into pricing mechanisms.

In a free market economy, the prices of goods and services are determined by the forces of supply and demand. However, this pricing system frequently overlooks the broader societal benefits associated with certain goods and services, which are referred to as positive externalities. Positive externalities are the advantages that third parties, who did not engage in the transaction, experience as a result of economic activities. Since these benefits are not reflected in market prices, the quantity of goods or services produced and consumed may fall short of the socially optimal level.

For example, consider education. The advantages of an individual acquiring an education extend beyond the individual to society at large. An educated population contributes to a more productive workforce, lower crime rates, and heightened civic engagement. However, the societal benefits of education are not captured in the tuition fees that an individual pays. Consequently, the market may underprovide educational services because the price does not accurately reflect the full societal value of education.

Another pertinent example is the production of clean energy. The societal advantages of clean energy, including reduced pollution and enhanced public health, benefit everyone. Yet, these benefits are not incorporated into the market price of clean energy. As a result, the market may underprovide clean energy because the price does not fully account for its societal value.

In both of these instances, the market fails to deliver the socially optimal quantity of goods or services because the prices do not reflect the comprehensive societal benefits. This situation is known as market failure. To address this issue, governments often intervene by providing subsidies or enacting regulations that promote the production and consumption of goods and services that generate positive externalities.

In conclusion, the free market may underprovide positive externalities due to its pricing mechanism's failure to account for societal benefits. This oversight can lead to market failure, resulting in a quantity of goods or services produced and consumed that is less than the socially optimal level.
