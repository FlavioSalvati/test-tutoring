Markets do not always achieve equity on their own, primarily due to factors such as market failures, income inequality, imperfect competition, and externalities.

One of the key reasons for the market's inability to achieve equity is market failures. Market failures occur when the allocation of goods and services by a free market deviates from efficiency, which can result in inequitable distributions. For instance, public goods like clean air and national defense are classified as non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that they are accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they contribute financially. This leads to the 'free-rider' problem, where individuals benefit from these goods without contributing, thereby exacerbating inequity.

Income inequality also plays a significant role in hindering the natural attainment of equity in markets. In a free market, individuals generate income by selling goods, services, or labor. However, not everyone has equal access to opportunities or capabilities for earning income. Differences in education, skills, physical abilities, and experiences of discrimination can lead to considerable disparities in income. Such disparities result in inequity, as higher-income individuals can afford to purchase more goods and services, while those with lower incomes may struggle to meet even their basic needs.

Imperfect competition further complicates the market's ability to achieve equity. In an ideal perfect competition scenario, numerous buyers and sellers exist, and no single entity can significantly influence prices. However, many real-world markets are characterized by imperfect competition, where some firms possess greater market power than others. This imbalance allows these firms to manipulate prices to their advantage, often to the detriment of consumers or competing businesses, thereby contributing to inequity.

Additionally, externalities—defined as the indirect costs or benefits of a transaction affecting third parties—can obstruct the market's ability to foster equity. For example, a factory that emits pollution creates a negative externality, impacting the local community. If the factory does not account for the costs associated with this pollution, it effectively receives a subsidy from the community, further perpetuating inequity.

In summary, while market mechanisms are powerful tools for resource allocation, they do not inherently lead to equity. Various factors, including market failures, income inequality, imperfect competition, and externalities, can inhibit the market's natural capacity to achieve equitable outcomes.
