A devaluation refers to a deliberate reduction in the value of a country's currency, whereas depreciation signifies a decrease in currency value motivated by market forces.

Both devaluation and depreciation indicate a decline in the value of a country's currency relative to others. However, the primary distinction between the two lies in their underlying causes. Devaluation is a strategic decision made by a government or central bank to intentionally lower the currency's value. This action is commonly observed in fixed exchange rate systems, where authorities maintain control over the currency's valuation. Governments may choose to devalue their currency to rectify trade imbalances, as this makes exports more affordable and imports costlier, thus promoting domestic consumption and production.

In contrast, depreciation occurs naturally within floating exchange rate systems and is influenced by market dynamics such as supply and demand, inflation rates, interest rates, and the overall economic and political climate. When a currency experiences depreciation, its value diminishes in comparison to other currencies. This decline can be triggered by various factors, including a country's economic performance, political instability, or fluctuations in global market conditions.

For instance, if investors lose faith in the stability of a country's economy, they may begin selling off their investments in that country's currency. This increased supply coupled with decreased demand can lead to a depreciation of the currency's value. Conversely, a government or central bank may opt for a devaluation to stimulate exports and alleviate a trade deficit.

In summary, while both devaluation and depreciation result in a decline in a currency's value, the fundamental difference lies in their origins: devaluation is a conscious policy decision, whereas depreciation arises from market-driven forces.
