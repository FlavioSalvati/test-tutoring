A change in price has a direct impact on the quantity supplied; as the price increases, the quantity supplied also increases.

In economics, the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell is referred to as the law of supply. This law states that, all other factors being equal, an increase in price leads to an increase in the quantity supplied. This phenomenon occurs because higher prices incentivize producers to supply more goods, allowing them to earn greater revenues.

For example, if the price of apples rises, apple growers will be motivated to sell a larger quantity of apples. They may choose to hire additional workers, utilize more fertilizers, or invest in new machinery to boost their production. The increased price enables them to recover the costs associated with these inputs while still achieving a profit. Conversely, if the price of apples declines, growers may reduce their production, as it may become unprofitable to maintain their previous output levels.

This relationship is often illustrated through the supply curve, which typically slopes upward. The vertical axis represents the price of the good or service, while the horizontal axis represents the quantity supplied. As one moves up along the curve, the quantity supplied increases, reflecting the corresponding rise in price.

However, it is crucial to recognize that this relationship assumes all other factors remain constant. In reality, various factors such as production costs, technological advancements, and expectations regarding future prices can also influence the quantity supplied. For instance, if the cost of fertilizers rises, apple growers may choose to decrease their supply, even if the price of apples stays high. Similarly, if growers anticipate a future increase in apple prices, they may hold back some of their current supply to sell at the higher price later.

In conclusion, while price is a fundamental determinant of the quantity supplied, it is not the sole factor. Producers consider a multitude of elements when deciding how much to supply, and changes in these factors can shift the supply curve, resulting in variations in the quantity supplied at every price level.
