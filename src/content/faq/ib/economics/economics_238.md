Governments frequently take on the responsibility of providing public goods because private enterprises often find it unprofitable to do so due to the inherent characteristics of these goods, namely non-excludability and non-rivalry.

Public goods are defined as goods that are both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludability implies that once a public good is produced, it is not feasible to prevent anyone from using it. Non-rivalry means that one individual's consumption of the good does not diminish its availability for others. These attributes create challenges for private firms attempting to charge for the use of public goods, which is a primary reason why such goods are typically provided by government entities.

A classic example of a public good is a lighthouse. Once constructed, it is impossible to exclude any ship from benefiting from the light it emits (demonstrating non-excludability). Furthermore, when one ship utilizes the lighthouse’s light, it does not reduce the light available for other ships (illustrating non-rivalry). Consequently, a private company would struggle to impose charges on ships for using the lighthouse, making it unlikely for them to find it profitable to build and maintain such a structure. This scenario highlights the role of government in providing the lighthouse as a public good.

Additionally, the provision of public goods often involves extensive infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, and public parks. These large-scale initiatives require substantial investment and long-term planning, which may exceed the capacity or interest of private firms. In contrast, governments can distribute the financial burden of these projects across a broad tax base and are better positioned to engage in long-term strategic planning, thus making them more suitable for providing such goods.

Moreover, public goods frequently generate positive externalities—benefits to society that are not reflected in the price of the good. For instance, public parks can enhance public health and promote community cohesion, advantages that are not captured in the maintenance costs of the park. Private firms, driven primarily by profit motives, may overlook these external benefits when assessing the feasibility of providing a good. In contrast, governments are able to factor in these broader societal advantages when deciding to supply public goods.

In summary, due to the unique characteristics of public goods, the significant investments required for their provision, and the potential for positive externalities, governments are often more equipped than private firms to deliver these essential goods.
