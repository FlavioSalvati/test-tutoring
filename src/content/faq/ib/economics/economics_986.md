Markets characterized by high information asymmetry often experience diminished competition due to the unequal distribution of knowledge between buyers and sellers.

Information asymmetry occurs when one party involved in a transaction possesses more or superior information than the other party. This discrepancy can create an unfair advantage that hinders competitive dynamics. In markets where information asymmetry is prevalent, potential entrants may hesitate to participate due to the perceived disadvantages they would face against established competitors who have access to more information.

A classic example is the market for used cars, where sellers typically have more knowledge about the quality of the vehicles they are selling compared to buyers. This situation is famously known as the "lemons problem." When buyers cannot differentiate between high-quality cars (referred to as "peaches") and low-quality cars (termed "lemons"), they may be reluctant to pay a premium price, fearing they might end up purchasing a lemon. Consequently, this uncertainty can deter new sellers of high-quality cars from entering the market, as they are unable to secure fair prices for their vehicles due to the prevailing information asymmetry. As a result, the market may become saturated with lemons, further stifling competition.

Additionally, high information asymmetry can give rise to adverse selection and moral hazardâ€”two phenomena that can further curtail competition. Adverse selection occurs when the lack of information leads to the selection of higher-risk individuals or products. In the insurance sector, for instance, if insurers are unable to accurately assess the risk profiles of potential clients, they may inadvertently attract a disproportionate number of high-risk customers. This situation can escalate costs and potentially drive some insurers out of the market.

Moral hazard, conversely, arises when one party alters their behavior because they are shielded from the consequences of their actions. An example of this is an individual with car insurance who might drive more recklessly, knowing that the insurance company will cover the costs of any accidents. This behavior can lead to increased expenses for insurers and may discourage some firms from offering insurance altogether, which ultimately reduces competition.

In summary, high information asymmetry can significantly diminish competition within a market by creating unfair advantages for certain players, discouraging new entrants, and fostering adverse selection and moral hazard.
