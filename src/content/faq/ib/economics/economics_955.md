Club goods are characterized as excludable yet non-rivalrous, meaning access can be limited to those who pay, while one person's use does not diminish the availability for others.

In economic terms, club goods—also referred to as artificially scarce goods—are a specific category of goods that are excludable but non-rivalrous. This implies that access to these goods can be restricted to a certain group of individuals, typically those who are willing to pay for them, thus making them excludable. However, the consumption of these goods by one individual does not reduce the quantity available for consumption by others, which is what makes them non-rivalrous.

To illustrate the concept of club goods, consider the example of a private park that charges an entry fee. The management of the park can prevent entry to those who do not pay, making it an excludable good. Yet, one person's enjoyment of the park does not significantly diminish the ability of others to enjoy it as well, which underscores its non-rivalrous nature. This is particularly true if the park has a large capacity, where one person's use does not inhibit others from using it concurrently.

Another pertinent example is a subscription-based streaming service, such as Netflix. The service can exclude individuals who do not pay the subscription fee; however, one person watching a show does not prevent others from viewing the same content simultaneously. This is feasible due to the digital nature of the service, which allows for an unlimited number of simultaneous streams of the same program.

In contrast, public goods are defined as non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they are accessible to everyone and one person's use does not affect availability for others. Typical examples include public parks and street lighting. Conversely, private goods are both excludable and rivalrous; they can be restricted to those who pay, and one person's consumption reduces the availability for others. Common examples of private goods include food and clothing.

In summary, club goods represent a distinct category within the field of economics, characterized by their excludable yet non-rivalrous nature. This unique attribute enables the development of business models that can generate revenue through access fees while still catering to a large number of users.
