Market power has a particularly detrimental impact on low-income individuals by driving up the costs of goods and services, making them less accessible.

**Understanding Market Power**

Market power is defined as the ability of a firm, or a group of firms, to set and sustain prices above what would be established in a competitive market environment. This phenomenon typically arises in situations involving monopolies or oligopolies, where a single company or a small number of firms dominate a specific market. When these entities exercise their market power, they can impose higher prices than those that would occur in a competitive landscape, resulting in increased costs for consumers.

**Impact on Low-Income Individuals**

The effects of market power are disproportionately felt by low-income individuals for several reasons:

1. **Higher Proportion of Income Spent on Essentials**: Low-income households allocate a larger share of their income to basic necessities such as food, housing, and utilities. Therefore, when prices for these essential goods and services rise due to market power, low-income individuals are significantly impacted, as they have limited disposable income to absorb such increases.

2. **Reduced Choice and Quality**: Market power can lead to a decrease in consumer choice and a decline in the quality of goods and services. Firms that possess market power often lack the motivation to innovate or enhance their products, given the reduced competition they face. This stagnation in quality disproportionately affects low-income consumers, who may not have the financial means to seek superior alternatives.

3. **Exacerbation of Income Inequality**: The profits generated by firms wielding market power tend to benefit shareholders and top executives disproportionately, rather than being equitably distributed across the economy. This dynamic can worsen income inequality, with the affluent growing wealthier while the less fortunate struggle to make ends meet.

4. **Limited Access to Essential Services**: In sectors such as healthcare and utilities, firms with significant market power may prioritize serving more lucrative markets or customers, neglecting those in lower-income areas. As a result, individuals in these regions may find themselves without access to critical services.

**Conclusion**

In summary, market power can exert a profound and disproportionate influence on low-income individuals by elevating the costs of goods and services, diminishing choice and quality, intensifying income inequality, and restricting access to essential services. Addressing these issues is crucial for fostering a more equitable economic environment.
