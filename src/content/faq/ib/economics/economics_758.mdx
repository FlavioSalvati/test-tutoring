Composite demand refers to a situation in which a good or service is sought for multiple purposes.

In the field of economics, the term "composite demand" describes the scenario where a specific good or service is required for various applications. This implies that the demand for this good or service arises from its different uses. For example, petroleum exemplifies composite demand, as it serves multiple functions: it is utilized for heating, transportation, and as a raw material in several industries.

A key characteristic of composite demand is that an increase in demand for one particular use of the good or service can impact its availability and price for other uses. This occurs because the total supply of the good or service is divided among its various applications. For instance, if the demand for petroleum for heating purposes rises, this could result in a shortage of petroleum available for transportation or industrial applications, subsequently driving up prices.

The implications of composite demand are significant for market dynamics and economic planning. It can create competition among different uses of a good or service, leading to price fluctuations and supply shortages. Therefore, understanding composite demand is essential for businesses and policymakers when managing resources and making strategic decisions.

Furthermore, composite demand can affect the elasticity of demand for a good or service. If a good or service has numerous substitutes for one application but few for others, its overall price elasticity of demand may be inelastic. For instance, if the use of petroleum for heating can be easily substituted with other energy sources, but its use in transportation cannot, then an increase in petroleum prices may not substantially decrease its overall demand.

In conclusion, composite demand is a fundamental concept in economics that highlights the multi-purpose nature of demand for certain goods or services. It plays a crucial role in shaping market dynamics and influencing economic decisions.
