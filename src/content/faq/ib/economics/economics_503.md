Exchange rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including inflation rates, interest rates, political stability, and economic performance.

One of the primary determinants of exchange rates is inflation rates. Countries that experience lower inflation rates tend to see an appreciation in their currency value, as their purchasing power increases in relation to other currencies. When a nation maintains consistently low inflation, the value of its goods and services rises. This increase in value attracts foreign buyers, thereby boosting demand for the country's currency and, consequently, enhancing its value.

Interest rates also play a crucial role in shaping exchange rates. When a country's interest rates increase, it becomes a more attractive destination for foreign investment, leading to currency appreciation. Higher interest rates offer lenders a greater return compared to other nations, encouraging foreign capital inflow and contributing to an increase in the currency's exchange rate.

Political stability and economic performance are additional vital factors influencing exchange rates. Countries with lower political risk tend to attract more foreign investors, which increases foreign capital inflow and supports currency appreciation. Similarly, robust economic performance can draw in foreign investment. For example, if a country's economy is expanding, it typically indicates thriving businesses, rising profits, and a positive economic outlook. This scenario entices foreign investors seeking to benefit from economic growth, increasing demand for the country's currency and resulting in an appreciation of the exchange rate.

Moreover, the terms of trade—defined as the ratio of export prices to import prices—also affect exchange rates. If a country's export prices rise more rapidly than its import prices, its terms of trade improve favorably. This improvement boosts export revenues, leading to a higher demand for the nation's currency and, in turn, an increase in its value.

In summary, the determination of exchange rates is a complex process influenced by various economic and political factors. A thorough understanding of these elements can aid in predicting future fluctuations in exchange rates.
