The primary objective of fiscal policy is to manage the economy by adjusting levels of government spending and taxation.

Fiscal policy serves as a vital instrument for governments to influence economic performance. It encompasses the strategic manipulation of government expenditures and tax rates to either stimulate economic growth or to moderate it, depending on the prevailing economic conditions. The overarching goals of fiscal policy are to achieve and sustain full employment, control inflation, and promote economic growth.

During economic downturns, governments can implement expansionary fiscal policy to spur growth. This approach typically involves increasing government spending, reducing taxes, or a combination of both strategies. Enhanced government spending can directly elevate demand within the economy, resulting in increased output and higher employment levels. Simultaneously, lower taxes boost disposable income for households, which encourages greater consumption and investmentâ€”further stimulating demand.

On the other hand, when the economy is experiencing excessive growth or inflation, the government may adopt contractionary fiscal policy to temper economic activity. This strategy may involve decreasing government spending or increasing taxes. By reducing government expenditure, demand within the economy can decline, leading to lower output and employment levels. Additionally, higher taxes diminish disposable income for households, which tends to discourage consumption and investment, thereby further curtailing demand.

Fiscal policy can also play a role in income redistribution, which is considered a secondary objective. Through adjustments in tax rates and government spending, the government can influence the distribution of income across the economy. For instance, progressive taxation, where individuals with higher incomes pay a larger percentage of their earnings in taxes, can help alleviate income inequality.

In conclusion, the primary purpose of fiscal policy is to manage the economy effectively. It is a powerful tool that enables governments to influence economic activity with the goals of achieving and maintaining full employment, controlling inflation, and fostering economic growth. Additionally, while income redistribution is a secondary aim, it remains an important aspect of fiscal policy implementation.
