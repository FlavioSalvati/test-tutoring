The balance of payments (BoP) is inherently balanced due to its double-entry accounting system, which meticulously records both inflows and outflows of money.

The BoP serves as a comprehensive record of a country's economic transactions with the rest of the world over a specified period. It encompasses various transactions, including the trade of goods and services, financial transfers, investments, and other forms of economic interactions. Under the double-entry bookkeeping principle, each transaction is recorded twice: once as a credit (inflow) and once as a debit (outflow). This systematic approach guarantees that the total of all transactions, or the balance of payments, remains equal to zero.

The BoP is divided into two primary accounts: the current account and the capital and financial account. The current account captures transactions related to goods, services, income, and current transfers. In contrast, the capital and financial account documents transactions involving investments, loans, and other types of capital transfers. A surplus in the current account necessitates a corresponding deficit in the capital and financial account, and vice versa. This relationship arises because a surplus in one account indicates an outflow of funds, which must be counterbalanced by an inflow in the other account.

For instance, if a country exports more goods and services than it imports, it will experience a current account surplus. This surplus signifies that money is entering the country, recorded as a credit in the current account. However, this inflow must be offset by a debit elsewhere in the BoP. Such debits could manifest as foreign investments in the country, a decline in the nation's foreign reserves, or an increase in overseas liabilities.

In summary, the balance of payments is always balanced due to its double-entry accounting system, where every economic transaction with the world is logged twice: once as money coming in and once as money going out. It consists of two main components: the current account and the capital and financial account. Surpluses or deficits in one account are consistently counterbalanced by changes in the other, thereby maintaining an overall balance of zero.
