Firms that possess market power often resort to non-price competition as a strategy to differentiate their products and enhance their market share.

Non-price competition encompasses various tactics employed by firms to attract customers without altering the prices of their products or services. These tactics may include enhancing product quality, providing superior customer service, investing in advertising and branding, or adding additional features to their offerings. Firms with market power, such as monopolies or oligopolies, frequently engage in non-price competition due to their ability to influence market dynamics and set their own prices.

One primary motivation for these firms to adopt non-price competition is to distinguish their products from those of their rivals. By elevating the quality of their goods or improving customer service, they can render their products more appealing to consumers, thereby increasing their market share. This strategy is particularly crucial in markets characterized by a few dominant firms, as it enables them to differentiate themselves and attract a larger customer base.

Additionally, firms with market power may engage in non-price competition to establish barriers to entry for potential rivals. By making substantial investments in advertising and branding, they can cultivate a strong brand identity and foster customer loyalty, which can pose challenges for new entrants attempting to penetrate the market. This practice helps these firms sustain their market power and retain control over pricing.

Moreover, non-price competition can assist firms with market power in maximizing their profits. By differentiating their products and creating barriers for new competitors, they can reduce the price elasticity of demand for their offerings. This reduction means that they can raise prices without experiencing a significant loss of customers, ultimately leading to increased revenues and profits.

In summary, firms with market power frequently engage in non-price competition to distinguish their products, expand market share, establish barriers for potential competitors, and maximize their profits. This approach can be particularly effective in markets where a limited number of large firms are vying for dominance, as it helps them stand out and attract more customers.
