An unskilled workforce can significantly hinder economic progress by decreasing productivity, stifling innovation, and undermining competitiveness in the global market.

A workforce is deemed unskilled when it lacks the necessary training, education, or experience required to perform complex tasks or jobs that demand specialized knowledge. This deficiency in skills can impede economic advancement in several key ways. 

Firstly, an unskilled workforce often results in lower productivity levels. Productivity, defined as the amount of output produced per unit of input, is a fundamental driver of economic growth. When workers lack the skills needed to execute their jobs efficiently, the overall output diminishes, leading to a slowdown in economic growth.

Secondly, an unskilled workforce can obstruct innovation. Innovation is essential for economic development, as it fosters the creation of new products, services, and technologies that can stimulate economic expansion. However, innovation typically necessitates a high level of skill and knowledge. Without a sufficiently skilled workforce, a nation may struggle to innovate and keep pace with technological advancements, further limiting its economic progress.

Thirdly, an unskilled workforce can diminish a country's competitiveness in the global market. In today's interconnected world, nations compete not only based on the goods and services they produce but also on the skills and talents of their labor force. A country with a predominantly unskilled workforce may find it challenging to attract foreign investment, which is a vital engine for economic growth.

Additionally, an unskilled workforce can contribute to elevated levels of unemployment, particularly structural unemployment. This type of unemployment arises when there is a mismatch between the skills possessed by workers and the skills required by employers. High unemployment rates can lead to various social and economic issues, including increased poverty and inequality, reduced consumer spending, and further deceleration of economic growth.

In conclusion, an unskilled workforce can impede economic progress in numerous ways, including lowering productivity, hindering innovation, reducing global competitiveness, and contributing to higher unemployment rates. Therefore, investing in education and training to cultivate a skilled workforce is essential for fostering economic advancement.
