National defense and street lighting serve as quintessential examples of public goods due to their inherent characteristics of non-excludability and non-rivalry.

Public goods are services or commodities provided by the government or the public sector that benefit all members of society. They are defined by two primary features: 

1. **Non-excludability**: Once a public good is made available, no individual can be effectively excluded from using it.
2. **Non-rivalry**: One person's consumption of the good does not diminish its availability for others.

**National Defense** is a prime example of a public good. It is non-excludable because, once the government establishes national defense, all citizens are safeguarded, irrespective of their contributions to funding it. Furthermore, it exhibits non-rivalry; the protection afforded to one individual does not lessen the protection available to others. In practical terms, the safeguarding of one citizen does not come at the expense of another. This is why national defense is typically managed by the government; a private entity would struggle to exclude those who do not pay and to charge individuals for their protection.

**Street Lighting** represents another classic public good. It is non-excludable, as once the lights are illuminated, everyone can benefit from them, regardless of whether they have contributed financially. Additionally, it is non-rivalrous; one person's enjoyment of the light (for instance, walking beneath it at night) does not restrict others from utilizing the same light. Consequently, street lighting is generally provided by local governments, as it would be impractical for a private business to charge individuals for their personal use of the light.

In summary, both national defense and street lighting exemplify public goods due to their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature. They are provided for the collective benefit of society, ensuring that one individual's utilization does not reduce their availability to others.
