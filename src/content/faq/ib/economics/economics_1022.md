The provisioning of public goods can result in inequities due to factors such as uneven distribution, the free-rider problem, and differing valuations of these goods.

Public goods are characterized as non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they are accessible to all members of society regardless of their contribution to their provision, and one person's use does not diminish another's ability to use them. However, the provision of these goods can give rise to inequities in several ways.

Firstly, the distribution of public goods may not be uniform across society. For instance, public amenities like parks or libraries may be more prevalent in affluent neighborhoods, resulting in an inequitable distribution of these resources.

Secondly, the non-excludable nature of public goods can lead to the 'free-rider' problem, where individuals or groups benefit from these goods without contributing to their provision. This situation can create inequities, as those who either cannot or choose not to contribute still reap the benefits, while others bear the associated costs. This issue is particularly pronounced in societies with significant income or wealth disparities, as individuals with fewer resources may be less able to contribute to public goods provision while still enjoying the benefits.

Thirdly, individuals and groups within society may have varying valuations of public goods. For example, a person who frequently uses public transportation may place a higher value on the availability of this service compared to someone who predominantly relies on private transportation. This divergence in valuation can lead to disagreements over the appropriate level of provision and funding for public goods, potentially resulting in inequities in their availability.

Additionally, the funding of public goods is often sourced from taxation, which can also contribute to inequities. In cases where the tax system is regressive—meaning that the tax rate decreases as the taxable amount increases—lower-income individuals may disproportionately shoulder the burden of financing public goods. Even in a progressive tax system, where higher-income individuals pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes, there can still be disputes and perceptions of inequity regarding who should bear the costs of providing public goods.

In conclusion, while public goods are designed to be universally accessible and beneficial, the practicalities of their provision can lead to various forms of inequity.
