Creating a market for externalities, such as carbon trading, involves assigning a monetary value to the cost of pollution, thereby enabling companies to buy and sell the rights to emit carbon dioxide.

At its core, the idea of establishing a market for externalities is rooted in the economic principle of 'internalizing externalities.' Externalities refer to the costs or benefits that impact individuals or entities who do not have a choice in bearing those costs or benefits. In the context of carbon emissions, the associated cost is the environmental damage inflicted by the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Typically, this cost is not reflected in the prices of goods or services that lead to carbon emissions, allowing companies to pollute without facing any financial consequences.

To address this market failure, governments or regulatory bodies can implement a market for these externalities. Specifically, in carbon trading, a limit or 'cap' is established on the total amount of carbon that certain sectors or industries are allowed to emit. Companies are then allocated or sold allowances that authorize them to emit a specified amount of carbon. Should a company manage to reduce its emissions and have surplus allowances, it can sell these to other companies that need to emit more. This mechanism creates a financial incentive for companies to decrease their emissions.

The price of these allowances is influenced by supply and demand within the market. When numerous companies seek to purchase allowances, prices increase, making pollution more costly and encouraging emission reductions. Conversely, if many companies are looking to sell allowances, prices will decrease.

This approach is referred to as 'cap and trade.' It has been implemented in various forms globally to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most prominent examples is the European Union's Emissions Trading System, which is one of the largest and most recognized initiatives of its kind. By establishing a market for carbon emissions, the system aims to achieve reductions in the most cost-effective manner possible. Companies that can reduce their emissions at a low cost will do so, selling their surplus allowances to those for whom emission reductions are more expensive. This strategy ensures that the overall cap on emissions is met in an economically efficient way.
