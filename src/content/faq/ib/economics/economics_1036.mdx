The GDP deflator is an essential measure that adjusts for inflation by comparing the current year's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to that of a designated base year.

Also referred to as the GDP price deflator, it quantifies the price level of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services within an economy. This measure is expressed as a ratio of the value of goods and services produced in a specific year at current prices to the value of those same goods and services at prices from a base year. Understanding this ratio is crucial, as it reveals whether changes in GDP are primarily due to an increase in the production of goods and services or due to inflationary price increases.

To compute the GDP deflator, one divides the nominal GDP by the real GDP and then multiplies the result by $100$. Nominal GDP represents the market value of all goods and services produced in an economy without adjusting for inflation, whereas real GDP reflects nominal GDP adjusted for inflation, providing a more accurate representation of actual output.

For instance, consider a scenario where a country's nominal GDP is £500 billion and its real GDP is £400 billion. The GDP deflator in this case would be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{GDP Deflator} = \left( \frac{500}{400} \right) \times 100 = 125.
$$

This indicates that the price level has increased by $25\%$ from the base year to the current year.

The GDP deflator serves as a comprehensive measure of inflation and is an invaluable tool in economic analysis. It captures changes in the average price level within the economy and enables economists to compare economic output over different years while accounting for the effects of inflation.

In contrast to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the price level of a fixed basket of goods and services, the GDP deflator is not constrained to a static basket. Instead, it adapts to changes in consumption and investment patterns among individuals. This flexibility allows the GDP deflator to provide a more accurate representation of the inflation rate within the economy.

In summary, the GDP deflator is a vital instrument in economic analysis, facilitating the adjustment of GDP figures for inflation and enabling meaningful comparisons of economic output across various years.
