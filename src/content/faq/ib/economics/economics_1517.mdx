Club goods are a distinctive category of goods in economics that are excludable but non-rivalrous. This means that access to these goods can be limited to individuals who pay for them, yet one person's use does not diminish the availability for others.

To elaborate, club goods, also referred to as artificially scarce goods, possess two key characteristics. First, they are excludable, meaning providers can restrict access to individuals who are willing to pay. Second, they are non-rivalrous, indicating that one person's consumption of the good does not reduce the amount available for consumption by others.

A clearer understanding of club goods can be illustrated with an example. Consider a private park that charges an entry fee. The management of this park can exclude individuals who do not pay the fee, categorizing it as an excludable good. However, one person's enjoyment of the park does not significantly diminish the enjoyment available to others, thereby making it non-rivalrous. This is possible due to the park's large capacity, where one user's presence does not prevent others from enjoying the space simultaneously.

Another pertinent example is a subscription-based streaming service, such as Netflix. This service can exclude users who do not pay the subscription fee, yet one individual watching a show does not impede others from watching the same show at the same time. The digital nature of the service facilitates unlimited simultaneous streams of the same content, reinforcing its non-rivalrous characteristic.

In contrast, public goods are defined as non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that these goods are accessible to everyone, and one person's use does not affect another's ability to use them. Common examples of public goods include public parks and street lighting. Conversely, private goods are characterized as both excludable and rivalrous, meaning they can be restricted to paying individuals, and one person's consumption diminishes the availability for others. Examples of private goods include food and clothing.

In summary, club goods represent a unique type of good in economics that is excludable but non-rivalrous. This distinctive feature enables the establishment of business models that can generate revenue through access fees while simultaneously accommodating a large number of users.
