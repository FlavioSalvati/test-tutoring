Income elasticity influences demand by determining how changes in income affect the quantity of a good or service demanded.

Income elasticity of demand is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good or service changes in response to a change in income. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. This concept is crucial in understanding consumer behaviour and market dynamics, particularly in relation to luxury and necessity goods.

When the income elasticity of demand is positive, it means that as income increases, the demand for a good or service also increases. This is typically the case for normal goods, which are goods that consumers buy more of as their income rises. For example, as people's income increases, they may choose to eat out more often, leading to an increase in demand for restaurant meals.

On the other hand, when the income elasticity of demand is negative, it means that as income increases, the demand for a good or service decreases. This is typically the case for inferior goods, which are goods that consumers buy less of as their income rises. For example, as people's income increases, they may choose to buy less canned food and more fresh food, leading to a decrease in demand for canned food.

Furthermore, the magnitude of the income elasticity of demand can tell us whether a good is a luxury or a necessity. If the income elasticity of demand is greater than 1, the good is considered a luxury good, meaning that demand for it increases more than proportionately as income rises. If the income elasticity of demand is less than 1 but greater than 0, the good is considered a necessity, meaning that demand for it increases less than proportionately as income rises.

In conclusion, income elasticity of demand is a key concept in economics that helps us understand how changes in income affect consumer behaviour and market dynamics. It provides valuable insights into how consumers will respond to changes in income, which can be used by businesses and policymakers to make informed decisions.
