Negative externalities can lead to significant disparities in societal well-being by disproportionately impacting certain groups more than others.

In economic terms, negative externalities refer to the costs experienced by a third party as a consequence of an economic transaction. These costs are not reflected in the market price of the goods or services involved. When such costs are overlooked, it can result in market failure and a reduction in overall societal well-being.

For example, consider a factory that emits pollutants into the local environment as a by-product of its production process. This pollution can have various detrimental effects on the surrounding community, including health issues, property damage, and a decline in quality of life. Since these negative impacts are not included in the price of the factory's products, the factory lacks incentives to mitigate its pollution. This scenario exemplifies a negative externality.

The issue becomes more pronounced as these negative externalities often affect specific groups within society disproportionately. In the case of the polluting factory, the local community that suffers from the pollution is typically not the same group that consumes the factory's products. This creates an imbalance in societal well-being, whereby one group reaps the benefits of the factory's output, while another group bears the associated costs.

Moreover, those adversely affected are frequently the ones least equipped to handle these burdens. For instance, marginalized communities often reside in areas with higher pollution levels, driven by lower property values. These communities may also have limited access to healthcare, rendering them more susceptible to the adverse health effects of pollution. Such dynamics further intensify the disparities in societal well-being resulting from negative externalities.

In conclusion, negative externalities can create profound inequalities in societal well-being, leading to a scenario where one group enjoys the benefits of economic activity while another group suffers the costs. This situation is a clear manifestation of market failure and underscores the necessity for government intervention to rectify these imbalances.
