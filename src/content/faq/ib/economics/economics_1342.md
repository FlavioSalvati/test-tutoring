A capital account surplus indicates that a country is attracting more foreign investment than it is investing abroad.

A capital account surplus occurs when the capital and financial account of a country's balance of payments records a net inflow of funds. This situation means that the country is selling more assets to foreign investors than it is purchasing from them. These assets may include a variety of items, such as real estate, businesses, stocks, and bonds.

One significant consequence of a capital account surplus is the potential appreciation of the country's currency. Foreign investors must purchase the local currency to make investments, which increases the demand for that currency and, consequently, its value. An appreciated currency can render the country’s exports more expensive while making imports cheaper, potentially resulting in a trade deficit. However, this appreciation can also help control inflation by lowering the cost of imported goods.

Furthermore, a capital account surplus can stimulate economic growth. The influx of foreign capital can be utilized to fund new businesses, infrastructure projects, and other investments that enhance the country’s productive capacity. This can lead to job creation and increased income for residents.

On the other hand, a capital account surplus may also have adverse effects. For instance, it can create an over-dependence on foreign investment, making the economy susceptible to abrupt shifts in investor sentiment. If foreign investors withdraw their capital, it could trigger a rapid decline in the currency's value and a sharp contraction in investment and economic activity.

Additionally, a capital account surplus can lead to asset price bubbles. When a substantial amount of foreign capital flows into a specific sector, such as real estate, it can inflate prices to unsustainable levels. When these bubbles burst, the resulting economic disruption can be significant.

In summary, while a capital account surplus can have positive effects—such as currency appreciation, enhanced economic growth, and potential asset price bubbles—it also brings risks related to reliance on foreign investment and volatility in investor sentiment.
