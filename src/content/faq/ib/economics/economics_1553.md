Price discrimination occurs when a firm with substantial market power can influence prices and segment its market.

In competitive markets, firms are considered price takers, meaning they have no control over the prices of the goods or services they sell. In contrast, a firm with significant market power acts as a price maker, capable of setting its own prices. This ability to influence prices enables price discrimination, a practice where a firm charges different prices to different consumers for the same good or service.

Price discrimination can take place under three key conditions. First, the firm must possess market power, which allows it to affect the price of its product. This situation is common in monopolies or oligopolies, where competition is limited. Second, the firm must be able to segment its market, which involves categorizing customers into distinct groups based on certain characteristics such as location, age, or income level. Lastly, the firm must prevent resale, ensuring that customers who purchase a product at a lower price cannot resell it to those facing a higher price.

Market power enables a firm to adjust prices according to the price elasticity of demand in various market segments. In segments where demand is more price-sensitive (elastic), the firm will set lower prices. Conversely, in segments where demand is less price-sensitive (inelastic), the firm will impose higher prices. This practice is referred to as third-degree price discrimination.

For instance, a firm with considerable market power might charge higher prices in an affluent neighborhood, where demand is inelastic, and lower prices in a less wealthy area, where demand is elastic. Additionally, firms might offer discounts to students or seniors, who generally exhibit greater price sensitivity.

In summary, significant market power allows a firm to engage in price discrimination by influencing prices, segmenting markets, and preventing resale. While this strategy can lead to increased profits for the firm, it may also result in consumer welfare losses, particularly for those who are charged higher prices.
