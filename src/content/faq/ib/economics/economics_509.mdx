Integrated regions often implement common external tariffs (CET) to safeguard domestic industries and establish consistent trade policies across member countries.

Regions such as the European Union (EU), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) typically adopt CET as an integral part of their trade framework. This approach is a fundamental characteristic of a customs union, which represents one of the stages of economic integration. The primary objective of CET is to shield domestic industries from foreign competition while ensuring uniform trade practices towards nations that are not part of the integrated region.

Common external tariffs apply to goods and services imported from countries outside the integrated region. Consequently, all member nations impose the same tariff on imports from non-member states. This uniformity prevents goods from entering the region through the country with the lowest tariffs, a scenario referred to as trade deflection. By establishing a CET, member countries can create a level playing field for their domestic industries.

Additionally, CETs serve as a mechanism to foster economic development within the integrated region. By levying tariffs on imports, member nations can incentivize consumers to purchase domestically produced goods and services. This shift can enhance demand for local products, leading to increased production, job creation, and overall economic growth.

Furthermore, CETs can also generate revenue for member countries. The tariffs collected can be utilized to fund public services and infrastructure projects, thus contributing to the region's overall development.

However, it is essential to recognize that while CETs provide several advantages, they can also result in trade diversion. This phenomenon occurs when trade shifts from a more efficient non-member country to a less efficient member country due to the implementation of CETs. Such a shift can lead to inefficiencies and higher costs for consumers.

In summary, common external tariffs are a vital element of the trade policies in integrated regions. They serve to protect domestic industries, maintain consistent trade practices, promote economic development, and generate revenue. Nonetheless, it is important to be aware that CETs may also induce trade diversion and elevate consumer costs.
