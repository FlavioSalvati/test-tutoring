The provision of public goods can result in inequities due to factors such as uneven distribution, free-riding, and differing valuations of these goods.

Public goods are characterized as non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means they are accessible to all members of society, regardless of whether they contribute to their provision, and one person's consumption does not reduce the availability for others. However, the delivery of these goods can lead to inequities in multiple ways. 

Firstly, the distribution of public goods is often not uniform across society. For instance, amenities like public parks or libraries may be more plentiful in affluent neighborhoods, resulting in an unequal distribution of these resources.

Secondly, the non-excludable nature of public goods gives rise to the 'free-rider' problem. This occurs when individuals or groups benefit from a public good without contributing to its provision. Such a scenario can exacerbate inequities, as those who are unable or unwilling to contribute still enjoy the benefits, while others shoulder the costs. This issue is particularly pronounced in societies with significant income or wealth disparities, where individuals with fewer resources may find it challenging to contribute to the provision of public goods yet continue to benefit from them.

Thirdly, people within a society may place different values on public goods. For example, an individual who frequently utilizes public transportation may assign a higher value to this service than someone who predominantly relies on private vehicles. These varying valuations can lead to conflicts over the appropriate level of provision and funding for public goods, potentially resulting in inequities in access and benefits.

Additionally, the funding for public goods is typically sourced from taxation, which can further contribute to inequities. If the tax system is regressive—where the tax rate decreases as the taxable amount increases—then lower-income individuals may end up bearing a disproportionate burden of the costs associated with public goods provision. Even in a progressive tax system, where higher-income individuals pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes, there can still be disputes and perceptions of inequity regarding who should bear the costs of providing these goods.

In conclusion, while public goods are designed to be universally accessible and beneficial, the complexities involved in their provision can lead to various forms of inequity.
