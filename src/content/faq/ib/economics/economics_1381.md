Economics is primarily divided into two main branches: microeconomics and macroeconomics.

**Microeconomics** is the examination of individual economic entities such as households, firms, and specific industries. It emphasizes the decision-making processes of these units and how they allocate their resources. Microeconomics analyzes supply and demand within particular markets, the behavior of firms, consumer behavior, and the distribution of income and wealth. This branch also investigates how individual decisions and behaviors influence the supply and demand for goods and services, which subsequently determine prices. In turn, these prices affect the supply and demand of the goods and services in question.

In contrast, **macroeconomics** focuses on the economy as a whole. It studies aggregate indicators such as national income, unemployment rates, and inflation rates. Macroeconomics explores the interrelationships among different sectors of the economy and assesses the overall functioning of the economic system. Moreover, it evaluates the impacts of fiscal and monetary policies, economic growth, and international trade on the economy.

The two branches are closely interrelated and exert influence over one another. For instance, a shift in macroeconomic policy, such as a change in interest rates, can significantly impact the decisions made by firms and households, which are microeconomic entities. Conversely, alterations in the behavior of these entities can affect macroeconomic indicators like national income and unemployment rates.

Beyond these primary branches, economics encompasses several sub-disciplines, including behavioral economics, environmental economics, and development economics, among others. These sub-disciplines apply economic principles and methodologies to specialized areas of study. For example, behavioral economics merges economics with psychology to investigate how individuals make economic decisions, while environmental economics examines the economic implications of environmental policies.

In summary, economics is a comprehensive field characterized by two principal branches—microeconomics and macroeconomics—each addressing different levels of economic activity. Despite their distinct focuses, these branches are interconnected and influence one another in numerous ways.
