The components of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) calculated using the expenditure approach consist of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.

The expenditure approach to determining GDP is founded on the principle that all goods and services produced in an economy must be purchased by someone. By aggregating all expenditures on goods and services, we can derive the total value of a country's economic output. This methodology is succinctly represented by the formula:

$$
\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - M)
$$

In this equation, $C$ represents consumption, $I$ denotes investment, $G$ stands for government spending, and $(X - M)$ reflects net exports.

**Consumption ($C$)** refers to the total expenditures made by households on goods and services. Notably, it excludes purchases of new housing, which fall under investment. Consumption is typically the largest component of GDP and can be further categorized into three groups: durable goods, non-durable goods, and services.

**Investment ($I$)** encompasses business expenditures on physical capital, such as machinery and buildings, as well as changes in business inventories. It also includes residential investment, which pertains to the purchase of new housing by households. Investment is often a fluctuating component of GDP, influenced by factors such as interest rates and business confidence.

**Government Spending ($G$)** is the aggregate of government expenditures on final goods and services. This includes outlays for defense, education, public safety, infrastructure, and various other public services. However, transfer payments, such as social security or unemployment benefits, are excluded from this category, as they do not represent purchases of goods or services.

**Net Exports ($X - M$)** signify the difference between a country's exports and imports. When a country exports more than it imports, net exports are positive and contribute to GDP. Conversely, if imports exceed exports, net exports become negative, which detracts from GDP.

In conclusion, the expenditure approach to calculating GDP aggregates all spending on final goods and services within an economy. This comprehensive measure includes household consumption, business investment, government spending, and the net balance of exports and imports.
