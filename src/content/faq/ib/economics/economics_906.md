Predatory pricing is a strategy employed by firms with significant market power to eliminate competition and enhance their dominance in the marketplace.

In essence, predatory pricing involves a powerful firm setting its prices extremely low—often below its own production costs—with the explicit goal of driving competitors out of the market. Once these competitors have been forced to exit, the firm can subsequently increase its prices and enjoy greater profits. This strategy is typically utilized by firms that possess substantial financial resources, enabling them to absorb short-term losses.

The underlying rationale for predatory pricing is rooted in the concept of economies of scale. Firms with market power often operate on a larger scale, allowing them to produce goods at a lower cost per unit compared to their smaller rivals. By significantly reducing their prices, these firms compel their competitors to either match these low prices or risk losing their market share. Smaller firms, unable to sustain matching prices without incurring losses, may ultimately be driven out of the market.

Furthermore, predatory pricing can serve as a formidable barrier to entry for potential new competitors. The prospect of engaging in a price war with a dominant firm can dissuade new entrants from even attempting to enter the market, thereby preserving the market power of the established firm.

It is crucial to recognize, however, that predatory pricing is often deemed anti-competitive and is illegal in many jurisdictions. This practice is viewed as detrimental to consumer welfare in the long run, as it can lead to monopolistic conditions or markets with reduced competition, ultimately resulting in higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.

In summary, predatory pricing is a tactic employed by firms with market power to eliminate competition and solidify their market position. It leverages the firm's capacity to endure short-term financial losses and capitalize on economies of scale, but it is frequently criticized for its negative impact on long-term consumer welfare.
