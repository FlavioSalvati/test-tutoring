Market power in microeconomics refers to a firm's ability to influence the price of a product or service.

More specifically, market power is the capacity of a firm to dictate the terms and conditions of exchange. This power enables a firm to set prices above marginal cost, allowing it to earn supernormal profits. Essentially, market power measures a firm's ability to control the prices of its goods or services without losing customers to competitors.

Market power is often linked to monopolies or oligopolies, where a limited number of sellers exist alongside many buyers. However, it can also be present in more competitive markets if a firm offers a unique product or service, possesses strong brand recognition, or has control over a vital resource.

Several factors determine the degree of market power a firm possesses. These factors include the number of competitors in the market, the price elasticity of demand for the firm's product, the firm's cost structure, and the presence of any barriers to entry.

For instance, a firm that offers a unique product in high demand with few substitutes will likely have considerable market power. Such a firm can increase its prices without losing a significant number of customers. Conversely, a firm operating in a highly competitive market with many available substitutes will possess limited market power. In this scenario, if the firm attempts to raise its prices, customers may easily switch to a competitor's product.

Barriers to entry also play a critical role in shaping market power. High barriers to entry—such as substantial start-up costs or stringent regulations—can hinder new firms from entering the market. This situation allows existing firms to sustain their market power.

In summary, market power is a vital concept in microeconomics, influencing pricing strategies, profit levels, and the overall competitiveness of a market. Understanding market power is essential for firms as they make strategic decisions regarding pricing, product development, and market entry or exit.
