A free trade area eliminates tariffs among its member countries, while a customs union not only removes these tariffs but also establishes a common external tariff policy.

Both a free trade area and a customs union are forms of economic integration, yet they differ significantly in their level of integration and the policies they enforce. In a free trade area, member countries commit to removing tariffs, quotas, and preferences on most, if not all, goods and services traded among them. However, each country retains the autonomy to formulate its own trade policies regarding non-member countries. As a result, goods imported from a non-member country into one member of the free trade area can be re-exported to another member without incurring additional tariffs, a phenomenon known as trade deflection.

Conversely, a customs union not only abolishes tariffs between member countries but also implements a common external tariff (CET) policy. This means that all member countries apply identical tariffs on goods and services imported from non-member countries. The primary purpose of the CET is to mitigate trade deflection, which can occur within a free trade area. By establishing a CET, goods can circulate freely within the customs union, eliminating the need for customs checks and reducing the risk of trade deflection.

In terms of economic integration, a customs union signifies a more profound level of integration compared to a free trade area. While a free trade area focuses solely on liberalizing trade in goods and services among its members, a customs union advances this integration by harmonizing external trade policies. This deeper integration can foster closer economic relationships and enhanced policy coordination among member countries.

Both free trade areas and customs unions come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. For example, a free trade area allows member countries to pursue independent external trade policies, but this can lead to trade deflection and distortions in trade flows. In contrast, a customs union helps prevent trade deflection and establishes a level playing field for all member countries; however, it requires them to concede some sovereignty in trade policy-making. Ultimately, the decision between adopting a free trade area or a customs union hinges on the specific circumstances and policy objectives of the countries involved.
