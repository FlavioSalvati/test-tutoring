In microeconomics, a public good is defined by two key characteristics: non-excludability and non-rivalry in consumption.

To elaborate, public goods are a crucial concept in microeconomics, distinguished primarily by these two features. First, non-excludability implies that once a public good is produced, it is impossible to prevent anyone from using or benefiting from it. Public goods are often supplied by the government and financed through taxpayer contributions, making them accessible to all individuals, regardless of whether they have contributed financially. Examples of non-excludable goods include public parks, street lighting, and national defense.

The second characteristic is non-rivalry in consumption. This means that one person's enjoyment or use of a public good does not diminish the availability of that good for others. In essence, public goods can be consumed by multiple individuals simultaneously without being depleted. For instance, when one person appreciates the view from a public park, it does not hinder others from enjoying the same view. Likewise, when one individual benefits from national defense, this does not lessen the protection afforded to others.

It is important to recognize that not all goods provided by the government qualify as public goods. For a good to be classified as a public good, it must meet both criteria: non-excludability and non-rivalry. If a good is excludable but non-rivalrous, it is classified as a club good. Conversely, if it is non-excludable but rivalrous, it is considered a common resource. Lastly, if it is both excludable and rivalrous, it is categorized as a private good.

Public goods pose a significant challenge in economics due to the phenomenon known as the free-rider problem. Since individuals can benefit from public goods without contributing to their cost, they may choose not to pay and instead rely on others to bear the expense. This tendency can result in the under-provision of the good, as the total costs are not adequately covered by those who benefit from it. Consequently, public goods are typically provided by the government, which can finance their provision through taxation.
