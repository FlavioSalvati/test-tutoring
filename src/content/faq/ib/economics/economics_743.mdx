Normative economics and positive economics represent two distinct approaches to economic analysis, each characterized by its own methodology and focus.

**Normative Economics**  
Normative economics is fundamentally subjective and value-driven. It centers around value judgments and reflects what individuals or societies believe ought to occur. This branch of economics involves statements that are inherently opinion-based and cannot be empirically tested or validated. For instance, consider the normative statement: "The government should provide healthcare for all citizens." This declaration stems from the belief that access to healthcare is a fundamental right, regardless of an individual's financial capacity. Such statements articulate ideals about what should be, rather than providing a description of existing conditions.

**Positive Economics**  
Conversely, positive economics is characterized by its objective nature and reliance on factual information. It encompasses statements that can be empirically tested, verified, or refuted. An example of a positive economic statement is: "When the price of a product increases, the demand for that product decreases." This assertion can be substantiated by analyzing market data and consumer behavior, illustrating a relationship based on observable phenomena. Positive economics seeks to describe what is, rather than what ought to be.

**Key Differences**  
The primary distinction between normative and positive economics lies in their foundational perspectives. Normative economics is inherently subjective, relying on individual or societal judgments about values and ethics, while positive economics is objective, focusing on observable data and facts. Normative economics often informs policy-making by articulating value judgments regarding which economic policies should be pursued. In contrast, positive economics serves to analyze and forecast economic behaviors.

As you engage with economic concepts and theories, it is crucial to discern between these two analytical frameworks. When evaluating economic statements, consider whether they present empirical facts (indicative of positive economics) or express opinions regarding policy and outcomes (indicative of normative economics). This awareness will enhance your critical thinking skills and enable you to form well-informed perspectives.
