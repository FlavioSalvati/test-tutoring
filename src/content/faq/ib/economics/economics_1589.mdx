Depreciation significantly influences net calculations by diminishing the value of assets, yet it does not affect gross calculations.

Depreciation refers to the method of allocating the cost of tangible or fixed assets over their useful life. In simpler terms, it represents the decrease in an asset's value over time due to factors such as wear and tear, aging, or obsolescence. This concept is vital in accounting and finance as it impacts both net income and net worth of a company.

In the context of net calculations, depreciation plays a pivotal role. For example, net income is determined by subtracting total expenses, including depreciation, from total revenue. Consequently, as depreciation rises, net income declines. Similarly, net worth, defined as the difference between a company's total assets and total liabilities, is also influenced by depreciation. As asset values diminish due to depreciation, the company's net worth correspondingly decreases.

Conversely, depreciation does not impact gross calculations. Gross income, or gross profit, is derived by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from total revenue. Since depreciation is not included in COGS, it does not affect gross income. Additionally, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures a country's economic performance, remains unaffected by depreciation. GDP is calculated by summing consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports, none of which include depreciation in their computation.

In summary, while depreciation is a critical factor in net calculations—reducing asset values and consequently decreasing net income and net worth—it does not influence gross calculations. Understanding the role of depreciation in these financial metrics is essential for anyone studying economics, as it sheds light on how asset values evolve over time and how this evolution impacts a company's financial health.
