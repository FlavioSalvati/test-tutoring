Determining the social benefits of public goods presents significant challenges, primarily due to their non-excludable and non-rivalrous characteristics.

Public goods are defined by two key features: non-excludability and non-rivalry. Non-excludability implies that once a public good is made available, individuals cannot be prevented from using it. Non-rivalry means that one person's consumption of the good does not diminish its availability for others. These characteristics complicate the task of measuring the social benefits associated with public goods.

Firstly, the non-excludable nature of public goods complicates the identification of beneficiaries and the extent of their benefits. For instance, a public park is accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they contribute through taxes. Consequently, quantifying the individual benefit derived from the park becomes challenging. Some individuals may visit the park daily, while others may never set foot in it. Nonetheless, all individuals are considered to benefit from its mere existence.

Secondly, the non-rivalrous aspect of public goods further complicates the measurement of total social benefit. Since one person's enjoyment of a public good does not reduce its quality or availability for others, calculating the overall social benefit is intricate. For example, when one person listens to a public radio broadcast, it does not hinder others from doing the same. Thus, the total benefit cannot merely be calculated as the sum of individual benefits.

Additionally, public goods frequently generate externalities—indirect benefits or costs that affect society but are not reflected in market prices. For example, a public library does more than just provide books; it fosters literacy and encourages lifelong learning, both of which confer broader societal advantages. However, these externalities are often difficult to quantify, making their inclusion in social benefit calculations problematic.

Finally, the diverse preferences and valuations of public goods among individuals add to the complexity of determining social benefits. Some individuals may place a high value on a clean environment, while others may prioritize public safety. As a result, assessing the social benefit of public goods necessitates subjective judgments regarding the relative importance of various benefits, a process that can be contentious.

In summary, the distinctive characteristics of public goods—namely, non-excludability and non-rivalry—coupled with the presence of externalities and varying individual preferences, render the determination of their social benefits a complex challenge.
