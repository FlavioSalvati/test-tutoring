Bounded rationality and heuristics present a significant challenge to traditional economic perspectives by questioning the assumption of perfect rationality in decision-making.

Traditional economic theory posits that individuals are perfectly rational agents who consistently strive to maximize their utility or profit. This implies that they possess complete information, have unlimited cognitive processing capabilities, and can perform complex calculations to identify the optimal course of action. However, the concepts of bounded rationality and heuristics contest this idealized view.

Bounded rationality, a term introduced by Herbert Simon, posits that individuals are only "boundedly" rational. This indicates that while they strive to make rational decisions, their capacity to do so is restricted by various factors, including incomplete information, cognitive limitations, and time constraints. For instance, when choosing a university to attend, a student may lack comprehensive information about all available institutions, find it challenging to process the information they do have, and face time limitations that prevent thorough consideration of all options. Consequently, they may arrive at a decision that is not perfectly rational but is deemed "good enough" given their circumstances.

Heuristics, conversely, are mental shortcuts or "rules of thumb" that people employ to simplify the decision-making process. While heuristics can be efficient, they may lead to biases and systematic errors, further undermining the assumption of perfect rationality. For example, individuals frequently rely on the "availability heuristic," which involves making decisions based on information that is readily accessible or easily recalled, even if that information is not representative or accurate. This reliance can result in decisions that diverge from what would be expected if the individual were perfectly rational.

These concepts carry profound implications for economic theory and policy. They suggest that individuals may not always act in their best interests and that their decisions can be swayed by factors such as the presentation of information (framing), prior experiences, and cognitive biases. This challenges the traditional notion of the "rational economic man" and implies that policies designed to "nudge" individuals towards certain behaviors may prove more effective than those predicated on the assumption of perfect rationality. For instance, behavioral economics, which integrates psychological insights into economic theory, has been leveraged to develop policies that promote saving, healthy eating, and other beneficial behaviors.
