Price ceilings and floors create distortions in market outcomes, resulting in surpluses or shortages and potential inefficiencies.

**Price Ceilings**  
A price ceiling is a maximum price established by the government for certain goods and services, aimed at protecting consumers from excessively high prices. When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, it leads to a shortage. This occurs because the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at the imposed lower price. For instance, rent control policies in various cities establish a maximum price that landlords can charge tenants. Although this may make housing more affordable for some individuals, it can also result in a shortage of quality housing. This happens because landlords may lack the incentive to maintain their properties or invest in new construction.

**Price Floors**  
Conversely, a price floor represents a minimum price set by the government for certain goods and services, often to ensure that producers receive a higher income. When a price floor is established above the equilibrium price, it leads to a surplus, as the quantity supplied surpasses the quantity demanded at the elevated price. A common example of a price floor is minimum wage laws, which stipulate the lowest wage that employers can pay their workers. While this can enhance income for some employees, it may also result in unemployment if employers find it challenging to pay the minimum wage, thus hiring fewer workers.

**Market Inefficiencies**  
Both price ceilings and floors contribute to inefficiencies within the market. They hinder the market's ability to allocate resources optimally, disrupting the equilibrium between supply and demand. This disruption can lead to deadweight loss, which represents a loss of economic efficiency when the equilibrium for a good or service is not reached. Moreover, price ceilings may foster the emergence of black markets, where goods or services are sold illegally at higher prices. On the other hand, price floors can lead to wasted resources if surplus goods remain unsold.

In summary, while price ceilings and floors are often implemented with good intentions, they frequently result in unintended consequences and distortions in the market.
