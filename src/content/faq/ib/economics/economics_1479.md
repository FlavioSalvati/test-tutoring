Common pool resources (CPRs) are particularly susceptible to overexploitation due to their inherent lack of exclusivity and the challenges associated with controlling access.

CPRs are defined as natural or artificial resources where one individual's consumption diminishes the availability for others, making it essential, yet often difficult and costly, to exclude users outside a designated group. Examples of these resources include fisheries, forests, underground aquifers, and irrigation systems. The absence of exclusivity and the difficulty in access regulation render these resources vulnerable to overuseâ€”a phenomenon commonly known as the "Tragedy of the Commons."

The "Tragedy of the Commons" describes a scenario in which individual users, acting independently in pursuit of their own self-interest, undermine the collective good by depleting the shared resource. While each user enjoys direct benefits from their resource consumption, the costs associated with that depletion are borne collectively. This situation disincentivizes individuals from conserving the resource, ultimately leading to overexploitation and potential exhaustion.

Furthermore, the challenges of excluding non-group members from utilizing the resource can give rise to a "free-rider" problem. Free-riders are individuals who derive benefits from resources, goods, or services without contributing to the costs associated with their provision. In the context of CPRs, free-riders can exploit the resource without participating in its maintenance or sustainability efforts, thereby worsening the overuse dilemma.

The problem of overexploitation is also aggravated by a lack of well-defined property rights. When ownership is ambiguous, individuals have little motivation to manage the resource sustainably over the long term. Instead, the prevailing incentive is to extract as much as possible in the shortest time frame, often leading to rapid depletion as users compete to secure their share.

Additionally, external factors such as population growth, rising demand, and technological advancements that facilitate more intensive extraction can further heighten the pressure on these resources, accelerating their depletion.

In summary, the susceptibility of common pool resources to overuse is a multifaceted issue influenced by a combination of economic, social, and environmental factors. Addressing this challenge requires thoughtful management and regulatory frameworks to ensure the sustainable use of these vital resources for future generations.
