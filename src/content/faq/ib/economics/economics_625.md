Life expectancy is a crucial indicator of economic growth, reflecting advancements in healthcare, living conditions, and income levels.

It is commonly used as a proxy for the overall health of a population, which is closely linked to economic prosperity. In a robust economy, individuals typically enjoy better access to healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions, all of which can significantly enhance life expectancy. Conversely, in struggling economies, life expectancy may decline due to inadequate healthcare services, poor nutrition, and substandard living conditions.

Additionally, life expectancy is associated with productivity. Longer lifespans often translate to extended working lives, which can increase output and contribute to economic growth. Economies with higher life expectancies tend to have larger workforces that can participate in economic activities for a longer duration, potentially leading to a higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a widely used measure of economic growth.

However, it is essential to recognize that while life expectancy can indicate economic growth, it does not always directly cause it. For example, a country might exhibit a high life expectancy due to factors unrelated to economic advancement, such as a favorable climate or genetic predispositions. Likewise, economic growth does not automatically lead to improved life expectancy, particularly if the wealth generated is not equitably distributed or utilized to enhance public services, including healthcare.

Moreover, life expectancy can serve as a measure of the quality of economic growth. When economic progress is accompanied by increases in life expectancy, it suggests that the growth is inclusive and benefits the broader population. In contrast, if economic growth occurs without corresponding improvements in life expectancy, it may indicate that the growth is not shared equitably or that it fails to enhance living standards.

In summary, life expectancy plays a multifaceted role in assessing economic growth. It serves as an indicator of the overall health and well-being of a population, reflects the productivity potential of an economy, and provides valuable insights into the quality and inclusiveness of economic growth.
