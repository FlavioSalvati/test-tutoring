Public goods and externalities are fundamental concepts in economics that address market inefficiencies. 

**Public Goods**  
Public goods refer to commodities or services that are made available to all members of society without profit, typically provided by the government or private organizations. These goods are characterized by two key properties: **non-excludability** and **non-rivalry**. 

- **Non-excludability** means that once a public good is produced, it is impossible to prevent anyone from using it. 
- **Non-rivalry** indicates that one individual's consumption of the good does not diminish its availability for others.

Common examples of public goods include street lighting, public parks, and national defense.

**Externalities**  
In contrast, externalities are the indirect effects of consumption or production activities that impact the welfare of third parties, which are not captured in market prices. Externalities can be classified as either positive or negative. 

- **Positive externalities** arise when the consumption or production of a good provides benefits to third parties. For instance, an individual's education can enhance societal welfare by contributing to lower crime rates and increased productivity.
- **Negative externalities** occur when the consumption or production of a good imposes costs on others. A typical example is pollution emitted by a factory, which can adversely affect the health of nearby residents.

**The Interconnection Between Public Goods and Externalities**  
Both public goods and externalities illustrate scenarios where the market does not efficiently allocate resources. In the case of public goods, the market may entirely fail to provide them, as private firms often do not find it profitable to supply such goods. This is primarily due to their inability to exclude non-payers from benefiting and because one individualâ€™s use does not limit another's availability.

Regarding externalities, the market overlooks the full social costs or benefits associated with production and consumption. This oversight can lead to overproduction when negative externalities are present and underproduction when positive externalities exist. Consequently, both public goods and externalities typically necessitate government intervention to rectify these market failures and promote more efficient resource allocation.
