Government failure in microeconomics refers to a situation where government intervention in the economy results in an inefficient allocation of resources. 

This concept highlights the instances when governmental actions lead to outcomes that diminish both economic and social welfare. It stands in contrast to market failure, which occurs when free markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. Various factors can contribute to government failure, including inadequate information, lack of incentives, and political interference.

One primary cause of government failure is poor information. Governments may lack the comprehensive data necessary to make optimal decisions. For instance, if a government is unaware of the precise demand and supply conditions within a market, it may implement misguided price controls or subsidies. Such miscalculations can result in overproduction or underproduction, both of which represent inefficient outcomes.

Another significant factor contributing to government failure is the absence of incentives. In the private sector, businesses are driven by a strong motivation to enhance efficiency, as they aim to maximize profits. In contrast, public sector entities may not operate under the same pressures. For example, a government agency may lack the urgency to minimize costs or maximize output, leading to inefficiencies in service delivery or resource use.

Political interference also plays a crucial role in government failure. Politicians may prioritize decisions that secure electoral support rather than those that are economically sound. For example, a politician might advocate for subsidies to a struggling industry that employs a large number of constituents, despite the fact that such support might not represent the most efficient use of resources.

In conclusion, government failure is a vital concept in microeconomics. It underscores the potential drawbacks of government intervention in the economy and highlights the necessity for accurate information, strong incentives, and judicious decision-making to achieve efficient economic outcomes.
