Market power significantly distorts competitive outcomes by allowing firms to manipulate prices and restrict consumer choices.

**Definition of Market Power**

Market power is defined as a firm's ability to influence the price of a product or service within a market. This power is often concentrated in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets, where only a few firms dominate. When a firm possesses substantial market power, it can distort competitive outcomes in various ways.

**Price Manipulation**

Firstly, firms with market power can set prices above competitive levels. In a perfectly competitive market, prices are determined by the forces of supply and demand. However, firms with market power can manipulate prices to maximize their profits, leading to higher prices for consumers. This phenomenon results in allocative inefficiency, where resources are not allocated to their most valued uses.

**Limitation of Consumer Choices**

Secondly, market power can restrict consumer choice. Firms wielding market power may use their influence to hinder the entry of new competitors. This can be achieved through tactics such as predatory pricing, where a firm temporarily lowers its prices to a level that is unsustainable for competitors, or by creating barriers to entry, such as imposing high startup costs. Consequently, this reduces competition and limits the variety of options available to consumers.

**Productive Inefficiency**

Thirdly, market power can lead to productive inefficiency. In a competitive market, firms are incentivized to operate efficiently to minimize costs and maximize profits. Conversely, firms with market power may not face the same pressures, resulting in higher operational costs and lower-quality products.

**Income Inequality**

Lastly, market power can contribute to income inequality. Firms enjoying market power can earn supernormal profitsâ€”profits that exceed the normal rate of return. These excessive profits may be distributed to shareholders, thereby increasing wealth for a small segment of the population. This dynamic can exacerbate income inequality within society.

**Conclusion**

In summary, market power can distort competitive outcomes in several significant ways: it can lead to elevated prices, reduced consumer choice, productive inefficiency, and heightened income inequality. Consequently, it is crucial for governments to regulate markets effectively to prevent firms from acquiring excessive market power.
