Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important component of the balance of payments, specifically recorded within the financial account.

To elaborate, the balance of payments serves as a comprehensive record of all economic transactions conducted between the residents of a country and the rest of the world over a specified period. It is categorized into three primary accounts: the current account, the capital account, and the financial account. FDI is included in the financial account, which reflects the net changes in ownership of national assets.

FDI is defined as the net inflows of investment aimed at acquiring a lasting managerial interest in an enterprise that operates in an economy different from that of the investor. This investment encompasses several elements, including equity capital, reinvested earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital, as presented in the balance of payments. The FDI series indicates net inflows—calculated as new investment inflows minus disinvestment—from foreign investors into the reporting economy, and is further segmented into net inflows from foreign direct investors and from foreign institutional investors.

FDI can be classified into two categories: inward and outward. Inward FDI, also referred to as inbound FDI, denotes direct investments made into a country by foreign entities and is recorded as a credit in the financial account. Conversely, outward FDI, or outbound FDI, pertains to direct investments made by domestic entities in foreign countries, and is recorded as a debit in the financial account.

The influence of FDI on the balance of payments varies depending on whether it is inward or outward. Inward FDI can enhance the balance of payments by supplying a source of foreign currency, especially when the investment is directed toward export-oriented industries. Conversely, outward FDI may negatively impact the balance of payments if it results in a net outflow of currency. However, if outward FDI yields returns in the form of dividends or profits, it has the potential to improve the balance of payments over time.

In summary, FDI is a vital factor in the balance of payments, having the capacity to both improve and deteriorate the balance, contingent upon whether the FDI is inward or outward, as well as the returns it generates through dividends or profits.
