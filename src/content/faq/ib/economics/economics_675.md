Key indicators for assessing economic development include Gross Domestic Product (GDP), literacy rates, life expectancy, and the Human Development Index (HDI).

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** serves as a primary measure of a country's economic health. It quantifies the total value of all goods and services produced within a nation's borders over a specified time period. Economists utilize GDP to compare the economic performance of different countries and to project economic growth. However, it is important to note that GDP does not account for income inequality or the informal economy, which can be particularly significant in developing nations.

**Literacy Rate** is another crucial indicator of economic development. It represents the percentage of individuals above a certain age—typically 15 years—who can read and write. Literacy is vital for economic progress, as it enhances labor productivity and improves capital efficiency. A high literacy rate is often linked to a robust level of human capital, which plays a critical role in driving economic growth.

**Life Expectancy** measures the average number of years a person is expected to live, based on current mortality rates. It is a significant indicator of the overall health and well-being of a population. A higher life expectancy generally reflects better healthcare systems and living conditions, both of which are essential for fostering economic development.

**The Human Development Index (HDI)** is a composite statistic that incorporates indicators of life expectancy, education, and per capita income to rank countries into four tiers of human development. Developed by the United Nations, the HDI aims to provide a standard method for measuring human development—a concept that the UN defines as the process of expanding individuals' options and opportunities in education, healthcare, income, and employment. The HDI offers a more comprehensive perspective on economic development than GDP alone, as it considers various social dimensions of progress.

In summary, economic development can be evaluated through indicators such as GDP, which reflects a country's economic performance; literacy rates, which indicate educational attainment; life expectancy, which signifies health and living conditions; and the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines life expectancy, education, and income levels. While GDP focuses primarily on economic size, the HDI provides a broader understanding of well-being and opportunities available within a country.
