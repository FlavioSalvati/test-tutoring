Positive economic statements are objective and grounded in facts, whereas normative economic statements are subjective and rooted in value judgments.

Positive economics focuses on the description and explanation of economic phenomena. It emphasizes the analysis of facts and the exploration of cause-and-effect relationships. For instance, a positive economic statement could be: "If the price of iPhones falls, the demand for iPhones will increase." This assertion is based on the law of demand, a fundamental principle in economics which posits that, all else being equal, a decrease in the price of a product leads to an increase in the quantity demanded. The purpose of positive economics is to clarify what occurs in the economy and how various elements interconnect. It is verifiable and can be tested against factual data.

In contrast, normative economics is grounded in value judgments. It articulates opinions about what ought to be, rather than what is. Normative statements often reflect subjective views on economic fairness and the ideal state of the economy. For example, a normative statement might be: "The government should reduce taxes on the poor to promote income equality." This statement stems from a value judgment regarding income distribution and the role of government in society. Normative economics lacks a factual basis and cannot be empirically tested or proven right or wrong.

In summary, the primary distinction between positive and normative economic statements lies in their foundation and testability. Positive economics is anchored in facts and can be empirically evaluated, while normative economics is based on values and remains untestable. Understanding this difference is essential for effective economic analysis and informed policy-making.
