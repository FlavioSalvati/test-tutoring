A tariff is a tax imposed on goods imported from foreign countries, designed to regulate international trade. By increasing the cost of importing goods, tariffs result in higher prices for these goods in the domestic market. This price increase occurs because importers typically pass the additional costs onto consumers.

The effect of a tariff on the prices of imported goods can be substantial. For example, if a government implements a tariff of $20\%$ on imported cars, the price of those cars in the domestic market would likely rise by a similar percentage. Consequently, this makes imported cars more expensive compared to domestically produced vehicles, assuming all other factors remain constant.

The primary objective of tariffs is to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. By elevating the prices of imported goods, tariffs provide domestic producers with a competitive edge, enabling them to offer their products at lower prices than their international counterparts. This protective measure can foster growth in domestic industries and help maintain employment levels.

However, the benefits of tariffs for domestic industries come at a cost to consumers, who face higher prices for imported goods due to the additional tariff expenses. Furthermore, domestic producers, aware that imported goods are now more expensive, may also raise their prices. This scenario can contribute to inflation, characterized by a general rise in prices that negatively impacts the economy.

Additionally, the implementation of tariffs can trigger trade wars, where countries retaliate by imposing their own tariffs on imports. Such escalations can reduce international trade, adversely affecting global economic growth.

In summary, while tariffs serve to protect domestic industries, they simultaneously increase the prices of imported goods, making them more expensive for consumers. This rise in prices can lead to inflation and the potential for trade wars, both of which pose risks to economic stability.
