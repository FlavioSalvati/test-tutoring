Tolls and congestion charges are essential tools for addressing transport externalities by internalizing the social costs associated with road usage.

Transport externalities refer to the indirect costs or benefits that impact individuals or groups who did not choose to incur those costs or benefits. In the realm of road transport, these externalities typically encompass issues such as traffic congestion, air pollution, noise, accidents, and the deterioration of infrastructure. These costs are not directly borne by the users of the transport system; instead, they are absorbed by society at large.

To address these external costs, tolls and congestion charges serve as economic instruments designed to ensure that users of the transport system bear the consequences of their actions. This approach is grounded in the principle of "the polluter pays," a fundamental concept in environmental economics.

Tolls are often implemented to recover the expenses associated with the construction and maintenance of roads. Additionally, they can be employed to manage traffic demand on specific routes by increasing the cost of using those routes during peak periods. This strategy can help alleviate congestion and mitigate the external costs associated with it.

Conversely, congestion charges are specifically aimed at reducing traffic congestion in urban areas. By imposing fees on drivers for entering crowded zones, these charges encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, or walking. This shift can significantly lower the external costs related to congestion, air pollution, and noise.

Moreover, the revenue generated from tolls and congestion charges can be reinvested into enhancing public transport and other sustainable transportation options. This reinvestment further contributes to minimizing the external costs of road transport.

However, it is important to acknowledge that while tolls and congestion charges can be effective in internalizing transport externalities, they often face criticism. Detractors argue that these charges are regressive, disproportionately impacting lower-income individuals who may depend on car travel. Therefore, it is crucial to implement these charges in a manner that is fair and equitable, ensuring that the generated revenue is utilized to improve transportation options for everyone.
