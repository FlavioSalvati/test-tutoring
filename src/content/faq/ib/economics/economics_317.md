When Aggregate Demand (AD) surpasses Aggregate Supply (AS) in the short run, inflation occurs.

In this context, an inflationary gap arises because the total demand for goods and services in an economy exceeds its capacity to produce them. This phenomenon is commonly known as "demand-pull inflation."

When AD exceeds AS, businesses respond by raising their prices to align demand with supply. This results in a general increase in the price level, which is the essence of inflation. The heightened demand also incentivizes firms to boost their production, leading to a rise in real GDP. However, this increase in real GDP is often short-lived, as it is primarily driven by elevated demand rather than an enhancement in the economy's productive capacity.

In the labor market, the increased demand for goods and services translates into a greater demand for labor, as companies seek to ramp up production. This heightened demand can result in rising wages, which can further exacerbate inflation. If the economy is already operating at full employment, the increased demand for labor may lead to a shortage of skilled workers, contributing to wage inflation.

In the financial markets, the surge in demand can cause interest rates to rise, as businesses and consumers compete for limited funds. This increase in interest rates may subsequently reduce investment and consumption, potentially slowing economic growth.

In the foreign exchange market, a rise in demand for goods and services can lead to an uptick in imports, resulting in a deterioration of the trade balance. Conversely, if the increase in AD is driven by rising exports, it may lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency, making imports cheaper while rendering exports more expensive.

In summary, when Aggregate Demand exceeds Aggregate Supply in the short run, it triggers inflation, an increase in real GDP, rising wages, higher interest rates, and shifts in the balance of trade and exchange rates. However, these effects are often transient and may lead to economic instability if not properly managed.
