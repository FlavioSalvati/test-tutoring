Rapid economic growth does not necessarily lead to a reduction in inequality, particularly if the benefits of that growth are not distributed equitably across all sectors of society.

Economic growth is defined as an increase in the production of goods and services within an economy over a specific period. However, this growth does not inherently result in decreased inequality. The distribution of wealth and income plays a critical role in determining whether economic growth alleviates or exacerbates inequality. When the advantages of growth are concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or entities, inequality may persist or even worsen despite rapid economic expansion.

One contributing factor is the structure of the economy. In many developing nations, economic growth is often driven by sectors such as mining or manufacturing, which may not offer widespread employment opportunities. Consequently, the benefits of this growth may be concentrated among those who own or control these industries, leading to an increase in income and wealth inequality.

Government policy also significantly influences the distribution of economic benefits. In the absence of effective redistributive measures, such as progressive taxation and social welfare programs, the gains from economic growth may fail to reach the lower-income segments of society. In some instances, government policies can actually deepen inequality. For instance, if a government prioritizes investment in urban infrastructure while neglecting rural development, this can result in heightened regional disparities.

Furthermore, rapid economic growth can spur inflation, which tends to disproportionately impact the poor. If prices increase at a rate that outpaces wage growth, the purchasing power of those with lower incomes diminishes, thereby increasing inequality.

Lastly, the nature of the growth itself is a crucial factor. Economic growth driven by technological innovation can contribute to rising inequality, especially if the skills and education necessary to benefit from these advancements are not widely accessible. This phenomenon is often referred to as "skill-biased technological change," and it can create a widening gap between those equipped with the skills to leverage new technologies and those who lack such skills.

In summary, while economic growth holds the potential to reduce inequality, this outcome is not guaranteed. The equitable distribution of growth benefits is essential and is influenced by various factors, including the structure of the economy, government policies, inflation, and the characteristics of the growth itself.
