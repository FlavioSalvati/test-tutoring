Governments often supply merit goods at prices lower than those found in the marketplace to enhance accessibility and promote social welfare.

Merit goods, such as education, healthcare, and public transportation, are services that society recognizes as valuable and beneficial not only to individuals but also to the community at large. These goods are frequently under-consumed when left to the free market due to their characteristics of being non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that they can be accessed by everyone, regardless of whether they pay for them. To address this issue, governments intervene by subsidizing these goods, making them available at reduced prices or even free of charge. This ensures that all individuals, regardless of their income level, have access to essential services.

The provision of merit goods at prices below the market rate represents a form of market intervention by the government. This intervention is intended to correct market failures, which occur when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently on its own. In the case of merit goods, the market tends to under-provide these services because private firms often find it unprofitable to offer them, given their inability to exclude non-paying users. By providing these goods at lower prices, the government can stimulate consumption to a level that is socially optimal.

Additionally, offering merit goods at reduced prices enhances social welfare and equity. Merit goods typically generate positive externalitiesâ€”benefits that extend to society but are not captured in the market price. For instance, a well-educated population contributes to a more productive workforce, which in turn benefits the overall economy. By making these goods more affordable, the government can maximize these positive externalities.

Furthermore, providing merit goods at below-market prices can help mitigate income inequality. By ensuring that essential services such as education and healthcare are accessible to everyone, the government can help level the playing field, giving all individuals the opportunity to improve their standard of living.

In summary, governments supply merit goods like education and healthcare at prices below market rates to guarantee universal access, irrespective of income. This intervention addresses market failures, enhances social welfare by increasing the consumption of beneficial services, and contributes to reducing income inequality by creating equal opportunities. Ultimately, it maximizes the societal benefits derived from these essential goods.
