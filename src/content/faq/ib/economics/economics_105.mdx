Information asymmetry can significantly disrupt market equilibrium by creating imbalances in the distribution of knowledge among participants.

In a perfectly competitive market, equilibrium is achieved when the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers at a specific price level. This scenario assumes that all market participants have equal and perfect access to information. However, in reality, this assumption is rarely met. Information asymmetry occurs when one party possesses more or better information than the other, which can profoundly affect market equilibrium.

When sellers possess more information about a product or service than buyers, it can lead to a phenomenon known as "adverse selection." In this situation, low-quality goods tend to be favored for purchase because buyers lack the necessary information to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality products. Consequently, this can result in market failure, as high-quality goods may be driven out of the market, thereby disrupting the equilibrium.

Conversely, when buyers have more information than sellers, it can lead to a situation known as "moral hazard." In this case, buyers may take on greater risks, knowing that they possess more information and that the seller will bear the associated costs. This dynamic can also cause market failure, as sellers may be reluctant to participate in the market due to the heightened risks, further disrupting the equilibrium.

Additionally, information asymmetry can lead to inefficiencies in price determination. In a market characterized by perfect information, prices accurately reflect the true value of goods or services. However, in a market plagued by information asymmetry, prices may fail to represent the actual value due to the unequal distribution of knowledge. This misalignment can result in either overpricing or underpricing, both of which can disturb market equilibrium.

In summary, information asymmetry has a significant impact on market equilibrium. It can lead to market failures, inefficiencies in price determination, and an overall disruption in the balance between supply and demand. Thus, reducing information asymmetry is vital for achieving and maintaining a stable market equilibrium.
