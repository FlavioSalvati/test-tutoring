Economists differentiate between positive and normative statements, using the former to describe factual situations and the latter to express value-based opinions.

Positive economics is the branch of economics that focuses on the description and explanation of economic phenomena. It emphasizes objective facts and the cause-and-effect relationships that characterize economic behavior. This area of study includes the development and testing of economic theories. For example, a positive economic statement would be: "If the price of iPhones decreases, the quantity demanded will increase." This assertion is grounded in the law of demand, a well-established economic principle. Economists utilize positive statements to analyze and clarify the mechanics of the economy, as these claims can be tested and confirmed or refuted using empirical data.

Conversely, normative economics involves the expression of value judgments regarding economic fairness or the desired outcomes of economic policies. It deals with "what should be" or "what ought to be," rather than simply describing "what is." For instance, a normative statement might be: "The government should provide basic healthcare to all citizens." This claim reflects a value judgment about the policies the government ought to pursue. Unlike positive statements, normative statements cannot be tested or proven true or false, as they are rooted in individual or societal values and beliefs.

Economists employ normative statements to articulate opinions and advocate for specific economic policies. Such statements are prevalent in the field of public policy, where economists advise governments on the potential implications of their decisions. While positive economics is objective and fact-based, normative economics is subjective and opinion-based.

In conclusion, economists rely on both positive and normative statements in their analyses. Positive statements enable them to understand the current state of the world, whereas normative statements allow them to envision desirable future scenarios. Both types of statements are crucial for a well-rounded comprehension of economics.
