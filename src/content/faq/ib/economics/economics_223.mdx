Free markets may fail to ensure equitable resource allocation due to income inequality and various market failures.

In a free market economy, resources are allocated according to the forces of supply and demand. However, this process does not necessarily result in an equitable distribution of resources. A significant factor contributing to this issue is income inequality. In a free market, individuals with higher incomes possess greater purchasing power, enabling them to acquire a larger share of resources. This dynamic can create a disparity where the wealthy continue to amass more wealth while the less fortunate struggle to fulfill their basic needs. Consequently, those with more resources can invest and expand their wealth, exacerbating the divide between the rich and the poor.

Additionally, free markets can lead to market failures, which occur when resources are not allocated efficiently. There are several reasons this can happen. For instance, public goods—such as roads and parks—are often under-provided in a free market setting. This is because they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning individuals cannot be prevented from using them, and one person's usage does not diminish their availability to others. As a result, private firms have little incentive to provide these goods, leading to their under-provision.

Another significant form of market failure involves externalities, which are the costs or benefits incurred by a party that did not choose to bear them. Pollution serves as a prime example of a negative externality, impacting everyone rather than just the polluter. In a free market, firms may neglect to consider the social costs associated with their actions, resulting in the overproduction of goods that contribute to pollution.

Furthermore, free markets can give rise to monopolies, where a single firm controls a large portion of the market. This situation can lead to elevated prices and diminished quality of goods and services, as monopolists have little incentive to innovate or improve due to a lack of competition.

Information asymmetry—where one party possesses more or superior information than another—can also result in adverse selection and moral hazard. For instance, in the insurance market, individuals who engage in high-risk behaviors are more inclined to purchase insurance, leading to increased premiums for all.

In summary, while free markets can be effective in resource allocation, they do not inherently guarantee an equitable distribution of resources. This inequity arises from factors such as income inequality, market failures, and information asymmetry.
