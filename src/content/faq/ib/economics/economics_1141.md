Trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) are integral components of global economic integration, with a significant interrelationship where each element influences the other in multiple ways. 

FDI refers to investments made by firms or individuals in one country into business ventures located in another country. This can occur through the acquisition of a company in the target country or by expanding the operations of an existing business there.

Conversely, trade involves the exchange of goods and services across international borders, typically quantified through exports and imports. The interplay between trade and FDI can be observed in several key ways:

Firstly, FDI often facilitates an increase in trade between the home and host countries. When a company invests in a foreign country, it frequently imports raw materials or components from its home country and exports finished products back to that same country.

Secondly, FDI can enhance trade between the host country and other nations. Foreign companies may utilize the host country as a strategic base for exporting goods to various international markets, particularly in industries where production costs are lower in the host nation.

Thirdly, FDI can impact a country's balance of trade, which represents the difference between its exports and imports. A country that attracts significant FDI may experience a rise in imports, potentially deteriorating its balance of trade. However, if such investments lead to an increase in exports, the balance of trade could improve.

Lastly, the relationship between trade and FDI is also shaped by governmental policies. For instance, governments may promote FDI to stimulate exports or impose restrictions to safeguard domestic industries. Consequently, the dynamics between trade and FDI are complex and influenced by a diverse range of factors.
