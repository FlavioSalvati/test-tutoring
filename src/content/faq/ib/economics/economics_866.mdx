Governments can mitigate the underconsumption of beneficial public goods through various strategies, including subsidies, the direct provision of services, and public awareness campaigns.

Public goods are characterized by their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature, meaning that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from using them, and one person's use does not diminish their availability to others. It is essential for governments to ensure that these goods are consumed at socially optimal levels. One effective approach to prevent underconsumption is through subsidies. By lowering production costs, subsidies enable suppliers to offer goods at reduced prices, thus stimulating consumption. A notable example of this is the subsidy of education and healthcare, which acknowledges their significant societal benefits.

Another strategy employed by governments is the direct provision of public goods. By offering certain services for free or at a markedly reduced cost, governments ensure that everyone, irrespective of income, has access to these essential goods. This approach is commonly seen with public services such as transportation, libraries, and parks. By making these services available at little or no cost, governments can promote consumption levels that maximize societal welfare.

Public awareness campaigns serve as another potent tool in combating underconsumption. By educating the public about the advantages of specific goods and services, governments can stimulate demand. For instance, awareness campaigns highlighting the benefits of vaccinations can lead to increased vaccination rates, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.

Furthermore, governments may utilize regulation and legislation to address underconsumption issues. For example, making the consumption of certain public goods mandatory is a common practice, as seen in compulsory education and vaccination requirements.

Additionally, tax incentives can be leveraged to encourage greater consumption of public goods. For instance, governments may provide tax breaks or rebates to individuals or businesses that engage in the consumption or production of specific public goods. This approach not only reduces the cost of consumption but also incentivizes the production of these valuable goods.

In summary, by implementing a combination of subsidies, direct provision of services, public awareness initiatives, regulatory measures, and tax incentives, governments can effectively combat the underconsumption of beneficial public goods.
