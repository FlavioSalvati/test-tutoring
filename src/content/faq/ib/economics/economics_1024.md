Economic activity is primarily assessed through various indicators, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), unemployment rates, and inflation rates.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the most widely utilized measures of economic activity. It represents the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific time frame. GDP serves as a benchmark for comparing the economic performance of different countries and assessing overall economic growth. It is calculated by summing up consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. However, GDP has notable limitations; it does not account for income distribution within a country or the contributions of the informal economy.

Unemployment rates serve as another crucial indicator of economic health. This metric measures the percentage of the labor force that is jobless and actively seeking employment. Elevated unemployment rates may signal an economy in distress, while lower rates often indicate a robust economy. Nonetheless, it is essential to consider the various types of unemployment—cyclical, structural, frictional, and seasonal—as these can provide deeper insights into the economic landscape.

Inflation rates also play a significant role in measuring economic activity. Inflation refers to the rate at which the general price level of goods and services rises, leading to a decline in purchasing power. Central banks strive to manage inflation and prevent deflation to maintain economic stability. Economists employ various indices to quantify inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).

Additional indicators include interest rates, which reflect the cost of borrowing and the return on savings, and the balance of trade, which indicates the difference between a country's imports and exports. Furthermore, stock market performance can serve as a barometer of economic activity, often reflecting investor confidence in the economy.

In conclusion, while GDP, unemployment rates, and inflation rates are the primary metrics for gauging economic activity, a variety of other indicators can provide a more comprehensive understanding of a nation's economic health.
