Economic statements can be classified into two distinct categories: positive and normative. 

**Positive Economic Statements**

Positive economic statements are objective and grounded in factual information. They focus on describing and explaining economic phenomena and emphasize the relationships between cause and effect. For instance, a positive economic statement might be: 

$$
\text{"If the price of iPhones falls, demand for iPhones will increase."}
$$ 

This assertion is rooted in the law of demand, a fundamental principle of economics that posits that, ceteris paribus (all else being equal), as the price of a product decreases, the quantity demanded increases. The goal of positive economics is to elucidate what occurs within the economy and how various elements interact. These statements are verifiable and can be tested against factual data, making them essential for empirical analysis.

**Normative Economic Statements**

In contrast, normative economic statements are subjective and based on value judgments. They articulate opinions about what should be, rather than what is. These statements often address issues of economic fairness or express ideals regarding the economy's desired state. For example, a normative statement might be: 

$$
\text{"The government should reduce taxes on the poor to promote income equality."}
$$ 

This assertion reflects a value judgment concerning income distribution and the government's role in society. Unlike positive statements, normative economics cannot be empirically tested or proven right or wrong.

**Summary**

In summary, the fundamental distinction between positive and normative economic statements lies in their foundation and verifiability. Positive economics is anchored in factual evidence and is subject to empirical testing, while normative economics is predicated on values and cannot be subjected to such tests. Recognizing the difference between these two types of economic statements is vital for effective economic analysis and informed policy-making.
