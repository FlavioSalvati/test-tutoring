The poverty trap is a self-reinforcing mechanism that causes poverty to persist over time.

In economics, the poverty trap refers to the idea that poverty is not merely a fixed condition but rather a dynamic and self-perpetuating cycle. This concept describes a set of circumstances in which individuals or communities, once ensnared, find it exceedingly difficult to escape. The persistence of poverty is influenced by a combination of adverse economic, social, and political factors that interact with and reinforce one another.

The poverty trap can be examined at both the individual and national levels. 

At the individual level, a person born into poverty often lacks access to quality education and healthcare, which limits their potential to earn a higher income in the future. This deficit in income restricts their ability to invest in their own education and health, as well as that of their children, thereby creating a cycle of poverty that can span generations.

At the national level, a country characterized by high poverty rates may struggle to allocate resources for essential investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcareâ€”key components necessary for economic growth. The absence of such investments can result in low productivity and economic stagnation, further entrenching the cycle of poverty. Additionally, these countries frequently experience a high dependency ratio, where a significant portion of the population is either too young or too old to participate in the workforce, placing additional strain on available resources.

Social and political factors also play a critical role in reinforcing the poverty trap. Individuals living in poverty often have limited political influence, which can result in the implementation of policies that do not promote their economic advancement. Socially, poverty may contribute to increased crime and social unrest, which in turn deters investment and hinders economic growth.

Understanding the poverty trap is essential for devising effective poverty alleviation strategies. These strategies must address not only the symptoms of poverty but also the underlying mechanisms that sustain it. Effective interventions could include improving access to education and healthcare, fostering economic growth, and promoting social and political inclusion.
