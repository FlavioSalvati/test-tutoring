Markets often fail to adequately provide public goods due to their unique characteristics: non-excludability and non-rivalry, which create free-rider problems.

Public goods are distinguished by two key features. First, they are non-excludable, meaning that once a public good is made available, it is impossible to prevent individuals from using it regardless of whether they have contributed to its funding. Second, they are non-rivalrous, indicating that one person's consumption of the good does not diminish its availability for others. These attributes lead to a scenario in which individuals lack the incentive to pay for public goods, resulting in the phenomenon known as the free-rider problem.

The free-rider problem occurs when individuals recognize that they can benefit from a public good without contributing financially. For instance, a person can enjoy a clean environment or benefit from national defense without having to pay for these services. Consequently, individuals often wait for others to bear the costs of providing these goods, which ultimately results in their insufficient provision by the market.

Moreover, the provision of public goods typically involves significant costs. For example, constructing infrastructure such as roads, bridges, or public parks requires considerable investment. However, due to the non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature of these goods, private firms cannot directly charge users for their consumption. This inability to recover costs or generate profit may discourage firms from offering such goods.

Additionally, determining the optimal level of public good provision poses a challenge for markets. In conventional markets, prices act as signals that reflect supply and demand, facilitating the efficient allocation of resources. However, since public goods are not traded in markets, there is no price mechanism to convey their societal value. This absence of pricing makes it difficult for markets to ascertain how much of a public good should be provided.

In summary, the distinct characteristics of public goods—specifically their non-excludability and non-rivalry—coupled with the free-rider problem, high provision costs, and the challenges in establishing optimal provision levels, contribute to their underprovision by markets.
