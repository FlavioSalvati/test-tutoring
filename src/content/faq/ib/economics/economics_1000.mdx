Firms possessing market power invest significantly in advertising and branding to distinguish their products and sustain or enhance their market share.

In competitive markets, companies frequently find it challenging to differentiate themselves from rivals. This is where advertising and branding become essential. By making substantial investments in these areas, firms can set their products apart from those of competitors, establishing a unique selling proposition (USP) that attracts and retains customers. This differentiation is particularly vital for firms with market power, as they often contend with competition from both established companies and new entrants.

Advertising and branding also play a critical role in helping firms maintain their market power. By cultivating a strong brand identity, firms can develop a loyal customer base, which acts as a barrier to entry for potential competitors. Customers who are loyal to a particular brand are less inclined to switch to a competitor, even if that competitor offers a similar product at a lower price. Consequently, this loyalty enables firms with market power to preserve or even grow their market share.

Furthermore, advertising and branding can shape consumers' perceptions of a product's quality and value. By associating their products with positive imagery and messaging, firms can create the impression that their offerings are of high quality and provide excellent value for money. This perception can enhance consumers' willingness to pay, allowing firms with market power to set higher prices and achieve greater profitability.

Additionally, advertising and branding can facilitate market expansion for firms with market power. A robust brand can be leveraged to enter new markets, utilizing existing reputation and customer loyalty to attract new clients. Such expansion can further increase market share and reinforce their market dominance.

In summary, advertising and branding are indispensable strategies for firms endowed with market power. They assist these firms in differentiating their products, cultivating and maintaining a loyal customer base, influencing consumer perceptions, and branching into new markets. Therefore, it is unsurprising that firms with market power often allocate substantial resources to these essential areas.
