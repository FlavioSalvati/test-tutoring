Determining the social benefit of public goods presents significant challenges due to their inherent characteristics of non-excludability and non-rivalry.

Public goods are defined by two key features: non-excludability and non-rivalry. Non-excludability implies that once a public good is made available, individuals cannot be excluded from its use. Non-rivalry indicates that one person's consumption of a good does not diminish its availability for others. These traits complicate the measurement of the social benefits associated with public goods.

Firstly, the non-excludability of public goods complicates the identification of beneficiaries and the extent of their benefits. For example, a public park is accessible to all individuals, regardless of whether they contribute through taxes. This accessibility makes it difficult to quantify the benefits each individual derives from the park. While some may utilize the park daily, others may never visit it, yet all individuals are considered to benefit from its mere existence.

Secondly, the non-rivalry characteristic of public goods further complicates the assessment of social benefit. Since one person's use of the good does not reduce its availability or quality for others, calculating the total social benefit becomes challenging. For instance, when an individual listens to a public radio broadcast, it does not prevent others from enjoying the same broadcast. Therefore, the total benefit cannot simply be computed as the sum of individual benefits.

Additionally, public goods frequently generate externalities—indirect benefits or costs to society that are not captured in market prices. For example, a public library not only provides access to books but also fosters literacy and lifelong learning, contributing to broader societal benefits. However, these externalities are often difficult to quantify, leading to their exclusion from traditional calculations of social benefit.

Finally, individual preferences and valuations of public goods can vary widely, making it challenging to aggregate these into a singular measure of social benefit. Some individuals may place a high value on a clean environment, while others may prioritize public safety. Consequently, determining the social benefit of public goods involves subjective judgments regarding the relative importance of various benefits, which can be a source of controversy.

In conclusion, the distinctive characteristics of public goods—specifically non-excludability and non-rivalry—combined with the presence of externalities and the diversity of individual preferences, complicate the determination of their social benefit.
