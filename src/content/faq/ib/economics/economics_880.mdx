Information asymmetry can lead to suboptimal contracts by creating an imbalance of power and information between the parties involved in a transaction.

Information asymmetry occurs when one party possesses more or superior information than the other party. This disparity often results in inefficiencies in the transaction and can undermine fairness within the contract. Specifically, this can enable the better-informed party to negotiate terms that are more advantageous to themselves, potentially at the expense of the less informed party.

For example, consider insurance contracts. The insurer typically has more knowledge about the risks associated with the insured than the insured does. As a result, the insurer might set premiums that are excessively high or impose overly restrictive terms in the contract. Conversely, the insured may have more insight into their own health or behavior, which can lead to adverse selection. In such cases, only those individuals who are high-risk may opt to purchase insurance, ultimately resulting in increased costs for the insurer.

A similar scenario occurs in employment contracts. Here, the employer often has a better understanding of the job's requirements and responsibilities than the employee. This knowledge imbalance can lead to the employer offering wages that are insufficient or including demanding terms in the contract. On the flip side, the employee may possess greater awareness of their own skills and capabilities than the employer does. This situation can result in moral hazard, where the employee neglects their duties, knowing that the employer cannot perfectly monitor their performance.

In both of these examples, the party with more information can secure a contract that favors their interests, but this does not lead to overall efficiency. The contract fails to accurately reflect the true risks or rewards associated with the transaction. Moreover, the less informed party may become hesitant to enter into the contract, which can ultimately decrease the overall number of transactions. Thus, information asymmetry is a key factor contributing to the emergence of suboptimal contracts.
