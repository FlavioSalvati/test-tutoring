Quasi-public goods occupy a middle ground between private and public goods, exhibiting characteristics of both categories.

Also referred to as semi-public goods, quasi-public goods are defined by their partial excludability and partial rivalry. Unlike pure public goods, which are fully non-excludable and non-rivalrous, quasi-public goods can be challenging to exclude users from, though it is not impossible. Their consumption by one individual does not drastically diminish availability for others; however, congestion can occur if too many individuals utilize the good simultaneously.

A prime example of a quasi-public good is a toll road. While it is generally accessible to anyone once constructed, it is not entirely non-rivalrous; heavy usage can lead to congestion. Similarly, a public park serves as another example of a quasi-public good. It remains open to all, but if it becomes overcrowded, users may experience diminished enjoyment.

In contrast, private goods are characterized by being both excludable and rivalrous. They are excludable because access can be restricted to those who do not pay, and they are rivalrous since one person's consumption reduces the quantity available for others. A chocolate bar exemplifies this type of good: it is excludable because one can prevent someone from consuming it unless they pay, and it is rivalrous because once one person eats it, it is no longer available for others.

Thus, quasi-public goods blur the distinctions between private and public goods due to their mixed characteristics. They do not fit neatly into the categories of being fully non-excludable and non-rivalrous like public goods, nor are they entirely excludable and rivalrous like private goods. This unique blend renders quasi-public goods a distinctive category that can often be challenging to classify.
