Findings from behavioral economics fundamentally challenge classical economic theories by questioning the assumption of rational decision-making.

Classical economic theories, as articulated by thinkers such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, rest on the premise that individuals act as rational agents. These agents are believed to make decisions based on self-interest and the maximization of utility. Such theories presuppose that individuals possess perfect information, can effectively process this information, and will make choices that yield the greatest benefits. However, insights from behavioral economics reveal that human behavior is far more complex and often deviates from these assumptions.

Behavioral economics merges concepts from psychology and economics, indicating that individuals frequently act irrationally, make choices influenced by cognitive biases and heuristics, and are swayed by a variety of non-economic factors. A prominent example is the concept of **loss aversion**, introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. This principle posits that individuals experience the pain of loss more intensely than the pleasure associated with equivalent gains, which can lead them to make decisions that may not align with their best economic interests.

Another significant concept in behavioral economics is **bounded rationality**, proposed by Herbert Simon. This theory suggests that individuals lack the capacity to process all available information and arrive at the optimal decision, as classical economics assumes. Instead, individuals tend to settle for satisfactory decisions based on the limited information at their disposal and their constrained cognitive abilities.

Behavioral economics also contests the classical economic assumption of consistent preferences. Research has demonstrated that individuals' preferences can be significantly affected by how choices are presented, a phenomenon known as **framing effects**. For instance, individuals are more inclined to choose a medical treatment when its success rate is framed positively (e.g., a $90\%$ survival rate) rather than negatively (e.g., a $10\%$ mortality rate).

In conclusion, findings from behavioral economics challenge classical economic theories by providing compelling evidence that individuals do not always behave rationally, do not possess perfect information, and are influenced by a variety of non-economic factors. These insights carry significant implications for economic policy and practice, suggesting that effective interventions must consider the complexities of human behavior.
