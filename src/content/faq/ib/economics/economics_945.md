Regulatory price caps serve to mitigate the adverse effects of market power by preventing monopolies from imposing excessively high prices on consumers.

Market power is defined as a firm's ability to influence the price of its product or service within a market. This phenomenon is commonly observed in monopolistic and oligopolistic markets, where a single firm or a small group of firms exert significant control. Such firms can leverage their market power to set prices above competitive levels, resulting in increased profits for themselves while potentially harming consumers and diminishing overall economic efficiency.

Regulatory price caps are mechanisms employed by government or regulatory authorities to establish a maximum price that a firm can charge for its goods or services. These caps are typically designed to ensure that firms can cover their costs and achieve a reasonable profit margin, while simultaneously curbing their ability to exploit market power to impose exorbitant prices. By doing so, price caps help protect consumers from price gouging and maintain prices at levels that are fair and accessible.

Moreover, price caps can foster competition within the market. By preventing dominant firms from elevating prices too high, these caps can create a more favorable environment for smaller firms to compete. This, in turn, can lead to a more diverse and vibrant market, benefiting consumers through lower prices and a wider array of choices.

However, it is crucial to set price caps with careful consideration. If price caps are established too low, they may deter investment and innovation by diminishing the potential returns for firms. This could result in a decline in the quality of products or services, or even prompt firms to exit the market entirely. Therefore, while price caps can effectively reduce the detrimental impacts of market power, they must be implemented judiciously and in conjunction with other regulatory strategies to ensure a robust and competitive marketplace.
