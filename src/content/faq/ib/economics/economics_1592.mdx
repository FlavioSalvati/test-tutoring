Merit goods and public goods are distinct concepts in economics, primarily differing in their provision and consumption, even though both are considered beneficial for society.

Merit goods are defined as goods and services that the government believes will be under-consumed by the public. To address this issue, these goods are often subsidized or provided free of charge at the point of use, ensuring that access does not depend solely on an individualâ€™s ability to pay. Two key characteristics of merit goods are that they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. The term "non-excludable" means that once these goods are made available, it is impossible to prevent individuals from accessing them. "Non-rivalrous" indicates that one person's consumption of a merit good does not diminish the availability of that good for others. Common examples of merit goods include education, healthcare services, and social housing.

Conversely, public goods are characterized by being both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from using public goods, and one person's use does not reduce the quantity available for others. Examples of public goods include street lighting, public parks, and national defense. The provision of public goods is primarily the responsibility of the government, as these goods are typically not supplied by the private sector.

The fundamental distinction between merit goods and public goods lies in how they are provided and consumed. Merit goods are usually offered by the private sector but are often under-consumed due to issues such as lack of information or financial constraints. The government intervenes to ensure these goods are consumed in adequate quantities because they generate additional societal benefits. In contrast, public goods are usually provided exclusively by the government. The private sector typically refrains from supplying them, as it is challenging to charge individuals directly for their use.

In summary, merit goods, such as education and healthcare, are vital for societal welfare and often see insufficient consumption, prompting government support or subsidies. Public goods, such as street lighting and national defense, are accessible to all without diminishing their availability to others. The key difference between the two lies in their provision and consumption, with the government playing a crucial role in both areas.
