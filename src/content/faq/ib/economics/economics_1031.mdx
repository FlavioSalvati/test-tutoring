Inflation targeting is a monetary policy strategy employed by central banks to maintain price stability by keeping inflation within a specified range over a designated period.

In this approach, the central bank establishes a specific inflation target, typically expressed as a percentage range, and utilizes various monetary policy tools—such as interest rates and open market operations—to achieve this goal. The primary objective is to uphold price stability, which is essential for fostering economic growth and overall stability.

Generally, the inflation target set by central banks hovers around $2\%$, although this figure may vary depending on the country and prevailing economic conditions. This target is intentionally moderate; a target that's too high could trigger hyperinflation, leading to economic instability, while a target that's too low risks deflation, which can also be detrimental to the economy. By aiming for a balanced level of inflation, the central bank can help ensure that prices remain relatively stable.

Inflation targeting influences public expectations regarding future inflation rates. When individuals and businesses anticipate that inflation will remain within the target range, they tend to base their decisions—such as pricing strategies and wage negotiations—on these expectations. This alignment helps to anchor inflation expectations, facilitating the central bank's efforts to achieve its inflation target and sustain price stability.

Additionally, inflation targeting offers a clear and transparent framework for monetary policy. The central bank communicates its inflation target to the public, which enhances its credibility and accountability. Consistent achievement of the inflation target fosters trust and confidence in the central bank's ability to maintain price stability, further anchoring inflation expectations and contributing to economic stability.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that inflation targeting comes with its own set of challenges. It necessitates that the central bank accurately forecasts inflation and effectively utilizes its monetary policy tools. Furthermore, it assumes that the central bank has the capability to control inflation, which may not always hold true due to external factors such as global economic trends or fluctuations in commodity prices. Despite these challenges, inflation targeting continues to be a widely adopted strategy for promoting price stability.
