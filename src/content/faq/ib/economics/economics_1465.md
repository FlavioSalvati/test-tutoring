Competitive market equilibrium in microeconomics is defined as the point at which demand equals supply.

In a competitive market, numerous buyers and sellers engage in transactions involving goods or services. The concept of equilibrium represents a state of balance where there is no inherent tendency for change. In microeconomics, a competitive market achieves equilibrium when the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This condition is often referred to as the market-clearing condition, as it results in neither surplus nor shortage in the market.

The equilibrium price, also known as the market-clearing price, is the price point at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. At this price, every consumer willing to buy can find a seller ready to sell, and vice versa. The equilibrium quantity refers to the total amount of goods or services traded at the equilibrium price.

The law of demand states that, all else being equal, when the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases. Conversely, the law of supply asserts that as the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied also increases. The interaction of these two laws determines the equilibrium price and quantity in a competitive market.

If the price is above the equilibrium level, a surplus occurs, as the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. This surplus exerts downward pressure on the price, pushing it back toward equilibrium. Conversely, if the price falls below the equilibrium level, a shortage arises, as the quantity demanded surpasses the quantity supplied. This shortage puts upward pressure on the price, again driving it back toward equilibrium.

In summary, competitive market equilibrium is a fundamental concept in microeconomics. It signifies the point at which the market is balanced, with no tendency for change, occurring when the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. This results in the equilibrium price and quantity.
