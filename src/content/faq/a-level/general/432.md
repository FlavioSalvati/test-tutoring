As a University Admission Mentor, I understand that the uncertainty surrounding exams during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for the October/November 2020 session of IGCSE/A Levels, was a significant concern for many students. While I cannot predict specific outcomes, I can provide insights into the situation and its implications.

### Context of the Exams

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented challenge for educational institutions across the globe. The safety of students, teachers, and examiners became the top priority, leading to discussions about the viability of conducting exams as planned. Throughout 2020, many exam boards had to adapt their approaches to assessments, which affected students at various levels, including those preparing for IGCSE and A-Level exams.

### Cancellation of Exams

The prospect of exam cancellation was a real possibility during that time. Several factors contributed to this:

1. **Health and Safety Concerns:** Governments and educational bodies were prioritizing public health. If lockdowns or restrictions were in place close to the exam dates, holding in-person exams would not have been feasible.

2. **Logistical Challenges:** Organizing exams involves considerable logistics—exam papers need to be printed, distributed, and monitored. Restrictions on movement and gatherings complicated these processes.

3. **Precedent from Other Sessions:** Earlier in 2020, many exams were cancelled or altered in response to the pandemic. For example, the traditional GCSE and A-Level exams in the summer of 2020 were replaced with teacher-assessed grades.

### Potential Outcomes of Cancellation

If exams were cancelled, several outcomes could be anticipated:

1. **Predicted Grades:** If exams were indeed cancelled, students would likely rely on predicted grades, which are provided by teachers based on students’ performance throughout the course. These grades are typically derived from coursework, mock exams, and overall engagement in the subject.

2. **Standardization Measures:** Exam boards might implement standardization measures to ensure fairness in grading. This is essential to mitigate discrepancies that could arise due to varying levels of assessment quality and teacher expectations.

3. **Impact on University Admissions:** Universities would have to adjust their admissions processes to account for predicted grades. Many institutions have mechanisms in place to assess students based on these grades, but they may require additional documentation or a deeper look at students' overall profiles, including personal statements and references.

4. **Student Support:** The cancellation of exams would likely lead to increased support for students in navigating their next steps. This could include guidance on university applications, mental health resources, and alternative pathways to further education.

### Considerations for Students

As a student facing these uncertainties, here are some actionable steps to take:

1. **Stay Informed:** Regularly check updates from your exam board and school. They will provide the most accurate and timely information regarding any changes to exam schedules.

2. **Focus on Continuous Assessment:** Prepare as if exams will take place. Engage fully in your studies, complete assignments, and participate in any mock exams or assessments your school offers. This preparation will be beneficial regardless of whether exams occur.

3. **Communicate with Teachers:** Maintain open communication with your teachers regarding your performance and ask for feedback on areas for improvement. This can help you understand how your predicted grades may be determined.

4. **Mental Well-being:** The stress of uncertainty can take a toll on mental health. It’s important to seek support if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Schools often have resources available, including counseling services.

5. **Explore Alternatives:** Research and be open to alternative pathways to your desired university or career. This might include foundation courses, vocational training, or gap years to gain experience.

### Conclusion

While the possibility of the October/November 2020 IGCSE/A-Level exams being cancelled was a concern, there were various contingencies in place to support students in either scenario. The focus was on fairness and ensuring that all students had equitable access to their qualifications, regardless of whether assessments were conducted in person or through alternative means.

In times of uncertainty, resilience and adaptability are key. By staying informed, keeping up with studies, and seeking support when needed, students can navigate these challenges successfully. Whether exams took place or not, focusing on personal growth and academic integrity would serve students well in their future endeavors.
