Yes, you can study Edexcel A Levels and take the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) A Level exams; however, there are several important points to consider when navigating this path.

### Understanding A Levels

A Levels (Advanced Levels) are subject-based qualifications that students typically take in the UK and many other countries around the world. They are usually taken after completing GCSEs or equivalent qualifications and are crucial for university admissions, particularly at prestigious institutions like the University of Cambridge.

### Studying Edexcel A Levels

Edexcel A Levels are offered by Pearson Edexcel, one of the leading examination boards in the UK. They provide a wide range of subjects and are recognized by universities worldwide, including Cambridge. When pursuing Edexcel A Levels, students will study specific subjects, which culminate in examinations that are assessed at the end of the course.

### Taking CIE A Levels

CIE A Levels, offered by Cambridge Assessment International Education, are another well-recognized set of qualifications. Similar to Edexcel, CIE offers a variety of subjects, and the qualifications are accepted by universities globally. 

### Combining Edexcel and CIE A Levels

While it is theoretically possible to study Edexcel A Levels and take CIE A Levels, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind:

1. **College Approval:** Before you proceed, it's essential to contact the College at Cambridge (or any other university you are considering) to confirm that they accept applications from students who have taken a combination of different A Level boards. While many universities do accept qualifications from various boards, some may have specific preferences.

2. **Subject Availability:** You need to ensure that the subjects you wish to study are available under both the Edexcel and CIE exam boards. Not all subjects may be offered by both boards, so check the availability of your desired subjects.

3. **Examination Schedules:** The examination schedules for Edexcel and CIE A Levels may differ, and this could affect your study plan. Ensure that you can manage your time effectively to prepare for the examinations of both boards without compromising on performance.

4. **Assessment Methods:** Be aware that the assessment methods may differ between the two boards. For example, practical assessments or coursework components might be handled differently, and it’s crucial to understand how this might impact your overall grade.

5. **University Preferences:** Some universities have specific preferences for certain boards. While Cambridge accepts both Edexcel and CIE A Levels, it is wise to check if there are any subject-specific recommendations, especially for competitive courses such as Medicine or Engineering, where a strong mathematical background may be emphasized.

6. **High Performance:** Regardless of the combination you choose, universities, especially Cambridge, expect a very high level of attainment across all subjects. Ensure that you are adequately prepared and capable of achieving the required grades.

### Why Consider Combining?

Students might consider combining Edexcel and CIE A Levels for several reasons:

- **Subject Specialization:** Some subjects might be stronger with one examination board over another, allowing students to tailor their education to their strengths.
- **Flexibility in Learning Style:** Different boards may have varied teaching methodologies and assessment styles. Students might prefer one board’s approach over the other.
- **Availability of Subjects:** If a desired subject is not offered by one board, students can opt for another board to fulfill their academic requirements.

### Additional Considerations

- **Application Process:** When applying to universities like Cambridge, be clear and detailed in your application about the qualifications you are taking. Provide all relevant information regarding the subjects and boards to avoid any confusion during the admissions process.
  
- **Consult Academic Advisors:** If you are in a school or college, consult your academic advisors to understand the implications of taking A Levels from different boards. They can provide insights into how this might affect your university applications.

- **Preparation for Exams:** Ensure that you prepare effectively for both sets of exams. Familiarize yourself with the examination format, structure, and required content for both Edexcel and CIE A Levels. 

### Conclusion

In summary, while you can study Edexcel A Levels and take CIE A levels, it is essential to consider the potential implications and ensure that you meet the expectations of your desired university. Contact your chosen College for specific guidance and ensure that you are well-informed about the requirements and processes involved in your application. 

By approaching your studies thoughtfully and strategically, you can maximize your chances of success in your university applications and your academic career. Good luck!
