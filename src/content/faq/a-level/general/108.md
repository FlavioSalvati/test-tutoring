### Process and Considerations for Applying with A-Levels

#### 2. **Check Subject Combinations**
   - Ensure that your A-Level subjects meet the university's requirements. As previously discussed, two A-Levels should be from List A, and the third can be from List A or List B. Ensure that your subjects do not have dependencies.

#### 3. **Numerus Clausus (NC) Programs**

#### 4. **Language Proficiency**

#### 5. **Application Process**
   - Applications are typically submitted directly to the university or through platforms like Uni-Assist for some institutions. It’s important to adhere to the specific deadlines set by each university.

#### 6. **Visa and Financial Considerations**
   - If you are a non-EU student, make sure to apply for a student visa. Additionally, while many public universities in Germany do not charge tuition fees, there might still be a small semester fee, usually between €100 to €150.
