Absolutely, it is possible to pursue engineering without having taken chemistry at A-level. However, the feasibility of this largely depends on the specific engineering field you are interested in, as well as the universities you are considering for your studies. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of how you can navigate this situation.

### Understanding the Role of Chemistry in Engineering

First, it's essential to understand why chemistry is often considered a prerequisite for certain engineering disciplines:

1. **Chemical Engineering:** This field heavily relies on chemistry principles, focusing on the design and operation of chemical plants and the development of new materials. If you aim to study chemical engineering, having A-level chemistry is typically a requirement.
  
2. **Materials Science:** This area examines materials' properties and applications, which often involves chemistry to understand material reactions and properties fully.

3. **Environmental Engineering:** While this field may not require chemistry as strictly as chemical engineering, a solid understanding of chemical principles is beneficial, especially regarding pollution control and waste management.

However, many other engineering disciplines do not require chemistry, or where its absence can be compensated by other subjects. Let’s explore those fields in more detail.

### Engineering Disciplines Where Chemistry is Less Critical

1. **Mechanical Engineering:**  
   - **Typical A-Level Requirements:** Mathematics and Physics are usually the primary requirements. Some universities may accept Further Mathematics as an alternative to Physics.
   - **Chemistry's Role:** While a basic understanding of chemistry can be beneficial—especially in materials science—it is not a core requirement for most mechanical engineering courses. 

2. **Civil Engineering:**  
   - **Typical A-Level Requirements:** The standard requirements usually include Mathematics and Physics. Some programs may accept a third subject like Geography or Design Technology.
   - **Chemistry's Role:** Civil engineering focuses on structures, materials, and environmental concerns. Physics is crucial for understanding forces and mechanics, meaning chemistry is less critical unless you pursue specialized areas that deal with material properties.

3. **Electrical Engineering:**  
   - **Typical A-Level Requirements:** Mathematics and Physics are essential. Some programs might appreciate a background in Computing or Electronics.
   - **Chemistry's Role:** Chemistry plays a minor role in electrical engineering, mainly in areas related to semiconductors and materials. However, it's not a fundamental requirement.

4. **Software Engineering/Computer Engineering:**  
   - **Typical A-Level Requirements:** Mathematics and sometimes Computing are the primary subjects considered.
   - **Chemistry's Role:** For software or computer engineering, chemistry is not relevant at all. The focus is predominantly on mathematics, programming, and systems design.

5. **Geotechnical Engineering:**  
   - **Typical A-Level Requirements:** Mathematics and Physics; sometimes, a third subject may be accepted.
   - **Chemistry's Role:** While an understanding of soil chemistry can be useful, it is not necessary for initial entry into the program.

### University Entry Requirements

As you apply to universities, you’ll find that entry requirements can vary greatly among institutions. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Research University Requirements:**  
   - Look closely at the specific engineering programs of interest. Universities often list detailed entry requirements for their courses, including any mandatory A-level subjects.
   - Some universities might have flexible entry criteria. If you excel in Mathematics and Physics, they may be more lenient with chemistry.

2. **Contextual Offers:**  
   - Some universities offer contextual offers, which may lower the entry requirements based on socio-economic background or the school you attended. This might provide more options if you lack chemistry.

3. **Alternative Qualifications:**  
   - If you have taken vocational qualifications (like BTECs) or other exams that include relevant content, these can sometimes be accepted in lieu of A-level chemistry.
   - Consider qualifications like the International Baccalaureate (IB), where you can choose subjects more flexibly.

### Bridging the Gap

If you find yourself interested in a field that typically requires chemistry, but you haven’t taken it, there are several strategies to bridge the gap:

1. **Foundation Years:**  
   - Some universities offer foundation programs for students lacking certain A-levels. These programs often cover essential content and prepare you for the degree course.
  
2. **Self-Study:**  
   - If time permits, consider studying chemistry independently or through online courses. This can strengthen your understanding and make you a more competitive candidate, even if you don’t take the A-level.

3. **Consider a Different Path:**  
   - If you’re genuinely passionate about engineering but find that chemistry is a barrier, explore engineering fields that focus more on mathematics and physics. 

### Apprenticeships as an Alternative Pathway

If university routes seem daunting without A-level chemistry, consider engineering apprenticeships. These programs offer practical experience and may not have stringent A-level requirements. Here’s what to keep in mind:

1. **Employability:**  
   - Many employers value hands-on experience and may prioritize skills over formal education. A strong background in mathematics and problem-solving can be more beneficial than a chemistry A-level.

2. **On-the-Job Training:**  
   - Apprenticeships provide the opportunity to learn the practical applications of engineering without the need for formal qualifications in chemistry.

3. **Degree Apprenticeships:**  
   - These programs combine working with studying for a degree, which can allow for a more flexible entry into engineering.

### Conclusion

In summary, while A-level chemistry is a requirement for specific engineering fields, it is not universally necessary across all engineering disciplines. Fields such as mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering primarily require mathematics and physics, allowing you to pursue these paths without chemistry.

However, it’s crucial to thoroughly research the specific entry requirements of the universities and programs you are interested in. If chemistry is not your strong suit, consider alternative pathways such as foundation years, apprenticeships, or even self-study options to strengthen your application and knowledge base.

Ultimately, the key to success in engineering lies in your ability to demonstrate strong analytical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and a genuine passion for the field. Focus on excelling in the subjects you enjoy and are passionate about, and keep your options open as you navigate your educational journey.
