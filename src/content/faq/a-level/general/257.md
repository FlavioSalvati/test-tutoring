When discussing A Levels in the UK, it's essential to understand that they are primarily examination-based qualifications. However, the structure of A Levels can vary depending on the subject and the exam board you choose. To provide a comprehensive overview, let’s break down the components of A Levels, including examinations, coursework, and other relevant factors.

### A Levels Overview

A Levels, or Advanced Level qualifications, are subject-based qualifications typically taken by students aged 16 to 18 in the UK. They usually take two years to complete and are a crucial step for students wishing to progress to higher education or pursue specific career paths. 

### Examination Structure

The majority of A Level subjects are assessed primarily through examinations. These exams usually take place at the end of the two-year course and comprise a series of papers that test students on their knowledge and understanding of the subject matter. The exams are designed to assess both theoretical understanding and practical application.

For most subjects, the exams are structured as follows:

- **Final examinations:** These account for a significant portion (often around 70-100%) of the overall grade.
- **Multiple papers:** Many subjects require students to sit multiple papers, which may include different types of assessments (e.g., multiple choice, short answers, essays).

### Coursework Component

While A Levels are predominantly exam-based, some subjects incorporate a coursework or practical component. This aspect can vary significantly between subjects:

1. **Coursework:** 
   - Some A Level subjects, such as English Literature, History, or Psychology, may include coursework as part of the assessment. This coursework usually involves research, essay writing, or project work that is submitted for grading.
   - Coursework typically contributes a smaller percentage to the final grade, often around 20-30%. For example, in subjects like English Literature, students may be required to submit an extended essay or analytical piece of work based on their readings and interpretations.

2. **Practical Assessments:** 
   - Subjects such as Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and certain vocational courses often include practical components where students must demonstrate their skills in a lab setting. 
   - The performance in practical assessments may also contribute to the overall grade, with students required to complete specific experiments or projects that are then assessed.

3. **Non-Exam Assessment (NEA):**
   - Certain subjects, particularly in the arts (like Drama, Art & Design, and Music), may have a significant non-exam assessment component, where students create a portfolio of work, participate in performances, or submit artistic projects. 
   - This NEA can be critical in subjects like Drama where students might need to demonstrate their performance skills or staging techniques.

### Subject Variability

It’s important to note that the extent of coursework and practical assessments can vary widely between different A Level subjects and the exam boards (e.g., AQA, Edexcel, OCR, WJEC). When choosing A Levels, students should carefully review the specifications for each subject to understand the assessment methods, including how much weight is given to exams versus coursework.

### Exam Boards and Specifications

Each exam board provides a specific syllabus or specification for their A Level subjects. This document outlines:

- The structure of the course
- Assessment methods
- Content coverage
- Weighting of exams versus coursework

Students should consult these specifications when making decisions about their subject choices to ensure they are aware of what is expected and how they will be assessed.

### Preparing for A Levels

Considering the assessment structure, students should prepare accordingly:

1. **Balanced Study Plan:**
   - Allocate time for both exam preparation and coursework. For subjects with a coursework component, begin early to allow ample time for research, drafting, and revision.

2. **Understand the Marking Criteria:**
   - Familiarize yourself with how both exams and coursework are marked. Understanding the criteria can help you focus your efforts on what is most important.

3. **Utilize Resources:**
   - Use available resources such as past papers, mark schemes, and example coursework to guide your learning and ensure you meet the required standards.

4. **Seek Support:**
   - Consider engaging with teachers, tutors, or online platforms for additional guidance, especially for subjects with a significant coursework component.

### Conclusion

In summary, while A Levels are predominantly assessments through examinations, there is a significant emphasis on coursework and practical components in certain subjects. This mixed-method approach allows students to demonstrate a broader range of skills and knowledge. When selecting A Levels, it's crucial to consider both the exam and coursework requirements for each subject and how they align with your strengths and interests. Always refer to the specific guidelines provided by your chosen exam board to ensure you are fully prepared for both the examinations and any coursework you may need to complete. 

If you’re considering your A Level options, I recommend making a list of subjects that interest you and reviewing their assessment structures. This will not only help you make informed choices but also set you up for a successful A Level experience. Remember that the right combination of subjects can significantly impact your university applications and career prospects, so choose wisely!
