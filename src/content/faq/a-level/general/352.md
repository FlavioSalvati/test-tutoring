Choosing the right A-level subjects is a critical step for students aiming for competitive university programs, especially at prestigious institutions like Cambridge University. If you're considering taking Maths, Law, and Statistics as your A-level combination, you're on a promising path. Here’s a comprehensive analysis of why these subjects can be an excellent combination for your university application, particularly if you have an interest in fields such as Economics, Human, Social, and Political Sciences (HSPS), or even Law itself.

### Understanding the A-Level Subjects

Before delving deeper into the combination of Maths, Law, and Statistics, let’s briefly review each subject's significance and relevance:

1. **Mathematics**: 
   - Mathematics is a fundamental subject that is highly regarded by universities. It develops logical reasoning, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills. 
   - It serves as a vital foundation for many courses, particularly in the sciences and social sciences. For example, if you're interested in Economics, a strong grasp of Mathematics is essential to understand economic models and quantitative analysis.
   - In Law, while not a direct requirement, mathematical skills can help in understanding statistics related to crime rates, economic factors in legal cases, or even analyzing financial documents in corporate law.

2. **Law**: 
   - Law is not only directly relevant if you want to pursue a degree in Law, but it also provides critical thinking and analytical skills that are beneficial in various fields.
   - A Law A-level will introduce you to key legal concepts, the structure of the legal system, and the importance of case law and statutes, which is invaluable for any future legal studies.
   - Furthermore, understanding legal principles can enhance your perspective when studying social sciences, as many legal issues intersect with societal challenges.

3. **Statistics**: 
   - Statistics is increasingly important across various disciplines. It equips you with the skills to collect, analyze, and interpret data, all of which are vital in today’s data-driven world.
   - In Economics, statistics is crucial for empirical research, allowing you to assess trends and make informed conclusions based on data.
   - For Law, statistics can play a role in understanding demographic trends in crime, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, or analyzing evidence in cases.

### How This Combination Works Together

Taking Maths, Law, and Statistics together allows you to develop a robust skill set that can be advantageous for a variety of courses at university. Here’s how these subjects complement each other:

- **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: 
  - The combination offers a unique interdisciplinary approach. For example, if you're considering a degree in Economics, both Maths and Statistics are directly applicable. The analytical skills you gain from Law can help provide context to economic theories, especially those related to regulations and policies.
  - If you are eyeing a course in HSPS or related fields, understanding the statistical methods can enhance your ability to conduct research and interpret findings effectively. Law's analytical framework will also be beneficial in understanding social policies and their implications.

- **Preparation for University Requirements**: 
  - Universities, especially Cambridge, appreciate students who can demonstrate versatility and a broad understanding of different fields. This combination showcases your ability to think critically across disciplines, which is a valuable trait in higher education.
  - Moreover, this combination aligns well with Cambridge's emphasis on super-curricular activities. Engaging in debates, writing articles, or conducting research that combines these subjects can significantly strengthen your application.

### Complementary Subjects to Consider

While Maths, Law, and Statistics form a solid trio, you may want to consider adding a fourth A-level that complements this combination. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Further Mathematics**: 
   - If you are leaning towards Economics or any quantitative course, Further Maths can deepen your understanding of advanced mathematical concepts, making you more competitive in your applications.

2. **English Literature**: 
   - This subject can enhance your writing and analytical skills, crucial for crafting strong essays in Law and HSPS. It also helps develop your ability to construct coherent arguments, a valued skill in any field.

3. **History**: 
   - Taking History can provide you with a background in socio-political contexts, which is beneficial for both Law and HSPS. Understanding historical precedents can also help in legal studies.

4. **A Foreign Language**: 
   - A language can demonstrate your commitment to understanding different cultures and perspectives, which is essential in Law and social sciences. It also shows your ability to communicate effectively, a key skill in any profession.

### Researching University Courses

As you consider your A-level choices, it’s crucial to research the specific courses you are interested in at Cambridge or any other university. Each course may have different requirements or preferences regarding A-level subjects. 

- For example, if you're interested in **Economics**, check whether they have a preference for Maths and Statistics. 
- If you're considering **Law**, ensure that taking Law A-level matches the entry requirements for the universities you're applying to, as some may look for specific A-levels while others might be more flexible.

### Super-Curricular Activities

Beyond your A-level choices, engaging in super-curricular activities is vital. These activities can include:

- **Participating in Debate Clubs**: This helps develop your argumentation skills and understanding of legal principles.
- **Reading Relevant Literature**: Delve into books and articles related to your subjects. For Law, consider foundational texts or contemporary legal issues. For Economics, read about economic theories and current global economic challenges.
- **Attending Workshops/Seminars**: Look for events related to your subjects, such as law seminars or statistics workshops. This shows initiative and a genuine interest in your field.

### Personal Statement and Interview Preparation

When it comes to applying to Cambridge, your personal statement and interview performance are crucial. Here’s how to prepare:

- **Personal Statement**: 
  - Highlight your passion for Maths, Law, and Statistics. Discuss how these subjects have shaped your academic interests and future career aspirations.
  - Mention any relevant super-curricular activities or projects that demonstrate your commitment and understanding of the subjects.

- **Interviews**: 
  - Be prepared to discuss how these subjects interconnect. You might be asked to solve a problem using your Maths skills or to analyze a legal case critically.
  - Practice articulating your thoughts clearly and confidently. Mock interviews can be a great way to prepare.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, choosing Maths, Law, and Statistics as A-levels can be an excellent strategy for students interested in a variety of university courses, particularly at Cambridge. This combination not only prepares you for specific degrees but also equips you with essential skills that are highly valued in higher education and beyond.

Make sure to research the specific requirements for your targeted courses, consider adding a complementary fourth A-level, and engage in super-curricular activities to strengthen your application. Remember that each student’s journey is unique, so tailor your choices to align with your interests and career goals.

Lastly, don’t hesitate to reach out to university admissions offices for advice and clarification on any uncertainties you may have regarding your A-level choices. Good luck!
