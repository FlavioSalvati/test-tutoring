When discussing the A-Level achievements of members of the British Royal Family, it is important to note that each individual's academic journey is unique and reflects their personal choices and circumstances. In the case of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, their A-Level achievements were quite different from one another and also indicative of their educational backgrounds.

### Prince Harry's A-Level Results

Prince Harry attended Eton College, one of the UK's most prestigious schools, from 1998 to 2003. During his time there, he achieved:

- **2 A-Levels**:
  - **Art**: Grade B
  - **Geography**: Grade D

It is worth noting that Prince Harry did not attend university after completing his A-Levels. Instead, he chose to pursue a career in the British Army, where he served for over a decade. His decision to focus on military service rather than further academic pursuits reflects a different path compared to many of his peers and highlights the diversity of career trajectories available post-A-Levels.

### Meghan Markle's Educational Background

On the other hand, Meghan Markle's academic background is quite distinct. She completed her secondary education at Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles, California, before moving on to higher education. It is important to note that Meghan did not take A-Levels, as the A-Level system is specific to the UK. Instead, she pursued a different educational path:

- **University Education**: Meghan attended Northwestern University, where she graduated in 2003 with a double major in:
  - **Theatre**
  - **International Relations**

While Meghan did not participate in the A-Level system, her university education and diverse interests reflect her commitment to both the arts and global issues, which she has continued to advocate for in her career as an actress and later as a humanitarian and public figure.

### Summary

In summary, Prince Harry achieved 2 A-Levels (B in Art and D in Geography) and did not pursue university education, opting instead for a military career. Meghan Markle, however, did not take A-Levels but graduated from Northwestern University with a double major in Theatre and International Relations. This contrast in their educational experiences highlights the varied paths that individuals can take after secondary education, whether in the realm of academia, military service, or other fields.
