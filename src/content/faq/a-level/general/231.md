When considering the admission requirements for Australian universities, it's important to understand that they often vary significantly between institutions and even between programs within a single university. In general, most Australian universities do have a preference for students who have completed three A Levels, as this is a common standard for entry. However, there are indeed some Australian universities that may accept students with only two A Levels, particularly if these are complemented by other qualifications such as AS Levels, vocational qualifications, or a strong academic background.

### Understanding Australian University Entry Requirements

1. **Standard Entry Requirements**: The majority of Australian universities typically require students to have completed the equivalent of three A Levels. This is especially true for competitive programs like medicine, law, or engineering, where higher scores and a strong overall academic profile are expected.

2. **Alternative Qualifications**: Many Australian universities recognize other qualifications in lieu of full A Levels. For example, students with two A Levels may still be eligible for admission if they have completed additional qualifications, such as:
   - **AS Levels**: Some universities may accept a combination of two A Levels and AS Levels.
   - **Vocational Education and Training (VET)** qualifications: These can also be taken into account, especially for certain courses.
   - **International Baccalaureate (IB)**: If students have completed the IB, they may meet the entry requirements even with fewer A Levels.
   - **Foundation Programs**: Some universities offer foundation courses designed for international students or those who do not meet the standard entry requirements.

3. **Specific University Policies**: Here are a few examples of how different universities approach the acceptance of A Levels:
   - **University of Melbourne**: While they typically require three A Levels, they do have pathways and foundation programs that can provide an alternative route for students who may not meet the standard criteria.
   - **University of Sydney**: Similar to Melbourne, the University of Sydney generally requires three A Levels but may consider applications from students who have two A Levels combined with other qualifications.
   - **University of Queensland**: This institution has more flexible entry requirements and may accept students with two A Levels, especially if they have strong results and additional qualifications.

4. **Consulting University Admissions**: The best approach for students is to directly consult the admission requirements of the specific universities they are interested in. Most universities have detailed information on their websites about entry requirements for various programs, including what qualifications they accept. It is also advisable to reach out directly to the admissions office via email or phone for clarification on specific cases, as they can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### Steps for Students Considering Australian Universities

1. **Research**: Start by researching the universities you are interested in. Look for their entry requirements on their official websites. Pay attention to the specifics for your intended course of study.

2. **Contact Admissions Offices**: If you have specific concerns about your qualifications or if you're unsure whether your combination of A Levels and other qualifications will be accepted, don’t hesitate to contact the admissions offices. They can offer personalized advice and guidance.

3. **Consider Foundation Programs**: If your current qualifications do not meet the entry requirements, consider enrolling in a foundation program. These programs are designed to bridge the gap for students and prepare them for university-level studies.

4. **Prepare Supporting Documents**: When applying, ensure you have all necessary documents ready, including transcripts, certificates, and any other evidence of your qualifications. Highlight your strengths and any relevant experience in your personal statement.

5. **Explore Scholarships**: Many Australian universities offer scholarships for international students, which could help alleviate financial concerns. Check the scholarship options available at the universities you are applying to.

6. **Understand Visa Requirements**: If you are an international student, remember that you will also need to secure a student visa to study in Australia. Familiarize yourself with the requirements and processes involved.

7. **Stay Updated**: Admission policies can change, so make sure you stay updated on any changes that might affect your application. Regularly check the university's website and consider following them on social media for the latest news.

### Conclusion

In summary, while most Australian universities prefer three A Levels for admission, there are exceptions. Some institutions may accept students with two A Levels, especially when combined with other qualifications. It’s crucial to thoroughly research each university's requirements, contact their admissions offices for specific advice, and consider alternative pathways if necessary. With careful planning and a proactive approach, you can navigate the application process more smoothly and increase your chances of securing a place in your desired program. Good luck with your university search!
