The question of whether any university will accept you with a D and E grade in your A-levels is nuanced and depends on several factors. While it's true that most competitive universities have minimum grade requirements that typically exceed a D and E, there are pathways and alternative options available that can still lead you to higher education. Here’s a detailed overview of your situation, the options available, and the steps you can take.

### Understanding Your Grades in Context

1. **A-Level Grading Scale**:
   - A-levels are graded from A* to E, where A* is the highest and E is the lowest passing grade. A D grade is worth 8 UCAS Tariff points, and an E grade is worth 4 points.
   - In many cases, universities set minimum entry requirements that might expect students to have achieved at least a C or higher in specific subjects relevant to the degree course.

2. **UCAS Tariff Points**:
   - The UCAS Tariff converts your A-level grades into points, which universities use to assess your application. For example, a D and an E combined provide only 12 UCAS points, which is significantly below the threshold for most university courses.
   - Many courses require a minimum of 96 UCAS points (equivalent to at least two C grades) for entry, especially in competitive fields like Medicine, Law, or Engineering.

### University Options with D and E Grades

While your grades may limit direct entry into many traditional university programs, some universities and courses may still consider you based on other factors. Here are some alternatives:

1. **Less Competitive Universities**:
   - Some universities may have more flexible entry criteria and could accept students with lower grades, particularly if they have strong personal statements or relevant work experience.
   - Universities that focus more on holistic admissions may consider your entire application, including personal circumstances, motivation, and other achievements.

2. **Foundation Years**:
   - Some universities offer foundation years as part of their degree programs. These are designed for students who do not quite meet the entry requirements for the full degree course but show potential. Completing a foundation year can lead directly into the degree program.

3. **Access to Higher Education Diplomas**:
   - Access courses are specifically designed for mature students or those who do not have the traditional qualifications for university entry. They can provide a pathway to university, and many institutions recognize these qualifications as equivalent to A-levels.

4. **Further Education Colleges**:
   - Many further education colleges offer courses such as BTECs or HNDs, which can be accepted by universities and may provide a more practical route into higher education.

### Strengthening Your Application

If you are determined to pursue university with your current grades, there are ways to strengthen your application beyond grades:

1. **Personal Statement**:
   - Your personal statement is your chance to showcase your passion for the subject, your experiences, and why you want to study at university. Highlight any relevant work experiences, voluntary activities, or skills that demonstrate your suitability for the course.

2. **Work Experience**:
   - Gaining practical experience in a related field can set you apart from other candidates. This could be through internships, volunteer work, or part-time jobs related to your intended area of study.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Strong references from teachers or employers who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and potential can bolster your application significantly.

4. **Interviews**:
   - If invited for an interview, this is an opportunity to articulate your motivations and interests in the subject, as well as to demonstrate your commitment and enthusiasm for studying at that university.

### Exploring Alternative Pathways

If you find that university may be a challenge with your current A-level grades, consider these alternatives:

1. **Gap Year**:
   - Taking a gap year to gain experience in the workforce or to travel can provide time to reflect on your academic path and possibly retake A-levels for better grades.

2. **Retake A-levels**:
   - Many students who are not satisfied with their A-level results opt to retake one or more subjects. This can improve your grades and increase your UCAS points.

3. **Apprenticeships**:
   - Consider entering an apprenticeship program that allows you to earn while you learn. Some higher-level apprenticeships may also lead to university qualifications.

4. **Vocational Courses**:
   - Explore vocational qualifications that may lead to careers in specific fields. These qualifications are often more hands-on and practical, aligning with the needs of various industries.

### Utilizing Clearing

After A-level results are released, the Clearing process allows students who did not meet their university offers or who did not apply to find available spots at universities. Here’s how to approach it:

1. **Research Available Courses**:
   - In Clearing, you can find courses that still have available spaces. Some universities may be more flexible in their requirements during this process.

2. **Contact Universities**:
   - Reach out to universities that interest you and inquire about their Clearing offerings. Be prepared to discuss your situation and demonstrate your enthusiasm for the course.

3. **Be Open-Minded**:
   - You may want to consider courses that are not your first choice but still align with your interests. Sometimes, pursuing a related field can lead to unexpected opportunities.

### Conclusion

In summary, while having a D and E grade in A-levels may present challenges in gaining admission to many universities, it does not eliminate your chances of pursuing higher education. It is essential to explore all available options, including less competitive universities, foundation courses, and alternative pathways like vocational training or further education.

Additionally, focusing on strengthening your application through personal statements, work experience, and references can significantly enhance your chances. If you remain proactive, open-minded, and committed to your educational goals, there are still many pathways to achieving your aspirations. Remember, education is a journey, and every step you take can lead you closer to your goals.
