If you have completed your A-levels, you would be considered an **undergraduate** if you are applying to or currently enrolled in a university to pursue your first degree, which is typically a Bachelor's degree. The term "undergraduate" specifically refers to students who are working towards their initial degree after completing their secondary education, which in the UK context usually includes A-levels.

To clarify further, let’s break down the definitions and the pathways involved:

### Understanding "Undergraduate" vs. "Graduate"

1. **Undergraduate**:
   - Refers to students who are pursuing their first degree, usually a Bachelor's degree (e.g., BA or BSc).
   - Typically, students start their undergraduate studies immediately after completing their A-levels, though some may take a gap year or choose alternative qualifications such as BTECs or the International Baccalaureate.
   - Undergraduate programs generally last three years in the UK, though there are accelerated options and degrees with foundation years.

2. **Graduate**:
   - In a broader sense, the term “graduate” can refer to anyone who has completed any level of education, including secondary school, A-levels, or university degrees.
   - However, in the context of higher education, "graduate" most commonly refers to students who have completed their undergraduate degree and are now pursuing further studies, such as a Master's degree or a PhD.
   - Graduate programs are for those who have already obtained their first degree and wish to advance their education further.

### Your Path After A-Levels

After completing your A-levels, your immediate next step would typically be to apply for undergraduate programs. Here’s a guide on how to navigate that process:

1. **Choosing a Course and University**:
   - Consider your interests, strengths, and career aspirations when selecting a course. Research various subjects and universities to find the best fit for you.
   - Look into the specific requirements for each course, including A-level subjects needed, grades required, and any additional assessments (like personal statements, interviews, or entrance exams).

2. **UCAS Applications**:
   - In the UK, applications for undergraduate courses are primarily made through UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service). 
   - You can apply to up to five courses at once. Make sure to tailor your personal statement to reflect your interest in each course and demonstrate your passion and suitability.

3. **Funding and Tuition Fees**:
   - Be aware of the tuition fees associated with undergraduate study, which can be up to £9,250 per year for UK students in England. International students can expect to pay higher fees.
   - Explore student finance options, including loans and grants, to help cover tuition and living expenses.

4. **Consider Your Options**:
   - If you’re unsure about jumping straight into a degree, explore foundation years or vocational courses that may lead to undergraduate degrees.
   - Alternatively, you might consider taking a gap year for work experience, travel, or further study before applying to university.

5. **Postgraduate Studies**:
   - Once you complete your undergraduate degree, you can then consider furthering your education through graduate programs (Master’s or PhD). This step will depend on your career goals and the field you wish to enter.

### Conclusion

In summary, if you have completed your A-levels, you are classified as an **undergraduate** when you begin your studies toward your first degree at a university. After completing this degree, you may then become a **graduate** if you choose to pursue further studies. Understanding these distinctions is essential as you navigate your educational journey and make informed decisions about your future.

Remember, whether you are an undergraduate or considering graduate studies later, it’s important to engage actively with your education, seek guidance, and take advantage of resources available to you, such as career services, mentorship programs, and academic advising. Each step you take is an investment in your future, and being well-informed will help you maximize your opportunities. Good luck with your studies and future applications!
