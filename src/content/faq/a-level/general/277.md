Yes, Cambridge University does offer scholarships for international undergraduate students after they have completed their A-levels, but it is important to understand the structure and process of these scholarships. Here is a comprehensive overview to guide you through the scholarship landscape for international students at Cambridge.

### Understanding Cambridge Scholarships for International Undergraduates

Cambridge University provides a limited number of scholarships aimed at international undergraduates, which are primarily offered after admission to one of the Cambridge Colleges. Most of these scholarships are partial and means-tested, meaning that they take your financial situation into account before awarding funds.

#### Types of Scholarships Available

1. **Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust Awards:**
   - These awards are designed to provide financial assistance to international students. 
   - They are primarily part-cost scholarships, which means they help cover a portion of your tuition fees or living costs.
   - To apply, you must first receive an offer of admission from a Cambridge College and subsequently submit an application through the Cambridge Trust.

2. **College Awards:**
   - Some Colleges at Cambridge offer their own financial support for overseas students. 
   - This support can vary significantly from one College to another, so it's essential to check with individual College admissions offices for specific information regarding their available awards and eligibility criteria.

3. **International Disabled Students' Fund (IDS Fund):**
   - This fund is specifically for international students who have disabilities and need academic-related support. 
   - The fund is administered by the Disability Resource Centre, and you must be classified as an international student for fees purposes to be eligible.

4. **Prince Philip Scholarship:**
   - This scholarship targets permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region who are applying for their first undergraduate degree.
   - It offers cash awards and means-tested support for tuition and living expenses. 
   - Applications for this scholarship must be submitted alongside your Cambridge application.

### Application Process and Deadlines

- **Application Deadline:** Each scholarship has its own specific application requirements and deadlines. 
- **Means Testing:** All scholarship applications will involve a means-testing process, which assesses your financial situation. Make sure to prepare any necessary documentation to support your application.

### General Entry Requirements for International Students

To qualify for admission (and, by extension, for scholarships), you must meet Cambridgeâ€™s entry requirements. The qualifications accepted vary by course but generally include:

1. **International A Levels:** Comparable to UK A Levels, offered by Cambridge International, Oxford AQA, or Pearson Edexcel.
2. **International Baccalaureate (IB):** A typical minimum offer level is between 41 and 42 points out of 45, with high scores in Higher Level subjects.
3. **European Baccalaureate:** Offers are usually based on Higher Level subjects.
4. **Leaving Certificate (Ireland):** Requirements correspond to A-level offers, with specific grades needed in relevant subjects.
5. **Advanced Placement (AP) Tests:** Requires a minimum of five AP scores, all at 5.
6. **SATs and ACTs:** Accepted primarily for applicants from the United States.

### Additional Requirements

- **English Language Proficiency:** If English is not your first language, you'll need to demonstrate proficiency through recognized tests like IELTS.
- **Admissions Assessments:** Some courses require specific admissions assessments, such as the BMAT for Medicine or the TSA for Economics.
- **Interviews:** Shortlisted candidates may also be invited for interviews as part of the admissions process.

### Important Points to Keep in Mind

1. **Subject Requirements:** Each course has specific subject requirements that you must meet.
2. **College Variations:** Remember that entry requirements and scholarship availability can vary between different Colleges at Cambridge.
3. **Communication:** If you have any questions regarding qualifications, entry requirements, or scholarships, it is advisable to contact the College you are considering applying to directly. They can provide tailored advice and information.

### Conclusion

In summary, while Cambridge University does not generally offer full scholarships for international undergraduates after A-levels, it does provide various partial financial support options and scholarships that can significantly help with tuition and living costs.
