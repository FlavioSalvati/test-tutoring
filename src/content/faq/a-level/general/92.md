When considering the A-levels you need for an Economics degree, particularly if you're aiming for a prestigious university such as Oxford or Cambridge, there are several key factors to keep in mind. Your choice of A-level subjects can significantly influence your application, so it’s essential to choose wisely. Below, I will explore the recommended A-levels, their importance, and additional considerations that can enhance your application.

### Key A-Levels for Economics Degrees

1. **Mathematics (A or A*)**:
   - **Importance**: Mathematics is the cornerstone of Economics. It provides the analytical skills necessary to understand economic models and data. While not every university mandates it, top institutions like Oxford and Cambridge do require or highly recommend it.
   - **University Requirements**:
     - **Cambridge**: A-level Mathematics is a strict requirement for all applicants. In many cases, an A* is expected or even a condition of your offer. Some colleges, such as Murray Edwards, may also require an A* in Further Mathematics or Economics if you've chosen to study that.
     - **Oxford**: For courses like Economics and Management, the typical offer is A*AA, with Mathematics needing to be at least an A grade.

2. **Further Mathematics**:
   - **Importance**: If you have a strong aptitude for Mathematics, taking Further Mathematics can set you apart from other candidates. It delves deeper into mathematical concepts that are applicable in Economics, particularly in statistics and calculus.
   - **University Requirements**:
     - **Cambridge**: Highly recommended. Successful applicants often have A-level Further Mathematics.
     - **Oxford**: Not formally required, but it’s beneficial. While it may not directly boost your application, it reflects strong mathematical ability.

3. **Economics**:
   - **Importance**: If available, studying Economics at A-level can provide you with foundational knowledge of the subject, making you more prepared for university-level studies. It can also highlight your interest in the field.
   - **University Requirements**:
     - **Cambridge**: Useful but not essential. If your school does not offer it, subjects like Geography or Business Studies may be considered acceptable alternatives.
     - **Oxford**: Preferred but not mandatory. It can demonstrate a commitment to studying Economics.

4. **Statistics**:
   - **Importance**: A-Level Statistics is valuable as it equips you with the skills needed for data analysis, which is increasingly important in Economics.
   - **University Requirements**: While not a direct requirement, having a background in statistics can bolster your application and improve your quantitative skills.

### Other Relevant A-Levels

While the above subjects are the most critical, other A-levels can also strengthen your application by showcasing relevant skills and knowledge:

1. **History**:
   - Demonstrates strong analytical and writing skills, which are essential for essay-based assessments in Economics. It also indicates your ability to understand and interpret complex information and historical contexts.

2. **Geography**:
   - Offers insight into socio-economic factors affecting different regions and highlights your understanding of environmental impacts on economic systems.

3. **Politics**:
   - Understanding political frameworks and policies can enhance your grasp of how economic systems operate within political contexts, adding depth to your studies.

### Beyond A-Levels: Additional Considerations

Choosing your A-levels is just one part of the application puzzle. Other factors can significantly enhance your profile:

1. **Work Experience**:
   - Relevant work experience in finance, consulting, or related fields can provide practical insights into economic principles. Such experiences can also enrich your personal statement and interview discussions, demonstrating your commitment to the subject.

2. **Extracurricular Activities**:
   - Engaging in economics clubs, participating in competitions (like the UK Economics Challenge), or volunteering in roles that require analytical thinking can demonstrate your genuine interest in Economics. This involvement can make your application stand out.

3. **Personal Statement**:
   - Craft a compelling personal statement that reflects your passion for Economics, your understanding of its relevance, and how your chosen A-levels have prepared you for university-level study. Mention any relevant experiences or projects.

4. **Admissions Tests**:
   - Be aware that some universities require additional admissions tests, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA) for Oxford or the Test of Mathematics for University Admissions (TMUA). Preparing for these tests can further strengthen your application.

### Understanding University Entry Requirements

1. **UCAS Points**:
   - Most undergraduate Economics courses require between 96 and 160 UCAS points. Each A-level grade contributes to your UCAS point total, so it’s essential to aim for high grades in your chosen subjects.

2. **University-Specific Requirements**:
   - Different universities may have specific entry requirements and preferences. It's crucial to thoroughly research the courses you are interested in by visiting individual university websites. Look for:
     - Preferred A-level combinations
     - Any additional admissions tests
     - Specific grade requirements for each subject

### Choosing Your A-Levels: A Final Note

As you select your A-levels, consider the following actionable steps:

1. **Consultation**: Speak with your teachers and career advisors to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each subject and how they align with your interests.
2. **Self-Assessment**: Reflect on your own academic strengths. If you excel in Mathematics, taking Further Mathematics might be beneficial. If writing and analysis are your strengths, consider History or Politics.
3. **Research**: Keep up-to-date with the latest entry requirements for the universities you are interested in. Requirements may change, so ensure you have the most current information.
4. **Flexibility**: Be open to adjusting your choices based on the subjects offered at your school and your own academic performance. It’s better to excel in subjects you enjoy than to struggle in those you find challenging.

In conclusion, selecting the right A-levels for an Economics degree is a multifaceted decision that should reflect your academic strengths, interests, and the specific requirements of your target universities. By focusing on Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Economics, and complementing these with relevant subjects, you can create a strong application profile that enhances your chances of securing a place at a top university. Good luck!
