When preparing your Curriculum Vitae (CV), attention to detail—including punctuation—can reflect your professionalism and attention to quality. In the case of 'A Levels' or 'A-Levels', the common practice is to use the term **'A Levels'** without the hyphen. This is generally accepted in formal documentation and aligns with the conventions used by most employers and academic institutions.

### 1. Standard Formatting

The British education system refers to advanced level qualifications as 'A Levels'. This term is widely recognized and used in official contexts, such as university applications and job applications. Most style guides and educational resources, including UCAS (the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) and other academic institutions, adopt the format 'A Levels'. 

Using 'A Levels' without a hyphen is not just a matter of preference; it is the standard form that ensures clarity and uniformity in your CV. Consistency in terminology throughout your CV helps convey your attention to detail, which is a quality many employers value.

### 2. Contextual Considerations

While 'A Levels' is the preferred format, it’s important to consider the context in which you are writing your CV. Different industries might have specific style guides or preferences. For example, if you are applying for a position in academia or a very formal organization, it may be beneficial to check if they have a particular style guide. However, in the absence of specific guidelines, sticking to 'A Levels' is advisable.

Furthermore, if you are using a particular CV template, it is essential to maintain consistency with the format used in that template. If the template uses 'A-Levels', it may be wise to follow that style for the sake of uniformity, although it is not the common usage.

### 3. Consistency

Consistency is crucial in a CV, not just for the term 'A Levels' but for all sections. If you choose to use 'A Levels', ensure that you also present other qualifications in a similar format. For instance, if you use 'GCSEs' for General Certificate of Secondary Education, maintain that structure throughout your CV. This attention to detail creates a polished and professional appearance.

In addition to the formatting of qualifications, it's important to be consistent with your verb tenses, bullet points, and layout. This consistency reinforces your professionalism and makes it easier for employers to read and understand your CV.

### 4. Emphasis on Content

While the formatting of 'A Levels' is important, the content of your CV is far more critical. Employers are primarily interested in your qualifications, skills, and experiences. When detailing your A Levels, include relevant subjects, grades, and any associated achievements. For example, you might write:

**Education:**

- **A Levels:** Mathematics (A), Physics (B), Chemistry (B) – XYZ College, 2023

This not only highlights your qualifications but also demonstrates your academic performance in a clear and concise manner. Remember, your CV is your marketing tool; it should effectively showcase your strongest achievements, skills, and experiences relevant to the role you are applying for.

### 5. Highlighting Achievements

In addition to listing your A Levels, consider including any notable achievements associated with these qualifications. For example, if you received an award for outstanding performance in a particular subject, that should be included. This can help differentiate you from other candidates and provide employers with a clearer picture of your capabilities.

### 6. Other Considerations for Your CV

Besides the A Levels section, ensure that your CV includes other essential components:

- **Personal Statement:** A brief summary highlighting your career goals and what you can offer to potential employers.
- **Work Experience:** Include part-time jobs, internships, or volunteer work that showcases your skills and work ethic.
- **Extracurricular Activities:** Mention clubs or societies you are part of, especially if you held leadership positions.
- **Skills Section:** Highlight both technical and soft skills that are relevant to the job you are applying for.

### 7. Final Thoughts

In conclusion, when writing your CV, use **'A Levels'** without a hyphen, and ensure that you maintain consistency throughout your document. While the format is important, remember that content matters even more. Focus on creating a CV that effectively highlights your qualifications, experiences, and skills in a clear and professional manner. This approach will not only help you present yourself favorably to potential employers but also increase your chances of securing the positions you desire.

Good luck with your CV writing, and remember, the clarity and professionalism of your presentation will make a significant impact on your job search!
