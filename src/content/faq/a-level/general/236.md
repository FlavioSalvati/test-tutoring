When considering an application to Oxbridge, one of the most common questions students ask is whether the universities focus on only three A-levels even if a candidate chooses to take four. The short answer is yes, typically, Oxbridge will look primarily at the three A-levels that are most relevant to the course for which you are applying. However, there are nuances to this that can affect how your application is viewed.

### Understanding Oxbridge's Approach to A-Levels

1. **Primary Focus on Three A-Levels**:
   - Both Oxford and Cambridge generally base their offers on three A-levels. This means that while you may choose to take four A-level subjects, admissions tutors will assess your performance, predictions, and achievements primarily on the three A-levels that best align with the requirements of your chosen course.
   - It is essential to be aware that the three A-levels you select should be relevant to your intended area of study. For instance, if you are applying for a STEM course, having A-levels in subjects like Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry will be more beneficial than having unrelated subjects.

2. **The Role of the Fourth A-Level**:
   - Taking a fourth A-level can demonstrate your commitment, ambition, and ability to handle a challenging workload. However, it does not necessarily enhance your application as much as excelling in three core subjects would.
   - In particular, applicants for STEM subjects often take Further Mathematics as their fourth A-level. This is viewed positively and can provide a solid foundation for advanced study. Nevertheless, admissions tutors will focus on your performance in the three A-levels that are most relevant to your course.

3. **Evidence of Strength in Academic Performance**:
   - If you choose to take four A-levels, admissions tutors will expect to see strong grades across all subjects. A lower grade in one of your A-levels could raise questions about your academic focus or ability to manage your studies effectively.
   - While Oxbridge appreciates well-rounded candidates, the emphasis remains on achieving high academic standards in the subjects that matter most for your application.

4. **Combining Qualifications**:
   - If you are applying with a combination of A-levels and other qualifications (like the International Baccalaureate or Advanced Placement courses), Oxbridge will assess your entire academic profile. They look for a strong overall performance, but again, the focus will be on the core subjects that meet the specific requirements of your chosen course.

5. **The Importance of Subject Selection**:
   - When deciding which A-levels to take, it is crucial to select subjects that align with your future academic path. Each course at Oxbridge has specific subject requirements, and fulfilling these is essential.
   - Make sure to check the specific entry requirements for your desired course on the university’s website. This will give you clarity on which subjects are essential for your application.

### Recommendations for A-Level Choices

1. **Prioritize Relevant Subjects**:
   - Opt for three A-levels that directly correlate with your intended field of study. For example, if you are interested in studying History, you might choose History, English Literature, and a complementary subject like Politics.

2. **Consider Your Strengths**:
   - Choose subjects in which you excel or have a strong interest. A genuine passion for the subject can lead to better grades and a more enjoyable learning experience.

3. **Consult with Advisors**:
   - Speak with teachers or academic advisors to gather insights on the subjects you are considering. Their experience can provide you with a better understanding of the workload and expectations associated with each subject.

4. **Be Realistic About Your Workload**:
   - Taking on four A-levels can be demanding. Ensure you are prepared for the additional workload and that it won’t compromise your performance in your three main subjects.

5. **Reflect on Your Future Goals**:
   - Think about your long-term academic and career goals. If you are aiming for a specific course at Oxbridge, ensure that your A-level choices reflect that ambition clearly.

### Conclusion

In summary, while Oxbridge will consider your entire academic profile, including any fourth A-level you choose to take, the emphasis will be on your three strongest A-levels that are relevant to your course. Success in these subjects is what will ultimately define the strength of your application. Therefore, focus on excelling in those three subjects, and use any additional qualifications to further demonstrate your skills and commitment to your field of study. 

Remember, admissions at Oxbridge are highly competitive, and demonstrating a clear academic trajectory and passion for your chosen field through your A-level choices is critical. By aligning your subjects with your future ambitions and excelling academically, you will enhance your prospects of receiving an offer from these prestigious institutions. Always refer to the official university websites for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding course requirements and admissions policies. Good luck with your studies and your application!
