When considering the A-Level subjects required for pursuing an engineering degree at university, it’s essential to understand the varying requirements based on the specific engineering discipline you wish to study. The question of whether you need to take Chemistry at A-Level largely depends on the type of engineering you are interested in, as well as the specific requirements of the universities you are targeting. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you navigate this decision.

### Core A-Level Requirements for Engineering

1. **Mathematics: A Must-Have**
   - Mathematics is universally recognized as a fundamental requirement for almost all engineering courses. It provides the analytical skills and problem-solving techniques necessary for tackling engineering challenges. Most universities expect you to achieve a high grade (often A* or A) in A-Level Mathematics.

2. **Physics: The Preferred Companion**
   - Alongside Mathematics, Physics is typically the second required A-Level for most engineering courses. Physics equips you with crucial concepts in mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism, which are foundational to engineering principles. While some universities may accept alternative science subjects, having A-Level Physics significantly enhances your application.

### The Role of Chemistry in Engineering

1. **Chemical Engineering: A Requirement**
   - If you are specifically aiming to pursue Chemical Engineering, taking Chemistry at A-Level is not just beneficial—it's mandatory. Chemistry serves as the backbone for this field, providing essential knowledge about chemical processes, material properties, and reactions.

2. **Other Engineering Disciplines: Varying Importance**
   - For other branches of engineering, the necessity of Chemistry can vary:
     - **Materials Engineering:** Understanding the chemical composition and properties of materials is important, making Chemistry a valuable A-Level.
     - **Environmental Engineering:** Knowledge of chemical pollutants and their environmental impacts can be crucial, thus Chemistry can be advantageous.
     - **Biomedical Engineering:** This field often involves studying biological systems, where an understanding of chemistry is beneficial.

3. **When Chemistry is Not Required**
   - For many traditional engineering disciplines such as Mechanical, Civil, and Electrical Engineering, Chemistry is not a strict requirement. Instead, strong performance in Mathematics and Physics is generally sufficient. However, having Chemistry as a third A-Level can enhance your understanding and may make your application more competitive, especially if you are considering interdisciplinary fields or specific universities that appreciate a broader scientific background.

### Additional A-Level Considerations

1. **Further Mathematics: Highly Recommended**
   - If you have a strong aptitude for mathematics, consider taking Further Mathematics. This A-Level deepens your understanding of advanced mathematical concepts, which can be particularly useful in fields like Electrical, Aerospace, and Mechanical Engineering.

2. **Computing: Increasingly Relevant**
   - With the rise of technology in engineering, A-Level Computing is becoming more important. This subject covers programming and computational thinking, skills that are invaluable in modern engineering.

3. **Design Technology: Practical Skills**
   - A-Level Design Technology can provide practical problem-solving skills and an understanding of design principles, which can be advantageous in various engineering fields.

4. **Vocational Qualifications: Alternative Pathways**
   - Some universities are open to accepting vocational qualifications like BTECs alongside A-Level Mathematics. However, make sure you check the specific entry requirements for each university, as they can differ significantly.

### University-Specific Requirements

1. **Highly Competitive Institutions**
   - **Cambridge University:** Generally requires A*A*A with A* in Mathematics and Physics. A third A-Level is preferred in a relevant subject, which could include Chemistry if applicable to your chosen course.
   - **Oxford University:** Also requires A*A*A, with A* in Mathematics and either Further Mathematics or Physics. All applicants must take the Physics Aptitude Test (PAT), which emphasizes the need for strong Physics knowledge.
   - **Other Universities:** Requirements can vary widely. Some may specify certain science subjects, while others may be more flexible. Always check the specific requirements on university websites.

### General Advice for A-Level Choices

1. **Start Early**
   - Begin considering your A-Level choices as early as possible. This allows you to make informed decisions based on your interests and the requirements of the engineering courses you wish to pursue.

2. **Research Thoroughly**
   - Investigate the specific requirements of the universities you are interested in, as well as the different engineering disciplines. Note that some universities may have unique prerequisites that could influence your A-Level choices.

3. **Seek Guidance**
   - Don’t hesitate to consult with your school advisors or reach out to university admissions offices. They can provide valuable insights and help clarify any doubts regarding subject requirements.

4. **Build a Strong Foundation**
   - Excelling in Mathematics and Physics is crucial, particularly if you aim for competitive engineering programs. A strong foundation in these subjects will significantly increase your chances of securing a place at your desired university.

5. **Consider the Future**
   - Reflect on your long-term career goals and interests. If you have a particular engineering field in mind, try to align your A-Level choices with the skills and knowledge that will be most beneficial in that area.

### In Summary

To answer your question: **Do you have to take Chemistry in A-Levels to do engineering at university?** 

- If you are pursuing **Chemical Engineering**, then yes, Chemistry is a requirement. 
- For most other engineering fields, Chemistry is not strictly required, but it can be beneficial as a third A-Level, depending on the specific discipline and university. 

The most critical A-Level subjects for engineering are Mathematics and Physics. A strong performance in these areas, along with a strategically chosen third A-Level, will position you well for university applications. Remember to conduct thorough research and seek advice tailored to your specific interests and goals in engineering.
