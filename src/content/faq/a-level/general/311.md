When dealing with A Level or IGCSE remark requests, understanding the timelines for these processes is crucial, especially if you are relying on your results for university admissions. Here's a comprehensive overview of how long a remark may take, along with some tips on how to navigate this situation effectively.

### Understanding the Remark Process

When you request a remark (officially known as a "review of marking"), the exam board undertakes a series of steps to ensure that your exam paper was marked accurately and fairly. The process typically involves:

1. **Clerical Check**: Initially, the exam board verifies that all sections of your paper were marked, that the marks were correctly totaled, and that the grade boundaries were applied correctly.

2. **Senior Examiner Review**: A senior examiner reviews the initial marking to determine whether the original grade was fair and consistent.

### Timeframes for Remarks

The timeframe for receiving the outcome of a remark can vary based on a few factors, including whether you request a priority review or a standard review. Let’s break down the expected timelines:

#### 1. **Priority Review of Marking**
- **Timeframe**: Generally takes **up to 15 days** from the date the request is submitted.
- **Eligibility**: This service is recommended if you have a university place dependent on the outcome of your grade. It accelerates the process to ensure decisions are made quickly, allowing you to secure your university placement if your grade changes.

#### 2. **Normal Review of Marking**
- **Timeframe**: Typically takes **up to 20 days**.
- **Use Case**: If you are not under immediate pressure for university admission or if your concern is less urgent, you can opt for a normal review, which is less expensive but takes longer to process.

### Key Deadlines

It’s essential to be aware of the deadlines for submitting requests for both priority and normal reviews:

- **For Priority Reviews**: The request must be made within a specified timeframe after results day (e.g., by **22 August** for exams taken in the summer).
- **For Normal Reviews**: The deadline is typically later (e.g., around **26 September**).

These deadlines are crucial, especially if you're waiting on a university decision, as missing them could mean having to wait until the next examination cycle to address any grading issues.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Fees**: Expect to pay a fee for the review service, which can range from £40 to £75 depending on the exam board and whether it is a priority review. If your grade changes after the review, the fee is usually waived.

2. **Potential Outcomes**: Be aware that your grade could go up, down, or remain the same. There is no guarantee that a review will yield a better grade, so weigh your options carefully before proceeding.

3. **Access to Scripts**: You can also request to see your marked exam paper (often referred to as an "Access to Scripts" request). This can help you determine whether to proceed with a full review. However, requesting this can take additional time, so if you’re under a deadline for university admission, it may be more prudent to go straight for the priority review.

4. **Communicate with Your School**: Since the request for a review must be made through your school or college’s exams officer, ensure you communicate with them promptly to avoid any delays.

5. **Seek Advice**: If you’re uncertain about whether to request a review, consider discussing it with your teachers or a career adviser. They can provide insights based on your performance and potential next steps.

### Conclusion

In summary, the duration for receiving the outcome of a remark for A Levels or IGCSEs typically takes up to 15 days for priority reviews and up to 20 days for normal reviews. Understanding these timelines and being aware of deadlines can greatly assist you in making informed decisions regarding your exam results and university applications. Always communicate with your school’s exam officer to initiate the process and seek professional advice if you feel uncertain about your next steps. Good luck!
