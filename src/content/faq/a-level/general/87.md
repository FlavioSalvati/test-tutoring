Yes, universities, including prestigious institutions like the University of Cambridge, do look at A-levels and IGCSE results as part of the admissions process. These qualifications serve as key indicators of a student's academic performance and preparedness for university-level study. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how A-levels and IGCSEs factor into university admissions, particularly at Cambridge, but applicable to many universities in the UK and abroad.

### Understanding the Importance of A-levels

**1. Primary Qualifications for Admission:**
   - A-levels (Advanced Level qualifications) are the most commonly accepted qualifications for university admissions in the UK. For most courses at Cambridge, offers are based on three A-level subjects taken together in Year 13. 
   - A strong performance in A-levels is crucial as it demonstrates a student’s capability to handle the academic rigors of higher education.

**2. Subject Relevance:**
   - Universities typically require specific A-level subjects depending on the course applied for. For instance, if you are applying for a STEM course (like Engineering or Physics), having A-levels in Mathematics and Physics is often essential.
   - It is advisable to check the specific subject requirements for your desired course on the university's official website.

**3. Additional A-levels:**
   - While the standard offer is usually based on three A-levels, taking a fourth A-level, particularly Further Mathematics, can be advantageous for students applying to STEM courses. However, it is important to note that taking four A-levels does not generally provide a significant advantage in the admissions process.

### Role of IGCSEs in Admissions

**1. Foundational Qualifications:**
   - The International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) is often viewed as a foundational qualification, similar to GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education). Both are respected by universities, although IGCSEs are commonly taken by international students.
   - While IGCSE results are not the primary focus for admissions, they are used to assess a student’s academic background and readiness for A-levels or equivalent qualifications.

**2. Contextual Considerations:**
   - Universities, including Cambridge, evaluate IGCSE results in the context of the applicant's school or college. This means that the university considers the overall academic environment and the performance of students from that institution when reviewing IGCSE grades.
   - Strong IGCSE results can indicate a solid work ethic and foundational knowledge, which is beneficial for any applicant.

### Additional Factors Considered in Admissions

**1. Super-Curricular Activities:**
   - Beyond academic qualifications, universities look for evidence of engagement in super-curricular activities. This includes involvement in related projects, research, or relevant experiences that extend beyond standard coursework.
   - Participation in activities like science fairs, mathematics competitions, or research projects can enhance an application significantly.

**2. Extenuating Circumstances:**
   - If there are any valid reasons affecting your performance in IGCSEs or A-levels (such as illness or personal difficulties), it’s important to communicate these through your UCAS reference or an Extenuating Circumstances Form. Teachers can provide context for any challenges you faced.

**3. English Language Proficiency:**
   - For international students, demonstrating proficiency in English is essential. Universities typically require standardized English language tests (like IELTS or TOEFL) unless the student has completed their education in English.

### Key Takeaway: The Holistic Approach

Universities often adopt a holistic approach to admissions, taking into account not just A-level and IGCSE results, but also personal statements, references, and interviews (where applicable). 

- **Personal Statements:** This is your opportunity to articulate your passion for the subject, your experiences, and your aspirations. Strong personal statements that effectively complement your academic qualifications can make a significant impact on your application.

- **References:** A reference from a teacher can provide insight into your academic abilities and character. They can also discuss your personal qualities and any challenges you've overcome.

- **Interviews:** Some universities, notably Cambridge, may require applicants to attend interviews. These interviews assess your thinking, problem-solving abilities, and passion for the subject.

### Conclusion

In summary, universities like Cambridge place significant weight on A-level and IGCSE results as part of their admissions criteria. While A-levels are the primary focus, IGCSE results help form a complete picture of an applicant’s academic history. 

To strengthen your application:
- Aim for strong A-level results, particularly in subjects relevant to your chosen course.
- Maintain a solid academic record at the IGCSE level.
- Engage in super-curricular activities to demonstrate your enthusiasm and commitment.
- Communicate any extenuating circumstances effectively.

It's essential to thoroughly research the specific requirements for the course and college you’re interested in. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to the university or the specific college for guidance. Good luck with your application!
