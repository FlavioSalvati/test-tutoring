The last time GCSEs and A-levels were cancelled was during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in the years 2020 and 2021. This unprecedented decision was made in response to the widespread disruption caused by the pandemic, which led to school closures and significant challenges in delivering a consistent educational experience.

### Timeline of Cancellation

1. **2020**: 
   - In March 2020, the UK government announced that all exams, including GCSEs and A-levels, would be cancelled for that academic year. This decision was taken in light of the escalating health crisis and was aimed at protecting the health and safety of students and staff.
   - Initially, students were to receive their grades through an algorithm that moderated teacher assessments. However, this method faced significant backlash due to perceived unfairness, particularly affecting students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Following widespread criticism, the government reversed this decision, allowing students to receive the higher of either their teacher-assessed grades or the moderated grades.

2. **2021**:
   - Exams were again cancelled in 2021. As a result, students were once more assessed through teacher-assessed grades (TAGs). This approach aimed to provide a more equitable assessment method, given the disruptions faced by students during their studies.
   - The reliance on TAGs resulted in significant grade inflation, with a higher proportion of students receiving top grades compared to previous years. This highlighted ongoing inequalities in the education system, particularly favoring students from private and selective schools.

### Implications of the Cancellations

The cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels had far-reaching implications for students, schools, and universities:

- **Impact on Students**: Students faced uncertainty regarding their futures, particularly regarding university admissions. The reliance on TAGs and the subsequent grade inflation raised questions about the fairness of university admissions processes and the preparedness of students for higher education.

- **University Admissions**: Universities had to adapt quickly to the new grading landscape, accepting students based on the TAGs while also considering the context of the pandemic. This meant that admissions criteria and expectations were reevaluated to accommodate the unique circumstances faced by applicants.

- **Long-Term Effects**: The disruptions caused by the pandemic have led to ongoing discussions about the fairness and integrity of assessment methods in the education system. There is a heightened awareness of the need for fair and equitable assessment practices, particularly in light of the socio-economic inequalities that were exacerbated during the pandemic.

### Looking Forward

As we move beyond the immediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial for educational authorities, universities, and policymakers to reflect on the lessons learned from the cancellation of exams. This includes considering how to create a more resilient education system that can withstand future disruptions, ensuring that all students have access to fair and equitable assessment methods.

In summary, the last time GCSEs and A-levels were cancelled was in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The repercussions of these cancellations continue to shape discussions around educational assessment and university admissions in the UK.
