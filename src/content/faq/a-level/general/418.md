As an experienced University Admission Mentor, I appreciate your inquiry about the A-Level requirements for physiotherapy courses, particularly regarding the necessity of Chemistry. Your question is crucial for students planning their academic paths and wanting to pursue a career in physiotherapy.

### Understanding A-Level Requirements for Physiotherapy

Physiotherapy programs have specific prerequisites that aspiring students must meet to be considered for admission. While the exact requirements can vary between universities, there are general trends that can guide your decision-making process.

#### Essential A-Level Subjects

1. **Biology:** 
   - Biology is universally recognized as an essential A-Level subject for physiotherapy. It provides foundational knowledge about human anatomy, physiology, and various biological processes that are critical when diagnosing and treating patients.

2. **Physics:** 
   - Physics is also highly beneficial, as it helps students understand the mechanics and biomechanics involved in human movement and rehabilitation. It covers principles that apply to therapeutic techniques and equipment used in physiotherapy.

3. **Psychology:**
   - Psychology is increasingly important in physiotherapy, as it addresses the mental and emotional aspects of rehabilitation, thus fostering effective communication and empathy.

#### The Role of Chemistry

Now, let’s focus on your primary question: **Does a physiotherapy course require Chemistry in A-Levels?**

1. **Not Universally Required:**
   - Chemistry is not universally required for physiotherapy programs. Many universities accept students without A-Level Chemistry, especially if they have strong grades in Biology and another relevant subject (like Psychology or Physics). 

2. **University-Specific Requirements:**
   - Some universities may explicitly list Chemistry as a preferred or optional subject, while others may have a more flexible approach. For example:
     - **Robert Gordon University**: Requires two subjects from Biology, Chemistry, Maths, or Physics. Hence, while Chemistry is preferred, it's not mandatory if you have strong Biology and another subject.
     - **University of Brighton**: Primarily requires Biology, Human Biology, or Physical Education, focusing less on Chemistry.
     - **University of Wolverhampton**: Accepts a range of sciences and social sciences, indicating that Chemistry is not a strict requirement.

3. **Chemistry’s Value:**
   - While not always required, A-Level Chemistry can be advantageous. The understanding of biochemical processes, pharmacology, and the body’s chemistry can enhance your overall grasp of physiotherapy concepts. This knowledge can be particularly useful when dealing with medications and understanding their effects on the body, which is vital in rehabilitation contexts.

### Recommendations for Aspiring Physiotherapy Students

1. **Prioritize Biology:**
   - Focus on obtaining a strong grade in A-Level Biology, as it is crucial for all physiotherapy courses. 

2. **Consider Your Strengths:**
   - If you excel in subjects like Physics or Psychology, those can be valuable alternatives if Chemistry isn’t your strong suit.

3. **Research Universities:**
   - Each university may have slightly different requirements. It’s essential to research the specific programs you are interested in, as well as contact their admissions offices for clarity on the necessity of Chemistry.

4. **Alternative Pathways:**
   - If you find that your current A-Level choices do not align with the requirements, consider alternative pathways, such as Foundation courses, or even exploring degree apprenticeships that may have different entry criteria.

5. **Postgraduate Options:**
   - If you already have a degree in another field, you can consider postgraduate physiotherapy courses. These often have different requirements and may not necessitate A-Level Chemistry.

### Conclusion

In summary, while A-Level Chemistry can be beneficial for a physiotherapy career, it is not universally required for all physiotherapy courses. Biology is essential, while Physics and Psychology are also highly regarded. If you are concerned about your A-Level choices, I encourage you to reach out to the universities you are interested in to clarify their specific requirements. This proactive approach will help you make informed decisions that align with your academic strengths and career aspirations in physiotherapy. 

By carefully considering your A-Level subjects and thoroughly researching university requirements, you can successfully navigate the entry pathways to a rewarding career in physiotherapy.
