Procedural programming and functional programming are two distinct programming paradigms, each with its own approach to structuring code.

Procedural programming focuses on writing procedures or methods that execute operations on data. It employs a linear or top-down methodology, centering around the concept of procedure calls. In this paradigm, various procedures—often referred to as routines, subroutines, or functions—are crafted to perform specific tasks. These procedures consist of a sequence of computational steps. The primary objective of procedural programming is to decompose a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines. However, in large procedural codebases, maintaining and updating the code can become quite challenging.

Conversely, functional programming emphasizes the creation and application of mathematical functions. It is characterized as a declarative programming style that prioritizes "what" needs to be solved rather than "how" to solve it, which is the main focus of procedural programming. In functional programming, the emphasis is on the actions being performed rather than the specific steps taken to perform them. Languages that support functional programming are designed around the principles of mathematical functions, utilizing conditional expressions and recursion for computation. Importantly, functional programming avoids mutable data and changing states, ensuring that the output of a function is solely dependent on the arguments provided to it.

In procedural programming, data and functions are treated as separate entities. This means that a list of instructions is used to guide the computer through each step of the process. In contrast, functional programming merges data and functions, treating computations as evaluations of mathematical functions based on lambda calculus.

In summary, procedural programming revolves around writing procedures or methods that manipulate data, while functional programming focuses on constructing and applying mathematical functions. Each paradigm has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them often depends on the specific requirements of the project at hand.
