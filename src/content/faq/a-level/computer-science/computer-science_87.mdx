An adjacency list is a data structure used to represent a graph by storing a list of vertices that are connected to each vertex in the graph.

To elaborate, the adjacency list provides a way to define the relationships among nodes (or vertices) in a graph. Each vertex has an associated list that contains all the vertices it is directly connected to. This list is referred to as the adjacency list of that particular vertex.

Typically, an adjacency list is implemented using either an array or a linked list. Each element of the array or each node of the linked list corresponds to a vertex in the graph. The value stored in each element or node represents a list of vertices that are adjacent to the vertex in question. This adjacency list can be implemented using various data structures, such as a dynamic array, a linked list, a set, or any other suitable collection.

For instance, consider a graph with four vertices labeled $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$. If vertex $1$ is connected to vertices $2$ and $3$, vertex $2$ is connected to vertices $1$ and $4$, vertex $3$ is connected to vertices $1$ and $4$, and vertex $4$ is connected to vertices $2$ and $3$, the adjacency list representation of this graph would look like this:

$$
\begin{align*}
1: & \quad 2, 3 \\
2: & \quad 1, 4 \\
3: & \quad 1, 4 \\
4: & \quad 2, 3 \\
\end{align*}
$$

In this representation, the adjacency list for vertex $1$ includes vertices $2$ and $3$, while the adjacency list for vertex $2$ includes vertices $1$ and $4$, and so forth.

The adjacency list representation is generally more space-efficient than an adjacency matrix, particularly in the case of sparse graphs—graphs characterized by a relatively small number of edges—since it only stores the existing connections. However, it may be less efficient for certain operations, such as checking the existence of an edge between two vertices, compared to the adjacency matrix representation.
