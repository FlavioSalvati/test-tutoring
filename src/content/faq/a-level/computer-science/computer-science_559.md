An inner join retrieves only the records that have matching values in both tables, while an outer join returns all records from one table along with the matched records from the second table.

In SQL, a join operation combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. The two most common types of joins are the inner join and the outer join. An inner join specifically returns only those rows where there is a match in both tables. If a row in the first table matches a row in the second table, that row will be included in the result set. Conversely, if no match exists, the row will be excluded from the result. Essentially, an inner join yields the intersection of the two tables.

In contrast, an outer join returns all rows from one table and the corresponding matched rows from the second table. If there is no match, it will display 'NULL' for the unmatched side of the table. Outer joins can be further categorized into three types: 
1. The **left outer join**, which returns all rows from the left table along with the matched rows from the right table.
2. The **right outer join**, which returns all rows from the right table along with the matched rows from the left table.
3. The **full outer join**, which returns all rows from both tables, including those without matches.

In summary, the primary distinction between an inner join and an outer join lies in their respective result sets. An inner join exclusively returns rows with matches in both tables, whereas an outer join includes all rows from one table and any matching rows from the other. This means that an outer join can yield a greater number of rows than an inner join. The decision to use an inner join or an outer join in SQL should be based on the specific needs of your query.
