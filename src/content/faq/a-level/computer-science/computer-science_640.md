Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that organizes elements by tallying the occurrences of each unique item in the array.

This algorithm is classified as a non-comparison-based sorting method, meaning it does not sort elements by comparing them. Instead, it utilizes an auxiliary array, often referred to as the count array, to record the frequency of each unique element in the input array. The size of the count array is determined by the maximum element present in the input array. The algorithm then adjusts the count array so that each element at a given index accumulates the total of the previous counts. This modified count array effectively indicates the position of each element in the final output sequence.

The counting sort algorithm proceeds through three main steps:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: It first counts how many times each number appears in the input array, storing this information in the count array.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Computation**: Next, it performs a prefix sum calculation on the count array. This step modifies the count array so that each element at each index reflects the cumulative sum of all previous counts, providing the starting index for each number in the output array.

3. **Building the Output Array**: Finally, the algorithm iterates over the input array in reverse order. For each element, it places it in the output array at the index specified by the count array and subsequently decrements the count for that element by one.

Counting sort is particularly efficient when the range of the input data, denoted as $k$, is not excessively larger than the number of items to be sorted, denoted as $n$. Its time complexity is $O(n + k)$, and it also has a space complexity of $O(n + k)$, where $n$ represents the number of elements in the input array and $k$ is the range of input values.

However, it is important to note that counting sort is not a comparison-based sort and is frequently employed as a subroutine within other sorting algorithms, such as radix sort. Additionally, counting sort is not equipped to handle arrays containing negative numbers or floating-point values. One of the notable features of counting sort is that it is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output.
