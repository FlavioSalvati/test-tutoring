Class-based programming utilizes predefined classes to create objects, while prototype-based programming focuses on creating objects and subsequently adding properties and methods.

In class-based programming, a class serves as a blueprint from which individual objects are derived. Each object is an instance of a class, and each class encapsulates both the data and methods that are common to all instances of that class. For instance, a 'Car' class might define properties such as 'colour' and 'model', along with methods such as 'drive' and 'park'. When a new 'Car' object is instantiated, it automatically possesses these properties and methods. This programming paradigm is prevalent in languages such as Java, C++, and Python. Class-based languages typically employ inheritance to efficiently manage data and operations.

Conversely, prototype-based programming is a form of object-oriented programming that does not utilize classes. Instead, it enables behavior reuse—commonly known as inheritance—through the process of cloning existing objects that act as prototypes. This model can provide greater flexibility than class-based programming, as it allows for the dynamic addition of properties and methods to individual objects or to the prototype itself. JavaScript is a prominent language that exemplifies prototype-based programming.

In prototype-based programming, every object is essentially a clone of another object, making it possible to inherit properties and methods from its prototype. For example, in JavaScript, one might start with a basic 'Car' object and then create a 'Ford' object that inherits the properties and methods of the 'Car' object, while also introducing additional properties and methods unique to 'Ford' vehicles. This flexibility is fundamental to the inheritance model, which can vary in its implementation across different prototype-based languages.

**A-Level Computer Science Tutor Summary:** Class-based programming employs predefined classes to create structured and consistent objects, commonly found in languages like Java and Python. In contrast, prototype-based programming, which is exemplified by JavaScript, directly creates objects and permits greater flexibility by cloning existing objects and augmenting them with additional properties and methods. Both paradigms are integral to object-oriented programming, facilitating effective code management and reuse.
