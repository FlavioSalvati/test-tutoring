In functional programming, graphs can be represented using various methods, including adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, edge lists, and incidence matrices.

**Adjacency Lists** are one of the most popular methods for representing graphs in functional programming. In this representation, each node is associated with a list of its adjacent nodes. Typically, this is implemented using a map or a dictionary, where the keys represent the nodes and the values correspond to lists of adjacent nodes. Adjacency lists are particularly efficient for sparse graphs, where the number of edges is significantly less than the square of the number of nodes, denoted as $|E| \ll |V|^2$.

**Adjacency Matrices** provide another widely-used representation. Here, the graph is structured as a two-dimensional array, where the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column indicates the presence of an edge between the $i$-th and $j$-th nodes. While this representation consumes more space compared to adjacency lists—especially for sparse graphs—it allows for constant-time access to check for an edge's existence between any two nodes, providing $O(1)$ lookup time.

**Edge Lists** represent a graph as a list of its edges, with each edge depicted as a pair of nodes. This representation is particularly beneficial for graphs with edges that have associated data, such as weights in weighted graphs. However, it can be less efficient for operations that require accessing the neighbors of a node, as this necessitates scanning through the entire edge list.

**Incidence Matrices** are a less common but potentially useful representation in specific scenarios. In this model, the graph is depicted as a two-dimensional array, where the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column indicates whether the $i$-th node is connected to the $j$-th edge. This representation can be advantageous for operations that need to access the edges linked to a node, but it tends to be less efficient for checking the existence of an edge between two nodes.

Each of these representations has distinct advantages and disadvantages, and selecting the appropriate representation can profoundly affect the efficiency of graph algorithms. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the characteristics of the graph and the types of operations to be performed when choosing the most suitable representation.
