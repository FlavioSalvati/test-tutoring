A constant is a value that remains unchanged throughout the execution of a program, while a variable's value can be modified at any point during the program's runtime.

In programming, a constant is a specific type of identifier whose value is fixed and cannot be altered after its initial assignment. Once a constant is defined, it retains its value for the duration of the program. This feature makes constants particularly useful for values that are used repeatedly and should remain unmodified, such as the mathematical constant $\pi$ in calculations or the maximum number of students allowed in a classroom within a school management system.

In contrast, a variable serves as a symbolic name for a memory location where data can be stored. Unlike constants, variables are mutable, meaning that their values can change over the course of the program's execution. Variables are essential for storing data that may need to be updated or manipulated later. For example, in a program that calculates the area of a circle, the radius could be represented as a variable because it can assume different values for different circles.

The primary distinction between constants and variables lies in their mutability. Constants are immutable, which means their value is established at the time of declaration and remains constant throughout the program. Conversely, variables are mutable, allowing their values to be modified at any point after they have been declared. Exploring practical examples can provide deeper insights into how constants and variables function in more complex programming scenarios.

The syntax for declaring constants and variables varies across programming languages. For instance, in Java, constants are typically declared using the `final` keyword, while variables do not require a specific keyword. In Python, constants are conventionally denoted by writing their names in all capital letters, although this is not enforced by the language itself. For those who are new to programming, understanding these conventions is essential for grasping how constants and variables are implemented in various programming languages.

Comprehending the difference between constants and variables is vital for effective programming. This knowledge contributes to writing more efficient and error-free code, as well as enhancing oneâ€™s understanding of a program's flow and logic. Additionally, familiarity with the syntax and conventions of different programming languages can improve a programmer's ability to effectively utilize constants and variables in diverse contexts.
