The Strand Sort algorithm operates by repeatedly extracting sorted sublists from an unsorted list and merging them together.

Strand Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that systematically divides the original unsorted list into smaller, sorted sublists. It continues merging these sublists until the entire list is sorted. The term 'Strand Sort' derives from the way the algorithm isolates or "strands" sorted sequences from the unsorted list.

The process begins by examining the first element of the list, which serves as the initial element of a new sublist. The algorithm then iterates through the remaining elements, checking each one in sequence. If an element is found that is larger than the last element of the current sublist, it is removed from the main list and appended to the end of the sublist. This procedure continues until the end of the list is reached, at which point the sublist is fully sorted and ready to be merged back into the main list.

The merging process is quite straightforward. The algorithm compares the first elements of both the main list and the sublist. The smaller of the two elements is removed from its respective list and added to the end of the output list. This comparison continues until one of the lists is empty. At that point, all remaining elements from the non-empty list are appended to the end of the output list.

After this, the algorithm repeats the process by creating a new sublist from the remaining unsorted elements in the main list and merging it into the output list. This cycle continues until the main list is empty and all elements have been sorted.

Strand Sort is particularly efficient for sorting lists that contain many elements already in order. However, it has a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which can make it less suitable for large lists or those that are significantly disordered. Nevertheless, it is a valuable algorithm to understand, as it illustrates the divide and conquer principle, a fundamental concept in computer science.
