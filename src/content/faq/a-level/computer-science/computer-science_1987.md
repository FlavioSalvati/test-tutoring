Bitwise operators perform operations directly on the binary representations of numbers, while logical operators evaluate boolean expressions.

Bitwise operators are commonly used in programming to manipulate individual bits within a binary number. They operate on the binary representations of integers stored in memory. The most frequently used bitwise operators include AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift. For instance, consider the two binary numbers $1011$ (which is $11$ in decimal) and $1101$ (which is $13$ in decimal). When performing a bitwise AND operation, each bit of the first operand is compared with the corresponding bit of the second operand. The resulting bit is set to $1$ if both bits are $1$; otherwise, it is set to $0$. Therefore, the result of $1011 \text{ AND } 1101$ is $1001$, which is $9$ in decimal.

In contrast, logical operators are used to evaluate expressions and yield a boolean result: either true or false. The most common logical operators are AND (often represented as $&&$), OR (represented as $||$), and NOT (represented as $!$). Unlike bitwise operators, logical operators function at a higher level of abstraction, dealing with truth values rather than binary representations. For example, if we have two boolean expressions, $A$ (which is true) and $B$ (which is false), a logical AND operation will return true only if both $A$ and $B$ are true. Since $B$ is false in this case, the expression $A \text{ AND } B$ will return false.
