A complete binary tree is a specific form of binary tree characterized by the fact that every level, with the exception of possibly the last one, is entirely filled with nodes.

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. A complete binary tree possesses unique attributes that distinguish it from other types of binary trees. In a complete binary tree, all levels are fully populated with nodes, except for the last level, which is filled from left to right. Consequently, when viewing the tree level by level, each level is completely filled with nodes until the last level is reached.

One of the fundamental properties of a complete binary tree is its height. The height of a complete binary tree is always minimized for a given number of nodes. This efficiency arises because the tree is filled level by level, starting from the root and extending down to the leaves. The height of a complete binary tree containing $n$ nodes is given by:

$$
\text{height} = \lfloor \log_2(n + 1) \rfloor
$$

Another significant property of a complete binary tree is that it is inherently balanced. A balanced tree is defined as one in which the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node does not exceed one. This characteristic ensures that operations such as insertion, deletion, and search can be executed efficiently in a complete binary tree.

Regarding representation, complete binary trees are often implemented using arrays. This array representation is feasible due to the structural properties of complete binary trees, which eliminate any gaps. Specifically, for a node located at index $i$ in the array, its left child can be found at index $2i + 1$, while the right child is at index $2i + 2$. Additionally, the parent of a node at index $i$ can be located at:

$$
\text{parent index} = \lfloor \frac{i - 1}{2} \rfloor
$$

In summary, a complete binary tree is a specialized type of binary tree that is fully filled except for the last level, which is completed from left to right. It exhibits several important properties that enhance operational efficiency and make it particularly suitable for array representation.
