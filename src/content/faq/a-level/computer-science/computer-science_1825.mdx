Horizontal partitioning divides a database into rows, while vertical partitioning divides it into columns.

To elaborate, horizontal partitioning, also referred to as data sharding, entails splitting a database into two or more tables that share the same columns but contain different rows. Each partition becomes a separate entity that holds a subset of the data, allowing for independent location and management. This approach is particularly advantageous when handling large tables, as it can enhance query performance by minimizing the volume of data that needs to be scanned. For instance, a database for a multinational corporation might be horizontally partitioned by country, ensuring that all data related to each country is stored in distinct partitions.

Conversely, vertical partitioning involves dividing a database into smaller tables, each containing fewer columns while retaining all rows from the original table. Each partition holds different fields of data, and a unique identifier is employed to link these fields back together. This strategy is especially beneficial when dealing with tables that have a large number of columns or when certain columns are frequently accessed together. For example, in a customer database, one partition could store basic contact information, while another could contain purchase history.

Both partitioning methods offer distinct advantages and can be utilized in conjunction to optimize database performance. However, they also introduce certain complexities. Horizontal partitioning may lead to more complicated queries and increased maintenance efforts, as data is distributed across multiple tables. Similarly, vertical partitioning can complicate queries since information from a single record is spread across various tables, potentially requiring more joins to reconstruct a complete record.

In summary, horizontal and vertical partitioning are effective techniques for managing and optimizing large databases. The decision to use one method over the other hinges on the specific requirements of the database, including the size and nature of the data, as well as the types of queries that will be executed.
