Network cabling encompasses various types, including Ethernet cables, coaxial cables, fibre optic cables, and patch cables, each serving distinct purposes and environments.

### Ethernet Cables
Ethernet cables, commonly referred to as Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7, and Cat8, are the most widely used network cables. They serve to connect devices within a local area network (LAN), such as computers, routers, and switches. These cables are classified based on their performance characteristics and the maximum frequency they can support. For example, Cat5e cables can handle frequencies up to $100 \, \text{MHz}$ and data speeds of up to $1 \, \text{Gbps}$, whereas Cat6a cables can manage frequencies up to $500 \, \text{MHz}$ and speeds of up to $10 \, \text{Gbps}$.

### Coaxial Cables
Coaxial cables, often simply called coax, consist of an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, which is then encased in a tubular conducting shield. These cables are commonly used to connect televisions to aerials or satellite dishes, and they can also be employed in certain computer networking scenarios. Coaxial cables are particularly valued for their capability to maintain signal strength over long distances, making them ideal for television broadcasts.

### Fibre Optic Cables
Fibre optic cables transmit data at high speeds and over extensive distances using light. They include one or more optical fibres, each capable of sending messages modulated onto light waves. Fibre optic cables are less prone to interference than traditional copper cables and can carry signals much farther, making them a prevalent choice for wide area networks (WANs) and high-speed internet connections.

### Patch Cables
Patch cables are designed for short-distance connections, typically found in server rooms or for linking computers to wall outlets. They are usually made from Cat5e or Cat6 Ethernet cables, although fibre optic variants are also available. Patch cables are frequently employed to connect devices to a network switch or hub in wired network configurations.

### Choosing the Right Cabling
Each type of network cabling has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The selection of the appropriate cable type depends on specific network requirements, including the distance the signal needs to travel, the installation environment, and the available budget for network infrastructure.
