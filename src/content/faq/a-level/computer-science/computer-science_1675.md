The fundamental principles of cloud computing in networking include on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.

Cloud computing is defined as a model that enables ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. These resources can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with service providers. This concept is known as on-demand self-service, which allows users to autonomously provision computing capabilities—such as server time and network storage—automatically, without requiring direct human intervention from service providers.

Another key principle is broad network access. Capabilities are made available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms, facilitating use by diverse client platforms, whether they are thin or thick clients. This ensures that services can be accessed from virtually anywhere at any time, greatly enhancing user convenience. For a deeper understanding of how these capabilities contribute to the overall goals and advantages of networking, further reading is recommended.

Resource pooling is also a crucial aspect of cloud computing. In this model, the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers through a multi-tenant architecture. Different physical and virtual resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned based on consumer demand. This means that resources are shared among multiple users and can be reallocated as needed. Users typically do not have control or knowledge of the specific locations of the resources being provided, although they may be able to specify a general location at a higher level of abstraction.

Rapid elasticity is another vital principle of cloud computing. This allows capabilities to be elastically provisioned and released—often automatically—enabling rapid scaling up or down in response to demand. Consequently, services can be adjusted quickly and efficiently to meet varying demands, providing users with both flexibility and scalability. For more details on how this scalability is managed within cloud computing frameworks, additional resources are available.

Lastly, measured service is an important principle of cloud computing. Cloud systems automatically monitor and optimize resource usage by employing a metering capability that is appropriate for the type of service being provided. This means that users only pay for the resources they actually use, making cloud computing a cost-effective solution. If you're interested in how cloud computing interacts with various network architectures, such as client-server and peer-to-peer systems, further reading is suggested.
