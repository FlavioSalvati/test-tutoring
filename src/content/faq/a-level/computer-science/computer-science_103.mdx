Wireless network protocols encompass a variety of technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Infrared, LTE, and NFC.

**Wi-Fi** is the most prevalent wireless network protocol, primarily employed for establishing local area networks (LANs). It operates within the frequency bands of $2.4 \, \text{GHz}$ and $5 \, \text{GHz}$ and adheres to the IEEE 802.11 standard. Wi-Fi facilitates connections for devices such as computers, smartphones, and smart home devices to the internet, providing high data transfer rates that make it ideal for streaming and downloading large files.

**Bluetooth** is another widely used wireless protocol, specifically designed for short-range connections between devices. It also operates on the $2.4 \, \text{GHz}$ band and is commonly used to connect devices like headphones, speakers, keyboards, and mice to computers or smartphones. Bluetooth is particularly effective for low-power, short-range applications due to its minimal energy consumption.

**Zigbee** and **Z-Wave** are wireless protocols predominantly utilized in smart home applications. Zigbee functions on the $2.4 \, \text{GHz}$ band and is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It is employed for connecting various smart home devices, including lights, locks, and thermostats. Conversely, Z-Wave operates on sub-$1 \, \text{GHz}$ frequencies and serves similar functions as Zigbee. Both protocols are engineered for low-power, low-data-rate applications and feature mesh networking capabilities.

**Infrared** is a wireless protocol that utilizes infrared light to transmit data. It is commonly found in remote controls for televisions and other consumer electronics. Infrared communication is restricted to line-of-sight and has a limited range, making it less versatile compared to other wireless protocols.

**LTE** (Long Term Evolution) is a wireless protocol that facilitates mobile broadband communication. It operates across various frequency bands and connects mobile devices to the internet. LTE is known for its high data transfer rates and extensive coverage, making it suitable for mobile internet access.

**NFC** (Near Field Communication) is a wireless protocol designed for short-range communication between devices. Operating at a frequency of $13.56 \, \text{MHz}$, it is commonly used for applications such as contactless payments and data transfer between smartphones. NFC is optimized for very short-range interactions (typically just a few centimeters) and low-data-rate applications.
