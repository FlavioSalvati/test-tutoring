The Radix Sort algorithm organizes numbers by examining individual digits, beginning with the least significant digit and proceeding to the most significant.

Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm specifically designed for integers. It sorts data by grouping keys based on their individual digits that share the same position and value. The term "radix" refers to the base of the number system; for instance, in the decimal system, the radix is $10$.

The algorithm operates by distributing numbers into buckets according to their radix. It starts with the least significant digit (the rightmost digit) and works its way to the most significant digit (the leftmost digit). For each digit, numbers are collected from the buckets, thereby maintaining the order established in the previous step. This procedure is repeated for each digit until all digits have been processed.

There are two variations of Radix Sort: Most Significant Digit (MSD) and Least Significant Digit (LSD). The LSD Radix Sort is the more common approach; it begins with the least significant digit and progresses toward the most significant. This method employs a stable sorting algorithm, such as counting sort or bucket sort, to organize the digits at each stage. Conversely, the MSD Radix Sort starts with the most significant digit and moves toward the least significant, utilizing a recursive sorting technique for digit organization.

The time complexity of Radix Sort is $O(nk)$, where $n$ represents the number of elements and $k$ denotes the number of digits in the maximum number. This efficiency makes Radix Sort particularly suitable for large datasets. However, it's important to note that the algorithm has a space complexity of $O(n + k)$, indicating that it requires additional memory to execute the sorting process.

In conclusion, Radix Sort is a distinctive sorting algorithm that processes numbers digit by digit, from least significant to most significant. It is notably efficient for handling large datasets, although it does necessitate extra space for sorting operations.
