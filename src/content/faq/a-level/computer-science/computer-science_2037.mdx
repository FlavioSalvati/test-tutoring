The Comb Sort algorithm is an efficient sorting method that improves upon the traditional Bubble Sort by comparing and swapping elements that are separated by a certain "gap."

Unlike Bubble Sort, which only compares adjacent elements, Comb Sort begins with a relatively large gap, typically set to the length of the list being sorted. This gap is progressively reduced in each iteration until it reaches $1$, at which point the algorithm functions similarly to Bubble Sort.

The sorting process begins by initializing the gap to the length of the list. The algorithm then enters a loop where it compares each element with the element that is located $gap$ positions ahead. If the two elements are out of order, they are swapped. This procedure continues from the beginning of the list until a complete pass is made without any swaps, indicating that the elements are in order for the current gap.

After each complete pass, the gap is decreased, usually by dividing it by a factor of $1.3$. This reduction has been shown to yield good performance in practical scenarios. The algorithm repeats the comparison and swapping process with the new gap until the gap is reduced to $1$. At this stage, the algorithm continues to compare and swap adjacent elements until the entire list is sorted.

One significant advantage of the Comb Sort algorithm over Bubble Sort is its ability to efficiently handle "turtles," which are small values located near the end of the list that tend to move slowly to their correct positions in Bubble Sort. By utilizing a larger gap, Comb Sort can effectively move these small values towards the front of the list much more quickly.

In terms of computational complexity, Comb Sort performs well on average, with a time complexity of $O\left(\frac{n^2}{2^p}\right)$ for a list of $n$ elements, where $p$ is the number of times the gap has been reduced. However, in the worst-case scenario, its time complexity is $O(n^2)$, which is the same as that of Bubble Sort. Despite this worst-case performance, Comb Sort typically outperforms Bubble Sort in practice because of its enhanced ability to manage "turtles" effectively.
