Early binding and late binding are two concepts that pertain to how method calls are resolved in programming, specifically regarding when the association between a method call and the actual method implementation is made.

**Early Binding**  
Early binding, also referred to as static binding or compile-time binding, occurs when the compiler directly associates a method call with a specific method implementation during the compilation process. This means that the method to be executed is determined at compile-time. Early binding is typically utilized in statically typed languages, such as C++ and Java. One of the primary advantages of early binding is improved performance; since the method to be executed is known prior to runtime, it reduces overhead during execution. However, this approach lacks flexibility, as the binding is fixed once the code is compiled.

**Late Binding**  
In contrast, late binding, often called dynamic binding or runtime binding, determines the method associated with a method call during the program's execution. This technique is commonly found in dynamically typed languages like Python and JavaScript. Late binding offers greater flexibility, allowing the method to be executed to be modified at runtime, which facilitates more dynamic behavior. However, this flexibility comes at a cost; it can result in a slight decrease in performance due to the additional overhead of resolving the method during execution.

For further insights into how methods and objects operate within these binding contexts, as well as the programming constructs that facilitate late binding, please refer to the relevant sections.
