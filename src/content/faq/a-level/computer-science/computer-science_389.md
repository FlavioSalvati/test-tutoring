Counting sort is a specialized sorting algorithm that organizes elements by counting the frequency of each unique value in the input array.

As a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm, counting sort does not rely on comparing elements to establish their order. Instead, it creates an auxiliary array known as the count array, which holds the frequency of each unique element present in the input. The size of this count array is determined by the maximum value in the input array. The algorithm then modifies the count array so that each element at a given index contains the cumulative sum of the counts of all previous elements. This modified count array helps determine the final position of each element in the sorted output.

The counting sort algorithm proceeds in three main steps:

1. **Counting Frequencies**: It first counts how many times each number appears in the input array, storing this information in the count array.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Next, it computes the prefix sums for the count array. This step transforms the count array so that each index contains the total count of all previous elements, effectively indicating the starting index for each number in the output array.

3. **Building the Output Array**: Finally, the algorithm processes the input array in reverse order. For each element, it places it in the output array at the index specified by the count array and then decrements the count for that element by one.

Counting sort is particularly efficient when the range of the input data, denoted as $k$, is not significantly larger than the number of elements, $n$, being sorted. Its time complexity is $O(n + k)$, and it requires $O(n + k)$ space, where $n$ represents the number of elements in the input array.

However, it is important to note that counting sort is not a comparison sort. It is often utilized as a subroutine within other sorting algorithms, such as radix sort. Additionally, counting sort is not suitable for sorting arrays that include negative numbers or floating-point values. A notable feature of counting sort is its stability, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output.
