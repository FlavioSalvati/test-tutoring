Sequential algorithms execute one operation at a time, whereas parallel algorithms perform multiple operations simultaneously.

Sequential algorithms are designed to execute each step in a specific order, with one step following another. In this model, the next step can only commence once the preceding step has been completed. This approach is particularly useful when the output of one step serves as the input for the subsequent step. While sequential algorithms are generally easier to design and implement, they may not be as efficient as parallel algorithms, especially when handling large datasets or complex computations.

In contrast, parallel algorithms tackle problems by dividing them into multiple sub-problems and solving these concurrently. This is accomplished by utilizing multiple processing elements, such as cores in a multi-core processor, to execute different parts of the algorithm simultaneously. The results from these concurrent operations are then combined to produce the final output. Although parallel algorithms can significantly reduce the time required to solve a problem, they are more complex to design and implement. They demand careful coordination and synchronization to ensure that all processing elements work together correctly. Consequently, parallel algorithms are particularly suited for tasks that involve processing large volumes of data or performing complex computations in a timely manner.

In summary, the primary distinction between sequential and parallel algorithms lies in their execution methods. Sequential algorithms follow a linear, step-by-step approach, executing one operation at a time, while parallel algorithms break the problem into smaller components and address them simultaneously. The decision to use either a sequential or parallel algorithm depends on the nature of the problem, the resources available, and the performance requirements.
