A rose tree, also referred to as a multiway tree, is a data structure that allows for an arbitrary number of children at each node.

In essence, a rose tree is a type of tree structure in which every node can have any number of child nodes. This differs from binary trees, where each node is limited to a maximum of two children. The term "rose tree" is frequently used in functional programming languages, such as Haskell, to describe this specific data structure.

In a rose tree, each node consists of a value and a list of its children, which are themselves rose trees. The root of the tree is the only node that does not have a parent, while the leaves are the nodes that do not have any children. The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that particular node, and the height of the tree is the maximum depth of any node within the tree.

A significant characteristic of rose trees is their recursive nature. This property allows operations on rose trees — such as applying a function to all the values within the tree or reducing the tree to a single value through folding — to be implemented in a highly elegant and concise manner using recursion.

Additionally, rose trees naturally represent hierarchical data structures. For instance, a file system can be modeled as a rose tree, where each node represents either a directory or a file, and the children of a directory node correspond to the files and subdirectories contained within that directory.

When considering computational complexity, operations on rose trees may prove to be more resource-intensive than those on binary trees, due to the potential for each node to have many children. However, this complexity can be alleviated by utilizing balanced rose trees, which maintain a relatively small number of children at each node.
