A min heap is a data structure that utilizes a binary tree to maintain the heap property during insertion and deletion operations.

A min heap is characterized as a complete binary tree in which each node is less than or equal to its children. This property, known as the heap property, ensures that the root of the tree holds the smallest element, which is a defining feature of a min heap.

To implement a min heap, you can utilize an array where each element corresponds to a node within the binary tree. The parent-child relationships can be established using array indices. For a node at index $i$, the left child is located at index $2i + 1$, and the right child is at index $2i + 2$. Conversely, the parent of a node at index $i$ can be found at index $\left\lfloor \frac{i - 1}{2} \right\rfloor$.

When inserting a new element, you place it at the end of the array (or the next available position in the binary tree) and then perform a process known as "bubbling up" to restore the heap property. Bubbling up entails swapping the newly added element with its parent if the parent is larger than the new element. This process continues until the new element is either smaller than its parent or it becomes the root of the heap.

To delete the minimum element (which is always at the root), you replace the root with the last element in the array (or the last node in the tree) and then perform a "bubbling down" operation to restore the heap property. Bubbling down involves swapping the element with its smallest child if the element is larger than that child. This process continues until the element is smaller than both of its children or it becomes a leaf node.

Constructing a min heap from an array of $n$ elements can be accomplished in $O(n)$ time, while operations such as insertion, deletion of the minimum element, and decreasing a key can be performed in $O(\log n)$ time. This efficiency makes min heaps particularly useful for algorithms that require frequent access to the smallest element, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or heap sort.

In summary, the fundamental principle of implementing a min heap lies in maintaining the heap property throughout insertions and deletions. This guarantees that the root of the heap always contains the smallest element, which can be accessed in constant time.
