Balanced trees, such as AVL trees, can be effectively implemented in functional programming languages using recursion and immutable data structures.

In functional programming, data structures are generally immutable, which means they cannot be altered once they are created. This approach contrasts sharply with imperative programming, where data structures like trees are frequently modified in place. When you implement an AVL tree in a functional language, you create new tree instances instead of modifying the existing ones.

The cornerstone of implementing AVL trees in functional programming is recursion. Each operation on the tree—such as insertion or deletion—involves recursively traversing the tree until the appropriate position is identified. Once the correct location is found, a new tree is constructed to reflect the desired change. For instance, to insert a new element, you would recursively navigate through the tree until you reach the suitable spot for the new element. Afterwards, you would create a new tree that mirrors the original, with the new element incorporated.

Balancing the tree is also accomplished through recursion. After each insertion or deletion, you check the balance factor of each node, which is defined as the difference in height between the left and right subtrees. If the balance factor of any node exceeds $1$ or falls below $-1$, a rotation is executed to restore balance. This rotation requires generating a new tree that represents the original structure after the rotation is applied.

One of the challenges of implementing AVL trees in a functional paradigm is the increased memory usage compared to imperative implementations, due to the creation of a new tree for each operation rather than modifying an existing one. However, this memory overhead can be mitigated by utilizing persistent data structures, which allow sharing of structure across different versions of the tree. Consequently, instead of generating a completely new tree for every operation, you only need to create new nodes for the portions of the tree that have changed.

In summary, implementing AVL trees in functional programming necessitates the use of recursion and immutable data structures. Each operation results in the construction of a new tree, while balancing involves checking the balance factor of each node and performing rotations as needed. Although this method may consume more memory, it offers the advantage of greater ease in reasoning and debugging, as each operation is self-contained and does not interfere with the rest of the tree.
