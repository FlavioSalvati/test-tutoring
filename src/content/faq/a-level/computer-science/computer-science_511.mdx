Laser networks facilitate data transmission by sending pulses of light through the air or through fiber optic cables.

These networks, commonly referred to as free-space optical (FSO) communication systems, utilize light to transmit information. The process involves encoding data onto a beam of light, which is subsequently transmitted through the atmosphere or along fiber optic cables. At the receiving end, the information is decoded from the light beam and converted back into a usable electronic format.

The transmission process begins with converting electronic data into light. This conversion is performed using a laser diode, which emits light when an electric current is applied. The emitted light is then modulated, meaning its intensity is varied to represent the data being transmitted. The most prevalent modulation method is on-off keying, where the presence of light signifies a binary one ($1$) and the absence of light indicates a binary zero ($0$).

After modulation, the light is directed through either the air or a fiber optic cable. In the case of air transmission, the light is focused into a narrow beam using a lens, which is then aimed toward the receiver, potentially located several kilometers away. When using fiber optic cables, the light travels through the cable due to a phenomenon known as total internal reflection.

At the receiving end, the light is detected by a photodiode, which generates an electric current upon exposure to light, thus converting the light signal back into electronic data. The current produced by the photodiode is then demodulated, restoring it to its original data format.

Laser networks offer several advantages over traditional radio frequency (RF) networks, including the ability to transmit data at significantly higher speeds and immunity to interference from other electronic devices. However, they also come with certain drawbacks. For instance, their performance can be affected by atmospheric conditions such as fog and rain, and they require a clear line of sight between the transmitter and receiver.
