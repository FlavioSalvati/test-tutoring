Normalization is a crucial process in database design, aimed at organizing data to minimize redundancy and enhance data integrity. The common normalization forms include:

1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**
2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**
3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**
5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**
6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

**First Normal Form (1NF)** represents the foundational level of normalization. It mandates that a relational database must not contain repeating groups. Specifically, each column must have a unique value, ensuring that no multiple columns retrieve the same row. This requirement helps to eliminate redundancy and enhances the integrity of the data.

**Second Normal Form (2NF)** builds upon the principles established by 1NF by ensuring that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key. There should be no partial dependency of any attribute on the primary key. For instance, if a table utilizes a composite primary key, every other attribute in that table should depend on the entire key, rather than just a portion of it.

**Third Normal Form (3NF)** advances the normalization process further by ensuring that all non-key attributes are independent of one another. This process, known as eliminating transitive dependencies, helps to further reduce redundancy and bolster data integrity.

**Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** is a more stringent version of 3NF. It stipulates that for every non-trivial functional dependency $X \to Y$, $X$ must be a superkey. In simpler terms, if a non-key attribute depends functionally on another non-key attribute, the latter must qualify as a candidate key.

**Fourth Normal Form (4NF)** addresses multi-valued dependencies. It requires that for any non-trivial multi-valued dependency $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$, $X$ must be a superkey. This condition helps to eliminate redundancy arising from multi-valued dependencies.

**Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**, also known as Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF), tackles scenarios where data can be reconstructed from smaller, more manageable pieces of information, thereby maintaining less redundancy. It requires that every join dependency in the table is implied by the candidate keys.

Each of these normalization forms has distinct rules and requirements, and they progressively build upon one another to reduce redundancy and enhance data integrity within relational databases.
