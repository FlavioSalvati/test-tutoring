The purpose of pseudocode in problem-solving is to simplify complex problems and provide a clear, human-readable plan for coding a solution.

Pseudocode is a method used in planning an algorithm. It is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language. It is used by programmers to understand and communicate algorithmic solutions without worrying about syntax details. It's a crucial step in problem-solving as it allows the programmer to focus on the logic of the solution before getting into the specifics of coding.

Pseudocode is not tied to any specific programming language, which means it can be understood and implemented by programmers regardless of their preferred coding language. This makes it a universal tool for communicating algorithms and enables collaboration between programmers who may use different programming languages.

In problem-solving, pseudocode helps break down complex problems into manageable steps. It allows the programmer to focus on the logic of the problem without getting distracted by the syntax or semantics of a particular programming language. This is particularly useful in the early stages of problem-solving, where the focus is on understanding the problem and devising a logical solution.

Pseudocode also serves as a blueprint for the actual coding. Once the pseudocode is written, it can be translated into any programming language. This makes the coding process more efficient, as the programmer can focus on translating the logic of the pseudocode into code, rather than figuring out the logic while coding.

In summary, pseudocode is a powerful tool in problem-solving. It simplifies complex problems, provides a clear plan for coding, facilitates communication between programmers, and makes the coding process more efficient. It's an essential skill for any programmer and a crucial step in the problem-solving process.
