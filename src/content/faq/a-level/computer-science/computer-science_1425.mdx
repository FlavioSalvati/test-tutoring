The octal representation of the decimal number $431$ is $667$.

To convert a decimal number to its octal equivalent, we divide the decimal number by $8$ and record the remainder. This division process is repeated until the quotient becomes zero. The final octal number is obtained by reading the recorded remainders in reverse order.

Let's go through the conversion of the decimal number $431$ to octal step by step:

1. First, divide $431$ by $8$. The quotient is $53$ and the remainder is $7$.
   
   $$431 \div 8 = 53 \quad \text{remainder } 7$$

2. Next, take the quotient $53$ and divide it by $8$. The new quotient is $6$ and the remainder is $5$.
   
   $$53 \div 8 = 6 \quad \text{remainder } 5$$

3. Finally, divide the quotient $6$ by $8$. The new quotient is $0$ and the remainder is $6$.
   
   $$6 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 6$$

Now, we read the remainders in reverse order: $6$, $5$, $7$. Therefore, the octal representation of the decimal number $431$ is $667$.

This method, known as the "repeated division by $8$" technique, is a straightforward and efficient way to convert decimal numbers to octal. It is crucial to remember to read the remainders in reverse order to obtain the correct octal number.

Understanding this conversion process is fundamental in computer science, as various number systems are frequently used in different computing contexts. For instance, octal numbers are often employed in programming, especially in some older systems. Mastering the ability to convert between these numeral systems is an essential skill for any computer scientist.
