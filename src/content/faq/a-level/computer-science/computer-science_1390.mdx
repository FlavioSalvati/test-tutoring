A **syntax error** refers to a mistake in the structure of the code, while a **runtime error** occurs during the execution of the program.

### Syntax Errors

As the term suggests, a syntax error is directly related to the syntax or structure of the programming language. It arises when the rules governing the language are not adhered to correctly. For example, omitting a semicolon at the end of a statement in languages such as Java or C++, or failing to properly close a bracket, can lead to a syntax error. 

These errors are typically identified by the compiler or interpreter before the program is executed, preventing it from running until the issues are resolved. Syntax errors are usually easier to correct because the compiler or interpreter provides feedback regarding the location and nature of the error. Familiarity with these fundamental programming principles can be reinforced by practicing with correct syntax structures.

### Runtime Errors

Conversely, a runtime error occurs while the program is running, which is why it is referred to as a 'runtime' error. Unlike syntax errors, these issues are not detected by the compiler or interpreter during the compilation or interpretation phase; they only become visible when the program is executed. 

Runtime errors can arise from various situations, such as attempting to divide by zero, accessing a null object, or using a variable that has not been initialized. These errors can be more challenging to diagnose and fix compared to syntax errors, as they may not always be predictable, and pinpointing their causes can be more complex. Gaining a deeper understanding of programming logic can assist in anticipating and mitigating potential runtime errors. Furthermore, learning effective debugging techniques is crucial for ensuring software reliability and performance.

### Summary for A-Level Computer Science Students

In summary, a syntax error occurs when the code violates the rules of the programming language, such as missing a semicolon, preventing the program from running until it is corrected. In contrast, a runtime error happens during program execution due to issues like dividing by zero or using an uninitialized variable. Generally, syntax errors are easier to resolve than runtime errors.
