A subquery in SQL is a powerful tool that allows you to retrieve data that will be used as a condition in the main query, thereby further refining the data that is retrieved.

More specifically, a subquery—often referred to as a nested query or inner query—is a query embedded within the 'WHERE' or 'HAVING' clause of another SQL query. Its primary purpose is to return data that serves as a condition for the main query, helping to narrow down the results. Subqueries can be utilized with various SQL statements, including 'SELECT', 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', and 'DELETE', in conjunction with operators such as $=$, $<$, $>$, $\geq$, $\leq$, 'IN', and 'BETWEEN', among others.

Subqueries can yield either individual values or a collection of records. Depending on your data retrieval needs, you can tailor your subquery accordingly. For instance, if you need to find a single value, such as the maximum price of a product, your subquery will be designed to return just that single value. Conversely, if your goal is to identify all products priced above the average, your subquery will return a list of records.

There are two main types of subqueries in SQL: correlated and uncorrelated. An uncorrelated subquery executes once for the entire outer query and produces a value or a set of values independent of the outer query. In contrast, a correlated subquery is executed for each row processed by the outer query and depends on values from that outer query.

Subqueries can also be nested within other subqueries, up to a maximum of 32 levels deep. However, it is important to note that deeper nesting increases the complexity of the SQL statement, which can make it more challenging to read and debug.

In summary, subqueries are a robust feature of SQL that enable complex data manipulations within a single query. They can streamline your SQL code, making it more understandable and maintainable. However, it is essential to use them judiciously, as they can also add complexity and potentially affect performance.
