The big-O notation for the quicksort algorithm is $O(n \log n)$ in both the best and average cases, while it is $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.

Quicksort is a widely-used sorting algorithm that employs the divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently sort elements. Big-O notation serves to describe the performance or complexity of algorithms. In the context of quicksort, the time complexity is $O(n \log n)$ for both the best and average cases, whereas the worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

The best-case scenario occurs when the pivot element consistently represents the median of the array. In this scenario, each division of the array yields two equal halves, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$. This is because the algorithm divides the array into halves at each step, which requires $\log n$ steps, and it performs $n$ operations to identify the pivot at each iteration.

The average-case scenario also exhibits a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$. Even though the array splits may not be perfectly balanced, they remain reasonably equitable, leading to a time complexity similar to that of the best case.

Conversely, the worst-case scenario arises when the pivot element is either the smallest or the largest element in the array. In this case, the array is either not divided at all or is divided very unevenly, which results in a time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Here, the algorithm must traverse all $n$ elements at each of the $n$ steps.

It is essential to recognize that, despite the concerning nature of the worst-case time complexity, such scenarios are quite uncommon in practical applications, especially when the pivot is selected randomly. Consequently, quicksort is regarded as a highly efficient sorting algorithm in practice, even with its worst-case time complexity.
