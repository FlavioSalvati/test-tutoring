Abstract classes offer a partial implementation that can be shared among multiple subclasses, while interfaces solely declare methods without providing any implementation.

To elaborate, an **abstract class** in programming is a type of class that cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create an object from it. Instead, it is intended to serve as a base class for other classes to inherit from. Abstract classes can contain both **abstract methods** (methods that are declared without an implementation) and **concrete methods** (methods that have a defined implementation). This dual capability allows you to establish default behaviors for subclasses, which can be overridden if needed.

In contrast, an **interface** is a fully abstract construct that contains only abstract methods. This means it specifies method signatures without any implementation. Any class that implements an interface is required to provide an implementation for all its methods. Interfaces are useful for defining a contract or behavior that classes must adhere to. They are particularly advantageous when you want to ensure that unrelated classes implement the same methods, enabling them to be used interchangeably.

A significant distinction between abstract classes and interfaces is that a class can extend only one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces. This limitation arises because languages like Java and many other object-oriented programming languages do not support multiple inheritanceâ€”the ability for a class to inherit from more than one superclass. However, these languages do support multiple interface implementations, allowing a class to adopt behaviors from various sources.

Regarding when to use each construct, abstract classes are typically employed when you have a hierarchy of classes that share common behaviors, while also wanting to prevent direct instantiation of the superclass. On the other hand, interfaces are utilized when you want to ensure that any class using the interface implements specific methods, regardless of its position in the class hierarchy.

In conclusion, both abstract classes and interfaces serve to enforce certain behaviors in classes, but they do so in distinct ways and are suited for different scenarios. Understanding these differences is crucial for effectively utilizing them in your coding practices.
