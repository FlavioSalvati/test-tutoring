The decimal (or denary) representation of the hexadecimal number $F3$ is $243$.

Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, which means it utilizes sixteen distinct symbols to represent numbers. These symbols include the digits $0$ through $9$ and the letters $A$ through $F$, where $A$ corresponds to $10$, $B$ to $11$, $C$ to $12$, $D$ to $13$, $E$ to $14$, and $F$ to $15$.

The hexadecimal number $F3$ is a two-digit number, with $F$ as the first digit and $3$ as the second digit. To convert this hexadecimal number to decimal, we multiply each digit by $16$ raised to the power of its position, starting from $0$ on the right.

For the hexadecimal number $F3$, the conversion can be calculated as follows:

$$
F \, (15 \text{ in decimal}) \times 16^1 \, (16 \text{ to the power of } 1) = 240
$$

$$
3 \times 16^0 \, (16 \text{ to the power of } 0) = 3
$$

Adding these two results together yields the decimal equivalent of $F3$:

$$
240 + 3 = 243
$$

This conversion process is a fundamental concept in computer science, as different number systems are utilized in various contexts. For instance, hexadecimal is commonly employed in programming and digital electronics due to its compactness compared to binary, making it easier to convert back and forth. Mastering the conversion between these systems is an essential skill for any computer science student.
