Common algorithms for searching within graphs include Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search.

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It utilizes a stack data structure to remember the path it has taken, allowing it to return to the starting point when no further paths are available. DFS is commonly applied in applications such as topological sorting, scheduling problems, cycle detection in graphs, and pathfinding in maze puzzles.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, in contrast, is another graph traversal algorithm that examines all vertices at the current depth level before proceeding to the next level. BFS employs a queue data structure to track the vertices that need to be visited next. This algorithm is frequently used in shortest path problems, the serialization and deserialization of binary trees, and cycle detection in undirected graphs.

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is specifically designed to find the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights, resulting in a shortest path tree. This algorithm relies on a priority queue data structure and is utilized in various network routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System).

**A* Search** is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm renowned for its completeness, optimality, and efficiency. It employs a best-first search strategy to determine the least-cost path from a specified starting node to a designated goal node. A* Search is widely implemented in applications such as GPS navigation and video game pathfinding, where efficiently plotting a traversable route between multiple points is essential.

Each of these algorithms has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and the selection of an appropriate algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. For instance, if the goal is to determine the shortest path between two nodes, Dijkstra's Algorithm or A* Search would be the most suitable choices. Conversely, if the objective is to traverse the entire graph, either DFS or BFS may be more appropriate.
