The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is a fundamental technique used in computer science for traversing or searching tree and graph data structures. The algorithm begins at the root node (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. This means that DFS thoroughly investigates a node's child nodes before moving on to its sibling nodes.

DFS employs a stack data structure to track nodes that need to be revisited to explore their branches. The procedure is straightforward: you start by pushing the root node onto the stack. Then, you enter a loop where you pop a node from the stack and push all its neighboring nodes onto the stack. This process continues until the stack is empty.

However, itâ€™s essential to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited. This precaution is necessary because graphs can contain cycles, which could lead to revisiting the same node indefinitely. To prevent this, you mark nodes as visited when you encounter them, ensuring that only unvisited neighbors are pushed onto the stack.

DFS is a powerful algorithm with a variety of applications, including finding paths between two nodes, detecting cycles within a graph, and identifying strongly connected components. It is important to note that while DFS is effective for many problems, it is not the optimal choice for finding the shortest path between two nodes, as it may explore more nodes than required. For such scenarios, algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm are more appropriate.

In summary, the Depth-First Search algorithm systematically visits all the nodes in a graph, prioritizing depth over breadth. It utilizes a stack to manage the nodes to be visited next and backtracks when it encounters a node with no unvisited neighbors. DFS is a foundational algorithm in computer science, applicable to various problems in graph and tree structures.
