A suffix tree is a specialized data structure designed for efficient string matching and searching operations within a given text.

Also referred to as a PAT tree, a suffix tree is a compressed trie that contains all the suffixes of the given text as its keys, with their respective positions in the text serving as values. This structure is an invaluable resource in multiple domains of string manipulation and analysis, including pattern matching, data compression, and bioinformatics.

The primary function of a suffix tree in string matching is to facilitate quick searches for patterns within a text. Once the tree is constructed, one can determine whether a string pattern $P$ of length $m$ is a substring of the text in $O(m)$ time, which represents a significant improvement over naive search algorithms. This efficiency is achieved by traversing the tree from the root and following the path that corresponds to the pattern $P$. If such a path exists, then the pattern $P$ is indeed a substring of the text.

In addition to pattern matching, suffix trees can be employed to address a variety of string-related problems. For example, they can efficiently find the longest repeated substring, the longest common substring between two strings, and the longest palindrome within a string. Remarkably, all of these problems can be solved in linear time once the suffix tree for the text is constructed.

The construction of a suffix tree for a text of length $n$ can be accomplished in $O(n)$ time, thanks to Ukkonen's algorithm. This algorithm builds the tree incrementally by adding one character at a time from the text. After each character is added, the tree accurately represents all the suffixes of the text that have been read up to that point.

In summary, the suffix tree plays a crucial role in string matching by providing a data structure that supports efficient searching and the resolution of various string problems. It is an essential tool in computer science, particularly in fields where rapid and efficient string operations are critical.
