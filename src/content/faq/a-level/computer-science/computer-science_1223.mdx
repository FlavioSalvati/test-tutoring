Static RAM (SRAM) retains data bits in its memory as long as power is supplied, while Dynamic RAM (DRAM) requires periodic refreshing to maintain its stored information.

SRAM and DRAM are two distinct types of Random Access Memory (RAM) utilized in computing systems, differing in technology, speed, cost, and application.

SRAM employs flip-flop circuitry to store each bit, allowing it to retain data as long as the power supply is active. This design results in faster access times and greater reliability, but it also incurs higher costs due to the complexity of the circuitry involved. Each SRAM cell consists of six transistors, which contributes to its larger size and greater power consumption. Despite these drawbacks, its speed and reliability make SRAM ideal for cache memory in processors, where rapid data access is essential.

In contrast, DRAM stores each bit in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit. The charge level in the capacitor represents the data for that bit. However, since capacitors can leak charge, the stored information will dissipate unless the capacitor is refreshed periodically. This need for refreshing introduces a delay in access times for DRAM. Nonetheless, DRAM cells are simpler in design, consisting of just one capacitor and one transistor, making them smaller and less expensive to manufacture. Consequently, DRAM is commonly used for the main memory in computers, where large volumes of cost-effective memory are necessary.

In summary, SRAM and DRAM fulfill different roles within a computer system. SRAM, with its high speed and reliability, is employed in scenarios where performance is critical, such as in processor caches. Conversely, DRAM, being more economical and capable of storing greater amounts of data in a compact space, is utilized for the primary system memory. Understanding the distinctions between these two types of RAM is essential for grasping the architecture and performance characteristics of modern computing systems.
