The Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is a widely utilized cache management technique that prioritizes the eviction of the least recently accessed items first.

In essence, the LRU algorithm serves as a cache replacement policy designed to optimize memory management within a computer system. The underlying principle of LRU is that data which has been accessed most recently is likely to be accessed again in the near future. Therefore, when the cache reaches its capacity and a new item needs to be loaded, the LRU algorithm will remove the item that has not been accessed for the longest duration.

To effectively implement the LRU algorithm, it is necessary to keep track of the usage history of each item in the cache. This tracking can become computationally expensive, as it requires maintaining "age bits" for each cache line and determining which cache line is the least recently used based on these age bits. In such implementations, whenever a cache line is accessed, the age of all other cache lines must also be updated accordingly.

LRU encompasses a family of caching algorithms that includes variants such as 2Q, developed by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha, and LRU/K, created by Pat O'Neil, Betty O'Neil, and Gerhard Weikum. These algorithms aim to intelligently discern which data should remain in the cache and which should be discarded to accommodate new data, based on observed access patterns.

While the LRU algorithm is relatively straightforward to comprehend and implement, it may not be the optimal solution for every caching scenario. For instance, in cases where older items are more frequently accessed than newer ones, a Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm could be more advantageous. Nonetheless, for most general-purpose caching systems, LRU strikes a favorable balance between implementation complexity and overall performance.
