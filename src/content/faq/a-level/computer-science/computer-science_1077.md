The octal representation of the binary number $10101010$ is $252$.

To convert a binary number to its octal equivalent, we begin by grouping the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the rightmost digit (the least significant bit). If the total number of binary digits is not a multiple of three, we add zeros to the left (the most significant side) to complete the grouping.

For the binary number $10101010$, we can group the digits as follows: $001\,010\,101\,010$. Next, we convert each group into its octal equivalent. The conversions are as follows: $001$ corresponds to $1$, $010$ corresponds to $2$, and $101$ corresponds to $5$. Thus, the octal representation of the binary number $10101010$ is $1252$.

It's important to highlight that the leading zero in the octal number is typically omitted, resulting in the final octal representation being $252$. This conversion process is a fundamental concept in computer science, as it enables the representation of binary data in a more compact and readable format.

In summary, the key steps for converting binary to octal are to group the binary digits into sets of three and then convert each group into its corresponding octal value. This method is both straightforward and efficient, making it an essential tool for computer scientists and programmers.
