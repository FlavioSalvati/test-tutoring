Polymorphism in programming languages refers to the capability of a variable, function, or object to assume multiple forms.

More specifically, polymorphism is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables objects of various types to be treated as objects of a shared, more general type. The term is derived from the Greek words 'poly,' meaning many, and 'morph,' meaning forms. Therefore, polymorphism essentially signifies 'many forms.'

There are two primary types of polymorphism: compile-time (or static) polymorphism and runtime (or dynamic) polymorphism. Compile-time polymorphism is realized through function overloading and operator overloading. Function overloading permits the creation of multiple functions with the same name but differing parameters, whereas operator overloading allows the customization of how operators behave with user-defined types.

Conversely, runtime polymorphism is achieved through inheritance and interfaces. Inheritance enables a child class to inherit properties and methods from its parent class, while an interface establishes a contract that outlines what a class can do, without specifying how it will accomplish those tasks.

The advantages of polymorphism in programming include increased flexibility and reusability. It allows a single interface to manage a general class of actions, with the specific action determined by the precise context of the situation. For instance, consider a class named 'Shape' that contains a method called 'draw.' This method will function differently depending on whether the shape is a circle, square, triangle, etc. Importantly, the user does not need to know the specific type of shape they are interacting with; they simply invoke the 'draw' method, and the appropriate action is performed based on the shape's type.

In summary, polymorphism is a powerful concept in programming that fosters flexibility and reusability by enabling a single interface to represent a broad class of actions. It is a core tenet of object-oriented programming and is widely utilized across various programming languages.
