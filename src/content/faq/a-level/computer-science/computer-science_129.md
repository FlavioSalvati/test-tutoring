An operating system facilitates task switching via a mechanism known as context switching, which is orchestrated by the scheduler.

Context switching is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system, enabling it to manage multiple tasks or processes that operate concurrently on a single processor. This process gives the illusion that tasks are executing simultaneously, even though only one task is actually being processed at any given time.

The context switching process initiates when the operating system's scheduler determines that it needs to interrupt the currently running task. This decision can be influenced by various factors, such as the task's priority level, the duration of its execution, or the arrival of a task with a higher priority. Once a decision is made, the operating system saves the state of the current task, which includes the values of its CPU registers and the program counter, into a data structure known as a Process Control Block (PCB).

Subsequently, the operating system loads the PCB of the next task scheduled for execution. This PCB contains all the information necessary to resume the task, including the values of its CPU registers and program counter. The operating system then transfers these values into the CPU, effectively switching the context from the previous task to the new one. The new task resumes execution from the point where it was last interrupted.

This method of saving and loading PCBs enables the operating system to perform task switching quickly and efficiently. However, it is important to acknowledge that context switching incurs certain costs. It demands a considerable amount of processing power and, if not managed properly, can lead to performance degradation. Consequently, the operating system's scheduler must be carefully designed to minimize the frequency of context switches while ensuring that each task receives an equitable share of CPU time.

In conclusion, task switching in an operating system is accomplished through context switching, a process that involves saving the state of a currently running task and loading the state of the next task. This enables the CPU to transition between tasks seamlessly.
