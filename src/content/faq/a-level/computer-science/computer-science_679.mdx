Explicit type conversion in programming is performed manually by the programmer, whereas implicit conversion is managed automatically by the compiler.

To elaborate, explicit type conversion—often referred to as type casting—occurs when the programmer deliberately changes the data type of a value. This is typically accomplished using built-in functions or operators provided by the programming language. For instance, in Python, you can convert an integer to a string using the `str()` function, as follows: 

$$
\text{str}(123)
$$

This expression will yield `'123'`, which is the string representation of the integer $123$. Explicit type conversion is particularly useful when it is essential to ensure that a value conforms to a specific type, especially during operations that require particular data types.

In contrast, implicit type conversion—commonly known as type coercion—takes place when the compiler or interpreter automatically alters the data type of a value. This generally occurs when performing operations on values of differing types. In such cases, the compiler will convert one or both of the values to a common type that can accommodate the operation. For example, when adding a float and an integer in Python, such as:

$$
1.5 + 2
$$

the integer $2$ will be implicitly converted to a float, resulting in $3.5$. While implicit type conversion can simplify code writing, it may also lead to unexpected results if the programmer is not aware of this automatic conversion.

In summary, the primary distinction between explicit and implicit type conversion lies in who is responsible for the conversion: the programmer or the compiler. Both methods have their advantages and potential drawbacks, and a thorough understanding of these concepts is crucial for mastering a programming language.
