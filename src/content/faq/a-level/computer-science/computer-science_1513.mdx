A physical data structure refers to the actual organization of data in memory, whereas a logical data structure is the abstract representation of that data.

A physical data structure, often referred to as a storage structure, pertains to the specific arrangement of data within a computer's memory. It focuses on the methods of data storage and access at the hardware level, and is closely associated with the operating system and the file structures utilized. Physical data structures can take various forms, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. The choice of a particular physical data structure can greatly influence the efficiency of data access and manipulation, as each structure has its own strengths and weaknesses related to memory usage and processing speed.

Conversely, a logical data structure, sometimes called a data model, offers an abstract representation of data that is independent of its physical storage. This type of structure emphasizes how users interact with data and how various data elements relate to one another. Logical data structures are commonly represented as tables, graphs, trees, or other high-level models. They provide an intuitive and user-friendly way to organize and manipulate data, without requiring users to grasp the complexities of the underlying physical data structure.

For instance, consider a database that employs a logical data structure such as a relational model, where data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. However, the actual physical data structure used to store this information on disk could be a B-tree or a hash table, which are designed for efficient data retrieval and storage. To further enhance your understanding of data structuring within databases, explore the concept of logical and physical data structures in greater depth.
