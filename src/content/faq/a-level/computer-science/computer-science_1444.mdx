The primary function of a foreign key in a relational database is to establish a connection between two tables, thereby ensuring data integrity and consistency.

In relational databases, tables are interconnected through keys. Among these keys, the foreign key serves as a critical link; it is a field (or a combination of fields) in one table that references a specific record in another table. The table that contains the foreign key is known as the child table, while the table that includes the corresponding primary key is referred to as the parent table. Typically, the foreign key in the child table points to a primary key in the parent table.

The principal objective of a foreign key is to maintain data integrity and consistency across tables. It achieves this by enforcing constraints on the data. For instance, if a foreign key is established in an `Orders` table that references the `Customers` table, the database will prevent the addition of any orders that do not correspond to a valid customer. This enforcement of valid references is known as referential integrity.

Foreign keys are also essential in executing database queries, especially those that involve joining multiple tables. When a query is run that encompasses several tables, the database management system utilizes the relationships defined by the foreign keys to merge the data in a coherent manner. For example, a query might join the `Orders` and `Customers` tables to generate a list of all orders placed by a specific customer.

Moreover, foreign keys can facilitate the establishment of hierarchical relationships between tables. This capability is particularly beneficial in databases designed to model real-world systems where such relationships are prevalent. For instance, in a school database, a `Students` table might include a foreign key that refers to a `Classes` table, thereby creating a relationship in which each student is associated with a specific class.
