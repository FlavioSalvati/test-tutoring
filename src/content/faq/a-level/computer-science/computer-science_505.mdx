A gateway connects two distinct networks, while a router manages data traffic within or between networks.

A gateway is a node in a computer network that acts as an access point to another network. This often involves not only a change in addressing but also a transition to a different networking technology. For instance, a local area network (LAN) that employs IP addressing may connect to a wide area network (WAN) that utilizes a different addressing scheme. In this scenario, the gateway facilitates both the connection and the necessary translation. Gateways can operate at any layer of the OSI model, although they are most commonly associated with the network layer. They are capable of performing more complex functions than routers, such as protocol translation and data encryption or decryption.

Conversely, a router is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers are responsible for directing traffic on the Internet. Typically, a data packet is passed from one router to another across the interconnected networks until it reaches its intended destination. Routers operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and utilize IP addresses to determine the most efficient path for forwarding packets.

Although both gateways and routers are crucial for directing network traffic, they serve different functions. A router connects devices within a single network by forwarding data packets among them, whether in a small home network or a large corporate environment. In contrast, a gateway is more complex and acts as the 'door' between two networks, often necessitating changes in addressing or protocols.

In conclusion, while both routers and gateways play important roles in managing network traffic, they do so in distinct ways and contexts. Routers are primarily utilized to connect devices within a network, whereas gateways function as the connection point between two disparate networks.
