A stack can be effectively implemented using an array through the use of push and pop operations to respectively add and remove elements.

A stack is a linear data structure that operates on a specific principle, adhering to either the Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO) order. The primary operations associated with a stack include:

1. **Push**: This operation adds an element to the stack. A pointer, referred to as 'TOP', is utilized to keep track of the topmost element in the stack.
2. **Pop**: This operation removes an element from the stack, with elements being removed from the top.
3. **Peek (or Top)**: This operation retrieves the top element of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: This function checks if the stack is empty, returning 'true' if it is, and 'false' otherwise.

To implement a stack using an array, you must first initialize an array of a specified size, which will represent the maximum capacity of your stack. Additionally, you will need a variable (let's call it 'top') to monitor the index of the topmost element in the stack. This variable is initialized to $-1$, indicating that the stack is currently empty.

### Push Operation
When you wish to add (push) an element onto the stack, you first check whether the stack is full. This is done by verifying if 'top' is equal to the maximum size of the array minus one. If the stack is not full, you increment 'top' by $1$ and assign the new element to the array at the 'top' index.

### Pop Operation
To remove (pop) an element from the stack, you start by checking if the stack is empty. This is determined by checking if 'top' is equal to $-1$. If the stack is not empty, you can safely decrement 'top' by $1$ to remove the topmost element.

### Peek Operation
To access the top element of the stack (peek), you simply return the element located at the 'top' index of the array.

### isEmpty Operation
To ascertain whether the stack is empty, you check if 'top' is equal to $-1$. If it is, then the stack is indeed empty; otherwise, it contains elements.

This approach offers a straightforward and efficient method for implementing a stack data structure using an array.
