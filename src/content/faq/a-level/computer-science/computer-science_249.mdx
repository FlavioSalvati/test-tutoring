The RANK function in SQL is designed to assign a unique rank to each distinct row within a result set. 

As a window function, RANK provides a unique ranking for each row within a specified partition of the data. This function is particularly beneficial when you need to determine the relative rankings of rows based on certain criteria. It assigns a unique rank number to each distinct value, ensuring that rows with identical values receive the same rank. However, in cases where multiple rows share the same rank (a tie), the RANK function will skip subsequent rank numbers accordingly.

For instance, consider a table containing students and their corresponding test scores. By utilizing the RANK function, you can rank each student based on their score. If two students achieve the same score, they will be assigned the same rank, and the next student with a different score will receive the rank that follows the rank of the last tied score.

The syntax for the RANK function is as follows:

$$
\text{RANK}() \, \text{OVER} ( [ \text{partition\_by\_clause} ] \, \text{order\_by\_clause} )
$$

The `partition_by_clause` divides the result set generated by the FROM clause into distinct partitions, to which the RANK function is then applied. If omitted, the entire result set is treated as a single partition. The `order_by_clause` specifies the order in which the data within each partition is ranked. The first row in each partition is assigned a rank of $1$.

The RANK function is an invaluable tool in SQL, particularly when handling large datasets where manual ranking would be impractical. It facilitates the easy identification of both the highest and lowest values, and it can be combined with other SQL functions to create more intricate queries and analyses.
