IP addresses are allocated and managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and organizations such as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

The process of assigning and managing IP addresses is intricate and involves multiple entities. IANA is the global authority responsible for overseeing the IP address space. It allocates large blocks of IP addresses to five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) worldwide: 

- ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) for North America,
- RIPE NCC (Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre) for Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia,
- APNIC (Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre) for the Asia Pacific region,
- LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre) for Latin America and the Caribbean, and
- AFRINIC (African Network Information Centre) for Africa.

These RIRs subsequently distribute IP addresses to ISPs within their designated regions. ISPs then assign IP addresses to their customers, which may include individuals, businesses, and other organizations. This assignment can be either static or dynamic. 

- **Static IP addresses** are fixed and do not change; they are often used by servers or websites that require a consistent address.
- **Dynamic IP addresses**, in contrast, are temporary and can change each time a device connects to the internet. Most residential internet connections utilize dynamic IP addresses.

Additionally, some large organizations, such as universities, major corporations, and government entities, may possess their own dedicated blocks of IP addresses that they manage internally. These organizations typically employ network administrators responsible for overseeing the allocation and management of these IP addresses.

Furthermore, the introduction of IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) has dramatically expanded the number of available IP addresses. This expansion was essential due to the rapid growth of the internet and the depletion of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 utilizes a 128-bit address space, while IPv4 uses a 32-bit address space, which allows for an almost limitless number of unique IP addresses.

In summary, the assignment and management of IP addresses is a multi-layered process that involves global, regional, and local entities. It is a fundamental aspect of internet functionality, enabling devices to communicate and share information effectively.
