A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element, referred to as a node, points to the next element in the sequence.

A singly linked list consists of nodes, each containing two components: the data itself and a reference (or link) to the subsequent node in the sequence. This structure enables efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position during traversal.

The starting point of a linked list is known as the head. It is important to note that the first node does not have a preceding node, while the last node lacks a following node. The last node in the list is identified by its next reference pointing to NULL.

To traverse a singly linked list, you begin at the head node and follow the references to each subsequent node until you reach the end, which is indicated by NULL. When adding an element to the list, a new node is created, its reference is set to point to the next node, and the reference of the previous node is updated to point to this new node. Conversely, to remove an element, you simply modify the reference of the previous node to bypass the current node and link directly to the next node.

One of the primary advantages of a singly linked list is its support for dynamic memory allocation. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size determined at compile time, linked lists can expand or contract as needed at runtime. However, they do come with certain drawbacks. For example, they incur greater overhead due to the storage of additional next references. Additionally, direct access to individual elements is not possible; to access a specific element, one must start at the head and follow the references sequentially.

In summary, a singly linked list is a straightforward yet powerful data structure that is particularly advantageous when frequent addition and removal of elements are required, and when the maximum number of elements is unknown in advance.
