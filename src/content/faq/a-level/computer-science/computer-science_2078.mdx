A Hilbert R-tree is a type of data structure used in spatial indexing to organise multi-dimensional information.

The Hilbert R-tree is a variant of the R-tree, a tree data structure used for spatial access methods i.e., for indexing multi-dimensional information such as geographical coordinates, rectangles or polygons. The R-tree was proposed by Antonin Guttman in 1984 as an extension of the B-tree for multi-dimensional data. The Hilbert R-tree, introduced by Ibrahim Kamel and Christos Faloutsos in 1994, improves upon the R-tree by ordering the data using the Hilbert curve, a continuous fractal space-filling curve.

The Hilbert curve maps the multi-dimensional data to one dimension while preserving locality of the data points. This means that points that are close together in the multi-dimensional space will also be close together on the curve. This property is very useful in spatial indexing as it allows for efficient range queries and nearest neighbour searches.

The Hilbert R-tree organises the data into a hierarchical structure, where each node in the tree represents a bounding box that contains a certain number of data points or other bounding boxes. The tree is constructed by inserting the data points one by one, following the order given by the Hilbert value of the centre of their bounding box. This results in a balanced tree where each leaf node contains a similar number of points.

In terms of its application, the Hilbert R-tree is widely used in spatial databases and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for tasks such as map overlay, spatial join and range search. It is also used in computer graphics for efficient collision detection, in network routing for scalable multicast and in data mining for clustering high-dimensional data.

In summary, the Hilbert R-tree is a powerful tool for spatial indexing, providing an efficient way to organise and search multi-dimensional data. Its use of the Hilbert curve to order the data ensures good spatial locality, resulting in improved query performance compared to other spatial indexing methods.
