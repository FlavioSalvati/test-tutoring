Solid State Drives (SSDs) leverage NAND flash memory to store data persistently, even when the power is turned off. This type of storage technology is classified as non-volatile, meaning it retains data without the need for electrical power. When you save data to an SSD, it is written directly to the NAND flash memory, and when you need to retrieve that data, the SSD reads it from the same memory.

NAND flash memory is structured into cells, which represent the smallest units capable of storing data. These cells are further organized into pages, the smallest units that can be written to or read from. Pages are then grouped into blocks, which are the smallest units that can be erased. This hierarchical organization enables SSDs to manage data efficiently.

When data is written to an SSD, it is stored in the cells within the pages. If a page is only partially filled, the SSD can still utilize the remaining space for additional data. However, once a page becomes full, the SSD must write new data to a different page. Similarly, if a block is full, the SSD must erase it before new data can be written. This process is referred to as garbage collection, and it can affect both the performance and the lifespan of the SSD.

To enhance performance, SSDs implement a technique known as wear leveling. This technique distributes write operations evenly across the physical drive. Given that each cell in NAND flash memory has a finite lifespan, wear leveling helps to prolong the overall longevity of the SSD.

Additionally, SSDs incorporate a form of error correction code (ECC) to maintain data integrity. ECC verifies the data as it is read from the NAND flash memory and corrects any errors detected. This is particularly important because NAND flash memory cells can degrade over time, potentially leading to data corruption.

In summary, SSDs utilize NAND flash memory to deliver fast, reliable, and persistent data storage. They employ a variety of techniques, including garbage collection, wear leveling, and error correction, to optimize performance and safeguard data integrity.
