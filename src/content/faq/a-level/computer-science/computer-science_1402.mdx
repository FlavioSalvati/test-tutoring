FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a widely recognized network protocol utilized for transferring computer files between a client and a server over a computer network.

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) consists of a series of rules that computers adhere to when transferring files from one system to another via the internet. It is an integral part of the TCP/IP protocol suite and operates on a client-server model for data exchange. In this model, the client initiates a connection to the server, which hosts the files. Upon receiving the connection request, the server responds and establishes a communication link with the client. Once the connection is successfully set up, files can be transmitted between the two parties.

FTP uses two distinct channels for its operations: the command channel and the data channel. The command channel is responsible for managing the connection and transmitting commands between the client and the server. Conversely, the data channel is dedicated to the actual file transfer process.

There are two operational modes in FTP: active mode and passive mode. In active mode, the client opens a port and listens for incoming connections, while the server actively connects to the client's port. In contrast, passive mode sees the server open a port and wait for the client to connect to it. This mode is particularly useful when the client is behind a firewall and cannot accept incoming connections.

Additionally, FTP supports secure file transfers through protocols such as FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol). FTPS enhances the standard FTP by incorporating support for cryptographic protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). On the other hand, SFTP employs Secure Shell (SSH) to facilitate file transfers. Unlike FTPS, SFTP encrypts both commands and data, effectively safeguarding against common network security threats.

In conclusion, FTP is a robust, reliable, and secure method for transferring files over a network. It plays a crucial role in the realm of networking and is extensively used in various applications, including web hosting, file sharing, and certain aspects of cloud storage.
