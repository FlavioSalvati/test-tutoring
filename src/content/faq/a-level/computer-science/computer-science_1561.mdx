Partial application in functional programming refers to the technique of fixing a subset of the arguments of a function, thereby generating a new function with a reduced arity.

To elaborate, functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as results from functions, and assigned to variables. One of the most powerful techniques within this paradigm is partial application.

In partial application, you create a new function by pre-setting, or "fixing," some of the arguments of an existing function. The outcome is a new function that no longer requires those fixed arguments. Consequently, the new function has a smaller arity, meaning it accepts fewer arguments than the original function.

For instance, consider a simple function defined to add two numbers together. By employing partial application, you could construct a new function that has one of the numbers preset. This newly created function would then only require a single argument: the second number to be added to the previously fixed number.

This technique proves particularly beneficial when dealing with functions that accept multiple arguments, especially when certain values are known in advance. By utilizing partial application, you can simplify your code and enhance its readability. Moreover, it enables you to derive specialized functions from more general ones.

In summary, partial application empowers you to manage the complexity of your functions and your code. It is a valuable asset in the functional programmer's toolkit, and mastering this concept can significantly improve your ability to write clean, efficient, and effective code.
