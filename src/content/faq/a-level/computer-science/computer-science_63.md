A binary tree is a type of tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children. These children are typically referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node of the tree is called the root. Every node in a binary tree has a parent node and can have zero, one, or two child nodes. Nodes that do not have any children are known as leaf nodes. Importantly, a binary tree does not impose any specific order on the arrangement of its elements or nodes.

In contrast, a binary search tree (BST) is a specialized form of a binary tree. While it adheres to the rule that each parent node can have at most two children, it introduces an additional constraint regarding the organization of the nodes. Specifically, in a binary search tree, for every node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node itself, and all elements in its right subtree are greater. This characteristic makes binary search trees particularly valuable in search algorithms, as they facilitate efficient operations for searching, inserting, and deleting elements.

In summary, both binary trees and binary search trees are tree-based data structures that exhibit a hierarchical structure. However, the key distinction between them lies in the arrangement of the nodes. Binary trees do not enforce any ordering rules, whereas binary search trees do. This ordered structure in binary search trees is what enhances their utility in various algorithms and operations, especially those that involve searching or sorting. Understanding these differences is essential for selecting the most appropriate data structure for specific needs in computer science.
