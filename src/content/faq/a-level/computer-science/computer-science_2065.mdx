A range tree is a specialized data structure designed for efficient range queries and nearest neighbor searches in geometric contexts.

At its core, a range tree is a balanced binary search tree constructed from a set of one-dimensional points. As a form of space-partitioning data structure, it organizes points in a multi-dimensional space. Range trees are particularly valuable in computational geometry, where they facilitate the resolution of problems such as range searching and nearest neighbor searching.

In a range tree, each node contains a point and a pointer to a secondary tree that holds all points within a specific range. The primary tree is organized based on the $x$-coordinates of the points, while each secondary tree is structured around the $y$-coordinates of the points that fall within the corresponding $x$-range. This hierarchical organization allows for efficient range queries: to retrieve all points within a specified range, one first traverses the primary tree to identify the $x$-range, and then explores the secondary trees to pinpoint the $y$-range.

The construction of a range tree entails sorting the points according to their $x$-coordinates and recursively building a balanced binary search tree. Each node in the tree not only stores a point but also maintains a pointer to a secondary tree, which is similarly constructed based on the $y$-coordinates of the points. This methodology can be extended to higher dimensions by creating additional trees for $z$-coordinates, $w$-coordinates, and beyond.

Range trees are especially beneficial in geometric problems because they enable efficient execution of range queries and nearest neighbor searches. A range query seeks to identify all points within a specified range, while a nearest neighbor search finds the point closest to a given reference point. By organizing points in a multi-dimensional space, range trees significantly enhance the efficiency of these operations compared to simpler data structures like lists or arrays.

In summary, a range tree is a powerful asset in the field of computational geometry, offering an effective means of managing range queries and nearest neighbor searches. Its structured approach allows for rapid access to points in multi-dimensional space, making it an indispensable tool for tackling a wide array of geometric challenges.
