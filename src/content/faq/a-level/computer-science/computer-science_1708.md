Analog signals are continuous waveforms, while digital signals are discrete and represent data in binary format.

Analog signals are characterized by their continuous nature, changing smoothly over time. They can take on any value within a specified range, allowing them to represent information with a high degree of accuracy. However, this continuous representation also makes analog signals more vulnerable to noise and distortion. In communication systems, analog signals are commonly used for voice transmission because they can accurately capture the continuous variations in sound pressure that constitute human speech.

In contrast, digital signals are discrete, meaning they convey information in a binary formatâ€”specifically, ones and zeros. Unlike analog signals, digital signals do not change continuously but instead transition in distinct steps. Each of these steps corresponds to a specific value, which can effectively represent data. As a result of their discrete nature, digital signals are less susceptible to noise and distortion compared to their analog counterparts. Furthermore, they can be easily processed and stored by computers, making them particularly well-suited for data transmission.

The primary distinction between analog and digital signals lies in how they represent information. Analog signals can provide a more detailed and accurate depiction of information since they can assume any value within a defined range. However, this capability also renders them more sensitive to noise and distortion, as even minor changes in the signal can alter the information being conveyed.

On the other hand, digital signals convey information in a binary format. While this representation may be less detailed and precise than that of analog signals, it also makes digital signals more robust against noise and distortion. Their compatibility with digital processing and storage further enhances their utility, particularly in contemporary communication systems.

In summary, while analog signals provide a more accurate representation of information, they are more prone to noise and distortion. Digital signals, although somewhat less accurate, offer greater robustness and are easier to process, making them the preferred choice for data transmission in modern communication systems.
