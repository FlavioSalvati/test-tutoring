Abstract classes and interfaces are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, each serving distinct purposes in the design of software systems. 

An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated, meaning you cannot directly create an object from it. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for other classes, which can extend the abstract class. Abstract classes can contain both abstract methods, which are declared without an implementation, and concrete methods, which have a defined implementation. This feature allows abstract classes to provide default behavior that can be overridden by subclasses if needed.

In contrast, an **interface** is a completely abstract type that contains only abstract methods—methods that are declared but not implemented. Any class that implements an interface is required to provide concrete implementations for all of its methods. Interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to, making them especially useful for ensuring that unrelated classes implement the same methods, which facilitates their interchangeability.

One significant distinction between abstract classes and interfaces is the inheritance model. A class can extend only one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces. This limitation arises because many object-oriented programming languages, including Java, do not support multiple inheritance—the ability of a class to inherit from more than one superclass. However, they do allow a class to implement multiple interfaces, enabling it to inherit behavior from various sources.

When deciding whether to use an abstract class or an interface, consider the following: abstract classes are typically employed when there is a hierarchy of classes that share common behavior but where instantiation of the superclass should be prevented. In contrast, interfaces are best utilized when you want to ensure that specific methods will be implemented by any class that uses the interface, regardless of its position in the class hierarchy.

In conclusion, both abstract classes and interfaces serve to enforce certain behaviors in classes, yet they do so in different manners and are suited for different situations. A clear understanding of these differences is essential for effective software design and implementation.
