A **clustered index** determines the physical order of data within a table, whereas a **non-clustered index** does not influence the physical arrangement of data.

A clustered index is a type of index that rearranges how records are physically stored in the table. Consequently, a table can have only one clustered index. In this structure, the leaf nodes of the clustered index contain the actual data pages. Essentially, this means that the clustered index is synonymous with the table itself, which is why it is often termed an *index-organized table*. When querying a table with a clustered index, the database can retrieve data more efficiently because it knows precisely where to locate it. However, since the data is physically reordered, operations that require significant data movement can experience slower performance.

In contrast, a non-clustered index is a specialized type of index where the logical order of the index does not correspond to the physical storage order of the rows on disk. The leaf nodes of a non-clustered index do not contain the data pages; instead, they consist of index rows. Each index row comprises the non-clustered key value along with one or more row locators that point to the corresponding data row containing that key value. This means that the actual data rows can be dispersed throughout the table, independent of the indexed column(s). You can create multiple non-clustered indexes on a table, which can enhance the speed of data retrieval. However, these indexes also consume additional storage space and may reduce the speed of write operations.

In summary, the primary distinction between a clustered index and a non-clustered index lies in how they store and organize data. A clustered index sorts and stores the data rows in the table based on their key values, while a non-clustered index maintains a separate record of this data. This allows for greater flexibility but comes with the trade-offs of increased storage requirements and potential reductions in write performance.
