The `CONCAT` function in SQL is designed to join two or more strings into a single string.

This built-in function is particularly useful when you need to merge data from different columns or combine multiple strings to generate a new string. The syntax for the `CONCAT` function is quite simple: you use the keyword `CONCAT`, followed by the strings you wish to combine enclosed in parentheses, and separated by commas.

For instance, consider a table named `customers` that contains separate columns for `first_name` and `last_name`. If you want to create a new column that displays the full name of each customer, you can utilize the `CONCAT` function as follows:

$$
\text{SELECT CONCAT(first\_name, ' ', last\_name) AS 'Full Name' FROM customers;}
$$

In this example, `first_name` and `last_name` represent the columns being combined, while the string `' '` adds a space between the first and last names in the resulting `Full Name` column. The `AS` keyword allows you to assign a name to this new column.

It's worth noting that the `CONCAT` function can accept an arbitrary number of arguments. These arguments can include any string value, such as column names, string literals, or even the results of other functions. For example, you could combine a static string with a column value as shown below:

$$
\text{SELECT CONCAT('Customer: ', first\_name) AS 'Customer Name' FROM customers;}
$$

In this case, the static string `'Customer: '` is concatenated with the value from the `first_name` column for each row in the `customers` table.

Keep in mind that the `CONCAT` function returns a new string that results from merging all the provided input strings. If any of the input strings are `NULL`, `CONCAT` will treat them as empty strings. This is a particularly beneficial feature, as it allows you to use `CONCAT` without the concern of `NULL` values causing errors in your SQL queries.
