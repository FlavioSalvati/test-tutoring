A dynamic array is a versatile data structure that can automatically adjust its size as elements are added or removed.

Also referred to as an array list, a dynamic array differs from a static array in that it has a variable size. This allows for the addition or removal of elements after the initial creation of the array. In contrast, a static array has a fixed size determined at compile time, requiring the programmer to specify the size upfront. The flexibility of a dynamic array eliminates the need for predefining its size.

The mechanism of a dynamic array involves allocating memory for a larger array when the current one reaches its capacity. When an attempt is made to add an element to a full dynamic array, the array will allocate a new, larger array in memory. It then copies all existing elements from the old array to the new one and finally includes the new element. This operation is commonly referred to as 'resizing' or 'reallocating'.

Typically, the size of the new array is a multiple of the old array's size. This strategy helps minimize the frequency of resizing operations, which can be computationally expensive. However, this may result in a dynamic array using more memory than a static array, as it can contain unused 'slots'.

When elements are removed from a dynamic array, there may be a reduction in its size to reclaim memory. However, this process is less common due to the high cost associated with shrinking an array. Additionally, frequent resizing could lead to inefficiencies if new elements are added shortly after.

In summary, a dynamic array is a flexible data structure capable of adjusting its size as needed. It achieves this by creating a new, larger array when the current one is full and may shrink when elements are removed. While dynamic arrays are powerful tools in programming, it is crucial to consider the potential memory and computational costs involved with resizing operations.
