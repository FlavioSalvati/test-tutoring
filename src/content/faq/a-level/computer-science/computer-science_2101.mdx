The flash sort algorithm is an efficient sorting technique that organizes numbers by distributing them into different buckets and then sorting each bucket individually.

Flash sort is classified as a distribution sort algorithm. This means that it sorts numbers by allocating them into several 'buckets.' The process begins with the selection of a specific number of 'pivots,' which are used to segment the range of numbers into equal intervals. Typically, the number of pivots is approximately equal to the cube root of the total number of elements to be sorted, denoted as $n$, so the number of pivots is roughly $n^{1/3}$.

After the pivots have been established, the algorithm distributes the numbers into the corresponding buckets based on their values. For instance, if the pivots are $10$, $20$, and $30$, then the number $15$ would be placed in the second bucket, since it lies between $10$ and $20$.

Once all the numbers have been assigned to their respective buckets, the algorithm sorts each bucket individually. This sorting is typically performed using an efficient algorithm such as quicksort or heapsort. These algorithms excel at sorting smaller lists, which is advantageous because each bucket generally contains only a limited number of elements.

After sorting all the buckets, the algorithm merges them to create the final sorted list. This merging process involves appending each bucket sequentially to the end of the previous one. Since each bucket is already sorted and the buckets themselves are arranged according to their pivot values, the concatenated final list will also be sorted.

Flash sort demonstrates particularly high efficiency when the numbers being sorted are uniformly distributed across the range. Under these conditions, the algorithm can achieve sorting in linear time, which is faster than any comparison-based sorting algorithm. However, if the numbers exhibit a non-uniform distribution, the algorithm's performance may degrade significantly, potentially reaching quadratic time in the worst-case scenario.
