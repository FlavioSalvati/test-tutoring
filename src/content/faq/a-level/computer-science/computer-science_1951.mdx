In a computer system, irrational numbers are typically represented as floating-point numbers.

To elaborate, an irrational number cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. It features non-repeating and non-terminating decimal expansions. Notable examples of irrational numbers include $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, and Euler's number $e$. These numbers have decimal representations that extend infinitely without repeating. However, due to the limitations of finite memory in computers, it is impossible to store an infinite number of digits. Consequently, a method for representing these numbers in a finite manner is necessary.

The most prevalent technique for representing irrational numbers in computer systems is floating-point representation. This system consists of two main components: a significand (also known as the mantissa) and an exponent. A number is computed as the significand multiplied by the base (usually $2$) raised to the power of the exponent. This approach allows for a broad range of values and precision levels, although it is inherently imprecise. The precision of a floating-point number is constrained by the number of bits allocated for its storage.

For instance, in most systems, a double-precision floating-point number utilizes $64$ bits: $1$ bit for the sign, $11$ bits for the exponent, and $52$ bits for the significand. This configuration provides approximately $15$ to $17$ decimal digits of precision. Thus, while the representation is not exact, it is generally sufficient for most practical applications.

It is important to recognize that not all irrational numbers can be represented exactly, even using floating-point numbers. For example, the number $\pi$ is often approximated as $3.14159$ in various calculations. Nevertheless, many computer systems and programming languages offer built-in constants for common irrational numbers like $\pi$ and $e$, which are represented as floating-point numbers with the highest precision possible for the system.

In conclusion, while it is impossible to represent irrational numbers exactly in a computer system due to their infinite nature, floating-point representation offers a practical and widely adopted solution.
