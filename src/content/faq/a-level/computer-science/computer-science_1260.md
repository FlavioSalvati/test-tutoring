Linkers play a vital role in the execution of programs by managing the relocation of code and data segments, allowing these segments to run at different memory locations.

To elaborate, linkers are responsible for combining various segments of code and data into a single executable file that can be loaded into memory for execution. A key function of the linker is to handle the relocation of these segments. This is essential because the memory address at which a program is loaded may vary each time it is executed.

Relocation involves adjusting the absolute addresses of code and data segments so they can be accurately referenced during runtime. This process is known as 'relocation linking'. The linker maintains a relocation table, where each entry corresponds to a specific symbol in the program. Symbols can include variables, functions, or any identifiable pieces of code or data. Each entry in the relocation table contains crucial information about the symbol, including its name, its original location in the code, and the type of relocation needed.

When a program is loaded into memory, the linker utilizes the relocation table to modify the addresses of the symbols. This adjustment involves adding the base address of the memory location where the program is loaded to the original address of each symbol. The result is a new, relocated address that accurately points to the symbol's new location in memory.

Additionally, the linker must update all references to these symbols within the code. This is achieved by scanning through the code and replacing each symbol reference with its newly relocated address. This process guarantees that the code correctly references the relocated symbols, regardless of the program's loading position in memory.

In summary, the linker is responsible for managing relocation during program execution by adjusting the absolute addresses of code and data segments and updating the corresponding references in the code. This functionality allows programs to execute correctly at various memory locations, enhancing both flexibility and efficiency in program execution.
