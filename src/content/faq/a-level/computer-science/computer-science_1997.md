A complete binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is fully filled with nodes.

A binary tree is a data structure where each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. A complete binary tree is a special category of binary trees characterized by specific properties. In a complete binary tree, all levels are completely filled with nodes, except for the last level, which is filled in a left-to-right manner. This means that when examining the tree level by level, you will observe that each level is completely occupied by nodes until reaching the last level.

One of the fundamental properties of a complete binary tree is its height. The height of a complete binary tree is always minimized for a given number of nodes. This is because the tree is populated from the root down to the leaves, filling each level sequentially. Specifically, the height of a complete binary tree with $n$ nodes is given by $\lfloor \log_2(n + 1) \rfloor$, where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.

Another significant property of complete binary trees is that they are inherently balanced. A balanced tree is one in which the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node does not exceed one. This characteristic facilitates efficient operations, such as insertion, deletion, and search, within a complete binary tree.

Regarding representation, complete binary trees are commonly represented using arrays. This is advantageous because the structure of a complete binary tree ensures that there are no gaps in the array representation. For a node located at index $i$ in the array, the left child can be found at index $2i + 1$, and the right child is located at index $2i + 2$. Conversely, the parent of a node at index $i$ can be calculated using the formula $\lfloor (i - 1) / 2 \rfloor$.

In summary, a complete binary tree is a specialized type of binary tree that is fully populated except for the last level, which is filled from left to right. Its distinct properties make it efficient for various operations and well-suited for array-based representations.
