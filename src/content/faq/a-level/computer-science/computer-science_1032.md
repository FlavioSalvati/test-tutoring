The process of converting a binary number to decimal involves multiplying each binary digit by $2$ raised to the power of its positional value, and then summing all the resulting products.

To convert a binary number to a decimal number, you begin with the rightmost digit (known as the least significant bit) and proceed to the left. Each digit is multiplied by $2$ raised to the power of its position, starting from $0$. The total of these products yields the decimal equivalent of the binary number.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Consider the binary number $1011$. Starting from the rightmost digit, we analyze each digit as follows:

- For the rightmost digit: 
  $$1 \times 2^0 = 1$$
  
- For the next digit to the left: 
  $$1 \times 2^1 = 2$$
  
- For the following digit: 
  $$0 \times 2^2 = 0$$
  
- For the leftmost digit: 
  $$1 \times 2^3 = 8$$

Now, we sum these products to find the decimal value:

$$1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 11$$

Thus, the decimal equivalent of the binary number $1011$ is $11$.

This method is applicable to any binary number, regardless of its size. The key concept to remember is that each digit in a binary number corresponds to a power of $2$, starting from $2^0$ on the right and increasing by one power as you move left. This is why binary numbers are referred to as base-2 numbers: each digit represents a multiple of a power of $2$.

It is also important to note that this process is the inverse of converting a decimal number to binary. When converting from decimal to binary, you divide the decimal number by $2$ and record the remainder until you reach $0$. The binary equivalent is then obtained by reading the string of remainders in reverse order. Therefore, understanding how to convert between binary and decimal enhances your comprehension of the relationship between these two numeral systems.
