Unicode is a more extensive character set than ASCII, capable of representing a broader array of characters and symbols.

ASCII, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard developed in the 1960s. It utilizes $7$ bits to represent each character, allowing for a total of $128$ distinct characters. This set includes the English alphabet (both uppercase and lowercase letters), the digits from $0$ to $9$, and a selection of punctuation marks and special symbols. However, ASCII is limited as it can only represent characters used in the English language.

In contrast, Unicode is a modern and comprehensive character encoding standard created to address the limitations of ASCII and other similar systems. Unicode employs between $8$ and $32$ bits to represent each character, enabling it to encompass over $1,000,000$ distinct characters. This extensive repertoire includes all characters represented by ASCII, as well as characters from virtually every written language around the globe, along with a wide variety of symbols, emojis, and other special characters.

Beyond its greater character range, Unicode offers several additional advantages over ASCII. For instance, it provides a consistent method for encoding characters, independent of the platform, program, or language in use. This feature significantly simplifies the sharing and display of text across diverse systems and applications. Furthermore, Unicode supports 'combining characters,' which are characters that can be combined with others to form new characters. This capability is particularly advantageous for representing languages that utilize diacritical marks, such as accents and tildes.

In summary, while ASCII sufficed during the early days of computing when English was the predominant language, the global nature of today's digital landscape necessitates a more versatile character encoding system. Unicode meets this demand by offering a comprehensive, consistent, and flexible approach to representing a wide variety of characters and symbols.
