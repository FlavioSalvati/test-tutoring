A stack is an essential data structure used in recursive function calls to keep track of the function calls and their intermediate results.

To elaborate, a stack operates on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently added item is the first one to be removed. When a recursive function is invoked, the computer utilizes a stack to remember which function call it is currently processing. Each time the function is called, a new stack frame is generated and pushed onto the top of the stack. This stack frame contains crucial information, including the function's local variables, parameters, and the return address.

The return address is particularly significant; it indicates where the computer should return after the function has finished executing. This is especially critical in recursion, where a function may call itself multiple times, forming a chain of function calls. Each call must be aware of where to go back to upon completion.

Upon completion of a function call, its stack frame is removed from the stack, and control transfers back to the address specified in the return address of the now topmost stack frame. This process continues until all function calls are completed and the stack is empty.

Furthermore, the stack plays a vital role in managing the intermediate results of these function calls. For instance, when calculating the factorial of a number recursively, each invocation computes a portion of the factorial and stores the result on the stack. Once the base case is reached and the recursion starts to unwind, these partial results are popped off the stack and combined to yield the final result. 

To gain a deeper understanding of how stacks function in computing, further exploration is recommended.
