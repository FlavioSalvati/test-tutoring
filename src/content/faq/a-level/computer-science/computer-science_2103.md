An X-tree is a spatial access method that supports high-dimensional data by dynamically adapting its structure to the data distribution.

The X-tree (eXtended Node Tree) is a type of index structure specifically designed to handle high-dimensional data. It was developed to overcome the 'curse of dimensionality' problem, which refers to the difficulty of organising and searching data in high-dimensional spaces. The X-tree achieves this by dynamically adapting its structure to the data distribution, which makes it particularly effective for handling large amounts of high-dimensional data.

The X-tree structure is similar to a B-tree, but with some key differences. Like a B-tree, an X-tree is a balanced tree structure, meaning that all leaf nodes are at the same depth. However, instead of splitting nodes along a single dimension as in a B-tree, the X-tree splits nodes along multiple dimensions. This multi-dimensional splitting is what allows the X-tree to effectively handle high-dimensional data.

The X-tree uses a concept called 'overlapping regions' to manage high-dimensional data. When the data in a node exceeds the node's capacity, the X-tree splits the node into two new nodes. However, instead of splitting the node along a single dimension, the X-tree splits the node along multiple dimensions, creating overlapping regions. These overlapping regions allow the X-tree to maintain a balanced tree structure while also effectively managing high-dimensional data.

Another key feature of the X-tree is its use of 'supernodes'. When a node split would result in a high degree of overlap, the X-tree creates a supernode instead. A supernode is a node that can store more data than a regular node. By using supernodes, the X-tree can avoid unnecessary node splits and reduce the amount of overlap in the tree.

In summary, the X-tree is a spatial access method that supports high-dimensional data by dynamically adapting its structure to the data distribution. Its use of multi-dimensional splitting, overlapping regions, and supernodes allows it to effectively manage and search high-dimensional data.
