Database locks can be classified into two primary categories: shared locks and exclusive locks.

**Shared Locks**  
Shared locks are utilized when a database operation requires reading a resource without modifying it. This lock type permits multiple transactions to read (i.e., select) the same resource simultaneously while preventing any modifications. While a shared lock is active on a resource, no other transaction can obtain an exclusive lock (also known as a write lock) for that resource. This mechanism ensures that multiple transactions can access the resource for reading without risking any inconsistency or alteration, thus preserving the integrity of the database.

**Exclusive Locks**  
Conversely, exclusive locks are employed when a database operation necessitates both reading and modifying a resource. When a transaction secures an exclusive lock on a resource, it effectively prevents any other transaction from acquiring either a shared lock or another exclusive lock on that same resource. This restriction grants the transaction holding the exclusive lock sole access for both reading and writing. The use of exclusive locks is crucial for ensuring that no other transaction can interfere with or read from a resource being modified, thereby avoiding potential inconsistencies and conflicts.

In addition to shared and exclusive locks, there are other specialized types of locks that serve specific purposes:

- **Update Locks**: These locks are a distinct type used when a transaction needs to read a resource with the intention of modifying it in the future. By acquiring an update lock, a transaction prevents other transactions from obtaining an exclusive lock on the resource, which helps to mitigate the risk of deadlocks.

- **Intent Locks**: Intent locks are used to establish a locking hierarchy within the database. They signal that a transaction intends to acquire locks at a lower level of the hierarchy. For instance, a transaction may obtain an intent lock on a table to indicate that it will subsequently lock a specific row within that table.

- **Schema Locks**: These locks are employed during operations that involve changes to the database schema, such as adding or removing tables. Schema locks prevent other transactions from accessing the database schema while it is being altered, ensuring that structural changes do not cause inconsistencies.

By understanding these different types of locks, database administrators can effectively manage concurrency and maintain the integrity of the database during transactions.
