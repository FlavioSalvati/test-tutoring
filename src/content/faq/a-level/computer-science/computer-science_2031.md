A queue can be effectively implemented using a linked list by adding elements at the end and removing them from the front.

A queue is a fundamental data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This principle states that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. In a linked list, each node points to the next node, allowing for a dynamic and flexible structure.

To implement a queue with a linked list, two pointers are necessary: one for the front of the queue and one for the rear. The front pointer is utilized for removing elements, while the rear pointer is responsible for adding elements.

When an element is added to the queue (a process known as enqueuing), it is placed at the end of the queue. This is achieved by creating a new node, assigning its value to the element being added, and then updating the 'next' pointer of the current last node to reference this new node. Subsequently, the rear pointer is updated to point to this newly added node.

When an element is removed from the queue (a process known as dequeuing), it is taken from the front. This is accomplished by moving the front pointer to the next node in the linked list. The node that was previously at the front is no longer referenced by the queue and can be safely deleted.

It is crucial to handle scenarios where the queue is empty. When adding an element to an empty queue, both the front and rear pointers should point to the new node. Conversely, when attempting to remove an element from an empty queue, an error should be raised, or the operation should be ignored.

In terms of time complexity, both the enqueue and dequeue operations have a complexity of $O(1)$, indicating that they take constant time regardless of the number of elements in the queue. This efficiency arises because these operations only involve manipulating the front and rear pointers, without the need to traverse the entire linked list.

In summary, implementing a queue using a linked list involves managing two pointers that track the front and rear of the structure and ensuring that additions and removals conform to the FIFO principle.
