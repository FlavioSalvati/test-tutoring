Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilizes a binary heap data structure. The sorting process begins by transforming the input list into a max heap, which is a specialized tree-based structure that adheres to the heap property. In a max heap, for any node $i$, the value at $i$ is greater than or equal to the values of its children. As a result, the largest element in the heap resides at the root node.

The next phase of the heap sort algorithm involves swapping the root node (which contains the largest element) with the last element in the heap. This action effectively removes the largest element from the heap and places it in its correct position within the sorted list. Subsequently, the size of the heap is decreased by one, and the heap property is reinstated by performing a process known as 'heapifying' the root node. This sequence of steps is repeated until the heap is completely empty, yielding a fully sorted list.

Heap sort is classified as an in-place algorithm, meaning it sorts the list by directly manipulating the original data without necessitating additional space. This characteristic makes it a space-efficient sorting method. However, it is important to note that heap sort is not a stable sorting algorithm; thus, equal elements may not preserve their original order in the final sorted list.

The time complexity of heap sort is $O(n \log n)$ in both best and worst-case scenarios, which underscores its efficiency for sorting large datasets. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that heap sort tends to be slower in practice compared to other $O(n \log n)$ algorithms, such as quicksort and mergesort, primarily due to its higher overhead.

In summary, heap sort is an effective sorting algorithm that operates by converting the list into a max heap and subsequently swapping the largest element with the last element in the heap. It is an in-place, comparison-based algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$. Despite its theoretical efficiency, it is often outperformed by faster algorithms in practical applications.
