Common security measures for internet banking encompass several key strategies, including two-factor authentication, encryption, firewalls, and anti-virus software.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is a vital security feature that requires users to present two distinct forms of identification to access their accounts. Typically, this involves a combination of something the user knows, such as a password, and something the user possesses, like a mobile device that receives a one-time code. This dual requirement adds an additional layer of security, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access accounts, even if they have obtained the password.

**Encryption** is another essential security measure. It entails transforming data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. Banks implement Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to safeguard the data transmitted between the bank and its customers. SSL encryption establishes a secure connection between the customer's browser and the bank's server, thereby making it challenging for hackers to intercept and decipher the transmitted information.

**Firewalls** serve as protective barriers for the bank's network against unauthorized access. They act as a filter between the bank's internal network and the internet, blocking potentially harmful data from entering. Firewalls can be tailored to restrict data from specific locations or applications, thereby enhancing security.

**Anti-Virus Software** is another common security measure employed by banks. This software protects against malware, which can be used to steal sensitive information. Anti-virus programs scan the bank's network and systems for known threats, removing them as necessary. Additionally, they help defend against phishing attacks, where cybercriminals attempt to deceive users into disclosing their login credentials.

In conjunction with these measures, banks utilize **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to monitor their networks for suspicious activity. When the IDS identifies potential threats, it alerts the bank's security team, enabling them to take prompt action to avert a security breach. Regular updates to systems and software are also performed to safeguard against emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

Lastly, many banks provide **security education** for their customers. This training can include guidance on creating robust passwords, recognizing phishing emails, and ensuring personal devices are secure. Such initiatives empower customers to take proactive steps in protecting their online banking information.
