In a computer system, polynomials are typically represented using an array or a list of coefficients.

A polynomial is a mathematical expression formed by summing powers of one or more variables, each multiplied by a coefficient. For instance, the polynomial $3x^2 + 2x + 1$ comprises three coefficients: $3$, $2$, and $1$. In a computer system, this polynomial can be represented as an array or list of these coefficients, where the index of each coefficient corresponds to the power of the variable it multiplies. Therefore, for the polynomial $3x^2 + 2x + 1$, the array representation would be $[1, 2, 3]$.

This representation is both efficient and convenient for performing various operations on polynomials. For example, to evaluate the polynomial at a specific value of $x$, one can iterate through the array, multiplying each coefficient by the corresponding power of $x$ and summing the results. Similarly, adding two polynomials can be achieved by simply summing their corresponding coefficients from the respective arrays.

However, this representation presumes that the polynomial is dense, meaning it has a coefficient for every power of the variable up to the highest one. In cases where the polynomial is sparse—having many powers with coefficients equal to zero—this representation may lead to inefficient use of space. For sparse polynomials, it is often more advantageous to use a representation that consists of pairs of coefficients and their corresponding powers, or to utilize a data structure such as a dictionary or map that can effectively manage sparse data.

In addition to arrays and lists, various other data structures can be employed to represent polynomials, depending on the specific requirements of the problem. For instance, if the coefficients are large numbers, a linked list might be more efficient, as it can handle large values effectively. Moreover, for multivariate polynomials—those involving multiple variables—a more complex data structure, such as a multidimensional array or a tree, may be necessary.
