The cocktail sort algorithm operates by sorting a list in both directions—first forward and then backward—in a continuous cycle.

Cocktail sort, which is also referred to as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail shaker sort, shaker sort, ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort, is a variation of the traditional bubble sort algorithm. Unlike bubble sort, which sorts the list in only one direction during each pass, cocktail sort sorts in both directions. As a result, after the initial pass, the largest number is moved to the end of the list while the smallest number is positioned at the start.

The algorithm begins by comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the incorrect order. This process continues from the beginning of the list to the end, effectively moving the highest value to the end. This behavior resembles that of bubble sort, where the largest number "bubbles" up to its correct position at the end of the list.

However, in contrast to bubble sort, cocktail sort does not restart the next pass from the beginning of the list. Instead, it proceeds in the opposite direction, from the end of the list back to the beginning. During this backward pass, the algorithm again compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are out of order, which moves the smallest number toward the front of the list.

The algorithm repeats this back-and-forth process until no further swaps are necessary, indicating that the list is now sorted.

One of the key advantages of cocktail sort over bubble sort is its enhanced efficiency when dealing with "turtle" elements—small values located at the end of the list. In bubble sort, these elements move to the front very slowly, while cocktail sort allows them to move much more quickly to their correct positions.

Nevertheless, similar to bubble sort, cocktail sort is not well-suited for large lists. Its average and worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of items in the list. This quadratic growth in time complexity means that the time required to sort the list increases significantly as the number of items grows, rendering it inefficient for handling large datasets.
