An HTML form facilitates communication with a server by sending HTTP requests, which are typically of two types: GET and POST. These requests contain the data entered in the form.

When a user completes a form and clicks the submit button, the browser collects the input data, constructs an HTTP request, and sends it to the server indicated in the form's `action` attribute. This entire process is referred to as form submission. The type of HTTP request that is generated is determined by the form's `method` attribute, with GET and POST being the most common options.

The GET method appends the form data directly to the URL of the specified server. This means that the data can be viewed in the browser's address bar. GET is particularly useful for transmitting non-sensitive information and when the user may want to bookmark the resulting page. However, it has limitations regarding the amount of data that can be sent. Additionally, since the data is included in the URL, it is not appropriate for transmitting sensitive information, such as passwords.

In contrast, the POST method transmits the form data in the body of the HTTP request, which is not visible in the browser's address bar. This method does not impose restrictions on the amount of data that can be sent and offers enhanced security, making it suitable for transferring sensitive information like passwords.

Once the server receives the HTTP request, it processes the form data and returns an HTTP response. The server-side processing can be executed using various programming languages, including PHP, Python, Java, or Node.js. The response from the server usually includes a new web page, but it may also consist of a status indicator or a confirmation message.

In summary, HTML forms communicate with servers by sending HTTP requests that encapsulate form data. The server processes this data and sends a response back to the client. The specific type of HTTP request and the manner in which data is transmitted depend on the form's `method` attribute.
