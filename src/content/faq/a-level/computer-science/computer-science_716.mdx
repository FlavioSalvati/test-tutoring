A min-heap is defined as a binary tree in which each parent node has a value less than or equal to the values of its child nodes, whereas a max-heap exhibits the opposite property.

Both min-heaps and max-heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that adhere to the heap property. These structures are binary trees, meaning that each node can have at most two children. The primary distinction between the two types of heaps lies in the arrangement of their nodes concerning their parent nodes.

In a min-heap, the value of every parent node is less than or equal to the values of its child nodes. Consequently, the smallest element is always located at the root of the tree. Whenever elements are inserted or removed, the heap reorganizes itself to preserve this property. This characteristic makes min-heaps particularly advantageous for algorithms that require efficient access to the smallest element, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used for finding the shortest path in a graph.

Conversely, in a max-heap, the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its child nodes. Thus, the largest element is consistently found at the root of the tree. Similar to min-heaps, max-heaps also reorganize themselves when elements are inserted or removed to maintain this property. Max-heaps are particularly useful for algorithms that need to efficiently find or remove the largest element, such as the heapsort algorithm, which sorts elements in ascending order.

Both min-heaps and max-heaps can be efficiently implemented using an array. In this implementation, each element of the array corresponds to a node in the tree, and the parent-child relationships are determined based on the indices of the elements. This array-based representation optimizes memory usage since it eliminates the need for additional pointers or data structures to maintain the tree's structure.

In summary, the fundamental difference between a min-heap and a max-heap is the ordering of the nodes: in a min-heap, parent nodes are always less than or equal to their children, while in a max-heap, parent nodes are always greater than or equal to their children. This variation in structure renders each type of heap suitable for different algorithms and operations.
