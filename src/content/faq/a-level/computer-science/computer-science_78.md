A stack is utilized for static memory allocation, while a heap is designated for dynamic memory allocation.

In the realm of computer programming, memory allocation is a crucial factor that significantly influences the execution of your program. The two main types of memory allocation are the stack and the heap. The stack is a memory region that automatically adjusts its size when a function is called or returns, respectively. It is specifically used for static memory allocation, where the size and lifespan of the allocated memory are determined at compile time. Variables allocated on the stack are automatically deallocated once they go out of scope.

Conversely, the heap is a memory region reserved for dynamic memory allocation. Unlike the stack, the heap does not impose size restrictions on variable sizes, aside from the overall memory capacity of your program. Memory management on the heap is manual; programmers must allocate and deallocate memory explicitly, and there is no automatic cleanup when variables go out of scope. While this provides greater flexibility, it also places the responsibility of memory management on the programmer, raising the risk of memory leaks if memory is not properly deallocated.

Allocating memory on the stack is generally faster than on the heap because the operating system simply adjusts the stack pointer upward or downward. However, the stack has a finite size, and exceeding this limit will lead to a stack overflow error. In contrast, memory allocation on the heap is typically slower due to the more complex bookkeeping required by the operating system. Nevertheless, the heap offers a higher degree of control and flexibility in memory management.

**Summary for A-Level Computer Science Students:** 
The stack is used for static memory allocation and is managed automatically, while the heap is designated for dynamic memory allocation and requires manual management. Although the stack is faster, it is limited in size; on the other hand, the heap, while slower, provides greater flexibility. Understanding these distinctions is essential for writing efficient programs.
