Assembly language is a low-level programming language that has a direct correspondence to the machine code utilized by a specific computer architecture.

It serves as a more human-readable alternative to machine code, employing symbolic representations of machine instructions that are subsequently translated into binary code by a program known as an assembler. Each assembly language is tailored to a particular computer architecture, reflecting the specific machine code that the architecture uses. In contrast, machine code is the most fundamental level of programming language, comprising binary or hexadecimal instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU).

The relationship between assembly language and machine code is intimate. Assembly language acts as a symbolic representation of machine code, designed to be more comprehensible and manipulable by humans. Every assembly language instruction corresponds to a specific instruction in machine code. For instance, an instruction in assembly language may direct the computer to 'load' a value into a register, while the equivalent machine code instruction would be a specific binary or hexadecimal value that the CPU recognizes as the 'load' command.

The translation of assembly language into machine code is performed by an assembler. This program takes each instruction written in assembly language and converts it into the corresponding machine code instruction. This entire process is termed 'assembling' the code. The resulting machine code can then be executed directly by the computer's CPU.

In summary, assembly language and machine code represent two different forms of the same underlying instructions that dictate a computer's operations. Assembly language provides a symbolic, human-readable version of these instructions, whereas machine code represents them in binary or hexadecimal format, suitable for direct execution by the CPU. The conversion of assembly language into machine code is facilitated by the assembler.
