A split tree, also referred to as a range tree, is a specialized data structure utilized in computational geometry to efficiently handle range queries.

A split tree is a type of binary tree designed to store a collection of points. Each node within the tree corresponds to an interval or range of values. The structure is organized such that for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree represent intervals that are strictly less than the interval represented by the node, while all nodes in its right subtree represent intervals that are strictly greater. This organization allows for rapid location of a specific interval or range of values, making it particularly valuable in computational geometry for tasks such as identifying all points that fall within a designated range.

The construction of a split tree begins with sorting the list of points. The sorted list is then recursively divided into two halves until each interval contains a single point. This process results in a balanced binary tree, where the height of the tree is proportional to the logarithm of the number of points, denoted as $h = O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of points. Consequently, the time complexity for searching for a specific interval within the tree is logarithmic, specifically $O(\log n)$, which is significantly more efficient than a linear search.

In addition to handling range queries, split trees can also be employed to resolve nearest neighbor queries. In this scenario, the objective is to identify the point that is closest to a given query point. This is accomplished by traversing the tree to locate the node that represents the interval containing the query point, followed by a comparison of the distance from the query point to the distances of points in adjacent intervals.

Moreover, split trees serve as foundational components in the construction of other important data structures in computational geometry, such as segment trees and interval trees. These structures are essential for tasks like detecting intersections between line segments and identifying all intervals that overlap with a specified interval. The versatility and efficiency of split trees make them a fundamental tool in various applications within computational geometry, including computer graphics, geographic information systems, and machine learning.
