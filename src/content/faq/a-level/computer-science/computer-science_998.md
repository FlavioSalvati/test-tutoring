To convert a hexadecimal number to binary, each hexadecimal digit is substituted with its corresponding binary equivalent, which consists of four bits.

Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, while binary is a base-2 system. This distinction means that each digit in hexadecimal can represent 16 different values (from $0$ to $15$), whereas each digit in binary can represent only $2$ values (either $0$ or $1$). Therefore, each hexadecimal digit can be perfectly represented by exactly four binary digits.

To perform the conversion from hexadecimal to binary, follow these steps:

1. **Write down the hexadecimal number** you wish to convert.
2. **Find the binary equivalent** for each hexadecimal digit. You can refer to a conversion table for this purpose. Below is a simple table for your reference:

   $$ 
   \begin{array}{|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Hexadecimal} & \text{Binary} \\
   \hline
   0 & 0000 \\
   1 & 0001 \\
   2 & 0010 \\
   3 & 0011 \\
   4 & 0100 \\
   5 & 0101 \\
   6 & 0110 \\
   7 & 0111 \\
   8 & 1000 \\
   9 & 1001 \\
   A & 1010 \\
   B & 1011 \\
   C & 1100 \\
   D & 1101 \\
   E & 1110 \\
   F & 1111 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

3. **Replace each hexadecimal digit** with its binary equivalent. Be sure to maintain the same order as the original hexadecimal digits. For instance, if you have the hexadecimal number 'A3', you would convert 'A' to '1010' and '3' to '0011', resulting in the binary number '10100011'.

4. **The final result** represents the binary equivalent of the original hexadecimal number.

It is important to note that converting from hexadecimal to binary does not alter the value of the number; it merely changes its representation. This process is akin to translating a sentence from English to Frenchâ€”the meaning remains unchanged, yet the words used to convey it differ.
