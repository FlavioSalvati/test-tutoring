The binary representation of the octal number $542$ is $101100010$.

To convert an octal number to binary, each digit of the octal number is replaced with its corresponding binary equivalent. The octal system is base $8$, which utilizes eight symbols (from $0$ to $7$), while the binary system is base $2$, consisting of two symbols ($0$ and $1$).

The octal number $542$ can be decomposed into three individual digits: $5$, $4$, and $2$. Each of these digits can be expressed as a three-digit binary number. The binary equivalents for these digits are as follows:

- The octal digit $5$ converts to binary as $101$.
- The octal digit $4$ converts to binary as $100$.
- The octal digit $2$ converts to binary as $010$.

Thus, to convert the octal number $542$ into binary, we replace each octal digit with its binary counterpart:

- $5$ becomes $101$,
- $4$ becomes $100$,
- $2$ becomes $010$.

When we concatenate these binary representations, we obtain the binary number $101100010$.

It is important to remember that each octal digit corresponds to a three-digit binary number. This is necessary because the highest digit in the octal system, which is $7$, requires three binary digits to represent it ($111$).

In conclusion, the binary representation of the octal number $542$ is $101100010$. This conversion method can be applied to any octal number to obtain its binary equivalent.
