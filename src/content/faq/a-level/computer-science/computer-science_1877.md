Higher-order functions enhance code reusability by enabling the passing of functions as arguments and returning them as results.

To elaborate, higher-order functions are a fundamental aspect of functional programming, a paradigm in which functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures, passed as parameters to other functions, and returned as values from functions. This level of flexibility greatly promotes code reusability.

For example, imagine you have a list of numbers and you want to perform various operations on this list, such as calculating the square of each number or filtering out numbers that are less than a specified value. Without higher-order functions, you would need to write separate loops for each operation. However, with higher-order functions, you can create a single function that accepts another function as an argument and applies it to each element in the list. This approach allows you to reuse the same function for different tasks simply by passing different functions as arguments.

Furthermore, higher-order functions can also return functions as results, facilitating the creation of function factories—functions that generate other functions with specific behaviors. For instance, you could design a function that takes a number as input and returns a new function that multiplies its argument by that number. This way, you can create multiple multiplication functions, each with a distinct multiplier, while reusing the same function factory.

Additionally, higher-order functions can be utilized to create control structures, such as loops or conditionals, which can be reused throughout various parts of a program. For instance, you might implement a higher-order function that accepts a condition function and a body function as arguments, executing the body function repeatedly as long as the condition function evaluates to true. This allows you to reuse the same control structure for different conditions and bodies, thereby minimizing code duplication.

In summary, by enabling the passing of functions as arguments and their return as results, higher-order functions provide a powerful mechanism for achieving code reusability. This capability fosters more concise, flexible, and modular programming practices.
