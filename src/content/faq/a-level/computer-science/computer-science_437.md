A multiway tree permits each node to have more than two children, whereas a binary tree limits each node to a maximum of two children.

A binary tree is a specific type of data structure in which each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. This straightforward and efficient structure is widely utilized in computer science, especially in the implementation of search algorithms and syntax trees. The binary tree configuration ensures that each node occupies a distinct position, which can enhance the efficiency of searching and sorting operations.

In contrast, a multiway tree—also known as a $k$-ary tree—represents a more generalized form of a binary tree. In a multiway tree, each node can have any number of children, ranging from zero to a predefined maximum. This characteristic provides multiway trees with greater flexibility compared to binary trees, allowing them to represent more complex relationships among nodes. For instance, a ternary tree (a specific type of multiway tree where $k=3$) allows each node to have up to three children.

The choice between employing a binary tree or a multiway tree often hinges on the specific requirements of the problem being addressed. Binary trees are simpler and may offer greater efficiency for certain tasks, such as searching and sorting. However, multiway trees can prove to be more effective for other tasks, such as representing hierarchical relationships within a more complex dataset.

Regarding traversal methods, binary trees utilize specific algorithms, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal. Multiway trees can also be traversed in a similar manner, but the process can become more intricate due to the possibility of having multiple children.

In summary, both binary trees and multiway trees serve as data structures for storing and organizing data. However, they differ fundamentally in the number of children each node can accommodate. This key distinction can significantly influence their efficiency and suitability for various tasks in the realm of computer science.
