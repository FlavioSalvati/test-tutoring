A graph can be represented using an adjacency list, which associates each vertex in the graph with a list of its neighboring vertices.

An adjacency list is a data structure commonly used in computer science to represent graphs. It consists of a collection of unordered lists, with one list for each vertex in the graph. Each list details the set of neighbors connected to that vertex. Consequently, for every edge in the graph, there is a corresponding connection from the vertex to each vertex listed as its neighbor.

For instance, consider a graph with vertices labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. If vertex $A$ is connected to vertices $B$ and $C$, vertex $B$ is connected to vertices $A$ and $D$, vertex $C$ is connected to vertex $A$, and vertex $D$ is connected to vertex $B$, the adjacency list representation of this graph would appear as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
A & : B, C \\
B & : A, D \\
C & : A \\
D & : B \\
\end{align*}
$$

The adjacency list is an efficient method for graph representation, as its space usage is proportional to the number of edges. This can be significantly less than the total number of potential edges, especially in dense graphs. Furthermore, it facilitates efficient graph traversal, allowing easy access to all neighbors of a particular vertex.

Regarding implementation, the adjacency list can be represented using various data structures. Options include an array of lists, a dictionary where vertices serve as keys and lists act as values, or even linked lists of linked lists. The choice of data structure will depend on the specific requirements of the problem, such as whether the graph is directed or undirected, and whether operations like adding or removing vertices and edges are necessary.

In summary, an adjacency list provides a straightforward and efficient means to represent a graph in computer science by associating each vertex with a list of its neighbors. This representation allows for efficient traversal and manipulation of the graph, and can be implemented using a range of data structures tailored to the specific needs of the problem at hand.
