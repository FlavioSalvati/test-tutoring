A one-to-many relationship in a database is established through the use of foreign keys in the related tables.

In a relational database, a one-to-many relationship occurs when a single record in one table can be linked to multiple records in another table. This relationship type is quite common and is implemented using primary keys and foreign keys.

To illustrate this concept, let's examine a school database comprising two tables: 'Teachers' and 'Students'. In this scenario, each teacher can have multiple students, while each student is associated with only one teacher. This scenario exemplifies a classic one-to-many relationship.

In the 'Teachers' table, there is a primary key, typically a unique identifier for each teacher, such as 'Teacher\_ID'. The 'Students' table also contains its own primary key, designated as 'Student\_ID'. To establish the one-to-many relationship, we introduce a foreign key in the 'Students' table, which we can name 'Teacher\_ID'. This foreign key links each student to a specific teacher.

The 'Teacher\_ID' in the 'Students' table serves as a foreign key that references the 'Teacher\_ID' in the 'Teachers' table. This mechanism allows the database to maintain the relationship. When you wish to identify the students assigned to a particular teacher, you would query the 'Students' table for all records where the 'Teacher\_ID' matches the 'Teacher\_ID' of the specified teacher.

It is essential to understand that the foreign key in the 'Students' table must permit duplicate values since multiple students can share the same teacher. Conversely, the primary key in the 'Teachers' table must remain unique, as each teacher represents a distinct individual.

In summary, a one-to-many relationship in a database is implemented by including a foreign key in the 'many' table that references the primary key in the 'one' table. This setup allows multiple records in the 'many' table to be associated with a single record in the 'one' table.
