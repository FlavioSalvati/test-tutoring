Certificate authorities (CAs) play a crucial role in verifying digital certificates by examining the certificate's signature with the issuer's public key.

To elaborate, a Certificate Authority is a trusted organization responsible for issuing digital certificates. These certificates serve as data files that cryptographically associate an entity with its public key. The verification process encompasses several steps to ensure both the authenticity and integrity of the digital certificate.

The first step in this process involves the CA checking the digital signature of the certificate. This signature is generated by the certificate's issuer using their private key. The CA then utilizes the issuer's public key to decrypt the signature. If the decrypted signature corresponds with the certificate's data, it confirms that the certificate was indeed issued by the stated issuer and has not been altered.

Next, the CA assesses the validity period of the certificate. Each digital certificate specifies a certain timeframe during which it is considered valid. If the current date falls within this timeframe, the certificate is regarded as valid.

Additionally, the CA reviews the Certificate Revocation List (CRL). This list contains certificates that have been revoked by the issuer before their expiration date for various reasons, such as the compromise of the private key. If the certificate in question appears on this list, it is deemed invalid.

Moreover, the CA verifies the intended usage of the certificate. Digital certificates are issued for specific purposes, such as server authentication, client authentication, or code signing. The CA checks whether the certificate is being utilized for its designated purpose.

Finally, the CA examines the binding of the certificate. A digital certificate links a public key to the entity that possesses the corresponding private key. The CA ensures that this binding is verified, confirming that the entity presenting the certificate is indeed the legitimate owner of the public key.

In summary, the verification process conducted by a CA encompasses several critical checks: the certificate's signature, validity period, revocation status, intended usage, and binding. This comprehensive procedure guarantees the authenticity, integrity, and trustworthiness of the digital certificate and the entity it represents.
