In Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling, inheritance relationships are depicted using a generalization or specialization hierarchy.

To elaborate, an inheritance relationship in ER modeling refers to a situation where a child entity inherits attributes and relationships from a parent entity. This relationship is often described as an "is-a" relationship, indicating that the child entity is a specific type of the parent entity. For instance, a 'Car' is considered a type of 'Vehicle', meaning that 'Car' inherits attributes such as 'color' and 'size' from 'Vehicle'.

In ER diagrams, this inheritance relationship is illustrated using a generalization or specialization hierarchy. In this structure, the parent entity occupies the top position, while the child entities are linked to it through connecting lines. These lines typically converge at a circle or an ellipse, symbolizing the generalization or specialization relationship. The hierarchy generally flows from the general (the parent) to the specific (the child entities).

For example, if 'Vehicle' serves as the parent entity, 'Car' and 'Bike' would be the child entities. In this case, the hierarchy would feature 'Vehicle' at the top, with lines extending down to 'Car' and 'Bike'. The convergence of these lines at a circle or an ellipse indicates that 'Car' and 'Bike' are specializations of 'Vehicle'.

Moreover, child entities can themselves have their own child entities, resulting in a multi-level hierarchy. For example, 'Sports Car' and 'SUV' could be child entities of 'Car', inheriting its attributes while further specializing the characteristics of the parent entity.

It is essential to understand that in an inheritance relationship, child entities inherit all the attributes and relationships from the parent entity. However, they are also permitted to possess additional attributes and relationships that do not exist in the parent entity. For instance, 'Car' might have an extra attribute, such as 'number of doors', which is not applicable to the general category of 'Vehicle'.
