A binary tree is a type of tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node of the tree is called the root. Each node in a binary tree can have zero, one, or two children, and nodes with no children are known as leaf nodes. Importantly, a binary tree does not impose any specific order on how its elements or nodes are arranged.

In contrast, a binary search tree (BST) is a specialized form of a binary tree that adheres to specific ordering rules. Like a binary tree, a binary search tree allows each parent node to have at most two children. However, it requires that for every node, all elements in its left subtree must be less than the node itself, while all elements in its right subtree must be greater than the node. This property of ordered nodes enables binary search trees to facilitate efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making them a valuable tool in algorithm design.

In summary, although both binary trees and binary search trees are hierarchical structures that share similar characteristics, the primary distinction lies in the arrangement of nodes. Binary trees do not impose any ordering constraints, whereas binary search trees do. This inherent order in binary search trees enhances their utility in various algorithms, particularly those focused on searching and sorting. Understanding these distinctions is essential for selecting the most appropriate data structure for your specific requirements in computer science.
