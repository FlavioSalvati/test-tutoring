The Cocktail Sort algorithm operates by sorting a list in both directions—first from the beginning to the end and then from the end back to the beginning—repeating this cycle until the list is fully sorted.

Cocktail Sort, also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail shaker sort, shaker sort, ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort, is a variation of the traditional bubble sort algorithm. Unlike bubble sort, which sorts the list in only one direction during each pass, cocktail sort alternates between forward and backward passes. As a result, after the initial forward pass, the largest element is positioned at the end of the list, while the smallest element is moved to the start.

The algorithm begins by examining each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order. This process continues from the beginning of the list to the end, effectively "bubbling" the highest value to the end. This behavior is akin to that of bubble sort.

However, in contrast to bubble sort, cocktail sort does not resume the next pass from the start of the list. Instead, it proceeds in the reverse direction, from the end of the list back towards the beginning. During this backward pass, it again compares adjacent pairs and performs swaps as necessary, which helps to position the smallest elements at the start of the list.

The algorithm alternates this forward and backward movement through the list until no further swaps are required, indicating that the list is now sorted.

One notable advantage of cocktail sort over bubble sort is its efficiency in handling "turtle" elements—small numbers located at the end of the list. In bubble sort, these elements move to the front very slowly, whereas cocktail sort facilitates their movement much more quickly.

Nonetheless, like bubble sort, cocktail sort is not ideal for large lists. Its average and worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of elements in the list. This quadratic growth in sorting time as the number of items increases renders it inefficient for handling large datasets.
