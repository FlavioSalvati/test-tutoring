Static libraries are linked at compile time, while dynamic libraries are linked at runtime.

Static libraries, also referred to as statically-linked libraries, consist of collections of object code that are integrated into your program during the compilation process. When you compile your program, the linker retrieves the object code from the static library and incorporates it into the executable file. As a result, once the program is compiled, it contains all the necessary code to execute independently, making it larger but entirely self-sufficient. The primary advantage of static libraries is that you can be confident that all the functions and resources required by your program are included in the executable, allowing it to run on any system without needing additional libraries. However, a downside to this is that if you update the library, you must recompile and redistribute your program.

In contrast, dynamic libraries are linked to your program at runtime. This means that the executable file does not contain the actual code from the library; instead, it holds a reference to the library. When you execute the program, it dynamically loads the required library into memory. This approach results in a smaller executable file and enables multiple programs to share the same library, which can save memory. The key benefit of dynamic libraries is that you can update them independently of your program, without the need to recompile or redistribute the executable. On the flip side, if the library is absent on the system where the program is executed, or if a different version of the library is installed, the program may encounter issues and fail to function correctly.

In summary, the decision between using static and dynamic libraries hinges on your specific requirements. If you prefer your program to be self-contained, ensuring it does not rely on the presence of external libraries, static libraries may be the better choice. Conversely, if you aim to reduce the size of your program or wish to facilitate library updates without recompilation, dynamic libraries may be more suitable.
