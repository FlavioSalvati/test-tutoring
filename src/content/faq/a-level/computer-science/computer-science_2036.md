A segment tree is a specialized data structure designed for efficiently storing and managing information about segments or intervals. It facilitates quick range queries, allowing for swift retrieval of information over specified segments of an array.

A segment tree is structured as a binary tree, where each node corresponds to an interval or segment of the underlying array. The root node represents the entire array, while each child node represents a segment that is half the size of its parent node. The leaf nodes of the tree correspond to individual elements of the array. This hierarchical organization enables efficient querying and updating of ranges within the array.

The primary function of a segment tree is to handle range queriesâ€”operations that require information about a contiguous subset of elements in the array. For instance, a range query may seek the sum, minimum, or maximum value within a specified range of elements. Without a segment tree, executing such a query would necessitate scanning through all the elements in the specified range, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$. In contrast, with the use of a segment tree, the time complexity for a range query is significantly reduced to $O(\log n)$.

Beyond range queries, segment trees are also capable of performing range updates, which modify a specified range of elements in the array. For example, a range update could involve incrementing all elements within a certain range by a specified value. Similar to range queries, these updates can be executed more efficiently using a segment tree compared to a naive approach.

In addition to handling range queries and updates, segment trees can support various other operations related to intervals or segments. Examples include finding the next smaller or larger element within a range, counting the number of distinct elements in a specified range, or identifying the most frequently occurring element within that range.

In summary, a segment tree is a versatile and efficient data structure well-suited for managing intervals and segments. It is particularly advantageous in scenarios where numerous range queries or updates are performed, especially when the underlying array undergoes infrequent modifications.
