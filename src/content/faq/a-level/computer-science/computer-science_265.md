In functional programming, graphs can be traversed using three primary methods: depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a widely used technique for graph traversal in functional programming. It begins at a specific node, often referred to as the root, and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS employs a stack to keep track of vertices, allowing the algorithm to revisit nodes when it encounters a dead end during any iteration. This recursive approach aligns well with the principles of functional programming.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is another method employed for traversing graphs. It commences at the root or any arbitrary node—sometimes called a "search key"—and explores all neighboring nodes at the current depth level before progressing to nodes at the next depth level. BFS utilizes a queue data structure that operates on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Although BFS is typically implemented in an imperative style, it can be adapted for functional programming by utilizing a recursive function along with an explicit queue of nodes that need to be visited next.

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is a more sophisticated method designed to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which can represent structures such as road networks. This algorithm is categorized as a greedy algorithm, as it constructs a shortest path tree for a weighted undirected graph. Specifically, it calculates the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes within the graph. Dijkstra's algorithm employs a priority queue to determine the next node to visit, reorganizing nodes based on the cost associated with reaching them. This ensures that nodes are visited in the order of their distance from the starting point. While Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented in a functional programming style, it is more commonly seen in imperative contexts due to its inherent complexity.

In summary, DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm are all essential methods for graph traversal in functional programming. Each technique possesses its unique strengths and weaknesses, and the selection of a particular method depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
