In computer architecture, interrupts are signals sent to the processor to notify it of events that require immediate attention.

An interrupt is a mechanism that allows an input/output operation or a specific instruction to temporarily suspend the normal sequence of processing by the processor. It effectively controls the execution flow of the processor. When an interrupt signal is received, the processor halts its current tasks and transfers control to a designated Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), which is a specialized piece of code created to handle the conditions that triggered the interrupt.

Interrupts can be categorized into two main types: hardware interrupts and software interrupts. 

- **Hardware interrupts** are generated by peripheral devices, such as keyboards or mice, when they need to communicate data to the processor. For instance, pressing a key on the keyboard sends an interrupt signal to the processor, indicating that data is available for processing.
  
- **Software interrupts**, conversely, are initiated by programs running on the computer. These interrupts are typically used to request services from the operating system, such as reading a file or displaying information on the screen.

Additionally, interrupts can vary in priority. Some interrupts have higher priority than others, allowing them to be serviced first. This prioritization is crucial in scenarios where immediate action is necessary, such as addressing a critical system error.

When an interrupt occurs, the processor must save its current state to ensure it can resume its previous task after the interrupt has been addressed. This process involves saving the program counter, which tracks the current position in the task, along with other relevant data. After the interrupt has been processed, the processor can restore its state and continue executing the original task.

In summary, interrupts play a vital role in computer architecture. They enable the processor to respond to events as they arise, ensuring that essential tasks are completed promptly.
