A full binary tree is defined as a tree in which every node has either $0$ or $2$ children. This means that each node can either be a leaf node with no children or an internal node with two children. Consequently, there are no nodes with only one child in a full binary tree. Notably, the number of leaf nodes in a full binary tree is always one greater than the number of internal nodes.

In contrast, a complete binary tree is characterized by having all levels completely filled, with the exception of possibly the last level. Furthermore, all nodes in the last level are positioned as far left as possible. While a complete binary tree can include nodes with only one child, these nodes must always be situated to the left of any nodes with two children. The last level of a complete binary tree is filled from left to right.

In terms of their applications, full binary trees are frequently employed in mathematical expressions and Boolean functions due to their clear and structured nature. On the other hand, complete binary trees are commonly utilized in various data structures, such as binary heaps, which play a crucial role in the heap sort algorithm, a widely used sorting method.

To summarize, both full and complete binary trees are specific types of binary trees, each with distinct structures and applications. A full binary tree consists solely of nodes with either $0$ or $2$ children, and the number of leaf nodes is always one more than the number of internal nodes. In contrast, a complete binary tree is filled entirely up to the last level, with all nodes positioned as far left as possible.
