A min-max heap is a specialized data structure that combines properties of both min heaps and max heaps within a complete binary tree. It is organized in such a way that levels of the tree alternate between the min and max properties.

### Properties of a Min-Max Heap

A min-max heap is a complete binary tree that adheres to the min-max heap property. This property specifies the following:

- At each even level of the tree, the key of any node must be less than or equal to the keys of its children.
- At each odd level, the key of any node must be greater than or equal to the keys of its children.

The root node is located at level $0$, which is classified as an even level.

### Structure of the Min-Max Heap

To implement a min-max heap, you begin by constructing a complete binary tree. Each node in this tree should contain a key and have two child nodes. For the tree to maintain the min-max heap property:

- The left child must have a key that is less than or equal to its parentâ€™s key.
- The right child must have a key that is greater than or equal to its parent's key.

### Inserting Elements

When you want to insert a new element into the heap, follow these steps:

1. Place the element at the next available position in the tree to ensure the binary tree remains complete.
2. "Bubble up" the newly inserted element to its appropriate position by comparing it to its parent node:
   - If the element is at an even level and is less than its parent, swap the two.
   - If the element is at an odd level and is greater than its parent, swap them as well.

Continue this process until the element is positioned correctly in the heap.

### Deleting Elements

To delete an element from the heap, specifically the root, you should:

1. Remove the root node and replace it with the last element in the tree.
2. "Bubble down" this element to restore the heap properties by comparing it with its children:
   - If this element is at an even level and is greater than one of its children, swap it with the smaller child.
   - If it is at an odd level and is less than one of its children, swap it with the larger child.

Repeat this process until the element is in its correct position within the heap.

### Summary

In summary, a min-max heap is a complete binary tree that alternates between levels of min and max heaps. The insertion and deletion of elements are managed through the "bubble up" and "bubble down" processes, respectively, ensuring that the min-max heap properties are maintained throughout these operations.
