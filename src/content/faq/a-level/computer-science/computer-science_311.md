In programming languages, iteration refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a specific condition is satisfied.

Iteration is a foundational concept in computer programming. It serves as a control flow mechanism that enables a set of instructions, commonly referred to as a block of code, to be executed multiple times. This repetition can occur either a predetermined number of times or until a particular condition is met. Typically, this condition is a logical expression that evaluates to either true or false. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop continues its iterations; conversely, if it evaluates to false, the loop terminates, and the program proceeds to the next segment of code.

There are several types of iteration structures in programming, including 'for' loops, 'while' loops, and 'do-while' loops. A 'for' loop is generally employed when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It includes a counter that increments or decrements with each iteration, and the loop continues until the counter reaches a specified value. In contrast, a 'while' loop continues to execute as long as a certain condition remains true. The condition is evaluated before each iteration, and if it is false, the loop is completely skipped. A 'do-while' loop operates similarly to a 'while' loop, but the condition is checked after each iteration, guaranteeing that the loop runs at least once.

Iteration is a powerful tool in programming because it allows developers to automate repetitive tasks, thereby enhancing code efficiency and readability. For instance, if you wanted to print the numbers from $1$ to $10$, you could either write ten separate print statements or utilize a 'for' loop to iterate over the range of numbers, printing each one sequentially. The latter method is not only more concise but also more adaptable, as it can be easily modified to print any desired range of numbers.

In conclusion, understanding iteration is essential for anyone learning to program. It is a fundamental concept that underlies many tasks performed by computers, from processing extensive datasets to managing user interactions within software applications.
