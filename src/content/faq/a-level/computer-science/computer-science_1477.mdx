A singly linked list allows traversal in only one direction, while a doubly linked list permits traversal in both directions.

A singly linked list is a type of data structure where each node consists of a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure enables efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position during iteration. However, it supports only one-way traversal, meaning you can navigate the list from the first node (the head) to the last node (the tail). To traverse the list in the opposite direction, you must start from the head again and move through the list sequentially until you reach your desired node.

In contrast, a doubly linked list is a more complex data structure that includes links to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence. This dual-linking allows for traversal in both directionsâ€”from the head to the tail and from the tail back to the head. The ability to traverse in both directions simplifies navigation and facilitates operations such as insertion and deletion at either end of the list. However, this added functionality comes at the cost of increased memory usage, as each node requires storage for an additional reference to the previous node.

Regarding memory efficiency, a singly linked list is more economical since it only needs to maintain a single reference to the next node. Conversely, a doubly linked list demands two references for each node: one for the next node and another for the previous node, making it less memory-efficient overall.

In terms of practical applications, singly linked lists are often employed in scenarios where memory conservation is critical and one-way traversal suffices, such as in the implementation of a stack. Doubly linked lists are more suitable for situations where two-way traversal is necessary, such as in the implementation of a web browser's back and forward navigation buttons.

In conclusion, the decision to use a singly or doubly linked list should be based on the specific requirements of your application, taking into account factors such as memory constraints and the necessity for one-way or two-way traversal.
