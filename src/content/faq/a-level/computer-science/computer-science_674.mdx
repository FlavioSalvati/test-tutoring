The tree sort algorithm is an effective sorting method that leverages the characteristics of a binary search tree (BST). The process begins by constructing an empty binary search tree and subsequently inserting each element from the input list into the tree. This insertion adheres to the binary search tree property: for any given node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's value, while all elements in the right subtree are greater.

After all elements have been inserted into the tree, the sorted list can be derived through an in-order traversal of the tree. During an in-order traversal, the algorithm visits the left subtree first, followed by the root node, and then the right subtree. This recursive process continues for each node, starting from the root. The outcome is a list of elements arranged in ascending order.

The time complexity of the tree sort algorithm is $O(n \log n)$ in both the best and average cases, which occurs when the tree remains balanced. This efficiency arises because each insertion operation requires $O(\log n)$ time, and there are $n$ such operations in total. However, in the worst-case scenario—when the input list is already sorted or sorted in reverse order—the tree becomes skewed, leading to a degradation in time complexity to $O(n^2)$. In this case, each insertion operation may take $O(n)$ time due to the linear structure of the tree.

Despite its suboptimal worst-case performance, tree sort offers several advantages. It typically performs well on average, maintains stability (preserving the relative order of equal elements), and does not require additional space for sorting, as the sorting occurs within the tree structure itself. Nevertheless, tree sort is not frequently employed in practical applications, primarily due to its poor worst-case performance and the superior average and worst-case efficiencies of other sorting algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort.
