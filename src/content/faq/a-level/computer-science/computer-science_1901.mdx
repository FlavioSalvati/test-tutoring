In functional programming, a trie can be elegantly implemented using recursive data structures and functions.

A trie, often referred to as a prefix tree, is a specialized search tree designed for storing a collection of strings. Each node in the trie corresponds to a character in a string, while the root node represents an empty string. In the context of functional programming, a trie can be represented as a recursive data structure, where each node is defined as a function that takes a character as input and returns another function representing the subsequent node.

To implement a trie in a functional programming language like Haskell, one would begin by defining a data structure for the nodes. This could be structured as a record type with fields for the character at the node, a list of child nodes, and a boolean flag indicating whether the node marks the end of a string. The child nodes would be represented as a list of functions, each corresponding to a potential next character in a string.

Inserting a string into the trie involves recursively traversing the structure and creating new nodes as needed. If the string is empty, the end-of-string flag for the current node is set. If not, the first character of the string is processed: the function locates the child node corresponding to that character (creating a new one if it does not exist) and then recursively inserts the remainder of the string into that child node.

Searching for a string within the trie follows a similar recursive pattern. If the string is empty, the function returns the end-of-string flag of the current node. If the string is not empty, it processes the first character, locates the corresponding child node (returning false if no such node exists), and recursively searches for the remainder of the string within that child node.

The recursive and higher-order function paradigms inherent in functional programming contribute to an elegant and concise implementation of a trie. However, it is crucial to recognize that this method may be less efficient than its imperative counterpart, particularly in languages that lack tail call optimization.
