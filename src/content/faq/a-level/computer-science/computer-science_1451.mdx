A flat-file database organizes data in a single table, while a relational database utilizes multiple linked tables, establishing relationships between them.

A flat-file database is a straightforward type of database that stores all of its data within a single table or list. Each record is represented by fields corresponding to various parameters. Typically, this data is stored in a plain text or binary file, where each record occupies a separate line. For instance, a spreadsheet that lists students along with their grades can be classified as a flat-file database. Although flat-file databases are easy to create and manage, they are not well-suited for handling complex queries or large volumes of data. Additionally, they exhibit limitations in terms of data redundancy and data integrity.

In contrast, a relational database is a more sophisticated type of database that organizes data into multiple tables (or "relations") consisting of rows and columns. Each row is uniquely identified by a key. These tables can be interrelated based on their data values, enabling efficient access and management of data. For example, a school might implement a relational database featuring distinct tables for students, courses, and grades, linking students to their corresponding courses and grades.

Relational databases offer greater power and flexibility compared to flat-file databases. They can accommodate substantial amounts of data and execute complex queries while providing robust mechanisms to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy. However, the design and management of relational databases are more intricate, requiring a solid understanding of the relational model and proficiency in SQL (Structured Query Language).

In conclusion, the primary distinction between flat-file databases and relational databases lies in their structure and complexity. Flat-file databases are uncomplicated and easy to use, but they have limited capabilities. On the other hand, relational databases provide enhanced capabilities and flexibility, albeit at the expense of increased complexity.
