SSH connections provide a secure method for data transmission by implementing encryption, authentication, and integrity checks for data exchanged over a network.

**Secure Shell (SSH)** is a protocol designed for secure communication between two computers across an insecure network. It offers robust password authentication and secure encrypted communication, enabling two systems to connect over open networks such as the internet. SSH is widely utilized by network administrators for remote management of systems and applications, allowing them to log into another computer, execute commands, and transfer files seamlessly.

The security of SSH connections relies on several key mechanisms:

1. **Public-Key Cryptography**: SSH employs public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and, when necessary, allow the remote system to verify the user's identity. This method utilizes two keys: a public key, which can be used by anyone to encrypt data, and a private key, which is kept secret by the recipient for decrypting the information. This approach ensures that even if someone intercepts the data, they cannot decipher it without access to the private key.

2. **Encryption**: Once a secure connection is established, SSH encrypts all data transmitted between the two computers, safeguarding the confidentiality of the information. Consequently, even if an unauthorized party manages to intercept the communication, they would be unable to comprehend the data due to its encrypted nature.

3. **Integrity Checks**: To guarantee that the data remains unaltered during transmission, SSH implements integrity checks using cryptographic hash functions. A hash function takes an input and generates a fixed-size string of bytes, known as a 'digest'. The sender computes a digest of the message, encrypts it, and sends both the message and the digest. Upon receiving the data, the recipient decrypts both the message and the digest, computes a new digest from the received message, and compares the two digests. If they match, the message is accepted as authentic; if they differ, the message is deemed compromised and rejected.

In conclusion, SSH connections ensure security through a comprehensive combination of authentication, encryption, and integrity checks. This multi-layered approach makes it exceedingly difficult for any unauthorized entity to intercept or tamper with data transmitted via an SSH connection.
