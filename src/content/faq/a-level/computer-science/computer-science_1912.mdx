Floating-point numbers in binary are represented using a structure akin to scientific notation, which consists of three main components: the sign, the exponent, and the mantissa (also referred to as the significand or fraction).

To elaborate, a floating-point number is typically represented in a computer using these three elements:

1. **Sign**: This is a single bit that indicates whether the number is positive or negative. A sign bit of $0$ denotes a positive number, while a sign bit of $1$ indicates a negative number.

2. **Exponent**: This component reflects the magnitude of the number. It is represented as a binary number that indicates the power to which the base (commonly $2$ in computing) is raised. The exponent can be both positive and negative, enabling the representation of very large and very small numbers. To simplify the handling of the exponent's sign, a bias is typically added, ensuring that the exponent is always stored as a positive value. For instance, in the case of a single-precision floating-point number, which allocates $8$ bits for the exponent, the bias is $127$.

3. **Mantissa**: This part represents the significant digits of the number and is generally expressed as a binary fraction. In the case of normalized numbers, it is assumed that there is a leading '1' before the binary point. Consequently, this leading '1' is not stored, allowing the mantissa to focus solely on the fractional part following the binary point, which enhances precision.

To illustrate, consider the decimal number $-14.75$. In binary floating-point representation, this number can be expressed as $$-1.84375 \times 2^3$$. In this example:
- The sign bit is $1$ (indicating a negative number).
- The exponent is $3$. After adding the bias for single-precision, it becomes $3 + 127 = 130$.
- The mantissa corresponds to $0.84375$, which in binary notation is represented as $0.11011$. 

This structured representation allows computers to handle a vast range of numerical values efficiently.
