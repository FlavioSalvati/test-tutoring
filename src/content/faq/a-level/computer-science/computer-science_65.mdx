A graph can be represented using an adjacency matrix, which is a square matrix where each cell indicates the presence or absence of an edge between pairs of vertices.

More specifically, an adjacency matrix is a square matrix that represents a finite graph. The entries of the matrix signify whether pairs of vertices are adjacent in the graph. The rows and columns of the matrix are labeled by the graph's vertices, and the cell located at the intersection of row $v$ and column $w$ is filled with a value that indicates the existence of an edge connecting vertices $v$ and $w$.

For undirected graphs, the adjacency matrix is symmetric. This is because if there is an edge connecting vertex $v$ to vertex $w$, there is also an edge connecting vertex $w$ to vertex $v$. Consequently, the matrix entries are either $0$ or $1$, where $1$ indicates the presence of an edge and $0$ indicates its absence.

In contrast, for directed graphs (commonly known as digraphs), the adjacency matrix does not necessarily exhibit symmetry. In this case, the entry in row $v$ and column $w$ corresponds to an edge directed from vertex $v$ to vertex $w$.

If the graph is weighted, the entries of the adjacency matrix can represent the weight of the edges instead of merely indicating their presence. For instance, if the weight of the edge from vertex $v$ to vertex $w$ is $2$, then the cell at the intersection of row $v$ and column $w$ in the adjacency matrix would contain the value $2$.

The adjacency matrix is particularly useful for quickly determining whether an edge exists between two vertices. However, it is not the most space-efficient representation for sparse graphs, where the number of edges is significantly less than the square of the number of vertices. In such scenarios, alternative representations like an adjacency list or an edge list may be more efficient.
