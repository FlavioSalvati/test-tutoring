The Heapsort algorithm is an efficient method for sorting numbers, which involves building a binary heap and subsequently removing the maximum element until the heap is empty.

Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that operates on an array of numbers. It utilizes a data structure known as a binary heap, which is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. This property stipulates that each parent node is either greater than or equal to its child nodes in a max heap, or less than or equal to its child nodes in a min heap.

The Heapsort algorithm begins by transforming the input array into a max heap. This transformation involves iterating over the array from the middle to the beginning, where, for each element, we 'sift it down' to its appropriate position within the heap. This procedure ensures that the largest element is positioned at the root of the heap.

Once the heap is constructed, the algorithm repeatedly swaps the root (the maximum element) with the last element of the heap, effectively placing the maximum element in its final sorted position within the array. Following this swap, the size of the heap is reduced by one—excluding the last element from the heap—and the new root is sifted down to its correct position. This process is carried out repeatedly until the heap is empty, resulting in a fully sorted array.

The efficiency of Heapsort is one of its most attractive features. It has both a worst-case and average time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, making it one of the most effective sorting algorithms for handling large datasets. Furthermore, Heapsort performs sorting in-place, requiring only a constant amount of additional space.

However, it is important to note that Heapsort is not a stable sorting algorithm. This means that equal elements may not maintain their relative order in the sorted array, as Heapsort rearranges elements to their final positions without regard for their initial positions. Despite this limitation, Heapsort remains widely used due to its optimal time complexity and minimal space requirements.
