An optional relationship in an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is illustrated by a circle on the line that connects the entities.

In an ERD, entities are depicted as rectangles, while relationships are represented by lines that link these rectangles. The nature of each relationship is denoted by specific symbols along these lines. A mandatory relationship, which requires an instance of one entity to be associated with an instance of another entity, is shown with a straight line. In contrast, an optional relationship—where an instance of one entity may or may not be associated with an instance of another entity—is represented by a circle on the connecting line.

For instance, consider the relationship between two entities: 'Student' and 'Course'. A student has the option to enroll in a course, but this enrollment is not compulsory; thus, it constitutes an optional relationship. In the ERD, 'Student' and 'Course' would be illustrated as two rectangles. A line would connect these rectangles, and a circle would be placed near the 'Course' entity on this line. This circle signifies that a student may or may not choose to be enrolled in a course.
