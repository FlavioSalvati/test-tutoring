A loader is an essential component of the linking process that loads executable code into memory for execution by the CPU.

The loader is a fundamental part of an operating system responsible for preparing a program to run by transferring it from disk storage into the computer's main memory. This process is crucial for the execution of any application.

The loader's function begins after the linker has combined individual object files, generated by a compiler, into a single executable file. This executable file is formatted in a way that the operating system can interpret. The loader reads the binary instructions from the file and places them in the appropriate locations in memory.

In addition to loading the executable, the loader performs several vital tasks. It resolves symbolic references between object modules, allocates memory for the program's variables, and sets up the stack and heap. The stack and heap are specific areas in memory used for dynamic memory allocation. Furthermore, the loader prepares the program counterâ€”a CPU register that holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.

Once the loader completes its tasks, the operating system initiates the program by transferring control to the loaded code. The CPU then begins executing the program's instructions, which are now situated in memory.

In certain systems, the loader also manages relocation, a process that adjusts absolute addresses in the program so it can be loaded at various memory locations. This adjustment is necessary because the specific memory address where the program is loaded may not be predetermined at compile time.

In summary, the loader plays a pivotal role in the linking process. It takes the executable file generated by the linker, loads it into memory, and prepares it for execution by the CPU. Without the loader, a computer would be unable to run any programs.
