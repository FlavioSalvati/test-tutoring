Creating an index in SQL is an essential task that can greatly enhance the performance of data retrieval operations. This is accomplished using the `CREATE INDEX` statement, which allows you to specify the name of the index, the associated table, and the column or columns that will be indexed.

The basic syntax for creating an index is as follows:

$$
\text{CREATE INDEX index\_name} \\
\text{ON table\_name (column1, column2, ...);}
$$

In this syntax:
- `index_name` is the identifier you want to assign to the index.
- `table_name` is the name of the table to which the index will be applied.
- `column1, column2, ...` are the names of one or more columns that the index will encompass. You can include multiple columns, separated by commas.

For instance, suppose you have a table named `Students` with the following columns: `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age`. If you wish to create an index specifically on the `LastName` column, you would execute the following SQL statement:

$$
\text{CREATE INDEX idx\_students\_lastname} \\
\text{ON Students (LastName);}
$$

In this example:
- `idx_students_lastname` is the designated name for the index.
- `Students` is the table to which the index applies.
- `LastName` is the column being indexed.

Utilizing indexes can significantly improve the speed of data retrieval operations in your database. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that indexes consume storage space and can introduce overhead during data updates, as the index must also be modified. Therefore, it is advisable to use indexes strategically, focusing on columns that are frequently searched or sorted.

In summary, the primary objective of creating an index is to enhance the performance of your database. Always weigh the benefits of faster data retrieval against the additional storage requirements and potential delays in data updates.
