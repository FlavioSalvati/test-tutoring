Bluetooth technology operates by utilizing radio waves to establish connections and exchange data between devices over short distances.

Bluetooth is a wireless communication protocol specifically designed for short-range connections among devices. It functions within the 2.4 GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band, a globally accessible and unlicensed frequency range. Originally developed by Ericsson in 1994, Bluetooth is now overseen by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).

This technology employs a method known as frequency-hopping spread spectrum, which divides the data being transmitted and sends segments across up to 79 channels, each spaced $1 \text{ MHz}$ apart within the frequency range of $2402 \text{ MHz}$ to $2480 \text{ MHz}$. This approach is intended to reduce interference from other devices operating in the same vicinity.

When two Bluetooth devices wish to connect, they must first undergo a pairing process. In this stage, one device, referred to as the 'master,' emits a signal to which another device, known as the 'slave,' can respond. Once the devices are paired, they can remember each other, enabling automatic reconnection in the future. The pairing process typically requires the user to confirm a code on both devices, although the specifics may vary based on the devices and their settings.

Bluetooth devices are capable of connecting with multiple devices simultaneously, forming a network called a 'piconet.' This configuration consists of one master device and up to seven active slave devices. Additional devices can enter a 'parked' state, remaining synchronized with the piconet without actively participating, and they can join when another device disconnects.

Over the years, Bluetooth technology has progressed significantly, with various versions introducing enhancements in range, speed, and power efficiency. For instance, Bluetooth 5.0, the latest version as of 2021, provides four times the range, twice the speed, and eight times the data broadcasting capacity compared to Bluetooth 4.2.

In summary, Bluetooth technology utilizes radio waves for establishing short-range connections and data exchanges between devices. It incorporates frequency-hopping spread spectrum to mitigate interference, and devices must pair before they can connect. Multiple devices can link together to create a piconet, and the technology has advanced over time, delivering improved range, speed, and data broadcasting capabilities.
