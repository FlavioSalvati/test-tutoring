Imperative programming languages define the procedures to achieve a specific outcome, whereas declarative languages focus on specifying the desired outcome itself.

Imperative programming languages, such as $C$, $Java$, and $Python$, are built on the principle of instructing the computer with a sequence of tasks to execute. These tasks consist of commands that the computer follows in a systematic, step-by-step manner. The emphasis of imperative programming lies in detailing how the program operates, with explicit instructions that modify the program's state. Essentially, the imperative approach requires you to provide clear directions on the exact steps the computer should take to solve a problem or accomplish a goal.

In contrast, declarative programming languages—such as $SQL$, $Prolog$, and $HTML$—concentrate on articulating the desired result rather than detailing the process to achieve it. They express the logic behind a computation without specifying the control flow. This means you indicate what you want to be accomplished, and the computer determines how to execute it. For instance, in $SQL$, a user might request to select data from a database without outlining the specific steps to retrieve that data; the database management system handles the execution of the query.

The primary distinction between these two programming paradigms lies in their approaches to problem-solving. Imperative programming resembles a cookbook recipe: it provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to obtaining the desired result. On the other hand, declarative programming is akin to placing an order at a restaurant: you specify what you want, and the chef (or, in this context, the computer) decides the optimal way to fulfill your request.

Both programming styles have their respective advantages and disadvantages. Imperative programming can offer greater efficiency and control, but it may also introduce complexity and be more challenging to verify. Declarative programming tends to be more straightforward and easier to comprehend, yet it might not be as efficient, and you have less control over the underlying operations of your program. By understanding both approaches, you can select the most appropriate tool for a given task and enhance your versatility as a programmer.
