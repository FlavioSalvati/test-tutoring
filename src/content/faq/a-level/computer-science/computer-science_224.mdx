A one-to-many relationship in a database is established through the use of foreign keys in the related tables.

In the context of a relational database, a one-to-many relationship occurs when a single record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table. This type of relationship is quite common and is realized through the use of primary and foreign keys.

To illustrate this concept, let's consider an example involving a school database, which includes two tables: 'Teachers' and 'Students'. In this scenario, each teacher can have multiple students, while each student is assigned to only one teacher. This situation exemplifies a classic one-to-many relationship.

The 'Teachers' table contains a primary key, which is typically a unique identifier for each teacher, such as $Teacher\_ID$. Similarly, the 'Students' table has its own primary key, $Student\_ID$. To implement the one-to-many relationship, we introduce a foreign key in the 'Students' table, which we can designate as $Teacher\_ID$. This foreign key establishes a link between each student and their corresponding teacher.

In this setup, the $Teacher\_ID$ in the 'Students' table serves as a foreign key that references the $Teacher\_ID$ in the 'Teachers' table. This mechanism allows the database to maintain the relationship between teachers and their students. If you wish to identify all the students assigned to a particular teacher, you would query the 'Students' table for all records where the $Teacher\_ID$ matches the $Teacher\_ID$ of the specified teacher.

It is crucial to understand that the foreign key in the 'Students' table must permit duplicate values, as multiple students can share the same teacher. In contrast, the primary key in the 'Teachers' table must remain unique, ensuring that each teacher is distinctly identified.

In summary, a one-to-many relationship in a database is implemented by incorporating a foreign key in the 'many' table that references the primary key in the 'one' table. This structure enables multiple records in the 'many' table to be linked to a single record in the 'one' table.
