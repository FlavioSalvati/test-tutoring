The insertion sort algorithm sorts a list by incrementally building a sorted array, one element at a time.

Insertion sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that resembles the method you might use to sort playing cards in your hand. It begins with the second element in the list and compares it to the first. If the second element is smaller, it swaps places with the first. The algorithm then proceeds to the next element, comparing it with all preceding elements and swapping as necessary until it finds its correct position. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

You can visualize the algorithm as dividing the list into two regions: a sorted region and an unsorted region. The sorted region initially contains just the first element. With each iteration, one element from the unsorted region is placed into its appropriate position within the sorted region. This cycle repeats until there are no more elements left in the unsorted region, resulting in a fully sorted list.

Insertion sort is particularly efficient for small lists or for lists that are already partially sorted. However, it can be less efficient for larger lists due to its time complexity. In the worst-case scenario, where the list is sorted in reverse order, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$ because each element must be compared with every other element. In contrast, the best-case scenario occurs when the list is already sorted, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$, as each element only requires a single comparison.

Regarding space complexity, insertion sort is highly efficient because it only requires a constant amount of additional memory for the element currently being sorted. This characteristic makes it an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not need extra space proportional to the size of the input list.

In summary, while insertion sort may not be the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets, its simplicity and effectiveness for small or partially sorted lists make it a valuable tool in a programmer's toolkit.
