The Gnome Sort algorithm is a straightforward sorting technique that organizes numbers by comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them when necessary.

Also referred to as the "Stupid Sort," the Gnome Sort algorithm is both simple and effective. Its name is derived from the traditional methods employed by Dutch garden gnomes. While it operates similarly to the Insertion Sort, it is generally easier to implement.

The algorithm starts at the first element of the array (position $0$). It compares the current element with the next one. If the current element is less than or equal to the next, the algorithm moves one step forward. However, if the current element is greater, it swaps the two elements and takes a step backward. If the algorithm is at the beginning of the array and needs to move backward, it will instead advance one step forward.

This process of moving forward to compare, swapping when necessary, and stepping backward continues until the algorithm reaches the end of the array. By this point, the array is sorted in ascending order.

Although Gnome Sort is not the most efficient sorting method, exhibiting a worst-case and average time complexity of $O(n^2)$, it is appreciated for its simplicity and ease of understanding. Additionally, it is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires no extra space for sorting.

In summary, the Gnome Sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are out of order. It advances when the elements are correctly ordered and retreats when they are not, continuing this until the entire array is sorted. This method is reminiscent of how a gnome might organize his garden!
