An exponential number in a computer system is represented using floating-point notation.

Floating-point notation is a technique employed to represent real numbers in computer systems, accommodating both extremely large and very small values. This method is based on scientific notation, which you may have encountered previously in mathematics. In scientific notation, numbers are expressed as the product of two components: a base number and an exponent. For instance, the number $300$ can be represented as $3 \times 10^2$ in scientific notation.

In computer systems, floating-point notation operates similarly but utilizes binary numbers instead of decimal. A floating-point number is composed of three parts: a sign bit, an exponent, and a fraction (also referred to as the significand or mantissa). The sign bit indicates whether the number is positive or negative, the exponent denotes the power to which the base number is raised, and the fraction represents the base number itself.

The IEEE 754 standard defines the format for floating-point arithmetic. According to this standard, single-precision floating-point numbers are represented using $32$ bits: $1$ bit for the sign, $8$ bits for the exponent, and $23$ bits for the fraction. In contrast, double-precision floating-point numbers utilize $64$ bits, comprising $1$ bit for the sign, $11$ bits for the exponent, and $52$ bits for the fraction.

This representation of exponential numbers enables a broad range of values with varying levels of precision. However, it is crucial to recognize that not all real numbers can be precisely represented, which can lead to rounding errors. This characteristic is a fundamental aspect of numerical computation that computer scientists must consider.

In summary, exponential numbers are represented in computer systems using floating-point notation, a binary adaptation of scientific notation. While this method allows for the representation of a vast range of values, it also introduces the potential for rounding errors.
