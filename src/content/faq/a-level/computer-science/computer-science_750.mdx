A Cartesian tree is a specific type of binary tree constructed from a sequence of numbers, and it plays an essential role in various applications within data structures.

In a Cartesian tree, each node corresponds to a number from the original sequence. The construction of the tree ensures that it adheres to the properties of both a binary search tree and a heap. This means that an in-order traversal of the tree will yield the original sequence, and the parent of any given node is the minimum value found in the subsequence to the left or right of that node in the original input.

The root of the Cartesian tree is the minimum number from the sequence. To build the tree, you begin with this root and recursively add the remaining numbers. For each subsequent number, you traverse as far right in the tree as possible until you encounter a node that is less than the number you are trying to insert. This node will serve as the parent of the new number, while any right child of this node will become the left child of the new number.

Cartesian trees have numerous applications in computer science. They are instrumental in constructing range minimum query data structures, which allow for the efficient retrieval of the minimum value within a specified range of numbers. Additionally, they are utilized in the creation of suffix trees, which are vital for string matching algorithms. Cartesian trees can also help address the nearest smaller values problem, which involves finding the closest number that is smaller than each number in a sequence.

In summary, a Cartesian tree is a versatile data structure that effectively combines the characteristics of binary search trees and heaps. It is constructed from a sequence of numbers and finds utility in various applications, including range minimum queries, string matching, and solving the nearest smaller values problem.
