The gnome sort algorithm is a sorting technique that organizes numbers by comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them when necessary.

Also referred to as the "stupid sort," the gnome sort algorithm is straightforward yet effective. Its name is derived from the traditional behavior of the Dutch Garden Gnome. While it operates similarly to insertion sort, gnome sort is easier to implement.

The algorithm begins at the first element of the array (indexed at $0$). It then compares the current element with the next one. If the current element is smaller than the next, or if the next element is the last in the array, the algorithm advances one position forward. Conversely, if the current element is larger, it swaps the two elements and steps back one position. If the current element is at the start of the array and there is no previous element, it simply moves forward.

This process of moving forward to compare elements, swapping when necessary, and stepping backward continues until the algorithm reaches the end of the array. At this point, the array will be sorted in ascending order.

While the gnome sort algorithm is not the most efficient sorting method—exhibiting a worst-case and average time complexity of $O(n^2)$—it is appreciated for its simplicity and ease of understanding. Additionally, it operates in-place, requiring no extra space.

In summary, the gnome sort algorithm sorts numbers by continuously swapping adjacent elements that are out of order. It moves forward when elements are correctly positioned and backward when they are not, ultimately achieving a fully sorted array. This method, reminiscent of how a gnome would tidy his garden, provides a clear and intuitive approach to sorting.
