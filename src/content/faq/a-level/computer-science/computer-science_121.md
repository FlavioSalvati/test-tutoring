An operating system manages interrupt processing by temporarily suspending the current process to address an interrupt request.

When an interrupt occurs, the operating system's primary responsibility is to oversee the interruption and ensure that the system continues to function seamlessly. The process begins with the CPU halting its execution of the ongoing process and saving its state for later resumption. This step is essential as it enables the system to return to the exact moment it was interrupted once the interrupt has been resolved.

Subsequently, the operating system identifies the type of interrupt and executes the corresponding Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). The ISR is a specialized piece of code specifically designed to handle a particular type of interrupt. For example, if the interrupt originates from a peripheral device such as a mouse or keyboard, the ISR will process the input and forward it to the appropriate software application. Conversely, if the interrupt is due to a system error or exception, the ISR will attempt to rectify the issue or, if necessary, terminate the problematic process.

After the ISR has completed its tasks, the operating system restores the CPU's state to resume the interrupted process. This involves reloading the saved state of the process from memory, allowing it to continue execution from the point it was interrupted, as if the interrupt had not occurred.

It is important to note that the operating system prioritizes interrupts based on their urgency. Certain interrupts, such as those indicating a critical system error, are assigned high priority and processed immediately. In contrast, lower-priority interrupts, like those from peripheral devices, may be queued until the CPU becomes available.

In summary, the operating system plays a vital role in managing interrupt processing. It ensures that interrupts are handled efficiently and effectively, allowing the system to maintain continuous operation despite interruptions. This management includes saving and restoring the CPU's state, executing the appropriate ISR, and prioritizing interrupts according to their urgency.
