HTTP/2 enhances web performance through several key features, including multiplexing, header compression, and server push. These advancements collectively reduce latency and accelerate page loading times.

HTTP/2, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2, represents a significant update to the HTTP network protocol that powers the World Wide Web. This version introduces several crucial enhancements that dramatically improve web performance. One of the standout features is multiplexing, which enables the simultaneous transmission of multiple requests and responses over a single TCP connection. In contrast, HTTP/1.1 requires establishing a new TCP connection for each individual request/response pair, resulting in increased latency and slower page load speeds.

Another notable feature of HTTP/2 is header compression. HTTP headers frequently contain considerable amounts of redundant information, which can hinder web performance. To address this, HTTP/2 employs a compression algorithm known as HPACK. This algorithm effectively reduces the size of headers, minimizing the amount of data that must be transferred and, consequently, enhancing page load times.

HTTP/2 also introduces server push, a feature that allows a server to proactively send resources to a client before the client explicitly requests them. This capability can significantly expedite page loading. For instance, when a client requests an HTML document, the server can simultaneously send the associated CSS and JavaScript files, eliminating the need to wait for separate requests. This approach reduces the number of round-trip times (RTTs) necessary to fully load a page, thereby improving overall web performance.

In addition to these primary features, HTTP/2 includes several other enhancements, such as stream prioritization, which allows more critical requests to be processed before less important ones, and flow control, which prevents a sender from overwhelming a receiver with excessive data. Together, these features make HTTP/2 a formidable tool for optimizing web performance.

While HTTP/2 offers significant improvements, it is essential to recognize that it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Other factors, such as the quality of a website's code and the speed of a user's internet connection, also play vital roles in determining web performance. Nevertheless, by implementing multiplexing, header compression, and server push, HTTP/2 can substantially reduce latency and enhance page loading speeds.
