A Patricia tree is a specialized data structure that serves as a compressed trie, designed for the efficient storage and retrieval of strings.

The acronym "Patricia" stands for "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric," and this data structure was introduced by Donald R. Morrison in 1968. The Patricia tree is a variant of a radix tree (also known as a prefix tree) that optimizes space by compressing paths in the trie that have only a single child node. This compression reduces space complexity and enhances the efficiency of operations.

In a Patricia tree, each node represents a string (or a segment of a string), and each edge signifies a binary digit that distinguishes between the strings. The leaf nodes of the tree hold the complete strings, while the internal nodes contain indexes pointing to the bit positions in the strings that enable differentiation. This design allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, which can all be accomplished in $O(k)$ time, where $k$ represents the length of the string.

To illustrate how a Patricia tree functions, let's consider an example where we want to store the words 'to', 'tea', 'ted', 'ten', 'A', 'i', and 'in'. We begin by creating a root node with an empty string. For each word, we traverse the tree starting from the root, following the path defined by the binary digits of the word. If we encounter a node that lacks a child corresponding to the next digit, we create a new node and continue this process until all words have been inserted. The resulting Patricia tree will have each word stored in a leaf node, with the path from the root to the leaf reflecting the binary digits of the respective word.
