The big-O notation for the quicksort algorithm is $O(n \log n)$ for both the best and average cases, while it is $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.

Quicksort is a widely-used sorting algorithm that employs the divide-and-conquer strategy to organize elements efficiently. Big-O notation provides a mathematical framework to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. For quicksort, the time complexities are as follows: $O(n \log n)$ for both the best and average cases, and $O(n^2)$ for the worst case.

### Best Case Scenario
The best-case scenario occurs when the pivot element selected is consistently the median of the array. In this situation, the algorithm divides the array into two equal halves at each recursive step, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$. This is because the array is halved with each partition (which contributes $\log n$ steps), and finding the pivot requires $n$ operations at each step.

### Average Case Scenario
In the average case, the time complexity remains $O(n \log n)$, even if the array is not split perfectly in half. This is due to the fact that the splits are still reasonably balanced. As a result, the overall time complexity approximates that of the best case.

### Worst Case Scenario
Conversely, the worst-case scenario occurs when the pivot element is either the smallest or largest element in the array. This results in highly uneven partitions, or in some cases, no partitioning at all. Consequently, the time complexity deteriorates to $O(n^2)$, as the algorithm must iterate through all $n$ elements for each of the $n$ recursive calls.
