Cuckoo hashing is a technique used in computer programming to resolve hash collisions within a hash table.

This method employs open addressing, where each key is linked to two possible positions in the hash table, determined by two distinct hash functions. The term "cuckoo hashing" is inspired by the behavior of the cuckoo bird, which lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, often displacing the resident eggs in the process. In a similar manner, when a new key is inserted into the hash table and one of its designated positions is already occupied, the existing key is "kicked out" and relocated to its alternate position, thus making space for the new key. This displacement process may need to be repeated multiple times, as moving the displaced key can, in turn, displace another key, leading to a chain reaction.

One of the primary advantages of cuckoo hashing is its worst-case constant lookup time. In contrast to other open addressing techniques, such as linear probing or double hashing, where the time complexity for lookup operations can increase linearly with the number of keys in the table, cuckoo hashing guarantees that every lookup operation will require at most two attempts, irrespective of the number of keys present. This characteristic makes it particularly advantageous for applications where rapid lookup times are essential.

However, cuckoo hashing does have certain drawbacks. A significant concern is that the insertion of a new key can potentially create an infinite loop if a cycle of displacements occurs. To mitigate this risk, most cuckoo hashing implementations set a maximum limit on the number of displacements allowed during a single insertion attempt. If this limit is exceeded, the hash table is typically resized, and all keys are rehashed. This resizing process can lead to increased time complexity for the insertion operation.

Another challenge associated with cuckoo hashing is the requirement for two independent and uniformly distributed hash functions. Designing such hash functions can be difficult, and suboptimal choices may result in a high rate of hash collisions and inefficient utilization of the hash table. Despite these challenges, cuckoo hashing remains a popular choice for hash table implementations due to its strong performance in lookup operations.
