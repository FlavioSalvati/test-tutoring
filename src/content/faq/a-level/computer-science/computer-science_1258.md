Linkers, also referred to as link editors, play a pivotal role in the program compilation process. When a program is structured into multiple source files, each of these files is compiled into an object file. These object files contain machine code as well as unresolved symbols—references to functions or variables defined in other object files. The primary function of the linker is to merge these separate object files into a single executable file while resolving all symbol references.

The linking process begins with the linker examining each object file to create a symbol table. This table includes the names and locations of all functions and variables defined across the object files. After constructing the symbol table, the linker scans through each object file again to identify any unresolved symbols. For each unresolved symbol, the linker checks the symbol table to find its definition and subsequently replaces the unresolved symbol with the corresponding address.

Beyond resolving symbol references, the linker is responsible for organizing the various sections of the object files into a coherent order in the final executable. For instance, it may consolidate all code sections from different object files, followed by the data sections. Additionally, the linker ensures that any initialization code is positioned at the beginning of the executable, allowing it to execute prior to any other operations.

Occasionally, the linker may encounter the same symbol defined in multiple object files, which is referred to as a 'linker error.' This situation typically indicates a mistake in the program, such as the unintentional definition of the same function more than once. In such cases, the linker will report the error and halt the linking process.

In summary, the linker is an essential tool in transforming source code into an executable program. It takes multiple object files, each containing unresolved symbols, and combines them into a single executable file with all symbols fully resolved.
