The hexadecimal representation of the octal number $643$ is $1C3$.

To convert an octal number to hexadecimal, we must first convert the octal number to binary, and then convert the resulting binary number to hexadecimal.

Let's begin with the octal number $643$. Each digit in an octal number corresponds to three binary digits. Therefore, we will convert each digit individually. The binary representation of $6$ (in octal) is $110$, for $4$ it is $100$, and for $3$ it is $011$. Consequently, the binary representation of the octal number $643$ is $110100011$.

Next, we will convert this binary number to hexadecimal. Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents four binary digits, so we need to group the binary number into sets of four, starting from the right. If necessary, we can add leading zeros to the leftmost group to ensure it contains four digits. In this instance, we do not require any leading zeros, and we obtain the groups $1101$ and $00011$.

The hexadecimal equivalent of the binary group $1101$ is $D$, while the group $00011$ corresponds to $3$. Therefore, the hexadecimal representation of the binary number $110100011$ (and by extension, the original octal number $643$) is $D3$.

However, there was an error in the grouping. The correct grouping should be $0001$ and $10100011$. The hexadecimal representation of $0001$ (in binary) is $1$, and the representation of $10100011$ is $C3$. Thus, the correct hexadecimal representation of the binary number $110100011$ (and hence the original octal number $643$) is $1C3$.

While this conversion process may appear complex initially, it becomes more manageable with practice. It's also important to note that there are various online tools available that can perform these conversions for you. Nonetheless, understanding the underlying process is crucial for a solid grasp of number systems in computer science.
