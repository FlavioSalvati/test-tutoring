A directed graph features edges that have a specific orientation, whereas an undirected graph consists of edges that possess no inherent direction.

In a directed graph, commonly referred to as a digraph, each edge is characterized by an orientation. This implies that each edge can be viewed as an ordered pair of vertices, where the sequence of the vertices is significant. For instance, if there is an edge from vertex $A$ to vertex $B$, it does not necessarily mean that there is a corresponding edge from vertex $B$ to vertex $A$. This property renders directed graphs particularly effective for modeling asymmetric relationships, such as "is a parent of" or "is a supervisor of."

Conversely, an undirected graph contains edges that lack direction. In this setting, each edge is represented as an unordered pair of vertices, meaning that the sequence of the vertices is inconsequential. If there exists an edge between vertex $A$ and vertex $B$, it automatically implies that there is also an edge from vertex $B$ to vertex $A$. This quality makes undirected graphs well-suited for depicting symmetric relationships, such as "is a friend of" or "is connected to."

The decision to utilize either a directed or undirected graph hinges on the nature of the relationships being represented. When the relationships are symmetric, an undirected graph is the appropriate choice. Conversely, if the relationships are asymmetric, a directed graph is more suitable.

In terms of visual representation, directed graphs are typically illustrated with arrows indicating the direction of the edges, while undirected graphs are depicted with simple lines connecting the vertices. Mathematically, directed graphs are represented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists where the order of the vertices is significant, whereas undirected graphs are represented with symmetric adjacency matrices or adjacency lists where the order of the vertices is not crucial.

In conclusion, the primary distinction between directed and undirected graphs lies in the presence or absence of direction in their edges. This difference fundamentally influences how the relationships between vertices are represented and interpreted.
