Overlay linking is a technique utilized in computer programming to optimize memory management by loading only the essential parts of a program into memory when needed.

To elaborate, overlay linking allows a program to exceed the limits of a computer's available memory. This is achieved by partitioning the program into distinct, self-contained segments known as 'overlays'. These overlays are dynamically loaded into memory as required during program execution. This approach is especially beneficial in systems with constrained memory resources, enabling the execution of large programs without necessitating that all components be loaded simultaneously.

The structure of these overlays is typically established during the linking process. The linker generates an overlay map, which serves as a blueprint for how the overlays will be loaded into memory. This map is crucial for managing the loading and unloading of overlays at runtime.

The primary advantage of overlay linking lies in its ability to facilitate efficient memory usage. By loading only the necessary segments of a program, it minimizes the overall memory footprint. This efficiency can enhance performance, particularly in environments with limited memory availability.

However, overlay linking is not without its challenges. It can complicate the development and debugging of programs, as developers must meticulously manage the dependencies among various program components. Furthermore, the process of loading and unloading overlays can introduce additional overhead, potentially affecting the program's overall performance.

In contemporary computing, overlay linking is less prevalent due to advancements in hardware that have significantly increased available memory. Nevertheless, it remains a critical concept in computer science, particularly in the realm of embedded systems and other scenarios where memory resources are limited.
