Structured programming languages employ a top-down design methodology and utilize control structures, whereas unstructured languages lack such defined rules and frameworks.

Structured programming languages aim to enhance the clarity, quality, and efficiency of software development by heavily relying on components such as subroutines, block structures, and control loops like "for" and "while." This top-down design paradigm involves breaking down a system into smaller, manageable subsystems. Such an approach facilitates the use of control structures—sequences, loops, and decision-making constructs—that dictate the order of instruction execution. Notable examples of structured programming languages include C, Java, and Python.

In contrast, unstructured programming languages do not conform to these specific guidelines or structures. They are typically organized as a sequential list of commands or statements, executed from the top down. This format can make the code more challenging to read and comprehend, especially in larger programs. Unstructured languages are often utilized for scripting or rapid prototyping, where their straightforward syntax allows for quick development. Examples of unstructured programming languages include Assembly and early variants of BASIC.

The primary distinction between structured and unstructured programming languages lies in their approach to program design and execution. Structured programming languages promote a more organized and systematic method of coding, resulting in more reliable and maintainable software. They also offer greater power and flexibility, enabling the development of complex programs. Conversely, while unstructured programming languages are generally simpler and easier to learn, they can lead to disorganized and inefficient code if not used judiciously.

In summary, structured programming languages leverage a top-down design approach and specific control structures to direct instruction execution, ultimately producing code that is more reliable and maintainable. In contrast, unstructured programming languages lack these defined structures, which can result in messy and inefficient code if not applied carefully.
