Wired networks use physical cables for connection, while wireless networks use radio waves or infrared signals for connectivity.

, as the name suggests, involve the use of physical cables and wires to connect different devices in a . This could be in the form of Ethernet cables, fibre optic cables, or other types of data cables. The devices in a wired network are physically linked, which often results in a stable and fast connection. Wired networks are typically used in settings where high-speed, reliable connections are necessary, such as in offices or data centres. They are also commonly used in home networks, particularly for devices that require a stable internet connection, like gaming consoles or desktop computers.

On the other hand, do not require any physical connection between devices. Instead, they use radio waves or infrared signals to transmit data. This type of network is commonly used in homes, cafes, and other public places, where mobility and convenience are prioritised. Devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets typically connect to the internet via wireless networks. These networks are created using wireless routers that broadcast a network signal, which devices can then connect to.

The main advantage of wired networks is their stability and speed. Because the devices are physically connected, there is less chance of interference or signal loss, which can result in faster data transfer speeds. However, the downside is that setting up a wired network can be more complex and costly, due to the need for physical infrastructure.

Wireless networks, meanwhile, offer the advantage of mobility and ease of setup. Devices can connect to a wireless network anywhere within its range, without the need for any physical connection. This makes it easier to add or remove devices from the network. However, wireless networks can be more susceptible to interference and signal loss, which can affect the quality of the connection.

Wired networks require physical cables to connect devices, offering fast and stable connections, ideal for high-speed needs. Wireless networks use radio waves for connectivity, providing the flexibility to connect devices anywhere within range. While wired networks are reliable and quick but costly to set up, wireless networks are convenient and easy to install but may face interference, affecting connection quality.
