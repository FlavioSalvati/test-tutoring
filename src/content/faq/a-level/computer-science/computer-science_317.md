The hexadecimal representation of the octal number $643$ is $1C3$.

To convert an octal number to hexadecimal, we first need to convert the octal number into binary, and then convert that binary number into hexadecimal.

Let's begin with the octal number $643$. Each digit in an octal number corresponds to three binary digits. We can convert each digit separately: the binary representation of $6$ (in octal) is $110$, the binary representation of $4$ is $100$, and the binary representation of $3$ is $011$. Therefore, the complete binary representation of the octal number $643$ is $110100011$.

Next, we will convert this binary number into hexadecimal. Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents four binary digits. To do this, we group the binary number into sets of four, starting from the right. If necessary, we can add leading zeros to the leftmost group to ensure it forms a complete set of four digits. In this case, we need to add a leading zero, resulting in the groups $0001$ and $10100011$.

Now we convert these binary groups to their hexadecimal equivalents. The hexadecimal representation of $0001$ (in binary) is $1$, and the hexadecimal representation of $10100011$ (in binary) can be determined by breaking it down further: $1010$ corresponds to $A$ and $0011$ corresponds to $3$. Thus, $10100011$ converts to $A3$.

Combining these results, the correct hexadecimal representation of the binary number $110100011$ (and consequently the original octal number $643$) is $1A3$.

This conversion process might seem complex initially, but it becomes more intuitive with practice. It is also beneficial to explore online tools that can perform these conversions automatically. However, gaining an understanding of the underlying process is crucial for a solid grasp of number systems in computer science.
