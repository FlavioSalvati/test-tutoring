The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) facilitates the transfer of files over a network by establishing a connection between a client and a server for data exchange.

FTP is a standard network protocol designed for transferring computer files between a client and a server on a computer network. It operates on a client-server model architecture and utilizes distinct control and data connections between the client and the server. This dual connection system is a key characteristic of the FTP protocol.

When a file transfer is initiated, the client first connects to the server to establish the primary control connection. After this connection is set up, the client can send commands to the server to navigate directories, list files, and perform various operations. The server processes these commands and provides feedback through the same control connection, updating the client on the status of the requested operations.

To facilitate the actual file transfer, a separate data connection is established. This can occur in one of two modes: active mode or passive mode. In active mode, the server establishes the data connection to the client, whereas, in passive mode, the client initiates the data connection to the server. The choice between these modes often depends on factors such as firewall configurations and network settings.

Once the data connection is successfully established, the file transfer commences. The FTP protocol supports both binary and ASCII transfer modes, enabling the transfer of both text and binary files. The client can specify the preferred file transfer type prior to beginning the transfer.

After the file transfer is completed, the data connection is terminated, but the control connection remains active for subsequent commands. This allows the client to initiate additional file transfers or to close the control connection to terminate the FTP session.

In conclusion, the FTP protocol efficiently transfers files over a network by establishing a dual connection between the client and server. One connection is dedicated to control commands and responses, while the other is reserved for the actual file transfer, thus enabling flexible and effective file exchanges across networks.
