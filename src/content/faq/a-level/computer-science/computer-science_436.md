A split tree is a specialized data structure employed in computational geometry to efficiently handle range queries.

Also referred to as a range tree, a split tree is a binary tree designed to store a collection of points. Each node in the tree corresponds to an interval or range of values. The structure of the tree ensures that for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree represent intervals that are entirely less than that of the node itself, while all nodes in the right subtree represent intervals that are entirely greater. This organization allows for the quick identification of specific intervals or ranges, which proves particularly beneficial in computational geometry tasks, such as determining all points that fall within a particular range.

To construct a split tree, the initial step involves sorting the list of points. Following this, the list is recursively divided into two halves until each interval contains a single point. This process results in a balanced binary tree, where the height of the tree is logarithmic in relation to the number of points, specifically proportional to $\log(n)$, where $n$ represents the number of points. Consequently, the time complexity for searching a specific interval within the tree is $O(\log n)$, which is significantly faster than linear search methods.

In addition to handling range queries, split trees are also adept at resolving nearest neighbor queries. In this scenario, the objective is to identify the point closest to a given query point. This is achieved by traversing the tree to locate the node that represents the interval containing the query point, followed by comparing the distance from the query point to the distances of points in adjacent intervals.

Furthermore, split trees serve as foundational components in the construction of other data structures used in computational geometry, such as segment trees and interval trees. These structures facilitate various tasks, including detecting intersections between line segments and identifying all intervals that overlap with a specified interval. The versatility and efficiency of split trees make them an essential tool in computational geometry, with applications spanning computer graphics, geographic information systems, and machine learning.
