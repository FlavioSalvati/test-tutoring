The flash sort algorithm is a sorting technique that organizes numbers by distributing them into multiple buckets and subsequently sorting each bucket individually.

Flash sort is classified as a distribution sort algorithm. This means it operates by allocating the numbers to be sorted into several distinct 'buckets'. The first step of the algorithm involves selecting a specific number of 'pivots', which serve to divide the range of numbers into equal intervals. Typically, the number of pivots is chosen to be approximately equal to the cube root of the total number of elements, denoted as $n$, which can be expressed mathematically as $\lceil n^{1/3} \rceil$.

Once the pivots are established, the algorithm distributes the numbers into their respective buckets. Each number is assigned to the bucket corresponding to the interval it falls within. For instance, if the chosen pivots are $10$, $20$, and $30$, the number $15$ would be placed into the second bucket, since it lies between $10$ and $20$.

After distributing all the numbers, the algorithm sorts each bucket individually. This sorting is typically performed using an efficient algorithm, such as quicksort or heapsort. These algorithms are particularly effective for sorting small lists, which is advantageous because each bucket generally contains only a limited number of elements.

Once all the buckets have been sorted, the algorithm concatenates them to form the final sorted list. This process involves appending each sorted bucket to the end of the preceding one. Since all buckets are sorted and arranged according to their respective pivot values, the final concatenated list will also be in sorted order.

The flash sort algorithm exhibits exceptional efficiency when the numbers to be sorted are uniformly distributed across the range. Under such circumstances, the algorithm can achieve a sorting time of linear complexity, $O(n)$, which outperforms any comparison-based sorting algorithms. However, if the numbers are not uniformly distributed, the algorithm may underperform and could potentially exhibit quadratic time complexity, $O(n^2)$, in the worst-case scenario.
