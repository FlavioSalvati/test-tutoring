In SQL, both the 'CHAR' and 'VARCHAR' data types are used to store string data in a database, but they differ significantly in how they manage storage and retrieval.

The 'CHAR' data type is fixed-length, which means it reserves a consistent amount of storage space for each entry, regardless of the actual length of the stored string. For instance, if you define a 'CHAR(10)' column, it will always consume 10 characters of storage. This holds true even if you only insert a string that is 2 characters long; the remaining 8 characters will be filled with blank spaces to maintain the fixed length.

Conversely, the 'VARCHAR' data type is variable-length. It utilizes only as much storage as the actual length of the string requires, plus a small amount of additional space to record the length of the data. For example, if you create a 'VARCHAR(10)' column and insert a string that is 2 characters long, only 2 characters of storage will be used (plus a bit more for length tracking). This characteristic can make 'VARCHAR' more space-efficient than 'CHAR', particularly when dealing with shorter strings.

However, this flexibility in storage comes with trade-offs. Since 'VARCHAR' must track the length of each individual value, it can be slower to retrieve data from a 'VARCHAR' column compared to a 'CHAR' column. This performance difference is particularly noticeable during operations that involve sorting or comparing values, as the database needs to account for the variable lengths of the 'VARCHAR' entries.

In summary, the primary distinction between 'CHAR' and 'VARCHAR' in SQL lies in their approach to data storage and retrieval. 'CHAR' is a fixed-length data type that consistently uses the same amount of storage space, whereas 'VARCHAR' is a variable-length data type that adapts its storage usage to fit the actual data length. While 'VARCHAR' offers greater space efficiency, it may incur slower retrieval times, especially in sorting and comparison operations.
