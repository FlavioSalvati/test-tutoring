In functional programming, queues and stacks are often implemented using recursive data structures, such as lists.

Functional programming languages, including Haskell and Lisp, utilize immutable data structures. This immutability means that once a data structure is created, it cannot be altered. Instead, any operation that would typically modify the data structure results in the creation of a new one. This characteristic is a core principle of functional programming and has significant implications for the implementation of data structures like queues and stacks.

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. In functional programming, a stack can be effectively represented as a singly linked list, where the head of the list corresponds to the top of the stack. The operation of pushing an element onto the stack is accomplished by prepending that element to the list, thereby creating a new list. Conversely, to pop an element off the stack, the tail of the list is returned, which also produces a new list. This method is efficient, as both operations can be performed in constant time, or $O(1)$.

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. Implementing a queue in a functional programming language poses more challenges than implementing a stack since the element to be removed is located at the end of the list instead of the beginning. A common solution to this challenge is to use a pair of lists. The first list, referred to as the front list, contains the elements of the queue in the correct order for removal, while the second list, known as the rear list, contains new elements to be enqueued in reverse order. When a new element is added to the queue, it is prepended to the rear list. When an element is to be removed from the queue, it is taken from the front list. If the front list is empty, the rear list is reversed and becomes the new front list. This strategy ensures that all operations have an amortized time complexity of $O(1)$.

In conclusion, functional programming languages leverage recursive data structures and the principle of immutability to implement queues and stacks. This approach differs from that of imperative programming languages, yet it results in efficient and elegant solutions.
