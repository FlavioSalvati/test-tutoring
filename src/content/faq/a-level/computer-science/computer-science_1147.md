The Comb Sort algorithm is an efficient sorting technique that improves upon the traditional Bubble Sort by comparing and swapping elements that are a specified distance apart, known as the "gap".

Unlike the Bubble Sort, which only compares adjacent elements, Comb Sort starts with a larger gap—often set to the length of the list being sorted—and gradually reduces this gap until it reaches $1$. At this point, the algorithm behaves like Bubble Sort.

The algorithm begins by initializing the gap to the length of the list. It then enters a loop where it compares each element with the element that is located $gap$ positions ahead. If these two elements are out of order, they are swapped. This process is repeated from the beginning of the list until a complete pass is made without any swaps, indicating that the list is sorted up to the current gap.

Once a pass is completed, the gap is reduced, typically by a factor of $1.3$. This particular reduction factor has been found to yield good performance in many practical scenarios. The algorithm then repeats the comparison and swapping process with the new, smaller gap. This cycle continues until the gap is reduced to $1$, at which point the algorithm switches to comparing and swapping adjacent elements until the entire list is sorted.

One of the key advantages of Comb Sort over Bubble Sort is its ability to effectively handle "turtles"—small values located near the end of the list that move towards the beginning very slowly in Bubble Sort. By utilizing a larger gap in its comparisons, Comb Sort can more rapidly reposition these smaller values.

In terms of computational complexity, Comb Sort generally performs well, achieving an average time complexity of $O\left(\frac{n^2}{2^p}\right)$ for a list of $n$ elements, where the gap reduction factor is $2^p$. However, in the worst-case scenario, its time complexity is $O(n^2)$, which is equivalent to that of Bubble Sort. Despite this, Comb Sort typically outperforms Bubble Sort in practical applications due to its enhanced efficiency in managing "turtles".
