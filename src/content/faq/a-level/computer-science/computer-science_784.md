The pancake sorting algorithm sorts a list by repeatedly flipping sections of it to position elements correctly.

Pancake sorting is a comparison-based sorting technique that employs a distinctive method to arrange a list of elements. The algorithm derives its name from the process of sorting a stack of pancakes by size using a spatula. The spatula can be inserted at any point in the stack to flip all pancakes above it. In a similar manner, the pancake sort allows for 'flipping' any prefix of the array.

The algorithm begins by identifying the maximum element in the list and flipping the segment from the start of the list to this maximum element. This action moves the largest element to the front of the list. Next, the entire list is flipped, subsequently placing the maximum element in its correct position at the end of the list. This process is repeated for the remaining portion of the list, excluding the last element each time, as it is already sorted.

For instance, consider the list $[3, 1, 4, 1]$. The maximum element is $4$. Thus, we flip the first three elements to obtain $[4, 1, 3, 1]$. Then, we flip the entire list, resulting in $[1, 3, 1, 4]$. At this point, the maximum element is correctly positioned. We continue this process for the rest of the list, progressively excluding the last element.

Despite its intriguing nature, the pancake sort algorithm is not commonly used in practice due to its inefficiency compared to other sorting algorithms. Its time complexity is $O(n^2)$, indicating that it takes significantly longer to sort larger lists than algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort. Nevertheless, pancake sorting is a captivating algorithm that showcases an alternative approach to sorting. Additionally, it serves as an excellent illustration of in-place sorting, as it requires only a small, constant amount of extra space to perform the sort.
