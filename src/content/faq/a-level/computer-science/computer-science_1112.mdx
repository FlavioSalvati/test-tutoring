Collision handling in hash tables is essential for resolving conflicts that arise when two keys hash to the same index.

In a hash table, data is organized in an array format, where each data entry is associated with a unique index. This index is computed using a hash function. However, there are instances when two different keys yield the same hash value, resulting in a collision. This is where collision handling techniques become necessary.

Several methods exist for handling collisions, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. One of the simplest methods is called **separate chaining**. In this approach, each cell in the hash table contains a pointer to a linked list of records that share the same hash. When a collision occurs, the new key is appended to the end of the corresponding list. While this method is straightforward and effective, it can lead to lengthy linked lists, which may degrade search performance.

Another approach is known as **open addressing**. In this method, all elements are stored directly in the hash table itself. When a collision occurs, the hash table searches for the next available slot to store the key. Open addressing tends to be more space-efficient than separate chaining; however, it can result in clustering, where a contiguous block of cells becomes filled, ultimately slowing down search times.

A more advanced technique is **double hashing**, which employs a second hash function to compute a new index in the event of a collision. This method can effectively mitigate the clustering problem, but it requires additional computational resources.

In summary, collision handling is a critical component of hash tables. It ensures that every key is mapped to a unique index, preventing data loss and facilitating efficient data retrieval. Without effective collision handling, the performance of a hash table can suffer significantly.
