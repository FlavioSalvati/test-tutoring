The octal representation of the binary number $11011011$ is $333$.

To convert a binary number to its octal equivalent, we start by grouping the binary digits into sets of three, beginning from the rightmost digit. If the total number of binary digits is not a multiple of three, we can add zeros to the left to complete the grouping. For the binary number $11011011$, we can organize it as $011 \, 011 \, 011$.

Next, we convert each group of three binary digits to its corresponding octal digit. The binary group $011$ translates to the octal digit $3$. Therefore, the octal representation of the binary number $11011011$ is indeed $333$.

This conversion process is straightforward because both octal and binary are base-2 numeral systems. Each octal digit represents exactly three binary digits, which simplifies the conversion. This characteristic contributed to the widespread use of octal in early computer systems. However, in contemporary computing, hexadecimal (base-16) has become more prevalent, as it aligns more closely with the byteâ€”the fundamental unit of information in modern computer architecture.
