The hexadecimal representation of the decimal number $1207$ is $4B7$.

To convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent, follow these steps: divide the decimal number by $16$ (since hexadecimal is a base-16 number system) and keep track of the remainder. The quotient obtained from each division is then divided by $16$ again, and this process continues until the quotient reaches zero. The hexadecimal number is formed by reading the remainders in reverse order.

Letâ€™s walk through the conversion of the decimal number $1207$ to hexadecimal step by step:

1. **First Division**: Divide $1207$ by $16$. The quotient is $75$ and the remainder is $7$. In hexadecimal, $7$ is represented as $7$.

2. **Second Division**: Next, divide the quotient $75$ by $16$. The new quotient is $4$ and the remainder is $11$. In hexadecimal, $11$ is represented as $B$.

3. **Third Division**: Finally, divide the new quotient $4$ by $16$. The quotient is now $0$ and the remainder is $4$. In hexadecimal, $4$ is represented as $4$.

Now, by reading the remainders in reverse order, we obtain $4B7$. Therefore, the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number $1207$ is $4B7$.

It is important to remember that in the hexadecimal system, the decimal numbers $10$ to $15$ are represented by the letters $A$ through $F$. Specifically, a remainder of $10$ is represented as $A$, $11$ as $B$, $12$ as $C$, $13$ as $D$, $14$ as $E$, and $15$ as $F$. This explains why, in our example, the remainder $11$ was represented as $B$.

This conversion method from decimal to hexadecimal is known as the division-remainder method. It is a fundamental concept in computer science, particularly useful in low-level programming and understanding how data is stored and manipulated at the hardware level.
