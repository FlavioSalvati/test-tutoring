The 'CONCAT' function in SQL is designed to merge two or more strings into a single string.

As a built-in function, 'CONCAT' enables you to concatenate, or join, multiple strings together seamlessly. This function proves especially useful when you need to combine data from distinct columns or strings to generate a new, unified string. The syntax for the 'CONCAT' function is simple: you write 'CONCAT', followed by the strings you wish to combine, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.

For instance, suppose you have a customer table with separate columns for first names and last names, and you want to create a full name column. You could employ the 'CONCAT' function as follows:

$$
SELECT CONCAT(first\_name, ' ', last\_name) AS 'Full Name'
FROM customers;
$$

In this example, 'first_name' and 'last_name' are the column names being combined, and the string '' '' represents a space character that separates the first and last names in the new 'Full Name' column. The 'AS' keyword is utilized to rename this new column.

It's essential to recognize that the 'CONCAT' function can accept any number of arguments, which can be any string valueâ€”this includes column names, string literals, or even the results of other functions. For example, you might use 'CONCAT' to combine a static string with a column value, as shown below:

$$
SELECT CONCAT('Customer: ', first\_name) AS 'Customer Name'
FROM customers;
$$

In this case, the static string ''Customer: '' is concatenated with the value in the 'first_name' column for each row in the 'customers' table.

Keep in mind that the 'CONCAT' function returns a new string that results from merging all the input strings. If any input string is 'NULL', 'CONCAT' treats it as an empty string. This feature is particularly beneficial because it allows you to use 'CONCAT' without the concern that 'NULL' values will lead to errors in your SQL queries.
