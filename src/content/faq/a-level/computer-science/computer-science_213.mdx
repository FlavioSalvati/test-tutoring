A database transaction is a fundamental unit of work executed within a database management system (DBMS) that manipulates a database.

More specifically, a database transaction consists of a sequence of one or more operations that are carried out as a single logical unit of work. These operations typically involve reading data from the database (known as a 'select' operation), writing data (which includes 'insert' or 'update' operations), or deleting data. Transactions play a critical role in database systems, as they are designed to uphold data integrity and consistency.

The concept of a transaction is grounded in four essential properties, collectively referred to as the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 

- **Atomicity** ensures that a transaction is treated as an indivisible unit of work, meaning it either completes in its entirety or does not complete at all. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, leaving the database unchanged.
  
- **Consistency** guarantees that a transaction transitions the database from one valid state to another, maintaining the integrity of the data throughout the process.

- **Isolation** ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions does not interfere with one another, resulting in a database state that is equivalent to that which would have been achieved had the transactions been executed sequentially.

- **Durability** provides the assurance that once a transaction has been committed, its changes will persist even in the event of a system failure.

Transactions are managed through two primary operations: 'commit' and 'rollback'. When a transaction is committed, the changes made to the database are saved and become visible to other transactions. Conversely, if a transaction is rolled back, all modifications made during that transaction are discarded, restoring the database to its state prior to the transaction's initiation.

In summary, a database transaction is a vital mechanism that allows multiple changes to a database to be bundled together into a single operation, thereby ensuring data integrity and consistency. This concept is essential in all major database systems and is crucial for maintaining the reliability and robustness of database applications.
