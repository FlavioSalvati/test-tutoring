Attributes in an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) are depicted as ovals that are connected to their corresponding entities through lines.

In the context of an Entity Relationship Diagram, attributes denote the properties or characteristics associated with an entity. Each attribute is represented as an oval linked to its entity, illustrating a specific piece of information relevant to that entity. For instance, if the entity is labeled as 'Student', the associated attributes might include 'Name', 'Age', 'Address', and so on.

There are several types of attributes in an ERD:

1. **Simple Attributes**: These attributes cannot be subdivided further. For example, 'Age' is a simple attribute of the 'Student' entity because it represents a singular value.

2. **Composite Attributes**: In contrast to simple attributes, composite attributes can be broken down into smaller components. For example, the 'Address' attribute can be divided into 'Street', 'City', 'Postcode', etc.

3. **Derived Attributes**: These attributes have values that can be calculated from other attributes. For example, 'Age' may be considered a derived attribute if the ERD includes a 'Date of Birth' attribute. In this case, 'Age' can be computed using the current date and the 'Date of Birth'.

4. **Multi-valued Attributes**: These attributes can hold multiple values for a single entity. For instance, a 'Student' entity could possess a 'Phone Number' attribute that accommodates various entries if the student has multiple phone numbers.

In an ERD, the representation of these different types of attributes varies:

- Simple and composite attributes are illustrated as ovals.
- Derived attributes are depicted using dashed ovals.
- Multi-valued attributes are shown as double-lined ovals.

In conclusion, attributes in an ERD are represented as ovals connected to their respective entities. They provide detailed information about the entities and come in various types, each represented distinctly within the diagram.
