Native code compilation directly translates source code into machine code, while intermediate code compilation first translates it into an intermediate language.

In native code compilation, the source code written by programmers is translated directly into machine code that can be executed by a specific type of processor. This results in code that is highly optimized for the target machine, leading to superior performance. However, this optimization comes at a cost: the compiled code is not portable. It cannot run on a different type of machine without recompilation because different processors have distinct instruction sets. Consequently, machine code generated for one processor type will not function on another.

Conversely, intermediate code compilation translates the source code into an intermediate language, often referred to as bytecode, before it is converted into machine code. This bytecode serves as a form of abstract machine code that can be executed by a virtual machine. The primary advantage of this method is portability; the bytecode can run on any machine equipped with the appropriate virtual machine, eliminating the need for recompilation. This feature makes intermediate code particularly well-suited for distributed systems where software may be executed on various types of machines. However, since the bytecode is not specifically optimized for any single machine, its performance may not match that of native code.

In summary, the decision between native code compilation and intermediate code compilation hinges on the specific requirements of the software being developed. If high performance is critical and the software is intended to run solely on a particular type of machine, then native code compilation is likely the optimal choice. On the other hand, if portability is more crucial, intermediate code compilation may be the better option.
