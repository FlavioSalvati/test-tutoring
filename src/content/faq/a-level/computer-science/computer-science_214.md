In SQL, handling NULL values requires the use of specific operators and functions designed to address these unique cases.

A NULL value in SQL represents an unknown or missing piece of information. It is crucial to understand that NULL is distinct from zero or empty spaces; a NULL value indicates the absence of any value. When SQL encounters NULL during data operations, it treats it as an unknown. Consequently, any arithmetic operation that involves NULL will always result in NULL. For instance, the expression $NULL + 10$ evaluates to $NULL$.

To effectively manage NULL values, SQL provides several operators and functions. The operators 'IS NULL' and 'IS NOT NULL' are used to check for the presence or absence of NULL values. For example, to select all rows in a table where a specific column contains a NULL value, you would use the following query:

$$
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IS NULL
$$

Conversely, if you want to select rows where a certain column is not NULL, you would employ the 'IS NOT NULL' operator, as in:

$$
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IS NOT NULL
$$

SQL also includes functions such as 'COALESCE' and 'NULLIF' to facilitate the handling of NULL values. The 'COALESCE' function returns the first non-NULL value from a list of values. For instance:

$$
SELECT COALESCE(NULL, 1, 2)
$$

This query would return $1$, as it is the first non-NULL value encountered in the list.

On the other hand, the 'NULLIF' function returns NULL if the two specified values are equal; otherwise, it returns the first value. For example:

$$
SELECT NULLIF(1, 1)
$$

This would yield NULL because the two values are equal.

Additionally, SQL provides functions like 'NVL' in Oracle and 'ISNULL' in SQL Server, which allow you to replace NULL values with a specified default value. For example, the query:

$$
SELECT NVL(column, 0) FROM table
$$

would return $0$ for any NULL values found in the 'column'.

In summary, effectively handling NULL values in SQL involves recognizing that they signify unknown or missing data and utilizing specific operators and functions to test for and manipulate these values.
