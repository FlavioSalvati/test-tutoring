In database design, a secondary key serves as an alternative method for retrieving and sorting data, distinct from the primary key.

More specifically, a secondary key—also referred to as a non-primary key—comprises one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a record, though it is not the primary key. While the primary key is the principal means of identifying records within a table, secondary keys offer additional avenues for accessing or retrieving these records. They are particularly beneficial when the primary key is unknown or when data must be sorted or obtained in a manner different from that provided by the primary key.

For example, consider a database table containing student information, where the primary key is the student ID. A secondary key could be the student's email address or phone number. These secondary keys enable data retrieval based on these attributes, even when the student ID is not readily available.

Additionally, secondary keys can enforce specific constraints or rules on the data. For instance, a secondary key may be implemented to ensure the uniqueness of email addresses within the student table, preventing multiple students from sharing the same email address in the database.

Furthermore, secondary keys facilitate the creation of indexes on the database table. An index is a data structure that enhances the efficiency of data retrieval operations. By establishing an index on a secondary key, you can significantly accelerate queries that utilize this key. For instance, if you frequently need to locate students by their email address, creating an index on the email address field (which serves as a secondary key) will optimize the speed of these queries.
