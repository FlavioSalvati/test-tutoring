Optical storage media, such as Compact Discs (CDs) and Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs), leverage laser technology to read and write data on their reflective surfaces.

The core mechanism behind optical storage involves the interaction between laser light and the disc's surface, which is typically coated with a reflective material. This technology relies on the precise manipulation of light to store and retrieve digital information.

The process of writing data onto the disc begins with a high-powered laser that creates microscopic indentations, referred to as pits, on the disc's surface. These pits are organized in a spiral track that extends from the center of the disc to its outer edge. The flat regions between the pits are known as lands. The arrangement of pits and lands encodes binary data (0s and 1s) that computers can interpret.

To read the stored data, a lower-powered laser is employed. This laser beam is directed toward the disc's surface and traverses the spiral track. The laser beam is reflected differently by the pits and lands: pits scatter the light due to their indented structure, while lands reflect the light directly back. This variation in reflection is detected by a photodiode sensor, which converts the information into binary data.

One of the primary advantages of optical storage devices is their durability and longevity. Unlike magnetic storage solutions, optical discs are not vulnerable to data loss from exposure to magnetic fields or mechanical failures. However, they do have some limitations. The total amount of data that can be stored is finite, constrained by the disc's physical size and the precision of the laser technology used. Additionally, the speed of data reading and writing is generally slower compared to other storage technologies.

In conclusion, optical storage devices like CDs and DVDs utilize lasers to create and read a pattern of pits and lands on a reflective surface, effectively representing binary data. This technology provides a reliable and durable method for data storage, though it does come with certain inherent limitations.
