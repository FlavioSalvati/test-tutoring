Dynamic hashing is an adaptive hashing technique that allows a data structure to grow and shrink dynamically as records are added or removed.

In contrast to traditional static hashing, where a hash function maps keys to a fixed number of buckets, dynamic hashing effectively addresses the challenges associated with overflow and uneven key distribution, particularly when the volume of keys is unpredictable or fluctuates over time. Dynamic hashing, often referred to as extendible hashing, enables the hash table to expand or contract as required.

The core concept of dynamic hashing involves using a directory that points to various buckets. Each bucket can accommodate a limited number of records. When a bucket becomes full due to an insertion, it is divided into two separate buckets, and the directory is updated accordingly to reflect this modification. The hash function in dynamic hashing generates a binary string representation of digits. Initially, the system considers only the first few digits, but as the table expands, it can incorporate additional digits, thereby effectively increasing the total number of available buckets.

For instance, if the system starts with a single bucket (denoted as $0$) and this bucket becomes full, it will split into two buckets, represented by $0$ and $1$. If the bucket denoted by $1$ subsequently becomes full, it will further split into two new buckets, represented by $10$ and $11$, and so forth. This incremental growth allows the hash table to expand without the need to rehash all existing keys, a process that can be computationally expensive.

Conversely, when a deletion results in a bucket becoming empty, it can be merged with another bucket, and the directory is updated to reflect this change. This functionality allows the hash table to reduce its size when necessary, thereby conserving memory.

In summary, dynamic hashing offers a flexible and efficient approach to managing hash tables with varying numbers of records. It effectively mitigates the issues of overflow and poor key distribution commonly encountered with static hashing, while also eliminating the need for costly rehashing operations.

**A-Level Computer Science Summary:** Dynamic hashing is a versatile method for organizing data that enables the system to adjust by expanding or contracting as items are added or removed. Unlike static hashing, which allocates fixed locations for data, dynamic hashing intelligently splits or merges buckets based on demand, ensuring efficient space utilization and preventing overflow. This adaptive method is particularly beneficial for handling fluctuating data sizes over time.
