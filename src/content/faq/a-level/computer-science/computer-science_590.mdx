The `LIKE` operator in SQL is a powerful tool used to search for a specified pattern within a column.

As a logical operator, `LIKE` evaluates whether a character string matches a given pattern. This pattern may consist of regular characters along with wildcard characters. You typically use the `LIKE` operator in the `WHERE` clause of `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.

There are two primary wildcard characters that can be used with the `LIKE` operator:

- The percent sign `$%$`: This wildcard represents zero, one, or multiple characters. For instance, the pattern `'a%'` will match any values that begin with the character `'a'`.
- The underscore `$_$`: This wildcard signifies a single character. For example, the pattern `'a_'` will find values that consist of two characters, with the first character being `'a'`.

It's important to note that the `LIKE` operator is case-sensitive. If you need to perform a case-insensitive search, you can use the `UPPER` or `LOWER` functions to convert the data to a uniform case.

Here is an example of how the `LIKE` operator can be applied in a SQL query:

$$
\text{SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE 'london%';}
$$

This SQL statement retrieves all customers whose city names begin with `'london'`. The `$%$` wildcard allows for any subsequent characters to follow after `'london'`, thereby matching any customer city that starts with this term.

Additionally, the `LIKE` operator is not confined to matching patterns solely at the beginning or end of a string. You can also utilize it to find matches within the middle of a string. For example, the pattern `'%don%'` would match any city name that contains the substring `'don'` at any position.

In summary, the `LIKE` operator in SQL serves as a robust mechanism for pattern matching within strings. It is commonly used in conjunction with the `WHERE` clause and can leverage wildcard characters to either broaden or narrow the search results effectively.
