Web browsers communicate with web servers through the exchange of HTTP requests and responses.

When you enter a URL into your web browser, it triggers a sequence of events to retrieve and display the desired webpage. This process commences with the browser sending an HTTP request to the web server that hosts the website. HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the standard protocol for transmitting data over the internet. It establishes a framework for how messages are formatted and transmitted, as well as the actions that web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.

The HTTP request generated by the browser encompasses several components, including the method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the URL, and additional information such as headers and body content. The method specifies the action that the server is to perform. For instance, a GET request is utilized to retrieve data from the server, while a POST request is employed to send data to the server.

Upon receipt of the HTTP request, the web server processes it and returns an HTTP response. This response consists of a status code, headers, and the requested content. The status code indicates whether the request was successful and provides further details regarding the outcome. For example, a status code of $200$ signifies that the request was successful, whereas a status code of $404$ indicates that the requested resource could not be found.

The headers included in the HTTP response furnish supplementary information about the response, such as content type, content length, and server details. The actual requested content, typically an HTML document, is contained within the body of the response.

Once the browser receives the HTTP response, it parses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript contained in the response to render the webpage. It may also issue additional HTTP requests for resources referenced within the HTML, such as images, stylesheets, and scripts.

In summary, the interaction between web browsers and web servers follows a request-response cycle. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, the server processes this request and returns an HTTP response, and the browser processes the response to display the webpage. This cycle is repeated for each resource that the browser needs to load the complete webpage.
