Cuckoo hashing is an effective strategy in computer programming for resolving hash collisions within a hash table.

This method employs open addressing, where each key is associated with two potential positions in the hash table, determined by two distinct hash functions. The term "cuckoo hashing" is inspired by the behavior of the cuckoo bird, which lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, displacing the resident eggs in the process. Similarly, when a new key is inserted into the hash table and one of its designated positions is already occupied, the existing key is "kicked out" and relocated to its alternative position, thereby creating space for the new key. This displacement process can repeat multiple times, as moving the displaced key may trigger the displacement of yet another key, and so forth.

One of the primary advantages of cuckoo hashing is its worst-case constant lookup time. In contrast to other open addressing techniques, such as linear probing or double hashing, where the time complexity of lookup operations can increase linearly with the number of keys in the table, cuckoo hashing guarantees that every lookup will require at most two attempts, regardless of the number of keys stored. This characteristic makes cuckoo hashing particularly beneficial for applications where rapid lookup times are essential.

However, cuckoo hashing does present some challenges. A notable concern is that the insertion of a new key can potentially result in an infinite loop if a cycle of displacements occurs. To mitigate this risk, most cuckoo hashing implementations impose a maximum limit on the number of displacements allowed for a single insertion attempt. If this limit is exceeded, the hash table is typically resized, and all keys must be rehashed, which can significantly increase the time complexity of the insertion operation.

Another potential drawback of cuckoo hashing is its requirement for two distinct hash functions, which must be independent and uniformly distributed to ensure efficient utilization of the hash table. Designing such hash functions can be challenging, and poor choices can lead to a high frequency of hash collisions and suboptimal performance. Despite these challenges, cuckoo hashing continues to be a popular choice for hash table implementations due to its strong performance in lookup operations.
