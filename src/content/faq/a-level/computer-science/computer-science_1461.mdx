A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains its balance through a combination of rotations and color changes during insertion and deletion operations.

In a red-black tree, each node has an additional attribute known as color, which can be either red or black. The tree's balance is upheld by a specific set of rules, referred to as the red-black properties, which are enforced during both insertion and deletion operations.

The red-black properties are defined as follows:
1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root node is always black.
3. All leaves (null or NIL nodes) are black.
4. If a node is red, then both of its children must be black.
5. Every path from a given node to its descendant leaves contains an equal number of black nodes.

When a new node is inserted or an existing node is deleted, these operations can potentially violate the red-black properties. To restore balance and ensure that the properties are maintained, the tree may require adjustments through a series of color changes and rotations.

Color changes are relatively simple: a red node can be changed to black, and vice versa. In contrast, rotations are more complex. There are two types of rotations: left rotation and right rotation. A rotation operation preserves the in-order traversal property of the binary search tree, thereby maintaining the order of the elements.

During the insertion or deletion process, the tree is traversed from the root to the appropriate leaf, making necessary rotations and color changes along the way. After completing the operation, a final verification is conducted to ensure that the root node remains black.

In summary, a red-black tree achieves balance by enforcing a series of properties through color changes and rotations during insertion and deletion operations. This mechanism ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, which facilitates efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
