The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) facilitates the transfer of files over a network by establishing a connection between a client and a server for data exchange.

FTP is a standard network protocol designed for transferring computer files between a client and a server within a computer network. It operates on a client-server architecture and utilizes separate connections for control and data transfer. This dual connection system is a key characteristic of the FTP protocol.

When a file transfer is initiated, the client first establishes a control connection to the server. This control connection allows the client to send commands for directory access, file listing, and other operations. The server responds to these commands through the same control connection, providing the client with feedback regarding the status of the requested operations.

For the actual transfer of files, a separate data connection is established. This can occur in one of two modes: active mode or passive mode. In active mode, the server initiates the data connection to the client. Conversely, in passive mode, the client initiates the data connection to the server. The choice between these modes often depends on factors such as firewall configurations and network settings.

Once the data connection is established, the file transfer commences. The FTP protocol supports both binary and ASCII transfer modes, enabling the transfer of text files as well as binary files. Prior to initiating the transfer, the client can specify the desired mode for the file transfer.

After the file transfer is completed, the data connection is terminated, while the control connection remains open. This allows the client to either initiate additional file transfers or close the control connection to end the FTP session.

In summary, the FTP protocol efficiently transfers files over a network by establishing a dual connection between the client and server. One connection is used for control commands and responses, while a separate connection handles the actual file transfers. This design provides flexibility and efficiency in file transfer operations across a network.
