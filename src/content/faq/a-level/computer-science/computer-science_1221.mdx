A subnet, or subnetwork, is a smaller network that is created from a larger network through a process known as subnetting.

Subnetting is a technique used to partition a network into two or more smaller networks, each referred to as a subnet. This practice enhances network performance, improves security, and simplifies network management. The process involves dividing an IP address into two components: the network address and the host address. The network address identifies the overall network, while the host address specifies an individual device, such as a computer or printer, within that network.

The subnetting process begins with an IP address, which serves as a unique identifier for a device on a network. An IP address consists of two parts: the network ID and the host ID. The network ID designates the entire network, while the host ID pinpoints a specific device within that network.

Subnetting operates by reallocating bits from the host portion of the IP address to create additional network IDs. This reallocation is facilitated by a subnet mask, which is a binary pattern that defines how the IP address is segmented. The subnet mask contains the same number of bits as the IP address, and the arrangement of ones and zeros within the mask indicates the boundary between the network and host portions of the IP address.

For example, consider a network with the IP address $192.168.1.0$ and a subnet mask of $255.255.255.0$. In this case, the first three octets ($192.168.1$) represent the network ID, while the last octet ($0$) represents the host ID. If you wish to divide this network into two subnets, you can modify the subnet mask to $255.255.255.128$. This adjustment results in two subnets: from $192.168.1.0$ to $192.168.1.127$ and from $192.168.1.128$ to $192.168.1.255$.

Subnetting is an essential aspect of network management. It facilitates improved organization, control, and security within a network. By segmenting a network into smaller subnets, administrators can better manage traffic flow, isolate issues, and prevent problems from impacting the entire network.
