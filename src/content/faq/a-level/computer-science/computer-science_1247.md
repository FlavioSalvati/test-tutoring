The TCP/IP model is structured into four distinct layers: the Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application layers.

The **Network Interface layer**, sometimes referred to as the Network Access or Link layer, is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model. Its primary responsibility is the physical transmission of data across network devices. This layer encompasses both the protocols and hardware necessary for connecting to the network media. Examples include Ethernet for wired connections and Wi-Fi for wireless connections. Additionally, it manages the conversion of digital data into electrical signals for transmission and vice versa. This layer is analogous to the combination of the Physical and Data Link layers found in the OSI model.

The **Internet layer**, also known as the Network layer, is tasked with the logical transmission of data across the network. It is responsible for routing data packets based on their IP addresses. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the core protocol within this layer, providing a unique addressing system for identifying each device on the network. Other important protocols in this layer include the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), which facilitate error reporting and multicasting capabilities, respectively.

The **Transport layer** is essential for end-to-end communication between devices. It offers various services, including connection-oriented communication, reliability, flow control, and error checking. The two primary protocols in this layer are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP provides a reliable, connection-oriented service, whereas UDP offers an unreliable, connectionless service. This layer corresponds to the Transport layer of the OSI model.

Finally, the **Application layer**, also known as the Process layer, is the topmost layer in the TCP/IP model. It acts as the interface between network services and user applications. This layer includes several protocols, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which facilitate web browsing, file transfers, and email communication, respectively. It corresponds to the combined functions of the Session, Presentation, and Application layers within the OSI model.
