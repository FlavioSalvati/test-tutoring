The binary representation of the octal number $756$ is $111\ 101\ 110$.

To convert an octal number to binary, each octal digit is substituted with its corresponding binary equivalent. The octal number system is base $8$, consisting of the digits $0$ through $7$. In contrast, the binary number system is base $2$, utilizing only the digits $0$ and $1$.

The octal number $756$ can be decomposed into three separate digits: $7$, $5$, and $6$. Each of these digits can be individually converted into its binary form.

- The binary equivalent of the octal digit $7$ is $111$.
- The binary equivalent of the octal digit $5$ is $101$.
- The binary equivalent of the octal digit $6$ is $110$.

Consequently, when we replace each digit in the octal number $756$ with its binary counterpart, we obtain $111$ (for $7$), $101$ (for $5$), and $110$ (for $6$).

Thus, the complete binary representation of the octal number $756$ is $111\ 101\ 110$.

It's important to note that during the conversion from octal to binary, each octal digit corresponds to a three-digit binary number. This is because the maximum value that can be represented with three binary digits is $7$ (which corresponds to $111$ in binary), and the octal system is structured around powers of $8$, allowing for a seamless conversion to the three-digit binary format.

This conversion method is straightforward and can be applied to any octal number, making it a valuable skill, particularly for students in computer science who frequently work with various number systems.
