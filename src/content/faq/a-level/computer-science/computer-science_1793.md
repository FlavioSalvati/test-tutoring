Normalization is a crucial process in database design, and it consists of several standard forms: First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), Fourth Normal Form (4NF), and Fifth Normal Form (5NF). Each of these forms has specific rules that help to eliminate redundancy and enhance the integrity of the data.

First Normal Form (1NF) represents the foundational level of normalization. To satisfy 1NF, a relational database must be free of repeating groups. This means that each column in a table must contain unique values, ensuring that no multiple columns can be used to retrieve the same row. By enforcing this rule, 1NF helps to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

Second Normal Form (2NF) builds upon the principles established in 1NF. In 2NF, all non-key attributes must be fully dependent on the primary key. This implies that there should be no partial dependencies; for instance, if a table has a composite primary key, every other attribute should depend on the entire key rather than just a portion of it.

Third Normal Form (3NF) advances the concept further by stipulating that all non-key attributes must be independent of one another. This is known as eliminating transitive dependencies. By adhering to this rule, 3NF further minimizes redundancy and enhances data integrity.

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is a stricter variant of 3NF. It requires that for every non-trivial functional dependency $X \rightarrow Y$, $X$ must be a superkey. In other words, if a non-key attribute is functionally dependent on another non-key attribute, then the latter must qualify as a candidate key.

Fourth Normal Form (4NF) addresses multi-valued dependencies, necessitating that for any non-trivial multi-valued dependency $X \rightarrow \rightarrow Y$, $X$ must also be a superkey. This requirement helps eliminate redundancy that arises from multi-valued dependencies.

Fifth Normal Form (5NF), often referred to as Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF), deals with scenarios where information can be reconstructed from smaller segments that can be maintained with less redundancy. To satisfy 5NF, every join dependency in the table must be implied by the candidate keys.

Each normalization form has its own distinct set of rules and requirements, progressively building upon one another to reduce redundancy and enhance data integrity within a relational database.
