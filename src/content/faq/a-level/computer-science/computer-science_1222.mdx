Interrupts in computer architecture are signals sent to the processor to notify it of events that require immediate attention.

More specifically, an interrupt is a mechanism through which an input/output (I/O) operation or an instruction can temporarily suspend the normal sequence of processing carried out by the processor. This mechanism is essential for controlling the execution flow of the processor. When the processor receives an interrupt signal, it temporarily halts its current tasks and transfers control to a designated interrupt service routine (ISR). An ISR is a specialized piece of code that addresses the conditions that triggered the interrupt.

Interrupts can originate from both hardware and software sources. Hardware interrupts are typically generated by peripheral devices, such as keyboards or mice, which need to communicate data to the processor. For instance, when you press a key on your keyboard, it sends an interrupt signal to the processor, indicating that it has data to transmit. In contrast, software interrupts are initiated by programs running on the computer and are used to request services from the operating system, such as reading a file or displaying information on the screen.

Additionally, interrupts can be classified based on their priority. Some interrupts have higher priority levels than others, meaning they will be addressed first. This prioritization is crucial in scenarios where certain tasks must be executed immediately, such as responding to a system error.

When an interrupt occurs, the processor must save its current state to ensure that it can resume its previous task once the interrupt has been handled. This process involves saving the program counter, which tracks the processor's current position in its task, along with other pertinent information. After the interrupt has been serviced, the processor can restore its saved state and continue with its interrupted task.

In summary, interrupts are a vital aspect of computer architecture. They enable the processor to respond to events in real-time, ensuring that critical tasks are executed promptly.
