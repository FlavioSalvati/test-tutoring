A transpiler converts source code from one programming language to another, while a compiler translates source code into machine code.

A transpiler, often referred to as a source-to-source compiler, is a specific type of compiler that takes the source code of a program written in one programming language and translates it into an equivalent program in another language. The output of a transpiler remains at a high level, meaning it retains human readability and has not yet been converted into machine code. This functionality is particularly beneficial when developers wish to leverage the features of a newer programming language while ensuring compatibility with older platforms that do not support those features. For instance, Babel is a widely used JavaScript transpiler that converts code written in ES6 (a more recent version of JavaScript) into ES5 (an older version). This conversion helps maintain compatibility with legacy browsers. To further investigate how language features can be manipulated, please refer to the relevant documentation.

In contrast, a compiler is a software tool that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into low-level machine code or bytecode. The output generated by a compiler is not human-readable; it can be directly executed by a computer's CPU. The compilation process typically involves several key stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The primary objective of a compiler is to optimize the code for efficient execution while minimizing resource usage. Notable examples of compilers include the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and the Java Development Kit (JDK). The complexity inherent in compilers is significantly tied to their function as tools that convert high-level languages into machine-executable formats.

**A-Level Computer Science Tutor Summary:** A transpiler converts code from one high-level programming language to another, keeping it human-readable, while a compiler translates code into machine code that can be directly executed by a computer. Transpilers are particularly useful for ensuring compatibility between different versions of programming languages, whereas compilers focus on optimizing code for efficient execution.
