Wi-Fi networks function by transmitting data through radio waves from a central hub, typically a wireless router, to connected devices.

Wi-Fi, which stands for Wireless Fidelity, is a technology that enables devices such as computers, smartphones, and other equipment to connect to the internet or communicate with each other wirelessly within a designated area. This area is referred to as a Wi-Fi network, which operates using radio waves to transmit data.

The process begins with a wireless router, serving as the central hub of the network. This router is connected to the internet via a modem, receiving data from the internet in the form of binary code. The router then converts this binary code into a radio signal and broadcasts it. Devices connected to the network, equipped with wireless adapters, receive this radio signal. The wireless adapter subsequently decodes the signal back into binary data, which the device can understand and utilize.

Wi-Fi networks typically operate on frequency bands of $2.4 \, \text{GHz}$ or $5 \, \text{GHz}$. These frequencies are subdivided into multiple channels to minimize interference and congestion. The $2.4 \, \text{GHz}$ band has $14$ channels available, while the $5 \, \text{GHz}$ band offers $23$ channels. For effective communication, the router and the devices on the network must operate on the same channel.

Wi-Fi networks can function in various modes, with the most common being infrastructure mode and ad-hoc mode. In infrastructure mode, all devices communicate through the router. Conversely, in ad-hoc mode, devices communicate directly with one another without the necessity of a router.

Security is a critical component of Wi-Fi networks. To safeguard the data transmitted, these networks often employ encryption protocols such as WEP, WPA, and WPA2. These protocols encrypt the data before it is sent, ensuring that only the receiving device possesses the key needed to decrypt it.

In conclusion, Wi-Fi networks operate by using a wireless router to convert internet data into radio signals that are received and decoded by connected devices. These networks utilize specific frequency bands and channels, can function in different modes, and implement encryption protocols to ensure security.
