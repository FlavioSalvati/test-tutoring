You can create a view in SQL using the `CREATE VIEW` statement followed by a `SELECT` statement.

In SQL, a view is essentially a virtual table derived from the results of a query. It consists of rows and columns, much like a regular table. The fields in a view can originate from one or more actual tables within the database. To create a view, you utilize the `CREATE VIEW` statement, which follows this syntax:

$$
\text{CREATE VIEW view\_name AS} \\
\text{SELECT column1, column2, ...} \\
\text{FROM table\_name} \\
\text{WHERE condition;}
$$

In this syntax:
- `view_name` represents the name you wish to assign to the view.
- `column1, column2, ...` are the specific columns you want to include in your view.
- `table_name` is the name of the table from which the view is constructed.
- The `WHERE condition` clause is optional and can be used to filter the rows included in the view.

For instance, if you have a table called `Orders` and you want to create a view that includes only the `OrderID` and `CustomerID` for orders where the `Quantity` exceeds $10$, you would write the following SQL statement:

$$
\text{CREATE VIEW LargeOrders AS} \\
\text{SELECT OrderID, CustomerID} \\
\text{FROM Orders} \\
\text{WHERE Quantity > 10;}
$$

Once the view is created, you can query it just as you would with a physical table. For example, to select all records from the `LargeOrders` view, you would execute the following SQL statement:

$$
\text{SELECT *} \\
\text{FROM LargeOrders;}
$$

It is important to note that a view is not a physical table; rather, it is a virtual table generated by executing a query that may join multiple tables. Consequently, any modifications made to the underlying tables will be reflected in the view. However, views do not occupy physical storage space in your database. They are an excellent tool for encapsulating complex queries and can significantly simplify SQL operations.
