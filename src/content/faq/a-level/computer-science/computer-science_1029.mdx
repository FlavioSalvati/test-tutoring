Selection sort is an algorithm that operates by repeatedly identifying the minimum element from the unsorted portion of a list and placing it at the beginning.

In detail, selection sort is a straightforward comparison-based sorting technique. It divides the input list into two segments: the sorted segment on the left and the unsorted segment on the right. Initially, the sorted segment is empty while the unsorted segment encompasses the entire list. The algorithm works by locating the smallest (or largest, depending on the desired sorting order) element within the unsorted sublist, swapping it with the leftmost unsorted element to effectively sort it, and then shifting the boundaries of the sublists one element to the right.

The fundamental operation in selection sort involves comparing elements. This occurs within a loop that starts at the beginning of the unsorted section and iterates through each element, comparing it to the current minimum. If a smaller element is discovered, it becomes the new minimum. Once the loop reaches the end of the list, the identified minimum element is swapped with the first element of the unsorted segment. This element is now considered sorted, and the process continues for the remaining unsorted elements.

Selection sort is appreciated for its simplicity and can outperform more complex algorithms in specific scenarios, particularly when auxiliary memory is limited. However, it is not ideal for large datasets due to its average and worst-case time complexities, which are on the order of $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of items being sorted.

Regarding space complexity, selection sort is highly efficient. It requires only a constant amount of additional space to store the current minimum and its index, resulting in a space complexity of $O(1)$. This makes selection sort an appealing option when memory conservation is crucial.

In summary, selection sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that is effective for small lists or situations where memory is constrained. Nevertheless, its suboptimal time complexity renders it less suitable for larger datasets.
