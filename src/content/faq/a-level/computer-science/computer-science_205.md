The primary types of database constraints include primary key, foreign key, unique, not null, and check constraints.

A **primary key constraint** is a field within a table that uniquely identifies each record. It must contain a unique value for every row and cannot include null values. This constraint prevents duplicate entries in the table. For instance, in a student database, the student ID could serve as the primary key since it is unique to each student.

A **foreign key constraint** refers to a field in one table that is a primary key in another table. This constraint is essential for maintaining the relationships between tables and preventing actions that could disrupt those links. For example, in a university database, a student's course ID would act as a foreign key, linking the student table to the course table.

A **unique constraint** ensures that all values in a specific column are distinct. Although similar to a primary key constraint, it allows for one null value and does not automatically create an index. For example, in a user account table, the email address field could have a unique constraint to guarantee that no two users share the same email address.

A **not null constraint** prohibits the entry of null values in designated columns of a table. If a column is subject to a not null constraint, a value must be provided when creating records. For instance, in a customer table, the customer name field could be enforced with a not null constraint to ensure that every customer has a name.

A **check constraint** establishes a condition that data in a table must fulfill. It allows you to define a Boolean expression that values in a specific column must satisfy. For example, in an employee table, a check constraint could be applied to the age column, ensuring that all employees are older than $16$ years.

In summary, database constraints are crucial rules that help maintain data integrity within a database. They ensure that data remains accurate, consistent, and reliable, thereby preventing errors and anomalies from entering the system.
