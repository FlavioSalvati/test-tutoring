Common network protocols serve essential roles in facilitating communication over the internet. Notable examples include HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, FTP for file transfer, and TCP/IP for overall internet communication.

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the protocol responsible for transmitting hypertext across the internet. It forms the backbone of data exchange on the web, primarily used for transferring web pages. When you enter a URL in your web browser, it sends an HTTP command to the web server, instructing it to retrieve and deliver the requested web page.

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is utilized for sending and receiving email. This protocol is an internet standard that governs email transmission across Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Typically, SMTP is employed to send messages from a mail client to a mail server, and subsequently from that server to another mail server.

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is designed for transferring files between hosts over a network, such as the internet. It serves as a standard network protocol for the transfer of computer files between a client and a server within a computer network. FTP operates on a client-server model architecture, utilizing separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

**TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)** is a suite of communication protocols that connect hosts on the internet. TCP/IP encompasses multiple protocols, with the two primary ones being TCP and IP. Rather than a single protocol, TCP/IP is a comprehensive protocol suite that includes various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, among others. It is named after its two most significant protocols, although it contains many others within the suite.

Another widely used protocol is **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**, which is suited for tasks that require low latency, prioritizing the rapid delivery of information. Unlike TCP, UDP does not guarantee the reliability of data delivery, meaning it does not verify whether the data has reached its intended destination.

Finally, the **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** is employed by network devices to transmit error messages and operational information. For instance, if a requested service is unavailable or if a host or router cannot be reached, ICMP will relay this information back to the sender, providing valuable feedback regarding network status.
