The Strand Sort algorithm operates by systematically extracting sorted sublists from the input and merging them into an output list.

Strand Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that functions by continuously identifying increasing sublists from the input and combining them into an initially empty output list. This process continues until there are no more elements remaining in the input list.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how the algorithm works:

1. **Initialize an empty output list.**
2. **Check the input list:** If it is empty, the algorithm terminates. If it contains elements, proceed to the next step.
3. **Begin a new sublist** with the first element of the input list.
4. **Iterate through the input list:** For each element, if it is greater than the last element of the current sublist, remove it from the input list and add it to the sublist.
5. **Merge the sublist** into the output list, ensuring that the order remains sorted.
6. **Repeat steps 2-5** until the input list is completely empty.

The core principle of Strand Sort lies in the extraction of sorted sublists from the input and the subsequent merging of these sublists into the output list. The extraction process is straightforward: it scans the input list to collect elements that are in increasing order. In contrast, the merging process is more intricate; it involves combining two sorted lists into one. This is accomplished by continually selecting the smaller of the first elements from the two lists and appending it to the end of the output list.

Despite its unique approach, Strand Sort is not widely used due to its complexity. Its worst-case and average time complexity is $O(n^2)$, making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort for large datasets. However, it can be advantageous in specific scenarios where the data is nearly sorted, as it may perform better in those cases.
