A function is a self-contained block of code, whereas a method is specifically tied to an object and can interact with that object's data.

In programming, both functions and methods serve as reusable code segments that execute specific tasks. However, they are employed in different contexts and possess varying levels of access to data. A function operates independently; it can accept inputs, execute computations, and return outputs. Functions are typically defined outside of classes in procedural programming languages like C, allowing them to be called autonomously. Additionally, in functional programming languages such as Haskell, functions serve as the foundational building blocks for constructing and organizing software.

Conversely, a method is a type of function that is linked to an object, particularly in object-oriented programming (OOP). Methods are defined within classes and are designed to manipulate the data contained within the object to which they are associated. Unlike standalone functions, methods can access and modify the data members of their defining class. This feature enables methods to be utilized in OOP languages such as Java, Python, and C++.

The primary distinction between a function and a method lies in the concept of 'state'. A function lacks state, as it solely processes the inputs provided to it and does not retain any information between calls. In contrast, a method possesses state because it is tied to an object and can access and modify that object's data. Consequently, the behavior of a method may vary depending on the state of the object it belongs to.

In summary, while both functions and methods execute computations, they are applied in different programming paradigms and have distinct relationships with data. Functions are independent entities found in procedural and functional programming, whereas methods are linked to objects and utilized within object-oriented programming.
