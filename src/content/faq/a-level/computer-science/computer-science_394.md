Cycle sort is an in-place, unstable sorting algorithm that efficiently arranges elements by repeatedly swapping them into their correct positions.

The cycle sort algorithm can be visualized as a cyclic graph, where each node corresponds to an element in the array, and the edges indicate the desired positions of these elements. The process begins by examining the first element of the array to determine its correct position in the sorted order. This is achieved by counting how many elements in the array are smaller than the current element. If the element is already in its correct position, the algorithm proceeds to the next element. If it is not, the algorithm swaps the current element with the element that occupies its correct position.

This swapping process continues with the new element that has taken the first position. If the algorithm encounters an element that is already correctly positioned, it breaks the current cycle and moves on to the next unprocessed position in the array. To efficiently track which positions have been included in a cycle, the algorithm maintains a Boolean array.

The algorithm repeats the swapping and cycle-breaking process until every element has been positioned correctly. Since each element is moved at most twice during the sorting process, the time complexity of cycle sort is $O(n^2)$, making it less efficient compared to other sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or mergesort, particularly for larger arrays. Nevertheless, cycle sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, requiring only a constant amount of extra space, which can be advantageous in memory-constrained environments.

In summary, cycle sort is a distinct sorting algorithm that employs cyclic swaps to arrange elements in their correct positions. Although it may not be the most efficient choice for sorting large arrays, its in-place nature offers practical benefits in specific scenarios.
