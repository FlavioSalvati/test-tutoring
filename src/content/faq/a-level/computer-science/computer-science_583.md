The 'INSERT' statement in SQL is utilized to add new rows of data to a table within a database.

To elaborate, the 'INSERT' statement is a core component of Structured Query Language (SQL), which serves as the standard language for interacting with Relational Databases. SQL enables users to perform various operations, including inserting, searching, updating, and deleting records within a database. Specifically, the 'INSERT' statement facilitates the creation and addition of new records (i.e., rows of data) into a specified table.

The basic syntax of the 'INSERT' statement is structured as follows:

$$
\text{INSERT INTO table\_name (column1, column2, column3,...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...)}
$$

In this format, 'table_name' represents the name of the table where the new data is to be inserted, while 'column1, column2, column3,...' are the names of the columns in the table that will receive the data. Correspondingly, 'value1, value2, value3,...' are the values that you intend to insert into their respective columns.

It is crucial to ensure that the order of the column names matches the order of the values being inserted. If you are inserting values for all columns in the table, it is not necessary to specify the column names in your SQL query. However, you must ensure that the sequence of values aligns with the order of the columns in the table.

Furthermore, the 'INSERT' statement is not limited to inserting data from user input or applications; it can also be utilized to transfer data from one table to another. This functionality is particularly beneficial when you need to duplicate data across tables or when you are backing up data.

In summary, the 'INSERT' statement is an essential tool in SQL for the creation and management of databases. It enables you to add new data to your tables, thereby keeping your database current and relevant.
