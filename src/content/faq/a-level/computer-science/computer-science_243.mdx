Subqueries are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to nest a SELECT statement within another SQL command, enabling more complex data retrieval and manipulation.

Often referred to as inner queries or nested queries, subqueries are utilized to return data that will serve as conditions for the main query, thereby refining the data retrieved. They can be employed in various SQL commands, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Depending on their structure, subqueries may return individual values or a collection of records, influencing the outcome of the main query in different ways.

A key aspect of subqueries is that they are executed once prior to the execution of the main query. The results generated by the subquery are then passed to the main query, which utilizes this information to complete its processing.

Hereâ€™s a straightforward example of a subquery within a SELECT statement:

$$
SELECT column\_name
FROM table\_name
WHERE column\_name IN (SELECT column\_name FROM table\_name WHERE condition);
$$

In this example, the subquery (the portion enclosed in parentheses) is executed first, yielding a list of values. Subsequently, the main query runs, applying the results of the subquery to filter the data accordingly.

Subqueries can be integrated within a WHERE or HAVING clause and can be nested within one another. It's worth noting that there are no restrictions on the level of subquery nesting within the FROM clause.

However, it's important to keep in mind that subqueries can often be rewritten as standard SELECT statements or as joins, which can enhance performance. In particular, subqueries used in SELECT statements tend to be the most resource-intensive type, as SQL Server must generate the subquery results for every row in a temporary table. This can result in slower performance compared to equivalent operations using joins or the EXISTS operator.

In summary, when using subqueries in a SELECT statement, remember that the subquery executes first, and its results are utilized to complete the main query. This functionality allows for more intricate data analysis and manipulation within your SQL commands.
