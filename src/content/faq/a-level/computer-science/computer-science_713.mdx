A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, allowing for the storage of key-value pairs.

More specifically, a hash table, often referred to as a hash map, is designed for high efficiency in accessing, inserting, and deleting data. It accomplishes this by employing a hash function that maps keys to specific positions within an array, facilitating direct access to the values associated with those keys.

The hash function is a vital component of a hash table. It takes a key as input and produces an integer known as the hash code. This hash code is subsequently used to determine the index at which the key-value pair will be stored in the array. The primary objective of a good hash function is to distribute keys uniformly across the array, thereby minimizing the chances of collisions. A collision occurs when two distinct keys yield the same hash code.

When a collision does happen, the hash table must implement a strategy to resolve it. Two common methods for handling collisions are separate chaining and open addressing. In separate chaining, each index of the array (often referred to as a 'bucket') contains a linked list of key-value pairs that share the same hash code. In contrast, open addressing seeks another available slot in the array to store the new key-value pair when a collision occurs.

One of the significant advantages of hash tables is their speed. If the hash function is well-constructed and the table is not overly populated, operations such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval can typically be executed in constant time, denoted as $O(1)$. However, in the worst-case scenario, where all keys collide and are placed in the same bucket, these operations can degrade to linear time, represented as $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of keys.

Hash tables are extensively utilized in computer science and serve as the foundational data structure for objects in numerous programming languages, including Python dictionaries and JavaScript objects. They are particularly advantageous in scenarios that require rapid data access, such as database indexing, caching, and password verification.
