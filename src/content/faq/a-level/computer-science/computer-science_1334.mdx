Symmetric encryption employs a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption utilizes two distinct keys for these processes.

In symmetric encryption, the same key is utilized for both encrypting and decrypting data. This key must be known to both the sender and receiver and must be kept confidential. Common examples of symmetric encryption algorithms include the Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and the Blowfish algorithm. Notably, symmetric encryption is typically faster and less computationally demanding than its asymmetric counterpart, making it well-suited for encrypting large volumes of data.

Conversely, asymmetric encryption relies on a pair of keys: one for encryption and a different one for decryption. These keys are mathematically related but not identical, which is why the method is referred to as 'asymmetric'. One key in this pair is usually made public (the public key), while the other is kept private (the private key). The public key is employed to encrypt the data, and the private key is necessary for decryption. This setup allows anyone to encrypt data using the public key, but only the individual possessing the private key can decrypt it. Prominent examples of asymmetric encryption include the RSA algorithm, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). While asymmetric encryption offers enhanced security compared to symmetric encryption, it is generally slower and requires more computational resources.

The fundamental distinction between symmetric and asymmetric encryption lies in the keys employed for the encryption and decryption processes. In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both actions, necessitating its secure sharing between the sender and receiver. This sharing can introduce security vulnerabilities if the key is intercepted during transmission. In contrast, asymmetric encryption utilizes distinct keys for encryption and decryption, thus eliminating the need for key sharing and significantly enhancing security. However, this increased security comes at the expense of processing speed and computational efficiency.
