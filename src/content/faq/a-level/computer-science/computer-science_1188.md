Dynamic hashing is a versatile hashing technique that allows data structures to grow and shrink in response to changes in the number of records, accommodating the dynamic nature of data storage.

In contrast to traditional static hashing, which maps keys to a fixed number of buckets or slots via a hash function, dynamic hashing mitigates issues such as overflow and poor key distribution. Static hashing can become problematic when the number of keys is unpredictable or fluctuates over time. Dynamic hashing, often referred to as extendible hashing, effectively addresses these challenges by enabling the hash table to expand or contract as necessary.

The core of dynamic hashing lies in the use of a directory that points to various buckets. Each bucket is designed to hold a specific number of records. When a bucket reaches its capacity due to an insertion, it is split into two smaller buckets, and the directory is updated accordingly. The hash function used in dynamic hashing generates a binary string of digits. Initially, only the first few digits are considered, but as the table grows, additional digits can be utilized, thereby increasing the number of available buckets.

For instance, if the system starts with a single bucket represented by the binary digit $0$, and this bucket becomes full, it is divided into two buckets represented by $0$ and $1$. If the bucket represented by $1$ subsequently fills up, it is further split into two buckets represented by $10$ and $11$, and so forth. This incremental growth of the hash table allows it to expand without requiring a complete rehash of all existing keys, which can be a resource-intensive operation.

Conversely, when a deletion results in a bucket becoming empty, it can be merged with an adjacent bucket, and the directory is updated to reflect this change. This mechanism allows the hash table to shrink when necessary, thereby conserving memory.

In conclusion, dynamic hashing offers a flexible and efficient approach to managing hash tables in the face of a variable number of records. This method effectively prevents issues related to overflow and poor key distribution commonly seen in static hashing, while also eliminating the need for costly rehashing operations.
