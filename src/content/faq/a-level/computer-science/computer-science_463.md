Optical storage devices, including Compact Discs (CDs) and Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs), utilize laser technology to store and retrieve data on their reflective surfaces. The core principle of this technology is based on the interaction between laser light and the disc's surface, which is typically coated with a reflective material.

The process begins with writing or "burning" data onto the disc. This is accomplished using a high-powered laser that creates microscopic indentations, referred to as pits, on the disc's surface. These pits are organized in a spiral track that originates at the center of the disc and extends outward. The flat areas between the pits are known as lands. The arrangement of pits and lands encodes binary data, represented as $0$s and $1$s, which computers can interpret.

To read the data, a lower-powered laser is employed. This laser beam is directed onto the disc's surface and, as it travels along the spiral track, it reflects differently off the pits and lands. The pits, due to their indentations, scatter the laser light, whereas the flat lands reflect the light directly back. A photodiode sensor detects these variations in reflection, which are then translated into binary data.

One of the primary advantages of optical storage devices is their durability and longevity. Unlike magnetic storage devices, optical media are not vulnerable to data loss caused by exposure to magnetic fields or mechanical failures. However, they do have certain limitations. The total amount of data that can be stored is finite and depends on the disc's physical size and the precision of the laser used. Additionally, the speed of reading and writing data is generally slower compared to other storage technologies.

In summary, optical storage devices such as CDs and DVDs operate by using lasers to form and read a pattern of pits and lands on a reflective surface, which represents binary data. This technology provides a reliable and long-lasting method of data storage, despite some inherent limitations.
