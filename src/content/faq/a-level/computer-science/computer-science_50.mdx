The binary representation of the decimal number $784$ is $1100010000$.

To convert a decimal number to binary, we employ a method that involves repeatedly dividing the number by $2$ and recording the remainders. We start with the number $784$, divide it by $2$, yielding a quotient of $392$ and a remainder of $0$. This remainder represents the least significant bit (the rightmost bit) of our binary number. We then continue this process using the quotient ($392$) and divide it by $2$, resulting in a quotient of $196$ and another remainder of $0$. This gives us the second bit of our binary representation.

Continuing with this method, we obtain the following sequence of quotients and remainders:

$$
\begin{align*}
784 \div 2 & = 392 \quad \text{remainder } 0 \quad (\text{least significant bit}) \\
392 \div 2 & = 196 \quad \text{remainder } 0 \\
196 \div 2 & = 98 \quad \text{remainder } 0 \\
98 \div 2 & = 49 \quad \text{remainder } 0 \\
49 \div 2 & = 24 \quad \text{remainder } 1 \\
24 \div 2 & = 12 \quad \text{remainder } 0 \\
12 \div 2 & = 6 \quad \text{remainder } 0 \\
6 \div 2 & = 3 \quad \text{remainder } 0 \\
3 \div 2 & = 1 \quad \text{remainder } 1 \\
1 \div 2 & = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 1 \quad (\text{most significant bit})
\end{align*}
$$

By reading the remainders from bottom to top, we arrive at the binary representation of $784$: $1100010000$.

This process of converting decimal numbers to binary is commonly referred to as the 'division by 2' algorithm. It is a straightforward and effective method for understanding how decimal numbers can be expressed in binary form, a fundamental concept in computer data storage and processing. This example also illustrates how a seemingly complex operation can be simplified into a series of manageable steps, which is an essential skill in the field of computer science.
