A hub and a switch are both networking devices designed to connect computers and other devices within a network. However, they operate in fundamentally different manners.

A hub is a simpler device that acts as a common connection point for devices on a network. It broadcasts all incoming data to every device connected to it, regardless of the intended recipient. This indiscriminate broadcasting can lead to data collisions and a general decline in network efficiency, particularly as the number of connected devices increases.

Conversely, a switch is a more sophisticated device. It maintains a table of MAC (Media Access Control) addresses for all devices connected to it. When a switch receives data, it inspects the destination MAC address and forwards the data only to the specific device associated with that address. This targeted approach significantly reduces unnecessary data traffic and minimizes collisions, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency.

In terms of performance, switches typically outperform hubs as they limit the volume of extraneous traffic. Additionally, switches offer improved security because data is not sent to all devices indiscriminately. However, due to their complexity, switches tend to be more expensive than hubs.

In summary, while both hubs and switches serve the essential function of connecting devices within a network, they do so through different mechanisms. Hubs broadcast all data to every device, while switches employ a selective approach, delivering data solely to the intended recipient. This distinction renders switches more efficient and secure, albeit at a higher complexity and cost.
