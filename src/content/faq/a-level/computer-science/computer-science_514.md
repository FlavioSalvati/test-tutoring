Virtual memory extends a computer's RAM by utilizing disk space to store inactive data and applications.

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows secondary storage to function as though it were part of the main memory (RAM). When the available RAM is insufficient to accommodate all running programs and data, the operating system allocates a portion of the hard disk as virtual memory. This procedure is referred to as swapping, where inactive data from RAM is transferred to the hard disk to free up space for active processes.

The operating system organizes memory into pages, which are small blocks of contiguous memory. When a program requires additional memory, the operating system identifies which pages in RAM have not been accessed recently and writes those pages to the disk. This action creates additional space in RAM for the new data. The pages transferred to disk are tracked in a page table, allowing for their retrieval when needed.

If a program attempts to access data that is not currently in RAM but resides in virtual memory, a page fault occurs. In response, the operating system swaps a page of data from RAM to the disk and brings the requested page from the disk back into RAM. This swapping process is seamless to both users and programs, as they perceive the virtual memory as an extension of the RAM.

However, utilizing virtual memory does come with a performance trade-off. Accessing data stored on the hard disk is significantly slower than accessing data in RAM. Consequently, the operating system aims to minimize reliance on virtual memory by keeping as much data as possible in RAM. It employs algorithms to predict which pages are likely to be required soon and maintains those pages in RAM.

In summary, virtual memory enables a computer to run more programs or manage larger datasets than would be possible with RAM alone. By using disk space to store data that cannot fit into RAM, the system can swap data between RAM and the disk as necessary. Despite the inherent performance costs, virtual memory is an essential component of modern operating systems, allowing for efficient memory management and ensuring a smooth user experience.
