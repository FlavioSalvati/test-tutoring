The binary insertion sort algorithm enhances the traditional insertion sort by utilizing binary search to efficiently insert elements into their correct positions within a sorted array.

Binary insertion sort is a specialized version of the standard insertion sort algorithm. The key distinction lies in the method used to identify the correct insertion position for an element. While traditional insertion sort sequentially scans through all elements in the sorted portion of the array, binary insertion sort employs binary search. This approach significantly decreases the number of comparisons required in the worst-case scenario, thereby improving efficiency, particularly for larger lists.

The algorithm initiates by considering the first element of the array as the sorted portion. It then selects the subsequent element and uses binary search to locate its correct position within this sorted section. Binary search operates by continuously halving the sorted array until the appropriate insertion point is identified. If the element being inserted is greater than the middle element of the sorted segment, the search continues in the right half; if it is smaller, the search proceeds to the left half. This halving process repeats until the correct position is determined.

Once the insertion position is located, the algorithm creates space for the new element by shifting all larger elements one position to the right. The new element is then inserted at its designated position. This procedure is iteratively applied to each element in the array.

It is crucial to understand that while binary insertion sort minimizes the number of comparisons, it does not lower the number of swaps. Each insertion still necessitates the shifting of all larger elements, which requires linear time. Consequently, the time complexity of binary insertion sort remains quadratic, specifically $O(n^2)$, in the worst-case scenario. Nonetheless, in practical applications, binary insertion sort can outperform standard insertion sort for larger lists due to the reduced number of comparisons.

In conclusion, binary insertion sort is a modified version of the insertion sort algorithm that leverages binary search to determine the correct positions for elements. This adaptation makes it more efficient for handling larger lists, although its time complexity remains quadratic in the worst-case scenario.
