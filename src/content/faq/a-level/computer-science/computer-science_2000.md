A circular linked list is a specialized data structure in which the last node points back to the first node, effectively forming a continuous loop.

To elaborate, a circular linked list is a variant of the traditional linked list. In a standard linked list, each node contains a data element and a reference, known as 'next,' which points to the subsequent node in the sequence. The last node in a standard linked list has a null reference, signifying the end of the list. In contrast, in a circular linked list, the 'next' reference of the last node loops back to the first node, resulting in a circular structure.

This circular architecture is particularly advantageous in specific scenarios. For instance, it can effectively model cyclical problems or systems, such as a round-robin scheduler in an operating system or a digital media player that returns to the first song after reaching the end of the playlist.

In terms of operations, a circular linked list functions similarly to a standard linked list. You can add, remove, or search for elements as you would in a conventional linked list. However, due to its circular nature, caution is required to avoid infinite loops. When traversing the list, it is essential to remember the starting point and stop when you return to it.

Another significant distinction is that in a circular linked list, you can traverse the entire list from any node. In a standard linked list, traversal is limited to moving from the first node to the last. This flexibility can be beneficial in various applications.

Regarding complexity, the operations on a circular linked list exhibit time complexities comparable to those of a standard linked list. Specifically, adding or removing elements is typically an $O(1)$ operation if you are at the appropriate location. However, searching for an element remains an $O(n)$ operation, where $n$ represents the number of elements in the list. It is important to note that locating the correct position can also take up to $O(n)$ time, particularly if you lack a reference to the preceding node of the one you wish to access.
