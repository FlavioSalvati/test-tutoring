An adjacency matrix is a square matrix that represents a finite graph, whereas an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists serving the same purpose.

An adjacency matrix is structured as a $V \times V$ 2D array, where $V$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph. The elements within the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent. Each vertex has a corresponding list that details the vertices to which it is connected. Since the size of the matrix is $V^2$, it is particularly efficient for dense graphsâ€”those where the number of edges is close to $V^2$. This type of representation resembles how data is organized in databases, which can be explored further.

In contrast, an adjacency list consists of separate lists, with each list representing the neighbors of a particular vertex. This approach is more space-efficient for sparsely connected graphs, in which the number of edges is significantly less than $V^2$. In an adjacency list, each vertex has its own list that includes the vertices it is connected to. The total size of the adjacency list is $2E$, where $E$ is the number of edges.

Regarding time complexity, checking for the existence of an edge $(u, v)$ in the graph takes $O(1)$ time with an adjacency matrix, while it requires $O(V)$ time with an adjacency list, where $V$ is the number of vertices. Conversely, when iterating over the edges, an adjacency matrix takes $O(V^2)$ time, whereas an adjacency list takes $O(V + E)$ time. The structure and management of these graph representations can often be visualized in a web graph representation, a concept that is elaborated upon further.

**A-Level Computer Science Tutor Summary:** An adjacency matrix employs a $V \times V$ 2D array to illustrate connections between nodes, making it suitable for dense graphs. An adjacency list uses individual lists for each node's neighbors, which conserves space in sparse graphs. While matrices provide rapid access for checking connections, lists are more efficient for traversing edges. Your choice between these representations should depend on the density of your graph and your specific requirements.
