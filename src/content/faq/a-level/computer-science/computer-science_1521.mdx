The IF statement in SQL is utilized to execute operations conditionally based on specified criteria.

In SQL, the IF statement serves as a control flow structure, enabling you to run different blocks of code depending on certain conditions. This functionality is akin to the IF statement found in other programming languages. The syntax for the IF statement in SQL is outlined as follows:

$$
\text{IF condition THEN} \\
\quad \text{statement\_list} \\
[\text{ELSEIF condition THEN} \\
\quad \text{statement\_list}] \ldots \\
[\text{ELSE} \\
\quad \text{statement\_list}] \\
\text{END IF;}
$$

In this syntax, the `condition` is a Boolean expression that evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE. If the condition evaluates to TRUE, the code block following the `THEN` keyword is executed. If the condition is FALSE and an `ELSEIF` clause is present, the condition in the `ELSEIF` clause is then evaluated. If the `ELSEIF` condition is TRUE, the corresponding code block after its `THEN` keyword is executed. If none of the conditions are TRUE and an `ELSE` clause is provided, the code block in the `ELSE` clause is executed.

Hereâ€™s an illustrative example of how to implement the IF statement in SQL:

$$
\text{IF } @score \geq 60 \text{ THEN} \\
\quad \text{SET } @grade = 'Pass'; \\
\text{ELSE} \\
\quad \text{SET } @grade = 'Fail'; \\
\text{END IF;}
$$

In this example, if the variable `@score` is greater than or equal to $60$, the variable `@grade` is assigned the value 'Pass'. If not, `@grade` is assigned the value 'Fail'.

It is important to note that the IF statement is not universally supported across all SQL databases. For instance, both MySQL and SQL Server offer support for the IF statement, whereas Oracle does not. In Oracle, you would utilize the IF statement within PL/SQL, which is Oracle's procedural extension of SQL.

In summary, the IF statement in SQL is a powerful mechanism that allows you to control the flow of your SQL scripts. By mastering the use of the IF statement, you can create more flexible and dynamic SQL scripts.
