Compiler design consists of six key phases: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and code generation. Each phase plays a crucial role in transforming high-level source code into machine language that can be executed by a computer.

The first phase, known as lexical analysis or scanning, involves breaking down the source program into a sequence of atomic units called tokens. Tokens represent the smallest individual components of a program, including identifiers, keywords, operators, and delimiters. During this phase, the lexical analyzer also eliminates any whitespace and comments present in the source code.

The second phase, syntax analysis or parsing, checks the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer against the grammar of the programming language. This verification ensures that the tokens form a valid syntactic structure. The output of this phase is a parse tree, which visually represents the syntactic structure of the source program. For more in-depth information about the algorithms used in parsing, please refer to our detailed notes.

The third phase is semantic analysis, where the compiler inspects the parse tree for semantic errors and collects type information to aid in the subsequent code generation phase. During this stage, the compiler verifies that identifiers are declared before they are used, ensures variables are of the correct type, and checks that operators are applied to compatible operands. The activities of the compiler in this phase are akin to fundamental programming constructs.

Next is the fourth phase, intermediate code generation. In this phase, the compiler translates the source program into an intermediate representation that facilitates easier translation into the target machine language. This intermediate code is machine-independent, allowing for the same representation to be utilized across different target machines.

The fifth phase, code optimization, focuses on improving the intermediate code to enhance the efficiency of the resulting machine code. This optimization process may involve eliminating unnecessary instructions, reducing code size, or accelerating execution speed.

Finally, the sixth phase is code generation. During this phase, the compiler translates the optimized intermediate code into the machine language specific to the target machine. This process includes memory allocation for variables and the generation of machine instructions. The output of this phase is the object code, a binary file that the machine can execute. 

For those interested in exploring the role of compilers within the broader programming environment, additional resources are available.

**A-Level Computer Science Tutor Summary:** Compiler design encompasses six primary phases: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and code generation. These phases collectively transform source code into machine language. They involve dissecting the code into tokens, verifying its structural integrity, ensuring its semantic correctness, converting it into an intermediate form, optimizing this form for efficiency, and ultimately translating it into an executable format for the computer.
