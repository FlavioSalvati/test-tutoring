A logical database design represents the abstract framework of the database, while a physical design focuses on the actual storage and implementation of that framework.

To elaborate, a logical database design serves as a conceptual model of the data structures needed by the database. This design is independent of any specific hardware or software considerations. It involves identifying and defining the relationships between various data elements, establishing rules for data integrity and security, and outlining other aspects that dictate how data is organized and accessed. Typically, the logical design is created using a data modeling tool, which provides a graphical representation of the data structures and their interrelationships. This logical design often acts as a blueprint for the subsequent physical design. For a deeper understanding of data structuring and the foundational concepts underpinning databases, please refer to relevant literature.

Conversely, a physical database design is focused on the actual implementation and storage of the data. This design takes into account the specific hardware and software that will be employed for data storage and retrieval. Key considerations in this design include disk storage options, indexing strategies, data access paths, and other technical specifications. The creation of the physical design typically falls to a database administrator, who utilizes the logical design as a reference point. The role of the database administrator is vital in optimizing the physical design process, and further insights into this role can be explored in supplementary resources. The choices made during the physical design phase can significantly affect the database's performance and efficiency. To learn more about different database models that may influence the physical design, please refer to additional materials.

**A-Level Computer Science Tutor Summary:** In simple terms, logical database design is about planning the types of data the database will hold and how they are interconnected, without delving into technical specifics. It's akin to creating a map of a city. In contrast, physical database design concentrates on the actual construction and storage of the database on computer systems, taking into account aspects like storage solutions and data retrieval speed.
