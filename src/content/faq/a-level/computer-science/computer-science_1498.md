Creating a stored function in SQL involves several key steps. To begin the process, you utilize the 'CREATE FUNCTION' statement, which indicates to SQL that you are defining a new function. The syntax for this statement is as follows:

$$
\text{CREATE FUNCTION function\_name ( [parameter1 [type1], ...] ) RETURNS return\_datatype}
$$

Once you have the 'CREATE FUNCTION' statement in place, the next step is to define the function's logic within a 'BEGIN ... END' block. This block encompasses the SQL code that constitutes the function's behavior. You can include any valid SQL statements here, detailing precisely what the function is designed to accomplish. The function's logic must conclude with a 'RETURN' statement, which specifies the value the function will yield upon being invoked.

Consider the following example of a simple stored function in SQL:

'''sql
CREATE FUNCTION total_sales (product_id INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
BEGIN
    DECLARE total DECIMAL(10,2);
    SELECT SUM(price) INTO total FROM sales WHERE product_id = product_id;
    RETURN total;
END;
'''

In this example, the 'total_sales' function calculates the total sales amount for a specified product. It accepts a single parameter, 'product_id', and returns a value of type 'DECIMAL(10,2)'. The logic is encapsulated within the 'BEGIN ... END' block, where a variable named 'total' is declared. The function calculates the sum of the 'price' column from the 'sales' table for the given 'product_id', storing the result in the 'total' variable. Finally, it returns the value of 'total'.

After defining the function, you can save it to the database by executing the 'CREATE FUNCTION' statement. Subsequently, you can invoke the function in your SQL queries just as you would any other function. For instance, you might use the 'total_sales' function in a 'SELECT' statement like this:

'''sql
SELECT product_id, total_sales(product_id) FROM products;
'''

Keep in mind that stored functions in SQL are powerful tools that can streamline your code and enhance performance by minimizing network traffic between your application and the database.
