To convert a hexadecimal number to binary, each hexadecimal digit is substituted with its binary equivalent, which consists of four bits.

Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, while binary is a base-2 system. Each digit in the hexadecimal system can represent 16 different values (from $0$ to $15$), while each digit in the binary system can represent only $2$ values (either $0$ or $1$). Consequently, each hexadecimal digit can be represented by exactly four binary digits.

To perform the conversion from hexadecimal to binary, follow these steps:

1. **Write down the hexadecimal number** that you wish to convert.
   
2. **Determine the binary equivalent** for each hexadecimal digit. You can refer to a conversion table for assistance. Here is a simple conversion table:

   $$ 
   \begin{array}{|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Hexadecimal} & \text{Binary} \\
   \hline
   0 & 0000 \\
   1 & 0001 \\
   2 & 0010 \\
   3 & 0011 \\
   4 & 0100 \\
   5 & 0101 \\
   6 & 0110 \\
   7 & 0111 \\
   8 & 1000 \\
   9 & 1001 \\
   A & 1010 \\
   B & 1011 \\
   C & 1100 \\
   D & 1101 \\
   E & 1110 \\
   F & 1111 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

3. **Replace each hexadecimal digit** with its corresponding four-bit binary representation. Maintain the same order as the original hexadecimal digits.

   For example, if you are converting the hexadecimal number $A3$, the digit $A$ corresponds to $1010$ in binary, and the digit $3$ corresponds to $0011$. Therefore, $A3$ in hexadecimal translates to $10100011$ in binary.

4. **The final result** is the binary equivalent of the hexadecimal number.

It's important to remember that when you convert a number from hexadecimal to binary, the actual value of the number remains unchanged; only its representation is altered. This process is akin to translating a sentence from one language to another: while the words may differ, the underlying meaning stays the same.
