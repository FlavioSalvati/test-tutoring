Static linking is a process in software development where all library modules are integrated into the executable file at compile time.

More specifically, static linking occurs during the compilation and linking stages of creating an executable file. This method involves incorporating all the library code that your program depends on directly into the executable. This integration happens at compile time, which is the phase when the source code is transformed into machine code. The end result is a self-contained executable that does not rely on external libraries to function, as all the necessary code is 'baked in'.

The primary advantage of static linking is that it produces a standalone executable, which can be executed on any system without needing additional libraries. This is particularly beneficial for software distribution, as it streamlines the deployment process and ensures that the software operates as intended on the end user's machine. Furthermore, static linking eliminates the risk of encountering 'DLL Hell', a problematic scenario where conflicts arise from different versions of the same dynamic link library.

However, static linking also has notable drawbacks. One significant disadvantage is that it can result in larger executable files, since all required library code is included, irrespective of whether it is utilized. This can lead to redundancy if multiple executables use the same libraries. Additionally, any updates or bug fixes made to the libraries will not be reflected in the executable unless it is recompiled.

In contrast, dynamic linking—the alternative linking method—involves linking libraries at runtime. This approach can yield smaller executables and allows for library updates without the need for recompilation, but it necessitates that the correct versions of the libraries are available on the end user's system.

In conclusion, static linking is a method for creating standalone executables that encompass all necessary library code. It presents both advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between static and dynamic linking will depend on the specific requirements of the software being developed.
