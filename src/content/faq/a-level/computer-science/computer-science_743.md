A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree characterized by its ability to allow quick access to recently accessed elements.

This type of binary search tree reorganizes itself with every operation performed—be it insertion, deletion, or search. The reorganization process, known as 'splaying', brings the element involved in the operation to the root of the tree, thereby facilitating quicker access in future operations. This dynamic adjustment makes splay trees particularly beneficial in applications where certain elements are accessed more frequently than others.

During the splaying process, when an element is accessed, it is moved to the root of the tree through a series of tree rotations. These rotations not only reposition the accessed element but also contribute to partially rebalancing the tree, which can enhance the efficiency of subsequent operations.

A distinctive feature of splay trees is their self-adjusting nature. This means that the tree automatically modifies its structure based on the sequence of operations performed. Such adjustments can lead to significant efficiency gains for specific operational sequences. For instance, if a particular element is accessed frequently, it will tend to remain near the root, resulting in rapid future accesses to that element.

Another notable advantage of splay trees is that they do not require additional information to be stored per node, unlike other self-adjusting trees, such as AVL trees or red-black trees. This attribute makes splay trees more space-efficient compared to their counterparts.

Regarding time complexity, the worst-case time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations in a splay tree is $O(n)$. However, the amortized time complexity for these operations is $O(\log n)$, which implies that over a sequence of $n$ operations, the average time per operation is $O(\log n)$. This efficiency is particularly advantageous in scenarios where certain elements are accessed more frequently than others.
