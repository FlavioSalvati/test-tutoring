The responsibilities of a linker during the code generation phase include resolving symbol references, combining object files, and managing memory allocation.

The linker is a vital component in the transformation of source code into an executable program. It takes the object files generated by the compiler and merges them into a single executable file. This process encompasses several key responsibilities.

Firstly, the linker resolves symbol references. During compilation, the compiler frequently encounters symbols—such as function names or variable identifiers—that are defined in other files. These unresolved references remain in the object files. The linker is responsible for matching each reference with its corresponding definition, which may reside in other object files or libraries. If the linker fails to locate a definition for a reference, it will generate an error.

Secondly, the linker combines object files. An object file is a file containing machine code produced by the compiler for each source file. The linker consolidates these object files into a single executable file, organizing the code and data from each object file into designated sections within the executable. Additionally, the linker ensures that all inter-file references are accurately linked.

Lastly, the linker manages memory allocation. It assigns memory addresses to the various code and data sections of the executable file. This involves determining where in memory each section will be loaded during program execution. The linker also modifies the code in the executable to reflect these assigned memory addresses, a process known as relocation.

Beyond these primary functions, the linker may also undertake various additional tasks, such as optimization and debugging support. For instance, it might optimize the layout of the executable file to enhance runtime performance or incorporate debugging information to facilitate error diagnosis. Despite its complexity, the linking process is generally transparent to the programmer, as the linker is typically invoked automatically by the development environment.
