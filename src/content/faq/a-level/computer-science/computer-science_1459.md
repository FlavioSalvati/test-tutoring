The primary functions of a Database Management System (DBMS) encompass data storage, manipulation, protection, and retrieval.

A DBMS is a software system that facilitates interaction between users, applications, and the database itself, allowing for the capture and analysis of data. Its core purpose is to provide a structured approach for storing, retrieving, updating, and managing data. By doing so, it ensures that the data remains consistent, secure, and readily accessible to users.

One of the fundamental roles of a DBMS is data storage. It offers a systematic and organized method for storing vast amounts of data. This data can be formatted in various structures, such as tables, reports, and spreadsheets. Additionally, the DBMS allows users to manage these formats by defining data types, structures, and constraints for the stored information.

Data manipulation is another critical function of a DBMS. This includes the processes of retrieving, updating, and deleting data. Users can execute queries to extract specific information, modify existing data, or remove data from the database. This interaction is typically conducted using a query language such as SQL (Structured Query Language), and the DBMS provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

Equally important is the function of data protection within a DBMS. It safeguards the data against unauthorized access, corruption, and loss through a variety of security measures, such as user authentication, data encryption, and backup and recovery procedures. Moreover, the DBMS upholds data integrity by ensuring that the information stored is accurate and consistent.

Finally, a DBMS supports multi-user access, allowing multiple users to access and manipulate data concurrently. The system manages this capability by ensuring that transactions are processed reliably and efficiently, preventing any interference between users during their transactions.
