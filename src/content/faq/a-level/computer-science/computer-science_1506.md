Data structures can be classified into two main categories: simple data structures and composite data structures. Simple data structures are designed to store a single value at a time, while composite data structures can hold multiple values simultaneously.

**Simple Data Structures**  
Also referred to as primitive data structures, simple data structures serve as the fundamental building blocks for data manipulation. They encompass basic types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. Each type is capable of storing a single value. For instance, an integer variable can hold values such as $5$ or $10$, whereas a character variable might store a single character like 'a' or 'b'. These structures are termed 'simple' because they deal with straightforward pieces of data, and operations performed on them are usually uncomplicated and direct.

**Composite Data Structures**  
In contrast, composite data structures, also known as non-primitive data structures, are more sophisticated. They can accommodate multiple values, potentially of different types, at the same time. Examples of composite data structures include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. These structures are termed 'composite' because they are made up of simpler data structures. For example, an array can hold a collection of integers, while a list can maintain a sequence of characters. Operations on composite data structures tend to be more complex, involving manipulation of either the entire structure or its individual elements. To learn more about how arrays manage multiple data types, see [insert relevant resource here]. Additionally, linked lists provide dynamic data storage solutions; you can read more about them at [insert relevant resource here].

**Choosing Between Simple and Composite Data Structures**  
The decision to use simple or composite data structures hinges on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. If you only need to store a single value, a simple data structure suffices. However, if your needs involve storing multiple related values or organizing data in a particular way, a composite data structure is more suitable. Understanding the distinctions between these two categories of data structures is essential for effective problem-solving in computer science.

**Summary for A-Level Computer Science Tutoring**:  
Simple data structures are designed to store one value at a time—such as integers or characters—making them easy to use. On the other hand, composite data structures, like arrays and lists, can store multiple values and are inherently more complex. The choice between using simple or composite data structures depends on whether you need to store a single value or organize multiple values for your specific problem.
