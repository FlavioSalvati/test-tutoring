Wi-Fi networks function by transmitting data through radio waves from a central hub, typically a wireless router, to various connected devices.

Wi-Fi, which stands for Wireless Fidelity, is a technology that enables devices such as computers, smartphones, and other equipment to connect to the internet and communicate with one another wirelessly within a designated area, known as a Wi-Fi network. This network operates using radio waves to facilitate data transmission.

The process begins with a wireless router, which serves as the central hub of the network. This router is connected to the internet via a modem, receiving data in the form of binary code. The router then converts this binary code into a radio signal and broadcasts it. Devices connected to the network, equipped with wireless adapters, receive this radio signal. The wireless adapter subsequently decodes the signal back into binary data, which the device is capable of understanding and utilizing.

Wi-Fi networks typically operate on frequency bands of $2.4 \, \text{GHz}$ or $5 \, \text{GHz}$. These frequencies are subdivided into multiple channels to mitigate interference and congestion. The $2.4 \, \text{GHz}$ band consists of $14$ channels, while the $5 \, \text{GHz}$ band offers $23$ available channels. For successful communication, the router and the devices on the network must be tuned to the same channel.

There are different operational modes for Wi-Fi networks, with the most common being infrastructure mode and ad-hoc mode. In infrastructure mode, all devices communicate through the router. Conversely, in ad-hoc mode, devices communicate directly with each other without the necessity of a router.

Security is a vital component of Wi-Fi networks. To safeguard the data being transmitted, Wi-Fi networks frequently utilize encryption protocols such as WEP, WPA, and WPA2. These protocols encrypt the data before transmission, and only the intended receiving device possesses the key required to decrypt it.

In summary, Wi-Fi networks function by utilizing a wireless router to convert internet data into radio signals, which are then received and decoded by connected devices. These networks operate on specific frequency bands and channels, can function in various modes, and employ encryption protocols to ensure security.
