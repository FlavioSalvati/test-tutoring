The pancake sorting algorithm is a unique comparison sort that sorts a stack of pancakes (or an array of numbers) by repeatedly flipping subsets of the stack.

This algorithm is inspired by a hypothetical scenario where you have a stack of pancakes of varying sizes, and your goal is to arrange them so that the largest pancake is at the bottom and the smallest is at the top. The only tool available for this task is a spatula that allows you to flip the top $n$ pancakes in the stack. In computational terms, this operation corresponds to reversing the order of the first $n$ elements in an array.

The algorithm begins by identifying the maximum element in the array and flipping it to the top (if it is not already there). After positioning the maximum element at the top, the entire array is flipped, placing the maximum element at the bottom. This process is then repeated for the remaining unsorted portion of the array, excluding the last element, as it is already in its correct position. The algorithm continuously finds the maximum element in the unsorted section, flips it to the top, and then flips the unsorted section again to move the maximum element to its proper place. This iterative process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Despite its intriguing nature, the pancake sorting algorithm is rarely used in practice due to its inefficiency. Its worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$, which can result in significant delays for larger arrays. Nonetheless, it serves as an engaging example that illustrates key concepts in computer science, such as the notion of an in-place sortâ€”an algorithm that sorts an array without requiring additional memory.

In summary, the pancake sorting algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly flipping the maximum element to the top of the unsorted portion and then flipping that section to place the maximum element in its correct position. While this algorithm is simple and interesting, it is not particularly efficient for practical use.
