Bubble sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm frequently discussed in computer science. Its name derives from the way the largest unsorted element "bubbles" up to its correct position with each iteration. However, it is important to note that bubble sort is not suited for large data sets due to its average and worst-case time complexity, both of which are $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of items being sorted.

The algorithm begins by examining the first two elements of the list. If the first element is larger than the second, they are swapped. The algorithm then progresses to compare the second and third elements, and this comparison continues sequentially through the list. Once the end of the list is reached, the largest element will have been moved to the last position, thus completing one full pass.

After completing a pass, the algorithm restarts at the beginning of the list. However, it can skip the last element since it is already in its correct position. With each subsequent pass, the range of elements that need to be checked decreases by one.

This process repeats until a pass is completed without any swaps, which signifies that the list is fully sorted. In the best-case scenario, where the list is already sorted, bubble sort only requires one pass through the list and makes no swaps, resulting in a best-case time complexity of $O(n)$.

Despite its simplicity and ease of implementation, bubble sort is rarely used in practice due to its inefficiency compared to other sorting algorithms. Nonetheless, it serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding sorting mechanisms. Additionally, bubble sort can detect whether a list is already sorted, which allows it to potentially terminate early in some cases.
