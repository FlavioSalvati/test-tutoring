A chaining table in hash tables is an effective method for managing collisions by linking records that share the same hash value.

In the context of a hash table, the concept of a chaining table is essential for addressing collisions. A collision occurs when two or more keys are mapped to the same index. This situation is common in hash tables due to their limited size. To resolve collisions, chaining employs linked lists to store keys that hash to the same bucket.

The chaining process involves creating a linked list for each slot in the hash table. When a collision occurs, the new key is simply appended to the end of the corresponding linked list. This approach allows multiple keys to coexist at the same hash value without overwriting each other. Each linked list in the hash table is referred to as a chain, which is the origin of the term 'chaining'.

When searching for a key in a hash table that utilizes chaining, the hash function first identifies the appropriate slot (or bucket) in the table. The linked list at that slot is then traversed until the key is found or the end of the list is reached. Consequently, the time complexity for searching can reach $O(n)$ in the worst-case scenario, where $n$ represents the number of keys stored in that particular bucket. However, if the keys are distributed evenly across the hash table, the average time complexity for searches tends to be significantly better.

In summary, a chaining table in hash tables serves as a practical and efficient solution for handling collisions. It enables multiple keys to be stored at the same hash value through the use of linked lists, which can be easily traversed to locate the desired key. While it may lead to slower search times in the worst-case scenario, chaining generally delivers good performance when keys are evenly distributed across the hash table.
