Encapsulation in functional programming is realized through the utilization of pure functions and immutable data.

In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation is a fundamental principle that combines data and the functions that manipulate this data, safeguarding both from external interference and misuse. The core idea is to bundle the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on this data into a single unit known as a class. This encapsulation ensures that the data is concealed from the outside world and can only be accessed through the class's methods, preventing unexpected modifications.

Conversely, functional programming adopts a different strategy. Instead of merging data and functions, it emphasizes the separation of the two. In functional programming, data and functions are distinct entities, with each function taking input data and producing output data. A critical aspect of this paradigm is that the data is immutable, meaning it cannot be altered once created. This immutability serves as a form of encapsulation, ensuring that data remains unchanged in unforeseen ways.

Moreover, the functions in functional programming are characterized as 'pure'. A pure function is one that does not produce side effectsâ€”any alterations to the program's state outside of its output. Side effects can include changing a global variable or modifying the values of its input arguments. By avoiding side effects, pure functions add another layer of encapsulation, guaranteeing that a function's behavior relies solely on its input values, independent of the program's broader state.

Functional programming also employs higher-order functions and closures to achieve encapsulation. A higher-order function is one that either accepts other functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. A closure, on the other hand, is a function that 'captures' its surrounding state, gaining access to variables from its outer scope. This mechanism allows data to be 'hidden' within the closure, providing a distinct form of encapsulation.

In conclusion, while functional programming does not implement encapsulation through the same mechanisms as object-oriented programming, it accomplishes a comparable objective: safeguarding data and behavior from unwanted interference. This is achieved through the use of pure functions, immutable data, higher-order functions, and closures.
