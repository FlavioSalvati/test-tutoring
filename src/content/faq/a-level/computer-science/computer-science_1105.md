An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a high-level conceptual framework that describes a collection of data along with the operations that can be performed on that data.

More specifically, an ADT encapsulates both data structures and the set of permissible operations. The term "abstract" refers to the fact that it conveys a general understanding of the functionality of the data type without detailing its underlying implementation. This encapsulation is known as data abstraction, allowing programmers to concentrate on what the data type accomplishes rather than how it achieves those results.

For instance, consider the list ADT. The list ADT defines a collection of items and includes operations such as:

- Adding an item to the list,
- Removing an item from the list,
- Checking whether the list is empty,
- Determining the size of the list,

However, it does not dictate how these operations are implemented. The list could be constructed using various data structures, such as an array, a linked list, or another format. Users of the list ADT are not required to understand or concern themselves with these implementation details.

Another example is the stack ADT. A stack is defined as a collection of elements that supports two primary operations:

- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack,
- **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.

Similar to the list ADT, the stack ADT does not specify the implementation details behind these operations. A stack can be constructed using an array, a linked list, or any other suitable data structure.

In both of these examples, the ADT offers a clear and straightforward interface for users, effectively concealing the complexities of the underlying implementation. This principle of abstraction is fundamental in software engineering, as it enables the construction of intricate systems from simpler, well-defined components. Each component can be understood and tested independently, promoting better organization and maintainability in software design.
