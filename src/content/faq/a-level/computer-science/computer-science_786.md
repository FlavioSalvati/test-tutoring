A breadth-first search (BFS) in a graph is executed using a queue to systematically visit and explore the neighbors of each vertex before advancing to the next level.

BFS is a search strategy that prioritizes breadth over depth. This means that all vertices at the current level are explored before moving on to the next level. The algorithm begins at a designated starting point—often the root of the graph or any arbitrary node, sometimes referred to as the 'search key'—and it investigates the neighbor nodes at the present depth before proceeding to nodes at deeper levels.

To implement BFS, a queue data structure is employed. The process starts by enqueuing the starting vertex and marking it as visited. The algorithm then enters a loop where it dequeues a vertex, inspects it, and checks if it is the goal. If the vertex matches the goal, the algorithm terminates. If not, it enqueues all unvisited neighbors of the vertex and marks them as visited. This cycle continues until all vertices have been processed or the goal is found.

The pseudocode for BFS is structured as follows:

1. Initialize an empty queue and enqueue the starting vertex.
2. Mark the starting vertex as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   a. Dequeue a vertex from the queue, denoting it as $V$.
   b. For each unvisited neighbor of $V$, enqueue the neighbor and mark it as visited.

The time complexity of BFS is $O(V + E)$, where $V$ represents the number of vertices and $E$ signifies the number of edges in the graph. This complexity arises because, in the worst case, each vertex and each edge will be explored. BFS is particularly beneficial for finding the shortest path in a graph in terms of the number of edges and for determining whether a graph is connected. Additionally, it serves as a foundational technique in various graph theory algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
