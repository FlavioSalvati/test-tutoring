A min-heap is a specialized binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes, whereas a max-heap is structured such that each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.

Both min-heaps and max-heaps are tree-based data structures that adhere to the heap property. They are classified as binary trees, meaning that each node can have at most two children. The primary distinction between the two lies in the organization of their nodes relative to their parent nodes.

In a min-heap, the value of each parent node is less than or equal to the values of its child nodes. This property ensures that the smallest element is always positioned at the root of the tree. Whenever elements are added or removed, the tree rebalances itself to maintain this structure. Consequently, min-heaps are particularly advantageous for algorithms that require quick access to the smallest element, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used for finding the shortest path in a graph.

Conversely, a max-heap maintains the property that each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its child nodes. This guarantees that the largest element is always located at the root of the tree. Similar to min-heaps, max-heaps also reorganize themselves during insertion or removal of elements to uphold this property. Max-heaps are especially useful for algorithms that need to quickly identify or remove the largest element, such as heapsort, which is an efficient sorting algorithm.

Both min-heaps and max-heaps can be effectively implemented using arrays. In this implementation, each element of the array represents a node in the tree, and the parent-child relationships are defined by the indices of the elements. This array-based representation is memory-efficient, as it eliminates the need for additional pointers or data structures to maintain the heap's structure. A thorough understanding of the array implementation of heaps is essential for mastering data structures in computer science.

**A-Level Computer Science Tutor Summary:** A min-heap is a binary tree where parent nodes are smaller than their children, facilitating quick access to the smallest element. In contrast, a max-heap has parent nodes that are larger than their children, making it easy to find the largest element. Both data structures are efficient for different algorithms and can be implemented using arrays.
