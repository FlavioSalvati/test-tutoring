The permutation sort algorithm operates by generating all possible permutations of an input list and checking each one to determine if it is sorted.

Permutation sort, often referred to as exhaustive sort, is a straightforward yet highly inefficient sorting method. The process involves generating every possible arrangement of the input list and examining each arrangement to see if it is in sorted order. Once a sorted permutation is identified, the algorithm halts and returns that permutation as the sorted output.

The algorithm begins by creating the first permutation of the input list, which is usually the list in its original, unsorted state. It then generates the subsequent permutation and checks whether it is sorted. This cycle continues until a sorted permutation is found or until all permutations have been generated and evaluated.

There are various techniques for generating all permutations of a list, with recursion being one of the most common approaches. The algorithm starts with the first element of the list, swapping it with each of the other elements in turn, while recursively generating permutations of the remaining elements. This procedure is repeated for each element in the list.

Verifying whether a list is sorted is a straightforward task. The algorithm iterates through the list from the beginning to the end, comparing each element with the following one. If it encounters any element that is greater than the next element, it determines that the list is not sorted. Conversely, if it reaches the end of the list without finding any such pair, it concludes that the list is sorted.

The primary drawback of permutation sort is its inefficiency. The total number of permutations for a list of $n$ elements is given by $n!$ (n factorial), which increases extremely rapidly as $n$ grows. Consequently, the algorithm has a worst-case and average time complexity of $O(n!)$. Due to this inefficiency, permutation sort is generally not employed in practice for large lists. However, it serves a valuable purpose in educational contexts, as it clearly illustrates the concept of permutations and the methods for generating and verifying them.
