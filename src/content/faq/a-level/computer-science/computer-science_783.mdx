In pre-order traversal, a binary tree is explored in the following sequence: first the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

Pre-order traversal is a specific type of depth-first traversal method utilized for binary trees in computer science. The term "pre-order" derives from the fact that the root node is processed before (or "pre") its subtrees. This traversal method is inherently recursive and adheres to a defined order: initially, the root node is visited, followed by the left subtree, and subsequently the right subtree.

To initiate the traversal, you begin by visiting the root node of the binary tree, which represents the "pre" aspect of pre-order traversal. Next, you move to the left subtree, where the process is repeated. You will visit the root of the left subtree (now considered the "current" root), then progress to its left subtree, and continue this pattern until you encounter a node that has no left child. At that point, you will start visiting the right child.

Once the left subtree has been completely traversed, the same procedure is applied to the right subtree. You visit the root of the right subtree, proceed to its left subtree, and so forth. If a node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), you simply visit that node.

This traversal method is particularly advantageous when you need to create a copy of the tree or to derive a prefix expression from the binary tree. Additionally, pre-order traversal is recursive, with the base case occurring when a null subtree is encountered.

In terms of implementation, pre-order traversal can be carried out either iteratively or recursively. The recursive approach is often more straightforward: a function is invoked on the root node, which subsequently calls itself on the left child, and then on the right child. The iterative approach, on the other hand, employs a stack to keep track of nodes during the traversal.

In summary, pre-order traversal is a systematic technique for visiting all the nodes in a binary tree, ensuring that the root node is always processed before its subtrees. It is a fundamental concept in tree-based data structures and has numerous applications in various problems within computer science.
