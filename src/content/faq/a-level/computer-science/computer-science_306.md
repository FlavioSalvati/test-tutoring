The Stooge Sort algorithm is a recursive sorting technique that operates by dividing an array into three parts and sorting them recursively.

Despite its educational value, Stooge Sort is considered inefficient for practical use due to its time complexity of approximately $O(n^{2.7095})$. This inefficiency makes it unsuitable for large datasets; however, it serves as an excellent example of a recursive sorting algorithm and is often utilized for teaching purposes.

The algorithm initiates by dividing the array into three equal segments. If the array's length is not divisible by three, the middle segment will overlap with both the first and last segments. The sorting process involves recursively sorting the first two-thirds of the array, then the last two-thirds, and finally sorting the first two-thirds once again. This recursive process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how the Stooge Sort algorithm operates:

1. If the first element of the array is greater than the last element, swap them.
2. If the array contains three or more elements, perform the following steps:
   a. Calculate one-third of the array's size and denote it as $m$.
   b. Recursively apply Stooge Sort to the first two-thirds of the array, which ranges from index $0$ to index $2m$.
   c. Recursively apply Stooge Sort to the last two-thirds of the array, which ranges from index $m$ to the end of the array.
   d. Recursively apply Stooge Sort to the first two-thirds of the array again, from index $0$ to index $2m$.

The algorithm will persist in dividing the array into thirds and sorting them until the entire array is completely sorted. Although Stooge Sort is inefficient, it exemplifies the divide-and-conquer strategy prevalent in computer science. Furthermore, it provides an engaging method to explore recursion, a fundamental concept within the field.
