The ShellSort algorithm operates by sorting elements at specific intervals, progressively reducing these intervals until the entire list is sorted.

Named after its inventor, Donald Shell, ShellSort is a generalization of the insertion sort that enables the exchange of items that are far apart. The core idea is to organize the list of elements such that if we start from any position and consider every $h$-th element, we obtain a sorted sublist. This characteristic is referred to as being $h$-sorted. Alternatively, one can view it as $h$ interleaved lists, each of which is sorted independently.

The algorithm initiates by defining a gap, typically set to half the size of the list. It then compares elements that are separated by this gap, swapping them if they are in the incorrect order. This process continues until the end of the list is reached. Subsequently, the gap is halved, and the procedure is repeated. This cycle persists until the gap becomes $1$, at which point the algorithm effectively performs a standard insertion sort. By this stage, however, the list is nearly sorted, representing an optimal scenario for insertion sort and yielding enhanced performance.

The key to ShellSort's improved efficiency compared to insertion sort lies in its ability to allow elements to move large distances in a single operation, rather than requiring incremental steps. This feature makes it particularly effective for lists where elements are nearly in reverse order, as they can be swiftly repositioned to their correct locations.

The selection of gap sequences is a nuanced topic, with numerous different sequences suggested. The original sequence proposed by Shell starts with a gap of $n/2$ and halves it with each iteration. However, alternative sequences such as the Pratt sequence or the Sedgewick sequence may offer superior performance.

Regarding complexity, ShellSort has a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Yet, with an appropriate choice of gaps, it can achieve a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, making it more efficient than basic comparison sorts like bubble sort or insertion sort. Nonetheless, it remains less efficient than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort when applied to larger lists.
