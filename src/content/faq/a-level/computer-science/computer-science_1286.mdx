A compiler front-end analyzes source code by transforming it into an intermediate representation (IR) for subsequent processing.

As the initial phase of the compilation process, the compiler front-end is tasked with understanding both the syntax and semantics of the source code. This phase encompasses several key activities: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and certain optimization techniques. The result of this phase is an intermediate representation of the source code, which is utilized by the compiler back-end for further refinement and code generation.

The first step in the front-end process is lexical analysis, commonly referred to as scanning. During this stage, the lexical analyzer examines the source code character by character, grouping them into meaningful sequences known as lexemes. Each lexeme is associated with a token, which consists of a token name and an optional attribute value. For instance, tokens may include keywords, identifiers, constants, or symbols.

Following lexical analysis is syntax analysis, or parsing. In this phase, the parser takes the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and organizes them to reflect the grammatical structure of the program. This structure is typically represented as a parse tree or syntax tree. The parser verifies that the expressions in the program adhere to the syntactical rules of the programming language.

The third step is semantic analysis. The semantic analyzer utilizes the syntax tree and a symbol table—a data structure created by the compiler that contains information about identifiers—to ensure that the source code is semantically consistent with the language definition. This analysis checks for issues such as type mismatches, undeclared variables, and other errors that do not pertain to the program's syntax.

In addition to these analyses, some compilers incorporate certain optimization techniques during the front-end phase. These optimizations may include constant folding (the process of replacing constant expressions with their corresponding values), dead code elimination (the removal of code that does not influence the program's output), and other optimizations that can be applied without knowledge of the target architecture.

The output generated by the compiler front-end is an intermediate representation of the source code. This IR serves as a lower-level representation of the program, maintaining all necessary information to facilitate the production of the final machine code. Subsequently, this IR is passed to the compiler back-end, which conducts additional optimizations and ultimately generates the executable machine code.
