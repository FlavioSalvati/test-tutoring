Universal hashing is a method for constructing hash functions that minimizes the likelihood of collisions through randomization.

To elaborate, universal hashing involves selecting hash functions from a well-defined class in such a way that keys are uniformly distributed. This uniformity ensures that no specific key is preferentially mapped to a particular hash value. The primary objective of universal hashing is to reduce the probability of hash collisions, which occur when two distinct keys produce the same hash value.

In a universal hashing system, the hash function is not predetermined; rather, it is randomly selected from a set of potential hash functions. This set is specifically designed so that for any pair of distinct keys, the number of hash functions that yield the same hash value is minimal. The inherent randomness in this approach promotes a uniform distribution of keys, thereby decreasing the chances of collisions.

The concept of universal hashing was introduced to address the worst-case scenario in hashing, where all keys might map to the same hash value, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$ for search operations. By ensuring a more evenly distributed set of hash values, universal hashing helps maintain an average-case time complexity of $O(1)$ for search operations.

Universal hashing is especially advantageous in scenarios where the distribution of keys is unknown or may change over time. By randomly selecting a new hash function whenever the hash table is resized, universal hashing can effectively adapt to evolving key distributions.

In summary, universal hashing is a technique employed in data structures to achieve a more uniform key distribution and to minimize the likelihood of hash collisions. By randomly selecting a hash function from a carefully designed set, this approach helps maintain the efficiency of search operations, making universal hashing a valuable asset in various computing applications.
