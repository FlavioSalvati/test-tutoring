Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that enables web applications to request resources from a different domain than the one from which they originated.

CORS operates through the use of additional HTTP headers, which instruct browsers to grant a web application running at one origin permission to access specific resources from a server at a different origin. A web application performs a cross-origin HTTP request when it seeks to retrieve a resource from a domain, protocol, or port that differs from that of the current document.

For instance, consider a web application hosted at $http://mydomain.com$ that uses AJAX to request data from $http://yourdomain.com$. Due to security measures, browsers impose restrictions on cross-origin HTTP requests initiated by scripts like AJAX. CORS was developed to mitigate these restrictions, allowing various resources (such as fonts, JavaScript files, etc.) on a web page to be fetched from an external domain.

Here’s how CORS functions: When a browser makes a request, it includes an 'Origin' header that identifies the domain from which the request originated. The server then evaluates this header and decides whether to respond based on its CORS policy. If the server permits the request, it responds with an 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header that matches the 'Origin' value from the request. Consequently, the browser determines whether to proceed with the request based on the information in the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header.

If the server opts not to fulfill the request—possibly due to not recognizing the requesting domain—it may either omit the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header entirely or set it to a value that does not correspond to the 'Origin' header from the request. In either scenario, the browser will block the request from completing.

In conclusion, CORS is an essential security feature that empowers servers to regulate which domains can access their resources. It serves as a means to relax the same-origin policy, which typically restricts web pages from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the web page, all while ensuring that server resources remain protected.
