The Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is a widely utilized cache management technique that prioritizes the removal of the least recently accessed items first.

In essence, the LRU algorithm serves as a cache replacement policy in computer memory management. It is based on the principle that data which has been recently accessed is more likely to be needed again in the near future. Consequently, when the cache reaches its capacity and a new item must be introduced, the LRU algorithm identifies and discards the item that has been unused for the longest duration.

To implement the LRU algorithm effectively, it is necessary to track the usage history of cached items. This tracking can be resource-intensive, as it requires maintaining "age bits" for each cache line and determining which cache line is the "Least Recently Used" based on these age bits. Each time a cache line is accessed, the ages of all other cache lines must be updated accordingly.

LRU encompasses a family of caching algorithms, with notable examples including 2Q, developed by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha, and LRU/K, created by Pat O'Neil, Betty O'Neil, and Gerhard Weikum. These algorithms aim to intelligently assess which data should remain in the cache and which should be evicted, based on the observed access patterns.

While the LRU algorithm is straightforward to comprehend and implement, it is not universally the optimal choice for every caching scenario. For instance, in cases where older items are more likely to be accessed than newer ones, a Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm may be more effective. However, for most general-purpose caching applications, LRU strikes a favorable balance between implementation complexity and performance efficiency.
