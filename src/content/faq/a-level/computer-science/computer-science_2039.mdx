Cycle sort is an in-place, unstable sorting algorithm that organizes elements by repeatedly swapping them until they reach their correct positions.

The cycle sort algorithm can be visualized as a cyclic graph, where each node represents an element of the array and the edges indicate the desired positions of these elements. The process begins with the first element in the array. The algorithm determines the correct position of this element in the sorted array by counting how many elements are less than it. If the element is already in its correct position, the algorithm proceeds to the next element. If it is not in the correct position, the algorithm swaps it with the element currently occupying that position.

This swapping process continues with the newly positioned element. If the algorithm encounters an element that is already in its correct position, it breaks the current cycle and shifts its focus to the next unprocessed element in the array. To track which positions have been included in cycles, a Boolean array is maintained.

Cycle sort repeats this process of swapping elements and breaking cycles until the entire array has been iterated over. Since each element is moved at most twice throughout the sorting procedure, the time complexity of cycle sort is $O(n^2)$. This makes it less efficient than other sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or mergesort, particularly for larger arrays. However, cycle sort requires only a constant amount of extra space, which qualifies it as an in-place sorting algorithm. This characteristic can be advantageous in scenarios with limited memory availability.

In summary, cycle sort is a distinctive sorting algorithm that systematically swaps elements in cycles until they are positioned correctly. While it may not be the most efficient choice for sorting larger arrays, its in-place nature provides significant benefits in specific contexts.
