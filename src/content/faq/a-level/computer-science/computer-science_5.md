A **while loop** is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. This loop can be likened to a repeating 'if' statement. The code inside the loop continues to run repeatedly until the condition evaluates to false, at which point the loop terminates. This characteristic makes while loops particularly useful for scenarios where the number of iterations is not predetermined, such as reading lines from a file until the end is reached.

In contrast, a **for loop** is another type of control flow statement designed to execute a block of code a specific number of times. The structure of a for loop simplifies the process of creating loops with a defined iteration count. A for loop consists of three main components: initialization, condition, and iteration. The initialization step is performed once at the start of the loop, the condition is evaluated before each iteration, and the iteration step is executed at the end of each loop cycle. This makes for loops especially suitable for cases where the number of iterations is known in advance, such as when iterating through elements in an array. 

In summary:
- **While Loop**: Repeats until a condition is false; useful for unknown iteration counts.
- **For Loop**: Repeats a specified number of times; ideal for known iteration counts.
