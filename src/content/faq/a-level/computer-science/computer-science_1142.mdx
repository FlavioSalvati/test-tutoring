A queue can be effectively implemented using a linked list by adding elements at the end (enqueue) and removing them from the front (dequeue).

A queue is a data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will also be the first one to be removed. In a linked list, each element, or node, points to the next, creating a dynamic structure that can grow and shrink as needed.

To implement a queue with a linked list, two pointers are required: one for the front of the queue and another for the rear. The front pointer is used to remove elements from the queue, while the rear pointer is used to add elements.

When an element is added (enqueued), it is placed at the end of the queue. This involves creating a new node, assigning its value to the element being added, and updating the 'next' pointer of the current last node to reference this new node. Subsequently, the rear pointer is updated to point to the newly added node.

Conversely, when an element is removed (dequeued), it is taken from the front of the queue. This is accomplished by moving the front pointer to the next node in the list. The node that was previously at the front becomes unreferenced by the queue and can be safely deleted.

It is crucial to handle scenarios where the queue is empty. When adding an element to an empty queue, both the front and rear pointers should be set to the new node. Conversely, if an attempt is made to remove an element from an empty queue, an error should be returned, or the operation should be ignored.

In terms of time complexity, both the enqueue and dequeue operations have a complexity of $O(1)$, indicating that these operations take constant time regardless of the size of the queue. This efficiency arises because the operations only involve the front and rear pointers and do not require traversing the entire list.

In summary, implementing a queue using a linked list entails managing two pointers—one for the front and one for the rear—and correctly handling additions and removals in accordance with the FIFO principle.
