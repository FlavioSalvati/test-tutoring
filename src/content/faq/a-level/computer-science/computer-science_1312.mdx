A flat-file database stores data in a single table, while a relational database organizes data into multiple tables that are interconnected by relationships.

A flat-file database is a straightforward type of database that maintains all of its data within a single table or list. Each field in this table represents a distinct parameter. Typically, a flat-file database is manifested as a plain text or binary file, with each record occupying a separate line. For example, consider a spreadsheet that lists students along with their corresponding grades; this can be viewed as a flat-file database. While flat-file databases are easy to create and manage, they are not well-suited for complex queries or large datasets. Additionally, they have inherent limitations regarding data redundancy and data integrity.

In contrast, a relational database is a more sophisticated type of database that organizes data into one or more tables, commonly referred to as "relations," arranged in rows and columns. Each row in a table is uniquely identified by a key. The tables within a relational database are interrelated based on the values they contain, allowing for efficient data access and management. For instance, a school might implement a relational database consisting of separate tables for students, courses, and grades, effectively linking each student to their respective courses and grades.

Relational databases offer enhanced power and flexibility compared to flat-file databases. They are capable of managing substantial amounts of data and executing complex queries. Furthermore, relational databases come equipped with robust tools designed to ensure data integrity and minimize data redundancy. However, this advanced capability also introduces greater complexity in design and management, necessitating a solid understanding of the relational model and proficiency in SQL (Structured Query Language).

In summary, the primary distinction between a flat-file database and a relational database lies in their structural organization and complexity. Flat-file databases are simple and straightforward, yet limited in their functionality. Conversely, relational databases provide enhanced capabilities and flexibility, albeit with increased complexity in their design and management.
