In post-order traversal of a binary tree, the nodes are visited in the following sequence: first, the left subtree is traversed, then the right subtree, and finally, the root node is visited.

Post-order traversal is one of the primary techniques for traversing binary trees in computer science. The term "post-order" reflects that the root of any subtree is accessed only after its left and right children have been visited. This method is applied recursively to each subtree, beginning with the root node.

To execute a post-order traversal, follow these steps:

1. Recursively traverse the left subtree.
2. Recursively traverse the right subtree.
3. Visit the root node.

This sequence is repeated until all nodes in the tree have been visited. Notably, in post-order traversal, the root node of the entire tree is the last node to be visited.

Post-order traversal proves particularly beneficial in specific scenarios. For instance, when you need to delete or free all nodes in a tree, this method ensures that child nodes are deleted before their parent node. This is achieved by visiting the child nodes prior to the parent, preventing any references to child nodes from being left behind once the parent node is deleted.

Another application of post-order traversal lies in evaluating algebraic expressions. In such cases, operators (represented by parent nodes) are applied after their corresponding operands (represented by child nodes). Thus, post-order traversal is well-suited for solving these expressions, as it processes the operator only after visiting the operands.

In summary, post-order traversal is a systematic approach to visiting all nodes in a binary tree. It begins with the left subtree, proceeds to the right subtree, and concludes with the root node. This traversal method is especially advantageous when operations on child nodes must be performed before addressing their parent node.
