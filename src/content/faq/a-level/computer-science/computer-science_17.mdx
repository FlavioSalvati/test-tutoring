The process of converting a hexadecimal number to binary involves translating each individual hexadecimal digit into its corresponding four-digit binary equivalent.

First, it's essential to recognize that hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, while binary is a base-2 system. This distinction means that each digit in a hexadecimal number can represent one of 16 different values (ranging from $0$ to $9$ and $A$ to $F$), whereas each digit in a binary number can only represent one of two values ($0$ or $1$).

To convert a hexadecimal number to binary, you simply replace each hexadecimal digit with its binary equivalent. This conversion is straightforward because each hexadecimal digit corresponds directly to a four-digit binary number. For instance, the hexadecimal digit '1' corresponds to the binary representation '0001', '2' to '0010', '3' to '0011', and so forth, up to 'F', which is represented by '1111'.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to perform this conversion:

1. Write down the hexadecimal number you wish to convert to binary.
2. Starting from the left, take each hexadecimal digit one at a time.
3. Look up the binary equivalent of each digit (you may refer to a conversion table to assist you).
4. Write down the corresponding four-digit binary number for each hexadecimal digit.
5. Repeat this process for every digit in the hexadecimal number.

For example, to convert the hexadecimal number '2A3' to binary, you would convert '2' to binary ('0010'), then 'A' to binary ('1010'), and finally '3' to binary ('0011'). Thus, the hexadecimal number '2A3' is represented as '001010100011' in binary.

Remember, the key to this conversion process lies in understanding the relationship between the hexadecimal and binary number systems. Once you have a firm grasp of this relationship, converting between the two becomes a straightforward exercise in translation.
