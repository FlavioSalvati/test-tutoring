The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a critical component of a computer's processor, responsible for executing both arithmetic and logical operations.

As a fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU)—the core of any computer—the ALU carries out essential calculations and decision-making tasks. Arithmetic operations encompass basic mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In contrast, logical operations involve comparisons and decisions, including operations like AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, as well as comparison tasks such as equality, less than, and greater than.

The ALU retrieves data from the computer's memory and processes it according to the instructions provided. These instructions are written in machine language, which the computer comprehends and executes. After processing, the ALU sends the resulting data back to memory or to another part of the CPU for additional processing or storage.

Designed for speed and efficiency, the ALU's performance is crucial as it directly influences the overall speed of the computer. A more powerful ALU enables faster data processing and quicker execution of commands.

Moreover, the ALU is integral to the fetch-decode-execute cycle—the method the CPU employs to execute instructions. During this cycle, the CPU fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it to ascertain the required operation, and then executes that operation. The ALU is specifically involved in the execution stage of this cycle, where it performs the necessary operations on the data.
