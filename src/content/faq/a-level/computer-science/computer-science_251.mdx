The `CURDATE` function in SQL is designed to return the current date.

As a built-in function, `CURDATE` does not require any parameters and outputs the current date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. This functionality is particularly valuable when managing dates and times in SQL queries.

To utilize the `CURDATE` function, simply include it in your SQL query. For instance, if you want to select all records from a table where the date is greater than the current date, your query would look like this:

$$
SELECT * FROM table\_name WHERE date\_column > CURDATE();
$$

In this example, `table_name` refers to the name of your table, while `date_column` indicates the column containing the dates you wish to compare against the current date. The `CURDATE` function is employed in the `WHERE` clause to perform this comparison.

Additionally, you can incorporate the `CURDATE` function directly in the `SELECT` statement to display the current date alongside other columns in your query. For example:

$$
SELECT column1, column2, CURDATE() AS 'Current Date' FROM table\_name;
$$

In this query, `column1` and `column2` represent the names of the columns you want to retrieve from your table. Here, the `CURDATE` function is used in the `SELECT` statement to return the current date, and the `AS` keyword assigns a label to the column that shows the current date.

Overall, the `CURDATE` function is an extremely useful tool in SQL for date management, enabling you to easily obtain the current date for use in your queries.
