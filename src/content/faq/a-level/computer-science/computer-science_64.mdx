A skip list is a probabilistic data structure that enables efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Essentially, a skip list is an enhanced linked list that incorporates additional forward pointers at various levels, facilitating faster traversal of the data. The term "skip" refers to the ability of these forward pointers to bypass multiple nodes in the list, significantly speeding up the process of locating a specific element.

The structure of a skip list consists of multiple sorted linked lists, where each list is a subset of the one below it. The bottom-level list contains all the elements, while each higher-level list includes a randomly selected subset from the list beneath it. The top-level list has the fewest elements, with the number of elements decreasing as you ascend through the levels. This hierarchical organization allows for efficient searching; one can start at the top level and progressively navigate downward until the desired element is found.

The efficiency of a skip list arises from its ability to combine the advantages of a sorted array—quick search times—with those of a linked list—rapid insertion and deletion times. The forward pointers enable us to skip over large sections of the list when searching for an element, akin to how we can quickly locate an item in a sorted array by jumping to the middle and eliminating half of the elements from consideration. Furthermore, because a skip list retains its fundamental linked list structure, we can quickly insert or remove elements by merely updating a few pointers, avoiding the need to shift large segments of data.

Regarding complexity, the average and worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations in a skip list is $O(\log n)$, where $n$ represents the number of elements in the list. This makes skip lists a highly efficient option for numerous applications. However, it is worth noting that they do require more space than a simple linked list due to the additional forward pointers.
