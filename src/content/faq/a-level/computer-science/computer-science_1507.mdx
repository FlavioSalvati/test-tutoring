In post-order traversal of a binary tree, the process involves visiting the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

Post-order traversal is a fundamental technique for traversing binary trees in computer science. It is termed 'post-order' because the root of each subtree is accessed only after its left and right children have been visited. This method is applied recursively to each subtree, starting from the root node of the tree.

To perform a post-order traversal, follow these steps:

1. Recursively traverse the left subtree by invoking the post-order function.
2. Recursively traverse the right subtree by invoking the post-order function.
3. Visit the root node.

This process continues until all nodes in the binary tree have been visited. Notably, in post-order traversal, the root node of the entire tree is the last node to be visited.

Post-order traversal proves particularly useful in specific scenarios. For instance, when the goal is to delete or free all nodes in a tree, this traversal ensures that no node is removed before its children. Since it visits child nodes before the parent node, it prevents any references to the child nodes from lingering when the parent node is deleted.

Another application of post-order traversal arises in evaluating algebraic expressions. In such expressions, operators (represented by parent nodes) are applied after their corresponding operands (represented by child nodes). Thus, post-order traversal is the optimal method for solving these expressions, as it processes the operator only after visiting its operands.

In conclusion, post-order traversal is a systematic approach for visiting all nodes in a binary tree. It begins with the left subtree, proceeds to the right subtree, and culminates with the root node. This traversal method is especially beneficial when operations on child nodes need to be completed before addressing the parent node.
