Web browsers render web pages differently due to their distinct rendering engines, varying support for web standards, and individual JavaScript engines.

Each web browser utilizes a specific rendering engine to interpret the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a web page, ultimately displaying it on your screen. For example, Google Chrome and Opera utilize the Blink engine, Firefox employs Gecko, and Safari relies on WebKit. Since these engines do not interpret code in the same manner, discrepancies can arise in how a page appears or behaves across various browsers.

However, rendering engines are not the sole contributors to differences in web page rendering. The extent of support for web standards, such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, also varies among browsers. Web standards are guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other organizations to ensure the continued growth of the web. Unfortunately, not all browsers offer the same level of support for these standards, which can lead to inconsistencies in the appearance and functionality of a web page across different browsers.

JavaScript engines significantly influence web page rendering as well. JavaScript is a programming language widely used to create interactive effects within web browsers. Each browser has its own JavaScript engine, such as Chrome's V8 engine, Firefox's SpiderMonkey, and Safari's JavaScriptCore. The performance of these engines can greatly affect how quickly and smoothly web pages load and execute.

Additionally, the way a browser manages fallbacks—alternative solutions when a specific feature is unsupported—can also impact web page rendering. Some browsers come equipped with built-in fallbacks for certain features, while others depend on web developers to provide these alternatives. This reliance on fallbacks can result in variations in how a web page is displayed if a certain feature is not supported by a particular browser.

In summary, the differences in web page rendering across browsers stem from their unique rendering engines, varying levels of support for web standards, distinct JavaScript engines, and their approaches to handling fallbacks. Consequently, web developers often need to test their websites on multiple browsers to ensure consistent performance and appearance.
