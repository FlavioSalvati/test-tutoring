The 'INSERT' statement in SQL is utilized to add new rows of data into a table within a database.

To elaborate, the 'INSERT' statement is an essential component of Structured Query Language (SQL), which is the standard language for managing Relational Databases. SQL provides capabilities for inserting, searching, updating, and deleting records in a database. Specifically, the 'INSERT' statement enables the creation and addition of new records (or rows of data) into a table.

The basic syntax of the 'INSERT' statement is as follows:

$$
\text{INSERT INTO table\_name (column1, column2, column3,...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...)}
$$

In this syntax, 'table_name' refers to the name of the table into which you wish to insert the new data, while 'column1, column2, column3,...' represent the names of the columns in that table where the data will be placed. The 'value1, value2, value3,...' represent the corresponding values to be inserted into these columns.

It is crucial to ensure that the order of the column names aligns with the order of the values being inserted. If you are providing values for all columns in the table, you may omit the column names from the SQL query. However, you must ensure that the sequence of the values matches the order of the columns as defined in the table.

Beyond inserting data from user input or applications, the 'INSERT' statement can also facilitate the transfer of data from one table to another. This functionality is especially advantageous for duplicating data across tables or for backing up data.

In conclusion, the 'INSERT' statement is a vital tool in SQL for the creation and management of databases. It empowers you to add new data to your tables, thereby keeping your database accurate and up-to-date.
