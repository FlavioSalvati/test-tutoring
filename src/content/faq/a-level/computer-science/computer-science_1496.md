A bitmap index significantly enhances query performance by enabling fast searching, sorting, and retrieval of records within a database.

A bitmap index is a specialized type of database index that utilizes bitmaps to expedite data retrieval. It is particularly advantageous when handling data with a limited number of distinct values, such as gender, age groups, or binary fields (yes/no). This indexing method employs a binary representation (0s and 1s) to indicate the presence or absence of a value in a record, allowing for rapid processing by computers.

The operation of a bitmap index involves creating a separate bitmap for each distinct value within the indexed column. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to an individual record in the database table. If a record contains the indexed value, the corresponding bit is set to $1$; otherwise, it is set to $0$. For example, consider a 'gender' column in a table containing $1000$ records. We would create two bitmaps, each consisting of $1000$ bits: one for 'male' and one for 'female'. In the 'male' bitmap, a bit is set to $1$ if the corresponding record is for a male; otherwise, it is $0$. The same logic applies to the 'female' bitmap.

This binary representation facilitates highly efficient Boolean operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT, which are frequently used in database queries. For instance, if we wish to retrieve all records that correspond to males AND fall within a specific age group, the database system can perform a bitwise AND operation on the relevant bitmaps. This method is significantly quicker than scanning through all records in the table.

Additionally, bitmap indexes are highly compressible, which allows them to occupy less storage space compared to other types of indexes. This characteristic further enhances query performance by minimizing the amount of data that must be read from disk.

However, it is important to recognize that bitmap indexes are not universally suitable. They are most effective with low-cardinality data, meaning data that has a limited number of distinct values. In contrast, high-cardinality data, such as unique identifiers, typically benefits more from other indexing methods, like B-trees. Furthermore, bitmap indexes can be slow to update, making them less ideal for tables that undergo frequent modifications.
