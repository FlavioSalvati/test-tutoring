A database ensures consistency during concurrent transactions through various mechanisms, including locking, timestamping, and transaction logs.

To maintain consistency during concurrent transactions, databases employ several techniques. One of the most prevalent methods is **locking**. In this approach, the database system locks the data items that a transaction is accessing, thereby preventing other transactions from modifying these items until the first transaction is completed. This mechanism ensures that transactions do not interfere with one another, thereby preserving the database's consistent state. There are two primary types of locks: **shared locks** and **exclusive locks**. Shared locks permit multiple transactions to read the same data item simultaneously, but they do not allow any modifications. In contrast, exclusive locks enable only one transaction to read and write to a data item.

Another essential method for ensuring consistency is **timestamping**. Each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp at its initiation. The database system utilizes these timestamps to establish the order in which transactions should access data items. If a transaction attempts to access a data item that has been modified by a later transaction, the database system will roll back the transaction and restart it with a new timestamp. This process prevents conflicts and guarantees that all transactions are executed in a **serializable** manner.

**Transaction logs** serve as another critical tool for maintaining consistency in database systems. A transaction log is a comprehensive record of all changes made to the database by each transaction. In the event that a transaction is interrupted—such as during a system crash or power failure—the database system can refer to the transaction log to roll back the transaction and restore the database to its previous state. This process ensures that the database remains consistent, even in the face of system failures.

In addition to these techniques, database systems often implement protocols like the **two-phase commit protocol** to guarantee consistency across multiple databases. This protocol divides a transaction into two distinct phases: the **prepare phase**, where the transaction is executed and the changes are logged, and the **commit phase**, where the changes are applied to the database. This structured approach ensures that all databases involved in the transaction reach a consensus on the outcome before any changes are finalized, thereby maintaining consistency across all participating databases.
