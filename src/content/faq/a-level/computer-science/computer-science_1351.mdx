Database locks can be classified into two primary categories: shared locks and exclusive locks.

**Shared Locks**  
Shared locks are employed when a database operation requires reading a resource without making modifications. This type of lock permits multiple transactions to read (or select) a resource concurrently, but it prohibits any changes to that resource. As long as a transaction holds a shared lock, no other transaction can obtain an exclusive lock (also known as a write lock) for that resource. This mechanism ensures that while numerous transactions can read the resource simultaneously, none can alter it, thereby preserving the integrity and consistency of the database.

**Exclusive Locks**  
In contrast, exclusive locks are utilized when a database operation necessitates both reading and modifying a resource. When a transaction holds an exclusive lock on a resource, it effectively prevents any other transaction from acquiring either a shared lock or another exclusive lock on that same resource. Consequently, the transaction with the exclusive lock enjoys sole access to the resource for both reading and writing. This type of lock is crucial for ensuring that when a resource is being modified, no other transaction can read or modify it, thereby avoiding inconsistencies and conflicts.

**Additional Lock Types**  
Beyond these two primary categories, there are several other types of locks designed for specific situations:

- **Update Locks**: These locks are a special category used when a transaction needs to read a resource with the intention of modifying it later. An update lock prevents other transactions from acquiring an exclusive lock on the resource, thereby helping to avoid deadlocks.

- **Intent Locks**: Intent locks are used to establish a locking hierarchy within the database. They signal that a transaction intends to acquire a lock at a lower level in the hierarchy. For example, a transaction might acquire an intent lock on a table to indicate its future intention to lock a specific row within that table.

- **Schema Locks**: These locks come into play during operations that involve changes to the database schema, such as adding or dropping tables. Schema locks prevent other transactions from accessing the database schema while alterations are being made, thereby ensuring the stability of the schema during modifications.

In summary, understanding the different types of database locks and their purposes is essential for maintaining database integrity and preventing conflicts during concurrent transactions.
