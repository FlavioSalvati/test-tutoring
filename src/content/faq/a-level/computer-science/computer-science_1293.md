An absolute assembler generates machine code for a specific memory location, while a relocatable assembler produces code that can be moved freely in memory.

An absolute assembler is a type of assembler that produces machine code fixed to a particular memory location. This means that the generated code is intended to be executed from a designated spot in memory. If there is a need to relocate the code to a different memory address, it requires modifying the code itself, which can be a complex and time-consuming process. Absolute assemblers are typically used in environments where memory resources are limited and the code is not expected to move, such as in embedded systems.

In contrast, a relocatable assembler generates machine code that can be relocated within memory without necessitating modifications. This flexibility is achieved through relative addressing, where the addresses in the code are defined as offsets from the current location rather than as fixed, absolute addresses. This approach enhances the code's adaptability and ease of management, allowing it to be loaded into any available memory space and executed from there. Relocatable assemblers are commonly employed in larger systems where memory is more plentiful and the code may need to be repositioned for efficiency.

The choice between using an absolute or a relocatable assembler depends on the specific requirements of the system. If memory is constrained and the code is unlikely to be moved, an absolute assembler may be the more appropriate option. Conversely, if the system benefits from ample memory and requires the ability to relocate code for improved efficiency, a relocatable assembler would be a better fit.

In summary, the primary distinction between an absolute assembler and a relocatable assembler lies in how they manage memory addresses. An absolute assembler generates code for a specific memory location, resulting in less flexibility but potentially greater efficiency in systems with limited memory. Conversely, a relocatable assembler produces code that can be moved within memory, offering increased flexibility and manageability in systems with more available memory.
