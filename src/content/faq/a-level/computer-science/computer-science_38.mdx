The binary representation of the decimal number $239$ is $11101111$.

To convert a decimal number to binary, we employ a method that involves repeatedly dividing the number by $2$ while keeping track of the remainders. Letâ€™s detail the conversion of the decimal number $239$ into its binary form.

We start by dividing $239$ by $2$. The quotient is $119$ and the remainder is $1$. This remainder represents the least significant bit (the rightmost bit) of the binary representation.

Next, we take the quotient $119$ and divide it by $2$. This gives us a new quotient of $59$ and a remainder of $1$. This remainder is the next bit in the binary representation, moving from right to left.

Continuing this process, we divide $59$ by $2$, yielding a quotient of $29$ and a remainder of $1$. We then divide $29$ by $2$, resulting in a quotient of $14$ and a remainder of $1$.

Next, we divide $14$ by $2$, which gives us a quotient of $7$ and a remainder of $0$. Following this, we divide $7$ by $2$, resulting in a quotient of $3$ and a remainder of $1$.

Finally, we divide $3$ by $2$, yielding a quotient of $1$ and a remainder of $1$. At this stage, since the quotient is less than $2$, we conclude the process. The quotient itself now becomes the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) of the binary representation.

By assembling all the remainders from bottom to top, we find that the binary representation of $239$ is $11101111$.

This method of converting decimal to binary is known as the "division by $2$" algorithm. It is a fundamental concept in computer science, as binary representation underpins how computers process and store data. A solid understanding of this process is essential for grasping more complex topics in computer science, such as data structures and algorithms.
