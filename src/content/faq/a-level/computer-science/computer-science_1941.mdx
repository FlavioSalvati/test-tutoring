The process of converting a binary number to its decimal equivalent involves multiplying each digit by $2$ raised to the power of its positional value and summing the resulting products.

To convert a binary number to decimal, begin with the rightmost digit (known as the least significant bit) and progress to the left. Multiply each binary digit by $2$ raised to the power of its position, starting from $0$. The sum of these products will yield the decimal equivalent of the binary number.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Consider the binary number $1011$. Starting from the rightmost digit, we calculate as follows:

- For the rightmost digit: 
  - $1 \times 2^0 = 1$
- Next digit to the left: 
  - $1 \times 2^1 = 2$
- Next digit: 
  - $0 \times 2^2 = 0$
- Leftmost digit: 
  - $1 \times 2^3 = 8$

Now, we add these products together:

$$
1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 11
$$

Thus, the decimal equivalent of the binary number $1011$ is $11$.

This conversion method is applicable to any binary number, regardless of its size. The essential concept to remember is that each digit in a binary number represents a power of $2$, starting from $2^0$ on the right and increasing by one exponent as you move left. This characteristic is why binary numbers are referred to as base-2 numbers: each digit is a multiple of a power of $2$.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that this conversion process is the inverse of converting a decimal number to binary. When converting from decimal to binary, you divide the decimal number by $2$ and keep track of the remainders until the quotient reaches $0$. The binary equivalent is formed by reading the string of remainders in reverse order. Therefore, mastering the conversion between binary and decimal enhances your understanding of the relationship between these two numeral systems.
