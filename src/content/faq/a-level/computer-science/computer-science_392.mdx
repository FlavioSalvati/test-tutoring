In-order traversal of a binary tree follows a systematic approach, visiting nodes in the sequence of the left subtree, the root node, and then the right subtree.

In-order traversal is categorized as a depth-first algorithm utilized in binary trees. The term 'in-order' is derived from the specific order in which nodes are visited: first, the left subtree is traversed, followed by the root node, and finally, the right subtree. This traversal method is especially advantageous for retrieving data in sorted order, which is particularly relevant for binary search trees.

To execute an in-order traversal, you begin at the root node and navigate to the leftmost node. Subsequently, you explore the left subtree of the root node. Once the left subtree has been fully traversed, you process the root node, and then you proceed to visit the right subtree. This recursive approach continues for each subtree until all nodes in the tree have been visited.

Here is a step-by-step guide to performing an in-order traversal:

1. Start at the root node.
2. Move to the leftmost node of the tree (or subtree).
3. Recursively visit the left subtree by calling the in-order function.
4. Process the data at the root node.
5. Recursively visit the right subtree by calling the in-order function.

It is important to highlight that in-order traversal is a depth-first algorithm. This means it explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. This approach contrasts with breadth-first algorithms, which examine all nodes at one level before progressing to the next level.

Regarding computational complexity, in-order traversal has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This efficiency arises because each node is visited exactly once. The space complexity is $O(h)$, where $h$ represents the height of the tree, as it requires stack space for the recursive calls.

In summary, in-order traversal is a fundamental algorithm in binary tree operations, offering an efficient means to visit all nodes in a sorted order. It operates as a depth-first algorithm with linear time complexity and logarithmic space complexity.
