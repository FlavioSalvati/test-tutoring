Heaps in functional programming languages are implemented as immutable data structures that facilitate efficient priority queue operations.

In functional programming, heaps are typically represented as binary trees. These structures are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after their creation. Instead of altering an existing heap, operations such as insertions and deletions result in the creation of a new heap. This approach aligns with the functional programming paradigm, which emphasizes immutability and the avoidance of side effects.

The most prevalent type of heap in functional programming is the binary heap. A binary heap is a complete binary tree in which each node's value is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the values of its children. This property makes binary heaps particularly suitable for implementing priority queues, where elements must be quickly retrievable based on their priority level.

To implement a heap in a functional programming language, one typically defines a data type for the heap along with functions that perform the fundamental heap operations. These operations generally include creating an empty heap, inserting an element, deleting the minimum or maximum element, and merging two heaps. Each operation yields a new heap, preserving the original heap in its unaltered state.

For instance, in the functional programming language Haskell, a binary heap can be defined as an algebraic data type with two constructors: one for an empty heap and another for a heap containing a value along with two child heaps. The insert operation would be defined as a function that takes a value and a heap, returning a new heap that includes the inserted value.

The application of heaps in functional programming extends beyond priority queues. They can also be employed in sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and various other contexts where efficient access to the minimum or maximum element is required. Although the necessity of creating new heaps for each operation may introduce some overhead, the use of heaps in functional programming often results in code that is easier to comprehend and less susceptible to errors.
