The primary types of removable storage devices include USB flash drives, external hard drives, optical discs, and memory cards.

**USB Flash Drives**  
Commonly referred to as thumb drives or pen drives, USB flash drives are widely favored for their portability and ease of use. They utilize flash memory to store data, allowing for rapid access without the need for an external power source. These devices connect to computers or other devices through a USB port and can hold data ranging from a few gigabytes ($\text{GB}$) to several terabytes ($\text{TB}$).

**External Hard Drives**  
External hard drives function similarly to the internal hard drives found in computers, but they are encased separately and connect externally, typically via USB or Thunderbolt. They provide substantial storage capacity and are commonly used for data backup or transferring large files between different computers. However, compared to USB flash drives, external hard drives are bulkier and less portable.

**Optical Discs**  
Optical discs, including CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs, represent another form of removable storage. They encode data in a digital format, which can be accessed using a laser in a disc drive. Although optical discs generally offer less storage capacity than USB flash drives or external hard drives, they are cost-effective and can preserve data for extended periods. Their resistance to data loss from magnetic fields or power outages makes them a reliable choice for long-term storage.

**Memory Cards**  
Memory cards, such as SD cards and microSD cards, are utilized in a diverse array of devices, including digital cameras, smartphones, and tablets. These small, portable devices also employ flash memory for data storage. Memory cards can be inserted into compatible devices to increase storage capacity or can be used to facilitate the transfer of data between devices.

Each type of removable storage has its distinct advantages and disadvantages, making the choice of the best option dependent upon the user's specific needs. For instance, a photographer may prefer a high-capacity SD card for storing images, while a student might find a USB flash drive more convenient for carrying school assignments.
