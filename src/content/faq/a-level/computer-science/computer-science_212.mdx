Attributes in an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) serve to describe the properties or characteristics of an entity, and they are visually depicted as ovals connected to their corresponding entities by lines.

In an ERD, each attribute conveys essential information relevant to the entity it describes. For instance, consider the entity 'Student': relevant attributes might include 'Name', 'Age', 'Address', and so on.

Attributes in an ERD can be categorized into several types:

1. **Simple Attributes**: These are indivisible characteristics. For example, 'Age' is classified as a simple attribute of the 'Student' entity, as it cannot be further subdivided.

2. **Composite Attributes**: In contrast, composite attributes can be broken down into smaller, more detailed components. An example of this is 'Address', which can be divided into 'Street', 'City', 'Postcode', etc.

3. **Derived Attributes**: These attributes derive their values from other attributes. For instance, 'Age' can be considered a derived attribute if the ERD includes a 'Date of Birth' attribute. In this case, 'Age' is calculated based on the current date and the 'Date of Birth'.

4. **Multi-valued Attributes**: These attributes can hold multiple values for a single entity. For example, a 'Phone Number' attribute for a 'Student' entity might contain multiple entries if the student has more than one contact number.

The representation of these different types of attributes varies in an ERD. Simple and composite attributes are depicted as regular ovals. In contrast, derived attributes are shown as dashed ovals, while multi-valued attributes are represented by double-lined ovals.

In summary, attributes in an ERD are illustrated as ovals connected to their respective entities, providing detailed information about the entities. Each type of attribute is represented with a specific visual style in the diagram, enhancing the clarity and understanding of the entity's characteristics.
