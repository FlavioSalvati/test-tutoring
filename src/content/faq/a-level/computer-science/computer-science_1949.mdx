To convert a binary number into its hexadecimal equivalent, the process involves grouping the binary digits into sets of four and converting each group into its corresponding hexadecimal representation.

First, it's essential to recognize that binary and hexadecimal are both numeral systems utilized in computing. The binary system is base 2, consisting of the digits 0 and 1, while the hexadecimal system is base 16, which includes the digits 0 through 9 and the letters A through F.

### Step-by-Step Conversion Process

1. **Grouping the Binary Digits**: Begin by grouping the binary digits into sets of four, starting from the rightmost digit. If the total number of binary digits does not divide evenly into groups of four, you can add leading zeros to the left. For instance, the binary number $1011$ can be represented as $0001\ 0111$.

2. **Converting Each Group**: Each group of four binary digits is then converted into a single hexadecimal digit. This conversion is accomplished by determining the decimal equivalent of each binary group and subsequently translating that decimal value into hexadecimal. For example:
   - The binary group $0001$ corresponds to the decimal number $1$, which is also $1$ in hexadecimal.
   - The binary group $0111$ corresponds to the decimal number $7$, which is also $7$ in hexadecimal.
   
   Therefore, the complete binary number $1011$ translates to $17$ in hexadecimal.

3. **Understanding Hexadecimal Digits**: Keep in mind that hexadecimal digits include the values $0-9$ and the letters $A-F$ to represent the decimal values $10-15$. Thus, if the decimal conversion yields a value of $10$ or higher, a letter will be used instead of a number. For instance, the binary group $1010$ converts to the decimal number $10$, which is represented as $A$ in hexadecimal.

### Summary

In summary, converting a binary number to its hexadecimal equivalent requires the following steps: 

- Group the binary digits into sets of four.
- Convert each group to its decimal equivalent.
- Finally, convert that decimal number to its hexadecimal representation.

This conversion process is fundamental to understanding how different numeral systems operate in computing and is an essential skill for anyone studying computer science.
