A priority queue can be effectively implemented using a linked list by inserting elements in order based on their assigned priorities.

In a priority queue, each element is associated with a priority at the time of its insertion. The element with the highest priority is always positioned at the front of the queue. In cases where two elements share the same priority, they are served according to their order of insertion.

To implement a priority queue using a linked list, one would begin by creating a class for the nodes. This node class should include two properties: the data (or value) of the node and the priority associated with that node. The priority is crucial for determining the order of the nodes within the queue.

Next, a priority queue class should be created. This class will include a 'head' property that points to the first node in the linked list, as well as a 'size' property that keeps track of the total number of nodes in the list.

The priority queue class will also feature two primary methods: 'enqueue' and 'dequeue'. 

1. The 'enqueue' method serves to add a new node to the queue. When a new node is inserted, the method begins at the head of the list and traverses through the nodes until it locates a node with a lower priority. At that point, the new node is inserted before the node with the lower priority. If no such node exists, the new node is appended to the end of the list.

2. The 'dequeue' method is responsible for removing the node with the highest priority from the queue. Given that the list is organized by priority, the highest priority node will always be the one at the head of the list. The method simply updates the 'head' property to point to the next node in the list, thereby effectively removing the first node from the queue.

In summary, a priority queue can be implemented using a linked list, but it's important to recognize the performance implications of this approach. The 'enqueue' operation has a time complexity of $O(n)$, as it may require traversing the entire list to determine the appropriate insertion point. In contrast, the 'dequeue' operation operates in $O(1)$ time, since it only involves removing the head node.
