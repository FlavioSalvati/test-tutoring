The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is $ O(\log n) $.

Binary search is an efficient method for locating an item within a sorted list. The algorithm operates by repeatedly halving the portion of the list that could potentially contain the target item, continuing this process until it narrows down the possible locations to just one. The time complexity of this algorithm is $ O(\log n) $, where $ n $ represents the number of elements in the list. Each comparison eliminates half of the remaining possibilities, which contributes to its efficiency.

To grasp why the time complexity is $ O(\log n) $, let's break down the workings of the binary search algorithm. The process begins by comparing the middle element of the list to the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, the algorithm returns its position in the list. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the list; conversely, if the target value is greater, the search proceeds in the upper half.

With each comparison, the size of the list under consideration is halved. This is based on the principle that if the target value exists in the list, it must reside within the half that the algorithm chooses for the next step. This halving continues until either the target value is found or the remaining list is reduced to zero, indicating that the target is not present.

The number of steps required to reduce a list of $ n $ elements to a single element is represented by $ \log_2 n $, commonly referred to as $ \log n $. This logarithmic relationship arises because each step halves the number of elements, which is the inverse of the doubling process. Hence, this leads to the base-2 logarithmic notation in the time complexity.

In summary, the time complexity of the binary search algorithm is $ O(\log n) $ because, at each step, the algorithm effectively halves the number of elements it needs to search through. This characteristic makes binary search an exceptionally efficient algorithm for handling large data sets.
