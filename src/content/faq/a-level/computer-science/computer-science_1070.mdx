The Pigeonhole Sort algorithm operates by assigning each item to a specific 'pigeonhole' that corresponds to its key value.

Pigeonhole Sort is a specialized sorting algorithm particularly effective for arranging lists of elements where the total number of elements is roughly equal to the number of possible key values. The algorithm runs in $O(n + \text{Range})$ time, where $n$ represents the number of elements in the input array, and $\text{Range}$ denotes the number of distinct values within that array.

The process begins by creating an array of 'pigeonholes' that is equal in size to the range of the input values. Initially, all pigeonholes are empty, containing no 'pigeons'. The algorithm then iterates through the input list, placing each element into its corresponding pigeonhole based on its key value. To determine the correct index for each pigeonhole, the algorithm subtracts the minimum value of the key range from the key value of the element.

Once all elements have been allocated to their respective pigeonholes, the algorithm proceeds to traverse the pigeonholes in order. For each non-empty pigeonhole, it extracts the contained elements and places them back into the input list. This step results in a sorted list, as the pigeonholes are processed in the sequence of their key values.

Pigeonhole Sort can be categorized as a type of bucket sort. It is particularly efficient when the number of elements is comparable to the range of possible key values. However, it is not well-suited for sorting large datasets or cases where the range of key values significantly exceeds the number of elements. This limitation arises because the size of the pigeonhole array is directly proportional to the range of key values, potentially leading to high memory usage if the key range is extensive.

In summary, the Pigeonhole Sort algorithm is a straightforward and effective sorting technique for specific types of lists. It functions by placing each element into a corresponding pigeonhole based on its key value and subsequently gathering the elements from the pigeonholes in order, resulting in a sorted output.
