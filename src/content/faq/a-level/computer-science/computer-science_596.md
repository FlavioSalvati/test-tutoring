The 'UNION ALL' operator in SQL retains duplicate records, whereas the 'UNION' operator eliminates them.

In SQL, both the 'UNION' and 'UNION ALL' operators are utilized to combine the result sets of two or more 'SELECT' statements. However, these operators differ in how they handle duplicate records. The 'UNION' operator automatically removes duplicate rows from the final result set, ensuring that each row is unique. In contrast, the 'UNION ALL' operator includes all records from all the 'SELECT' statements, regardless of whether they are duplicates.

The 'UNION' operator functions by comparing each record in the result set against every other record to identify and eliminate duplicates. This process can be resource-intensive, particularly with large datasets. Consequently, if performance is a critical consideration and you are certain that duplicate records will not appear, or if you are willing to accept duplicates, it is generally more efficient to use 'UNION ALL'.

On the other hand, the 'UNION ALL' operator simply aggregates all records from the involved 'SELECT' statements without performing any checks for duplicates. This characteristic makes 'UNION ALL' faster than 'UNION'; however, it also means that your result set may contain duplicate records. If maintaining uniqueness in your result set is essential, then you should opt for 'UNION'.

In summary, the choice between using 'UNION' and 'UNION ALL' hinges on your specific requirements. If your goal is to remove duplicate records from the result set, you should use 'UNION'. Conversely, if you wish to include all records—duplicates included—and prioritize speed, then 'UNION ALL' is the appropriate choice.
