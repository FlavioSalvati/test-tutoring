The octal representation of the decimal number $431$ is $667$.

To convert a decimal number to octal, we utilize a method that involves dividing the decimal number by $8$ and recording the remainder. This process continues until the quotient reaches zero. The final octal number is constructed by reading the remainders in reverse order.

Letâ€™s illustrate the conversion of the decimal number $431$ to octal step by step.

1. First, divide $431$ by $8$. The quotient is $53$ and the remainder is $7$.
   
   $$
   431 \div 8 = 53 \quad \text{remainder: } 7
   $$

2. Next, take the quotient $53$ and divide it by $8$. The new quotient is $6$ and the remainder is $5$.
   
   $$
   53 \div 8 = 6 \quad \text{remainder: } 5
   $$

3. Finally, divide the quotient $6$ by $8$. The new quotient is $0$ and the remainder is $6$.
   
   $$
   6 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder: } 6
   $$

Now, by reading the remainders in reverse order, we arrive at the octal representation of the decimal number $431$, which is $667$.

This method is commonly referred to as the "repeated division by $8$" method. It is a straightforward and effective approach for converting decimal numbers to octal. Remember, it is crucial to read the remainders in reverse order to obtain the correct octal number.

Understanding this conversion process is a fundamental concept in computer science. Different number systems, such as octal, are frequently employed in various computing contexts. For instance, octal numbers are often used in programming, particularly in certain legacy systems. Mastering the conversion between these number systems is an essential skill for any aspiring computer scientist.
