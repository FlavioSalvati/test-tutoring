The `flatMap` function in functional programming applies a given function to each element of a list and then flattens the results into a new list.

To elaborate, `flatMap` is essentially a combination of the `map` and `flatten` operations. The `map` operation takes a function and applies it to each element of a list, resulting in a new list containing the transformed elements. On the other hand, the `flatten` operation takes a list of lists and merges them into a single list. When these two operations are combined in `flatMap`, the function first maps each element of the input list to a new list using the specified function, and then flattens the resulting list of lists into a single, cohesive list.

For instance, consider a list of strings where each string contains multiple words. If we aim to compile a list of all the words contained in these strings, `flatMap` is an ideal solution. The function provided to `flatMap` would split each string into a list of words. The `map` operation would create a list of these individual lists of words, and subsequently, the `flatten` operation would merge all these lists into a single list.

Let's illustrate this with a concrete example. Suppose we have the following list of strings: 

$$
["Hello world", "Functional programming", "is fun"]
$$

If we apply `flatMap` to this list using a function that splits the strings into words, the resulting list will be:

$$
["Hello", "world", "Functional", "programming", "is", "fun"]
$$

In functional programming, `flatMap` is an extremely valuable operation because it simplifies the handling of nested lists in a clear and elegant manner. It is particularly beneficial when dealing with lists of lists or when the function applied to each element generates a list. By merging the `map` and `flatten` operations into one, `flatMap` enables us to write more concise and readable code.
