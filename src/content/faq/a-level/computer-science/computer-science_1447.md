Database normalization consists of several stages, including First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), Fourth Normal Form (4NF), and Fifth Normal Form (5NF).

**First Normal Form (1NF)** represents the foundational level of normalization. It mandates that the data within a relational database is devoid of repeating groups. Specifically, each set of columns must contain unique values, ensuring that no multiple columns can be utilized to retrieve the same row. Moreover, each table should be structured so that it can be uniquely identified by a primary key.

**Second Normal Form (2NF)** builds upon the principles of 1NF by ensuring that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. This implies that there should be no partial dependency of any column on the primary key. For instance, if a table has a composite primary key, every non-key attribute must depend on the complete set of primary key columns, rather than merely a subset.

**Third Normal Form (3NF)** advances this concept by requiring that all non-key attributes are independent of each other. In other words, there should be no transitive dependencies within the table. To clarify, if a column is dependent on another column, which itself is dependent on the primary key, this situation violates the 3NF rules.

**Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** is a stricter version of 3NF. It stipulates that for every non-trivial functional dependency $X \rightarrow Y$, $X$ must be a superkey. This means that if a column depends on another column, that latter column must be a unique key in the table.

**Fourth Normal Form (4NF)** addresses multi-valued dependencies. It requires that for any non-trivial multi-valued dependency $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$, $X$ must be a superkey. Essentially, this means that there should be no set of attributes capable of leading to more than one independent multi-valued fact about an entity.

**Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**, also known as Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF), focuses on scenarios where information can be reconstructed from smaller pieces, thus reducing redundancy. It necessitates that every join dependency within the table is implied by the candidate keys. 

By following these normalization forms, databases can achieve greater integrity and minimize redundancy, leading to more efficient data management.
