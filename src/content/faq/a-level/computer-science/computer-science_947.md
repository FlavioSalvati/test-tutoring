A database transaction is defined as a unit of work executed within a database management system, acting upon a database.

More specifically, a database transaction consists of a sequence of one or more operations that are performed as a single logical unit of work. These operations typically include reading data from the database (a 'select' operation), writing data (either through an 'insert' or 'update' operation), or deleting data. Transactions play a critical role in database systems, as they are designed to uphold data integrity and consistency.

The concept of a transaction is anchored in four key properties, commonly known as the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 

- **Atomicity** ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. This means that a transaction either succeeds in its entirety or fails completely. If any part of the transaction encounters an error, the entire transaction fails, leaving the database in its original state.

- **Consistency** guarantees that a transaction transitions the database from one valid state to another. This ensures that all data integrity constraints are upheld before and after the transaction.

- **Isolation** asserts that the concurrent execution of multiple transactions will not affect each other. It ensures that the results of a transaction remain unaffected by other transactions until it is completed, thereby maintaining the integrity of each transaction as if they were executed sequentially.

- **Durability** guarantees that once a transaction has been successfully committed, its changes will be preserved even in the event of a system failure. This means that the committed data will survive crashes and other failures.

Transactions are managed through two primary operations: 'commit' and 'rollback'. When a transaction is committed, all changes made to the database are saved and become visible to other transactions. Conversely, if a transaction is rolled back, any changes made during that transaction are discarded, and the database is restored to its previous state before the transaction commenced.

In summary, a database transaction is an essential mechanism that allows multiple changes to be grouped into a single operation, ensuring data integrity and consistency. This concept is fundamental to all major database systems and is vital for maintaining the reliability and robustness of database applications.
