### Enhanced Explanation of Rehashing in Hash Tables

Rehashing in hash tables refers to the process of enlarging the table and reassigning all existing elements to new positions within the updated structure. 

Hash tables are a type of data structure that employs a hash function to map keys to specific indices in an array. As more elements are inserted into a hash table, the probability of collisions—situations where two different keys are assigned the same index—tends to increase. An increase in collisions can degrade the performance of the hash table significantly. To counter this issue, we utilize a method known as rehashing.

Rehashing entails expanding the size of the hash table and recalculating the positions of all elements based on their keys. This action is typically triggered when the load factor, defined as the ratio of the number of elements to the total capacity of the table, surpasses a predetermined threshold. By increasing the table's size, we decrease the chances of collisions and thus preserve the operational efficiency of the hash table.

While the rehashing process can be computationally intensive—requiring the recalculation of the hash for each element and potentially relocating them to new indices—it is essential for ensuring the hash table's performance as the number of stored elements grows. The costs associated with rehashing can be amortized across multiple operations, which helps maintain a consistent average cost per operation.

There are various strategies for determining when and how to perform rehashing. Some implementations opt to double the size of the table each time rehashing occurs, while others may prefer to increase the size by a fixed increment. The choice of strategy often depends on the anticipated number of elements and the acceptable trade-offs in performance. A solid understanding of standard algorithms is vital for implementing efficient rehashing strategies.

### Summary for A-Level Computer Science

Rehashing in hash tables involves enlarging the table and redistributing all elements to new positions. This process helps minimize collisions, which happen when multiple keys are mapped to the same index, thereby ensuring that the hash table operates efficiently. Although rehashing can be computationally costly, it is crucial for maintaining optimal performance as the number of elements increases.
