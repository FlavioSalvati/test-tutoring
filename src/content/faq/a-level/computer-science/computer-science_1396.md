To convert an octal number to binary, you replace each octal digit with its corresponding three-digit binary representation.

Octal numbers are base-$8$, meaning they utilize digits from $0$ to $7$. In contrast, binary numbers are base-$2$ and consist solely of the digits $0$ and $1$. The conversion from octal to binary involves substituting each octal digit with its equivalent three-digit binary number.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to facilitate this conversion:

1. **Identify the Octal Number**: Begin by writing down the octal number and identifying each of its digits. For instance, if you have the octal number $345$, the individual digits are $3$, $4$, and $5$.

2. **Convert Each Octal Digit**: Use the following table to convert each octal digit to its binary counterpart:

   $$
   \begin{array}{c|c}
   \text{Octal} & \text{Binary} \\
   \hline
   0 & 000 \\
   1 & 001 \\
   2 & 010 \\
   3 & 011 \\
   4 & 100 \\
   5 & 101 \\
   6 & 110 \\
   7 & 111 \\
   \end{array}
   $$

   For our example, the digit $3$ in octal corresponds to $011$ in binary, $4$ corresponds to $100$, and $5$ corresponds to $101$.

3. **Combine the Binary Equivalents**: Write down the binary equivalents in the same order as the octal digits. Thus, the octal number $345$ converts to the binary number $011100101$.

It's important to remember that each octal digit corresponds to exactly three binary digits. This is due to the fact that the highest digit in octal, which is $7$, requires three binary digits for representation ($111$). Therefore, even when the binary equivalent of an octal digit can be represented with fewer than three binary digits (for example, the octal digit $2$, which is $10$ in binary), you should always express it as a three-digit binary number (i.e., $010$) for consistency.

This conversion method is both straightforward and user-friendly, though it does necessitate memorizing or having access to the conversion table. With practice, you'll be able to convert between octal and binary numbers quickly and accurately.
