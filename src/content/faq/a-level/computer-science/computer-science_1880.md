You can implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm on a tree using functional programming principles by leveraging recursion and a queue data structure.

In functional programming, we strive to avoid mutable state and changing data. This presents a challenge when implementing the BFS algorithm, as it inherently involves state changes. However, it is feasible to create a functional implementation by using recursion alongside a queue.

The BFS algorithm operates by exploring all the nodes at the current level of a tree (or graph) before proceeding to the next level. This approach contrasts with depth-first search (DFS), which visits child nodes before their sibling nodes. To implement BFS functionally, we utilize a queue to manage the nodes awaiting exploration. We initiate the process by enqueuing the root node. Then, we dequeue a node, visit it, and enqueue all its unvisited children. This cycle continues until the queue is empty.

In a functional programming language such as Haskell, BFS can be implemented as follows:

'''haskell
bfs :: Tree a -> [a]
bfs tree = bfs' [tree]
  where
    bfs' [] = []
    bfs' xs = map rootLabel xs ++ bfs' (xs >>= subForest)
'''

In this code snippet, the 'bfs' function takes a tree and returns a list of its nodes in BFS order. The helper function 'bfs'' processes a list of trees, extracting the root labels (the values of the nodes) and recursively traversing the sub-forests (the children of the nodes). The '>>=' operator is a monadic bind that applies a function to a monadic value (in this case, a list of trees) and concatenates the results.

This implementation adheres to purely functional principles, avoiding state changes or mutable data. However, it is not tail-recursive, which can lead to a stack overflow if the tree is particularly deep. To achieve tail recursion, one could introduce an accumulator to track the nodes to be visited, but this would complicate the code and detract from the idiomatic style typical in functional programming languages.
