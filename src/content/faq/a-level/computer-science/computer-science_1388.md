The hexadecimal representation of the binary number $11110000$ is $F0$.

To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, we start by grouping the binary digits into sets of four, beginning from the right. In this instance, the binary number $11110000$ is already organized into a group of four. Each group of four binary digits corresponds to a single hexadecimal digit.

Specifically, the binary number $1111$ corresponds to the hexadecimal digit $F$, while the binary number $0000$ corresponds to the hexadecimal digit $0$. Consequently, the hexadecimal representation of the binary number $11110000$ is $F0$.

This conversion relies on the fact that both binary and hexadecimal are positional numeral systems. Hexadecimal is a base-16 system, whereas binary is a base-2 system. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits, which is why we group the binary digits in sets of four. This grouping makes hexadecimal a convenient format for representing binary data, as it significantly reduces the number of digits required.

It is important to note that the hexadecimal system employs the digits $0-9$ and the letters $A-F$ to represent values from $0$ to $15$. In our example, the binary group $1111$ is equivalent to $15$ in decimal, represented as $F$ in hexadecimal. Meanwhile, the binary group $0000$ equals $0$ in decimal, which is represented as $0$ in hexadecimal. Therefore, the binary number $11110000$ is represented as $F0$ in hexadecimal.
