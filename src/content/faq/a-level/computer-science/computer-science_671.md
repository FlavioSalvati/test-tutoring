Early binding and late binding are two concepts related to method calls in programming, characterized by when the method to be executed is determined: at compile time or at runtime.

**Early Binding**  
Early binding, also referred to as static binding or compile-time binding, occurs when the compiler directly associates a specific method with a method call during the compilation process. This means that the method to be executed is identified at compile time. Early binding is typically seen in statically typed languages such as C++ and Java. One of the primary advantages of early binding is its performance, as the method is predetermined, which minimizes runtime overhead. However, this approach lacks flexibility; once the code is compiled, the binding cannot be modified.

**Late Binding**  
Conversely, late binding, also known as dynamic binding or runtime binding, involves determining the method associated with a method call during the execution of the program. This is commonly found in dynamically typed languages like Python and JavaScript. Late binding offers greater flexibility, as the method to be executed can change at runtime, allowing for more dynamic behavior. However, this flexibility comes at a cost, as the process of determining the method to be called incurs additional runtime overhead, potentially leading to a slight decrease in performance.

In summary, the choice between early binding and late binding should be guided by the specific requirements of the program you are developing. If performance is critical and the methods to be executed are well-defined and static, early binding is typically the better option. On the other hand, if your program demands flexibility and the ability to alter method execution during runtime, late binding is more appropriate. Understanding the distinctions between these two types of binding is essential for effective and efficient programming.
