The hexadecimal representation of the binary number $10110101$ is $B5$.

To convert a binary number to its hexadecimal equivalent, we begin by grouping the binary digits into sets of four, starting from the right. If the total number of binary digits is not a multiple of four, we can add leading zeros to the left to make it so. In this instance, the binary number $10110101$ can be divided into two groups: $1011$ and $0101$.

Next, we convert each group of four binary digits into its decimal equivalent. The binary group $1011$ is equal to the decimal number $11$, while the binary group $0101$ corresponds to the decimal number $5$.

Finally, we convert each decimal number into its hexadecimal digit. The decimal number $11$ translates to the hexadecimal digit $B$, and the decimal number $5$ remains $5$. Thus, the hexadecimal equivalent of the binary number $10110101$ is $B5$.

This conversion method is effective because both binary and hexadecimal are positional numeral systems. Hexadecimal serves as a more compact representation of binary data, where each hexadecimal digit corresponds precisely to four binary digits. This feature enhances the readability and manageability of binary data, particularly for larger numbers.

When converting from binary to hexadecimal, it is crucial to group the binary digits correctly and convert each group accurately. Any mistakes made during these steps will lead to an incorrect final result. Therefore, it is advisable to take your time and carefully verify your work.
