The selection sort algorithm is a straightforward comparison-based sorting technique that organizes an array by continually identifying the minimum element and relocating it to the beginning.

This algorithm operates by partitioning the input into two regions: a sorted region and an unsorted region. Initially, the sorted region is empty, while the unsorted region contains all the elements. The selection sort algorithm systematically selects the smallest (or largest, based on the desired order) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region. This process continues until the unsorted region is depleted, resulting in all elements being arranged in the correct order within the sorted region.

The procedure commences with the identification of the minimum element in the unsorted section of the array, which is then swapped with the first element of that section. This action incorporates the selected element into the sorted region while leaving the remainder of the array unsorted. The algorithm proceeds to repeat this process for the remaining elements in the unsorted region, consistently locating the minimum element and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted section. This cycle continues until the entire array is sorted.

Regarding algorithmic complexity, selection sort is efficient for smaller lists, as it relies on a simple linear search to identify the minimum or maximum element. However, its efficiency diminishes significantly with larger lists due to its time complexity of $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of items being sorted. As a result, selection sort tends to perform worse than other algorithms, such as insertion sort, when handling larger datasets.

Despite its simplicity, selection sort is rarely utilized for substantial arrays, as more efficient algorithms like quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort are preferable for larger datasets. Nonetheless, its ease of understanding and implementation makes it a valuable choice for educational purposes or for sorting small arrays.

In conclusion, the selection sort algorithm is a basic comparison-based sorting method that operates by repeatedly locating the minimum element from the unsorted region and transferring it to the sorted region. While it is easy to grasp and implement, its $O(n^2)$ time complexity renders it impractical for sorting large arrays.
