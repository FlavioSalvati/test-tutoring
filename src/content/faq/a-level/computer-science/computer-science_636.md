The hexadecimal representation of the binary number $11110000$ is $F0$.

To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, we begin by grouping the binary digits into sets of four, starting from the right. In this instance, the binary number $11110000$ is already organized into one complete group of four. Each group of four binary digits corresponds to a single hexadecimal digit.

In this case, the binary group $1111$ corresponds to the hexadecimal digit $F$, while the group $0000$ corresponds to the hexadecimal digit $0$. Therefore, the hexadecimal representation of the binary number $11110000$ is $F0$.

This conversion process relies on the fact that both binary and hexadecimal are positional numeral systems. Hexadecimal is a base-16 system, whereas binary is a base-2 system. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits, which is why we group the binary digits in sets of four. This method makes hexadecimal a practical choice for representing binary data, as it significantly reduces the number of digits required.

It is important to note that the hexadecimal system uses the digits $0$ through $9$ and the letters $A$ through $F$ to represent the values $0$ to $15$. In our example, the binary group $1111$ equals $15$ in decimal, which is represented as $F$ in hexadecimal. Similarly, the binary group $0000$ corresponds to $0$ in decimal, represented as $0$ in hexadecimal. Consequently, the binary number $11110000$ is represented as $F0$ in hexadecimal.
