SQL databases are structured and utilize a predefined schema, whereas NoSQL databases are unstructured, scalable, and feature a dynamic schema for handling unstructured data.

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, commonly referred to as relational databases, have been a primary choice for database management systems since the 1970s. They are founded on a relational model, where data is organized into tables, and the relationships between this data are also represented in tabular form. SQL databases require a predefined schema, meaning that the data structure must be known in advance. This makes them particularly well-suited for complex queries, as they allow for joining multiple tables and performing various operations on them. Notable examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

Conversely, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases were developed to address the limitations of SQL databases, especially concerning large datasets and the demands for agility, efficiency, and scalability. NoSQL databases are unstructured; they do not necessitate a fixed schema, allowing data to be stored in various formats such as key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases, or document databases. This flexibility makes NoSQL databases particularly suitable for semi-structured or unstructured data. They are designed for high scalability and facilitate easy updates and modifications to the database. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.

When it comes to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties—essential attributes that ensure reliable processing of database transactions—SQL databases excel in all four aspects. In contrast, NoSQL databases may not guarantee full ACID compliance; instead, they often provide "eventual consistency," meaning that changes to the database are propagated to all nodes "eventually," within a defined timeframe.

In conclusion, the decision between SQL and NoSQL databases largely depends on the specific requirements of a given project. SQL databases are typically favored for scenarios involving structured data and complex queries, while NoSQL databases are preferred for managing large datasets where the data structure is not clearly defined or is subject to change.
