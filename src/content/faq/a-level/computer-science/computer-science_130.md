The process of interpreting a programming language consists of four main stages: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and execution.

The first stage, **lexical analysis**, involves breaking down the source code into smaller units called tokens. Tokens serve as the fundamental building blocks of a program, representing individual components such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and punctuation marks. The lexical analyzer, commonly referred to as the lexer, processes the source code character by character, grouping characters into tokens according to a predefined set of rules. This stage also entails the removal of whitespace and comments, as well as the detection of lexical errors, including invalid characters or identifiers.

The second stage is **syntax analysis**, also known as parsing. In this stage, the parser takes the tokens generated by the lexer and organizes them into a hierarchical structure that illustrates the grammatical composition of the program, typically represented as a parse tree or syntax tree. During this process, the parser checks for syntax errors, such as missing parentheses or mismatched brackets. The syntax rules are dictated by the grammar of the programming language, which outlines how tokens can be combined to form valid statements and expressions.

Next comes **semantic analysis**. This stage focuses on identifying semantic errors, which involve issues with the meaning or logic of the program. The semantic analyzer verifies that operations are performed on compatible data types, that variables are declared before use, and that functions are invoked with the appropriate number and type of arguments. Additionally, it may conduct type checking and convert the syntax tree into an intermediate representation that is more manageable for the interpreter during execution.

The final stage is **execution**. In this phase, the interpreter executes the program directly from the intermediate representation or the syntax tree, processing it statement by statement. It carries out the specified operations, which can include arithmetic calculations, input/output operations, and control flow operations. The interpreter also oversees the program's runtime environment, managing variable values, memory allocation, and function calls. If any runtime errors occur, such as division by zero or accessing an out-of-bounds array, the interpreter will halt execution and report the error.
