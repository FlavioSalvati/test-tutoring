A Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), also known as a Fenwick Tree, is a data structure designed for efficient range queries and updates. It enables operations such as calculating prefix sums and updating elements in an array in logarithmic time.

The BIT is represented as an array where each element corresponds to the sum of a specific range of elements from the original array. The ranges are determined by the binary representation of the indices. For instance, if the binary representation of an index ends in a sequence of zeros, it indicates a larger range, whereas a sequence of ones signifies a smaller range. This unique property allows both updates and queries to be executed in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the array.

To illustrate how a BIT operates, consider an example with an array containing 8 elements. The BIT for this array will also consist of 8 elements, with each storing a cumulative sum of elements from the original array. Specifically, the first element of the BIT holds the value of the first element of the original array, the second element stores the sum of the first two elements, the third element contains the value of the third element, and so forth.

When an update is made to an element in the original array, the corresponding entries in the BIT must also be updated. For example, if we modify the third element of the original array, we would update the third element of the BIT as well as all other elements that encompass the range including the third element.

Similarly, to perform a range query, we can aggregate certain elements from the BIT. For instance, if we wish to calculate the sum of the first five elements of the original array, we would sum the values of the fifth and fourth elements in the BIT.

In summary, a Binary Indexed Tree is a highly efficient data structure for executing range queries and updates. It is particularly advantageous in situations where these operations need to be conducted frequently, making it an essential tool in algorithm design and data processing.
