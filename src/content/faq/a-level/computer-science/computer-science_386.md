You can implement a stack using a linked list by designating the head of the list as the top of the stack.

A stack is a data structure that adheres to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently added element will be the first to be removed. In terms of a linked list, this principle is realized by adding and removing elements at the head of the list, which is the most efficient operation in this data structure.

To create a stack using a linked list, you need to define two classes: a 'Node' class and a 'Stack' class. The 'Node' class should contain two properties: 'data', which stores the value of the node, and 'next', which points to the subsequent node in the list. The 'Stack' class will have a 'head' property that keeps track of the top of the stack, along with methods to perform stack operations, namely 'push', 'pop', and 'peek'.

The 'push' method adds a new node to the head of the list. It does this by creating a new node with the specified value, setting its 'next' property to the current head of the list, and then updating the head of the list to point to this new node.

The 'pop' method removes the node at the head of the list and returns its value. It first stores the value of the current head, updates the head to point to the next node in the list, and then returns the stored value. If the list is empty, this method can either return 'null' or throw an exception, depending on your design choice.

The 'peek' method allows you to view the value of the node at the head of the list without removing it. It simply returns the value of the current head. If the list is empty, similar to the 'pop' method, it can return 'null' or throw an exception.

By following this approach, you can effectively implement a stack using a linked list with efficient operations that run in $O(1)$ time complexity. The key point is to treat the head of the list as the top of the stack, performing all additions and removals from this position.
