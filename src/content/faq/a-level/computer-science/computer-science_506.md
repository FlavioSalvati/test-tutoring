The primary types of network firewalls include packet filtering, stateful inspection, proxy, and next-generation firewalls.

**Packet Filtering Firewalls**  
Also known as static packet filtering firewalls, packet filtering firewalls represent the most basic type of firewall. They monitor data packets traveling across the network and evaluate them against a predefined set of criteria, such as IP addresses and port numbers. If a packet matches the criteria, it is allowed through; if it does not, it is blocked. However, this type of firewall does not inspect the contents of the packets, potentially leaving the network vulnerable to certain attacks.

**Stateful Inspection Firewalls**  
Stateful inspection firewalls, often referred to as dynamic packet filtering firewalls, provide enhanced security. These firewalls not only examine each data packet but also maintain a record of whether that packet is part of an established TCP session. This contextual awareness enables them to make more informed decisions and effectively block a wider range of malicious traffic. Nevertheless, stateful inspection firewalls demand greater computing resources compared to packet filtering firewalls.

**Proxy Firewalls**  
Commonly known as application-level gateways, proxy firewalls serve as intermediaries between users and the services they wish to access. When a user initiates a request, the proxy firewall intercepts it, inspects it for malicious content or suspicious activity, and forwards it to the server if deemed safe. This approach provides a high level of security; however, the inspection process can introduce latency, thereby slowing down data transmission.

**Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)**  
Next-generation firewalls are the most sophisticated type of firewall available. They integrate the functionalities of previous firewall types while introducing advanced features such as deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention systems, and application awareness. Deep packet inspection allows the firewall to analyze the actual data within packets, rather than just the header information. Intrusion prevention systems can detect and block attacks in real-time, enhancing security. Application awareness enables the firewall to make decisions based on the specific application associated with the data, rather than relying solely on port and protocol information. While NGFWs offer the highest level of security, they also require substantial computing resources.
