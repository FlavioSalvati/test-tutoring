A rational number in a computer system is generally represented as a fraction consisting of two integers: a numerator and a denominator.

More specifically, a rational number can be defined as a number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction of two integers, with the condition that the denominator is not zero. In computational contexts, these numbers are typically stored as a pair of integersâ€”one for the numerator and one for the denominator. This representation is often implemented using a data structure or a class that encapsulates these two integers and provides methods for performing arithmetic operations on them.

For instance, in Python, you could represent a rational number using a simple class as follows:

python
class Rational:
    def __init__(self, numerator, denominator):
        self.numerator = numerator
        self.denominator = denominator

In this class, the 'numerator' and 'denominator' are stored as instance variables, and you could extend the class with methods to carry out operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Another approach to representing rational numbers in a computer system is through floating-point representation. However, this method can introduce precision errors because not all rational numbers can be precisely expressed as floating-point numbers. For example, the rational number $\frac{1}{3}$ cannot be accurately represented in floating-point format, leading to small errors in computations that involve this fraction.

In contrast, representing rational numbers as pairs of integers can help avoid these precision issues, provided that the values of the numerator and denominator do not exceed the limits of the integer type. Nevertheless, this method may be slower and consume more memory than using floating-point numbers, particularly when dealing with large integers or complex calculations.

In conclusion, the choice of how to represent rational numbers in a computer system ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the program, including considerations of precision, performance, and memory efficiency.
