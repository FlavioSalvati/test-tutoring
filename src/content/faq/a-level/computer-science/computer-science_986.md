The process of converting an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) into relational tables involves several key steps: creating tables for entities, defining primary keys, and establishing relationships.

The first step in this process is to create a table for each entity depicted in the ERD. Each entity corresponds to a table in the database, and the attributes of the entity become the columns of that table. For instance, if there is an entity named 'Student' with attributes such as 'Name', 'Age', and 'ID', you would create a table titled 'Student' with columns designated for 'Name', 'Age', and 'ID'.

Next, it is essential to define the primary key for each table. The primary key serves as a unique identifier for each record within the table. In an ERD, the primary key is typically indicated by underlining the attribute. When an entity has a composite primary key—meaning the primary key comprises multiple attributes—each of those attributes must be included in the primary key of the corresponding table.

The third step involves establishing the relationships between the tables. In the ERD, relationships are illustrated by lines connecting the entities. The nature of the relationship—whether it is one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many—determines how it is represented in the tables. For one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, a foreign key is added to the table on the 'many' side of the relationship. This foreign key is a column that contains the primary key from the related table. In the case of many-to-many relationships, a junction table is created, which includes foreign keys referencing both related tables.

Finally, it is important to consider the cardinality and optionality of the relationships. Cardinality indicates the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity. Optionality denotes whether an instance of one entity is required to be associated with an instance of another entity. These aspects are represented in the ERD by specific symbols at the ends of the relationship lines and are implemented in the tables through various constraints.

In summary, the conversion of an ERD into tables involves creating tables for each entity, defining primary keys, establishing relationships, and taking into account the cardinality and optionality of those relationships.
