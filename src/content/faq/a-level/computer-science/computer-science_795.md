An array is a collection of elements that share the same data type, whereas a record is a collection of related data items that can be of different data types.

An array is a fundamental data structure in computer science that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. All elements within an array must be of the same data type, such as integers, strings, or even other arrays. The size of an array is typically fixed and must be specified at the time of its declaration. Arrays are particularly advantageous when you need to store and manipulate a large number of similar items, such as a list of integers or a collection of names.

Conversely, a record (often referred to as a struct in various programming languages) is a distinct type of data structure that can hold a collection of related data items, which may differ in their data types. For instance, a student record might include a name (as a string), an age (as an integer), and grades (as an array of integers). Records are especially useful for grouping related data together, allowing each piece of data within the record to have a different type.

Regarding memory allocation, arrays allocate memory in a contiguous block, which can facilitate efficient access but may pose challenges in memory management, particularly when dealing with large arrays. In contrast, records do not necessarily allocate memory contiguously, as each field in the record can be stored separately.

In summary, the primary distinction between an array and a record lies in the types of data they can store and their intended use. An array is designed for storing multiple items of the same type, while a record is intended for storing related data items of varying types. Understanding these differences is essential for selecting the appropriate data structure for your programming needs.
