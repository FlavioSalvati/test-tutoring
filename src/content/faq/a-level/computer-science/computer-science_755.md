The Cocktail Sort algorithm sorts a list by traversing it in both directions—first forward, then backward—in a continuous cycle.

Cocktail Sort, also referred to as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail shaker sort, shaker sort, ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort, is a variation of the traditional bubble sort algorithm. Unlike bubble sort, which processes the list in a single direction during each pass, cocktail sort alternates directions. After the first pass, the largest element is positioned at the end of the list, while the smallest element moves to the front.

The algorithm begins by comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the incorrect order. This process starts from the beginning of the list and proceeds to the end, effectively moving the highest value to its correct position at the end. This behavior is similar to bubble sort, where the largest number "bubbles" up to the end of the list.

However, in contrast to bubble sort, cocktail sort does not start the next pass from the beginning of the list. Instead, it moves in the opposite direction, from the end back to the beginning. During this backward pass, the algorithm again compares adjacent pairs and swaps them as needed, which effectively shifts the smallest number to the front of the list.

This back-and-forth process continues until no more swaps are required, indicating that the list is now sorted.

One notable advantage of cocktail sort over bubble sort is its enhanced efficiency in handling "turtles," which are small numbers positioned at the end of the list. In bubble sort, these numbers tend to move to the front very slowly, while in cocktail sort, they can traverse the list much more quickly.

Despite its benefits, cocktail sort, like bubble sort, is not ideal for large lists. Its average and worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of items. This quadratic growth in time complexity means that the time required to sort the list increases significantly as the number of items grows, rendering it inefficient for larger datasets.
