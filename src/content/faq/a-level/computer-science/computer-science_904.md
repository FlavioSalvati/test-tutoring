A network switch plays a vital role in directing data packets by utilizing MAC addresses to pinpoint the appropriate destination port for each packet.

Also referred to as a switching hub, a network switch is an essential component in various types of computer networks. It functions at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, which encompasses responsibilities such as physical addressing, error notification, network topology management, and flow control. The primary role of a network switch is to receive incoming data packets and route them to their intended destinations within the network.

The switch achieves this by maintaining a table of MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. Each device connected to the network is assigned a unique MAC address, which is stored within the switch's MAC address table. When a data packet arrives at the switch, it inspects the destination MAC address and cross-references it with the entries in its table. The switch then forwards the packet to the designated port that corresponds to the device with the matching MAC address.

This routing mechanism is known as 'frame switching' and is a more efficient data transmission method compared to a hub, which indiscriminately broadcasts packets to all connected devices. By sending packets specifically to their intended recipients, a switch significantly reduces network congestion and enhances overall performance.

In addition to directing data packets, a network switch possesses the capability to learn and update its MAC address table. When a device initially connects to the network, the switch lacks knowledge of its MAC address. However, when the device transmits its first packet, the switch can 'learn' the device's MAC address along with the port to which it is connected. This information is subsequently added to the MAC address table. If a device is relocated to a different port or removed from the network, the switch updates the table accordingly to reflect these changes.

In summary, a network switch directs data packets by leveraging MAC addresses to identify the correct destination port. This process, coupled with the switch's ability to learn and update its MAC address table, ensures efficient and accurate data transmission within the network.
