Rehashing in hash tables is the process of expanding the size of the table and reassigning all elements to new positions.

Hash tables are a type of data structure that employs a hash function to map keys to specific locations within an array. As more elements are added to the hash table, the probability of collisions—situations where two keys are assigned to the same location—increases. This can negatively impact the performance of the hash table. To address this issue, we utilize a process known as rehashing.

Rehashing entails increasing the size of the hash table and redistributing all the elements to new positions. This process is often triggered when the load factor, defined as the ratio of the number of elements to the size of the table, surpasses a certain threshold. By enlarging the table, we diminish the likelihood of collisions and help maintain the hash table's performance.

Although rehashing can be computationally intensive—since it requires recalculating the hash for each element and potentially relocating them—it is an essential process for ensuring the efficiency of the hash table. The costs associated with rehashing can be amortized over multiple operations, which means that the average cost per operation remains manageable.

There are various strategies for determining when and how to rehash. Some implementations opt to double the size of the table whenever rehashing is necessary, while others may choose to increase the size by a fixed increment. The selection of a strategy often depends on factors such as the anticipated number of elements and the acceptable trade-offs in performance.

In summary, rehashing is a vital component of hash table management. It plays a key role in sustaining the performance of the hash table by reducing the chances of collisions as more elements are added. Despite its computational demands, rehashing is crucial for maintaining the overall efficiency of the hash table.
