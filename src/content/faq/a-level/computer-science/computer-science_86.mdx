A persistent data structure is one that retains its previous versions whenever it is modified.

More specifically, persistent data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science, especially in the realms of functional programming and certain database systems. They facilitate access to every prior state of the data structure, rather than just the current version. This is accomplished by ensuring that operations do not destructively modify the existing structure; instead, they create a new version of it.

There are two primary categories of persistent data structures: partially persistent and fully persistent. Partially persistent data structures allow access to any previous version, but only the most recent version can be modified. Conversely, fully persistent data structures permit modifications to any version in the structure, effectively generating a new version with each modification.

Implementing persistent data structures can be quite intricate. A common technique employed is path copying, which involves copying the entire path from the root of the data structure to the node being modified. While this approach can be inefficient for larger data structures, alternative methods such as fat nodes or path reversal may be utilized. Fat nodes store modification information directly within the nodes, whereas path reversal involves changing the direction of pointers within the data structure.

Persistent data structures are particularly advantageous in functional programming, where immutability—the principle that data cannot be altered once created—is paramount. They also play a vital role in version control systems, such as Git, where every commit generates a new, persistent version of the project's data structure. Furthermore, they are employed in database systems to maintain historical records, support undo operations, and enhance fault tolerance and concurrency control.

In summary, persistent data structures are an invaluable tool in computer science, allowing for non-destructive modifications and providing access to historical data. Although their implementation can be complex, the advantages they offer in terms of data integrity and access to previous states make them an important concept to comprehend.
