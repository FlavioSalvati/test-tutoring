The TCP/IP model is structured into four distinct layers: the Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application layers.

The **Network Interface layer**, also referred to as the Network Access or Link layer, is the foundational layer of the TCP/IP model. Its primary responsibility is the physical transmission of data across network devices. This layer encompasses the protocols and hardware necessary for interacting with network media, such as Ethernet for wired connections and Wi-Fi for wireless connections. Additionally, it facilitates the conversion of digital data into electrical signals for transmission over the network and vice versa. This layer corresponds to a combination of the Physical and Data Link layers found in the OSI model.

The **Internet layer**, sometimes called the Network layer, oversees the logical transmission of data within the network. It is tasked with routing data packets based on their IP addresses. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal protocol in this layer, providing a unique addressing system that identifies each device on the network. Other important protocols within this layer include the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), which offer functionalities for error reporting and multicasting, respectively.

The **Transport layer** is dedicated to facilitating end-to-end communication between devices. It delivers services such as connection-oriented communication, reliability, flow control, and error checking. The two predominant protocols within this layer are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP offers a reliable, connection-oriented service, while UDP provides an unreliable, connectionless service. This layer aligns with the Transport layer in the OSI model.

Finally, the **Application layer**, also known as the Process layer, is the topmost layer in the TCP/IP model. It serves as the interface between network services and the applications utilized by users. This layer encompasses protocols such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which are essential for web browsing, file transfer, and email communication, respectively. This layer corresponds to the combined functions of the Session, Presentation, and Application layers in the OSI model.
