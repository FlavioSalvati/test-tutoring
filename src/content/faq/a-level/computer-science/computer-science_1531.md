You can perform topological sorting on a directed graph in functional programming by utilizing depth-first search (DFS) along with a stack data structure.

Topological sorting of a directed graph involves creating a linear ordering of its vertices such that, for every directed edge $uv$ from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$, vertex $u$ appears before vertex $v$ in the ordering. This technique is particularly useful for scheduling tasks based on their dependencies. In functional programming, this can be accomplished through a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm combined with a stack.

To begin, initialize an empty stack and conduct a depth-first search traversal of the graph. In the DFS approach, you start at a selected vertex and explore as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. During this traversal, after visiting all the descendants of a vertex, you should push that vertex onto the stack. This ensures that a vertex is only added to the stack after all of its adjacent vertices (and their descendants) have already been processed.

Once the DFS traversal is complete, the stack will contain all the vertices of the graph. The top element of the stack will correspond to a vertex with no outgoing edges, or one where all outgoing edges have been visited. In other words, this vertex should be placed last in the topological sort. By repeatedly popping vertices from the stack, you will obtain a valid topological ordering of the graph.

In a functional programming context, you can implement this process using recursion for the DFS traversal and a list data structure to simulate the stack. The list can function as a stack by using the 'cons' operation to add an element to the top and the 'head' operation to remove an element from the top.

It is important to note that topological sorting is only feasible if the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If the graph contains cycles, a linear ordering of the vertices is impossible. Therefore, it is crucial to verify that the graph is a DAG prior to attempting topological sorting.
