Denormalization in a database can result in data redundancy, higher storage costs, and potential inconsistencies in data.

Denormalization is a design strategy employed to enhance the read performance of a database. While it offers advantages such as faster read times and simpler query structures, it also brings several notable drawbacks. The most significant of these drawbacks is data redundancy. In a denormalized database, identical pieces of data are frequently stored in multiple locations. This duplication can lead to a substantial increase in the required storage capacity, consequently raising costs.

Moreover, data redundancy raises the risk of inconsistencies. When the same data is stored in various locations, it must be updated in all of those locations whenever a change occurs. If updates are not executed correctly, inconsistencies may arise, resulting in different parts of the database reflecting varying versions of the same data. This can lead to critical issues, as it may result in incorrect data being utilized in calculations or decision-making processes.

Another disadvantage of denormalization is the added complexity it introduces, making the database harder to manage. Although denormalization aims to simplify query processes, it can inadvertently complicate the overall structure of the database. This increased complexity can hinder understanding and management, particularly in larger databases.

Additionally, denormalization can complicate efforts to maintain data integrity. In a normalized database, data integrity is upheld using constraints and relationships between tables. However, in a denormalized setup, these constraints and relationships are often diminished or eliminated, making it more challenging to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data within the database.

Finally, while denormalization can enhance read performance, it can adversely affect write performance. When data is written to a denormalized database, it often needs to be recorded in multiple locations. This requirement can slow down write operations and increase the likelihood of data inconsistencies if not managed carefully.
