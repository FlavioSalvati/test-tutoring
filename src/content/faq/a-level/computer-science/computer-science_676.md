Patience Sort is a sorting algorithm inspired by the card game Patience, also known as Solitaire. This algorithm organizes a sequence of cards by creating piles and subsequently merging them in ascending order.

The sorting process begins by dealing cards into piles according to specific rules. Each card from the input sequence is placed on the leftmost pile where it can be legally stacked on top of the current top card. If no such pile exists, a new pile is created to the right of all the existing ones. Each card is always placed on top of the smallest card it can legally stack upon, and if there is no smaller card, it initiates a new pile.

The piles are arranged from left to right in increasing order, with the smallest card on the leftmost pile and the largest card on the rightmost pile. Importantly, the piles themselves are not sorted; only the top card of each pile is significant. The total number of piles corresponds to the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the input sequence.

After all cards have been distributed into piles, the algorithm enters its second phase: merging the piles. This phase involves repeatedly selecting the smallest visible card and transferring it to the output sequence. This process resembles the merge step found in merge sort and can be executed efficiently using a priority queue. The merging continues in ascending order until all cards have been processed.

Although Patience Sort is not as widely used in practice as other sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort—primarily due to its worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$—it possesses intriguing theoretical properties and is beneficial in specific niche applications. Notably, it can be employed to find the longest increasing subsequence within a sequence in $O(n \log n)$ time.
