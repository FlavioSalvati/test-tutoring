A primary key is a critical component in a relational database, serving to uniquely identify each record within a table. In contrast, a unique constraint is a rule applied to a column or a set of columns to prevent duplicate values.

A primary key is defined as a specific column (or a combination of columns) in a relational database table that uniquely identifies every record. The key characteristics of a primary key include the following:

- Every value in the primary key must be unique for each row of data.
- It cannot contain null values.
- It must be able to uniquely identify each record within the table.

Each table can only have one primary key, although this key can be composed of a single column or multiple columns. When multiple columns are used together as a primary key, it is referred to as a composite key.

In contrast, a unique constraint is a rule applied to ensure that all values in a specified column or set of columns are distinct. This constraint allows for the presence of null values and enables the addition of multiple unique constraints within a single table. Like primary keys, unique constraints are essential for enforcing the uniqueness of data across one or more columns.

The primary distinction between a primary key and a unique constraint lies in their intended purposes and applications. A primary key is essential for maintaining data integrity by ensuring that each record in the table can be accurately and reliably identified. It plays a fundamental role in database design and is pivotal for various database operations.

On the other hand, a unique constraint is focused on preventing duplicate entries, which can be particularly useful for fields like usernames or email addresses. However, unlike a primary key, a unique constraint does not necessarily guarantee the unique identification of a single row of data.

In summary, while both primary keys and unique constraints are used to maintain uniqueness within database columns, they have distinct roles and rules. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and must not contain null values, whereas a unique constraint prevents duplicate values in a column or set of columns and can accommodate null values.
