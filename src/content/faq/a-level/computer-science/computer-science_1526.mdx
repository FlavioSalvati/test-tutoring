Functional programming is a programming paradigm that conceptualizes computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, while intentionally avoiding mutable data and changing states.

To elaborate, functional programming is centered around constructing software through the composition of pure functions. It eschews shared state, mutable data, and side effects. This approach is declarative rather than imperative, allowing application state to flow through pure functions. In contrast, imperative programming emphasizes state changes and the sequential execution of operations over time.

In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and assigned to variables. This capability fosters a style of programming known as higher-order programming.

Another significant characteristic of functional programming is immutability. In functional languages, once a variable is assigned a value, it cannot be altered. This immutability eliminates state changes, making programs easier to follow and comprehend. It also contributes to safer, more predictable code, which inherently enhances testability.

Functional programming promotes recursion and the use of higher-order functions such as map, filter, and reduce. These functions allow for elegant and efficient manipulation of data lists without the necessity for loops or temporary variables.

In contrast, imperative programming is a paradigm that relies on statements that modify a program's state. Similar to how the imperative mood in natural languages conveys commands, an imperative program comprises directives for the computer to execute. This approach focuses on detailing how a program operates.

The primary distinction between these paradigms lies in their approach to problem-solving. While imperative programming concentrates on the steps required to achieve a specific outcome, functional programming focuses on what the desired outcome is. In functional programming, you specify what you wish to accomplish and allow the computer to determine how to achieve it. Conversely, in imperative programming, you articulate both your goals and the steps to reach them.
