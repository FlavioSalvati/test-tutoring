Unicast transmission refers to the process of sending data from one sender to a single receiver, whereas multicast transmission involves sending data from one sender to multiple receivers simultaneously.

Unicast transmission is a one-to-one communication method within a network. In this scenario, there is a single sender and a single receiver. The sender transmits data directly to the receiver, who then acknowledges receipt of the data. This type of transmission is commonly employed in situations where a private communication channel is necessary between the sender and receiver. For instance, when you send an email to a specific individual, you are utilizing unicast transmission. This method is considered reliable, as it ensures that the data reaches its intended recipient. However, unicast can consume significant bandwidth if the same data needs to be distributed to multiple recipients.

Conversely, multicast transmission operates as a one-to-many communication method. In this case, the sender sends data to multiple receivers simultaneously, and the receivers are not required to acknowledge receipt of the data. This transmission method is often used when the same data needs to be delivered to multiple recipients at once. A common example of multicast transmission is when you watch a live broadcast over the internet. Multicast is efficient because it allows the sender to transmit the data just once, after which it is distributed to all intended recipients. However, it tends to be less reliable than unicast since it does not guarantee that all intended recipients will successfully receive the data.

In summary, the primary distinction between unicast and multicast transmission lies in the number of receivers involved. Unicast is a one-to-one transmission method, making it reliable but potentially bandwidth-intensive. In contrast, multicast is a one-to-many transmission method, which enhances efficiency but may compromise reliability.
