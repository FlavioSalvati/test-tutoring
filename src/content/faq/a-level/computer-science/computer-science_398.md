A binomial heap is a specialized data structure that consists of a collection of binomial trees.

Similar to binary heaps, a binomial heap is a type of heap that additionally supports the efficient merging of two heaps. This capability is facilitated by its unique tree structure, where each binomial heap comprises multiple binomial trees. Each binomial tree adheres to the min-heap property, which stipulates that the value of each parent node is always less than or equal to the values of its child nodes.

To illustrate the structure of binomial trees: a binomial tree of order $0$ contains a single node. A binomial tree of order $k$ can be constructed by linking two binomial trees of order $k-1$, making one tree the leftmost child or sibling of the other. This recursive property enhances the efficiency of the binomial heap, allowing trees of varying orders to be combined seamlessly to form a new heap.

The binomial heap possesses several notable characteristics. First, it supports key operations such as insertion, deletion, and extraction of the minimum element, each of which has a logarithmic time complexity of $O(\log n)$. Moreover, it enables the merging of two binomial heaps in $O(\log n)$ time, which is more efficient compared to other heap types.

Another significant feature of binomial heaps is that they consist of binomial trees arranged in increasing order of their degrees. Specifically, for a binomial heap containing $n$ nodes, the maximum number of trees is at most $\log(n) + 1$. This property ensures that the height of the heap remains relatively small, even as the number of elements increases, thereby contributing to its overall efficiency.

In summary, a binomial heap is a robust data structure that integrates the benefits of a binary heap with the ability to merge heaps rapidly. Its organization into binomial trees guarantees that operations can be performed efficiently, making it an invaluable tool in various domains within computer science.
