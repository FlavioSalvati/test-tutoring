A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree that maintains its balance through a systematic process of rotations and color changes during insertion and deletion operations.

In a red-black tree, each node has an additional attribute: color, which can either be red or black. The tree adheres to a specific set of rules, known as the red-black properties, which are enforced to maintain balance during these operations. The red-black properties are defined as follows:

1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root node is always black.
3. All leaves (null or NIL nodes) are black.
4. If a node is red, then both of its children must be black.
5. Every path from a node to its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes.

When a new node is inserted into the tree or an existing node is deleted, these operations can potentially violate the red-black properties. To restore balance and ensure compliance with these properties, the tree may require adjustments through a combination of color changes and rotations.

Color changes are relatively simple: a red node can be changed to black, and a black node can be changed to red. In contrast, rotations are more intricate. There are two types of rotations: left rotation and right rotation. A rotation operation maintains the in-order traversal property of the binary search tree, ensuring that the order of elements remains unchanged.

During an insertion or deletion, the tree is traversed from the root to the appropriate leaf. As the traversal occurs, rotations and color changes are performed as necessary. After completing the operation, a final verification is conducted to ensure that the root node remains black.

In summary, a red-black tree achieves balance by enforcing a set of properties through a combination of color changes and rotations during insertion and deletion operations. This process ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, which in turn facilitates efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
