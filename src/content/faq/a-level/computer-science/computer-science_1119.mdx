Tree traversals are essential techniques for visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure, and they can be categorized into three primary methods: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

**In-Order Traversal**  
In an in-order traversal, the process follows this sequence: first, visit the left subtree; next, visit the root node; and finally, visit the right subtree. This method is particularly useful in binary search trees, as it results in the values being returned in ascending order. To execute an in-order traversal, begin at the leftmost node, then visit the root, and proceed to explore the right subtree. Continue this process recursively for each subtree until all nodes have been visited.

**Pre-Order Traversal**  
In pre-order traversal, the sequence of visits is slightly different: first, the root node is visited; then the left subtree; and finally the right subtree. This method is often employed for tasks such as copying or cloning a tree, as well as in the construction of abstract syntax trees used in compilers. It accurately reflects the order of operations in arithmetic expressions. To carry out a pre-order traversal, start with the root, move to the left subtree, and subsequently explore the right subtree. This process is repeated for each subtree until all nodes are visited.

**Post-Order Traversal**  
In post-order traversal, the order of visiting nodes is as follows: first, the left subtree; then the right subtree; and finally, the root node. This method is commonly used for tree deletion and solving specific problems, such as evaluating postfix expressions. To perform a post-order traversal, begin with the left subtree, move to the right subtree, and finally visit the root. This process is recursively applied to each subtree until all nodes are accounted for.

**Summary**  
In summary, the distinctions among in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals reside in the sequence of node visits. In-order traversal yields nodes in ascending order, pre-order traversal prioritizes the root node, and post-order traversal visits the root node last. Each traversal method serves its unique purposes and is selected based on the specific requirements of the problem being addressed.
