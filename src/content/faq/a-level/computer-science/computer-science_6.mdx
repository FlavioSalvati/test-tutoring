Unicode is a more extensive character set compared to ASCII, as it is capable of representing a broader array of characters and symbols.

ASCII, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard that was introduced in the 1960s. It employs $7$ bits to represent each character, enabling it to encode a total of $128$ distinct characters. This set includes the English alphabet (both uppercase and lowercase), digits from $0$ to $9$, as well as a selection of punctuation marks and special characters. However, ASCII is limited in its scope, as it can only represent characters commonly used in the English language.

In contrast, Unicode is a more modern and comprehensive character encoding standard. It was created to address the shortcomings of ASCII and other similar character encoding systems. Unicode utilizes between $8$ and $32$ bits to represent each character, allowing it to encompass over one million different characters. This extensive character set includes not only all the characters represented by ASCII but also characters from nearly all written languages worldwide, in addition to a wide variety of symbols, emojis, and other special characters.

Beyond its broader character range, Unicode offers several advantages over ASCII. One significant benefit is that it provides a consistent method for encoding characters, irrespective of the platform, program, or language being used. This consistency facilitates the sharing and display of text across diverse systems and applications. Moreover, Unicode supports "combining characters," which are characters that can be combined with others to produce new characters. This feature is particularly advantageous for representing languages that utilize diacritical marks, such as accents and tildes.

In conclusion, while ASCII was adequate during the early computing era, when English was the predominant language, the global nature of todayâ€™s digital landscape necessitates a more versatile character encoding system. Unicode fulfills this requirement by offering a comprehensive, consistent, and flexible approach to representing a vast array of characters and symbols.
