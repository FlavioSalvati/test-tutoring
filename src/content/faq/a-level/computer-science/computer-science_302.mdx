Integers in binary are expressed as sequences of 0s and 1s, reflecting the principles of the binary number system.

The binary number system, also known as base-2, is a method for representing numbers using only two digits: 0 and 1. This system is the foundational language of computers, as it aligns directly with the on and off states of digital circuitry.

To convert an integer into its binary representation, begin by identifying the highest power of $2$ that is less than or equal to the integer. Place a $1$ in that position. Next, subtract this value from the original number and repeat the process with the resulting remainder. If a power of $2$ does not fit into the remaining value, place a $0$ in that position. Continue this process until you reach the power of $2$ that is less than or equal to $1$.

For instance, to represent the number $13$ in binary, start with the highest power of $2$ that fits into $13$, which is $2^3$ (or $8$). You would write a $1$ in the position for $2^3$. After subtracting $8$ from $13$, you are left with $5$. The next highest power of $2$ that fits into $5$ is $2^2$ (or $4$), so you place another $1$ in the $2^2$ position. Subtracting $4$ from $5$ leaves you with $1$, which corresponds to $2^0$. Thus, you write a $1$ in the $2^0$ position. The final binary representation of $13$ is therefore $1101$.

Negative integers can also be represented in binary using a technique called two's complement. This method involves inverting all the bits of the binary representation of the positive counterpart of the integer (changing $1$s to $0$s and vice versa) and then adding $1$ to the result. This approach facilitates straightforward arithmetic operations, even when dealing with negative numbers.

Understanding binary representation is essential in computer science, as it underpins all digital computation. It is the mechanism by which computers store and manipulate numerical data, and a solid grasp of these concepts provides invaluable insight into the fundamental workings of computers.
