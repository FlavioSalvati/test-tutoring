The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is $ O(\log n) $.

Binary search is a highly efficient method for locating an item within a sorted list. The algorithm operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, honing in on the potential location of the item until only one possibility remains. The time complexity of this process is $ O(\log n) $, where $ n $ represents the total number of elements in the list. This efficiency arises because each comparison eliminates half of the remaining candidates.

To grasp why the time complexity is $ O(\log n) $, letâ€™s delve into the workings of the binary search algorithm. The algorithm begins by comparing the middle element of the list with the target value. If the target matches the middle element, the algorithm returns its position. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the list. Conversely, if the target value is greater, the search proceeds in the upper half.

With every comparison, the effective size of the search space is halved. This is due to the fact that if the target value exists in the list, it must reside within the half that the algorithm has chosen to investigate further. This process of halving continues until either the target value is found or the search space is reduced to zero, indicating that the target is not present in the list.

The number of steps required to narrow down a list of $ n $ elements to just one element is given by $ \log_2(n) $, commonly represented as $ \log n $. Each iteration of the algorithm results in halving the number of elements, which is the inverse of a doubling process. Since doubling corresponds to a base 2 logarithmic operation, this explains the logarithmic nature of the time complexity.

In summary, the time complexity of the binary search algorithm is $ O(\log n) $ because each iteration effectively halves the number of elements to be searched. This characteristic makes binary search an exceptionally efficient algorithm, especially when applied to large datasets.
