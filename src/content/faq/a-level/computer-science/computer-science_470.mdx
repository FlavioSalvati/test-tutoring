Bluetooth technology operates by utilizing radio waves to establish connections and facilitate data exchange between devices over short distances.

It is a wireless communication protocol specifically designed for short-range connectivity. Bluetooth operates within the 2.4 GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) frequency band, which is globally accessible and does not require licensing. This technology was originally developed by Ericsson in $1994$ and is now overseen by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).

Bluetooth employs a method known as frequency-hopping spread spectrum. This technique divides the data into smaller segments and transmits these segments across up to $79$ different frequency bands, each $1$ MHz wide, within the range of $2402$ to $2480$ MHz. This approach is intended to reduce interference between devices operating in close proximity.

When two Bluetooth devices wish to establish a connection, they must first undergo a pairing process. During this process, one device, designated as the 'master', emits a signal that can be detected by another device, referred to as the 'slave'. Once paired, the devices can remember each other and connect automatically in the future. The pairing process typically requires the user to confirm a code on both devices, although the specifics may vary based on the devices and their individual settings.

Bluetooth technology allows for connections with multiple devices simultaneously, forming what is known as a 'piconet'. A piconet consists of one master device and up to $7$ active slave devices. Additional devices can be in a 'parked' state, meaning they are not actively transmitting data but are synchronized with the piconet and can join when an active device disconnects.

Over the years, Bluetooth technology has undergone significant evolution, with various versions providing enhancements in range, speed, and power efficiency. For instance, Bluetooth $5.0$, the latest version as of $2021$, boasts a range that is up to four times greater, a speed that is double that of Bluetooth $4.2$, and an eightfold increase in data broadcasting capacity.

In summary, Bluetooth technology utilizes radio waves to enable short-range connections and data exchange between devices. It incorporates frequency-hopping spread spectrum to minimize interference and requires devices to pair before connecting. Multiple devices can join to create a piconet, and the technology has continuously evolved to provide improved range, speed, and data transmission capabilities.
