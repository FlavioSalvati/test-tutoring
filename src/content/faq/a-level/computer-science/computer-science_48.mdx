In a computer system, a polynomial is commonly represented using an array or list of its coefficients.

A polynomial is a mathematical expression that consists of a sum of powers of one or more variables, each multiplied by corresponding coefficients. For instance, the polynomial $3x^2 + 2x + 1$ has three coefficients: $3$, $2$, and $1$. In a computer system, this polynomial can be represented as an array or list of these coefficients, where the index of each coefficient corresponds to the power of the variable it multiplies. Thus, for the polynomial $3x^2 + 2x + 1$, the array representation would be $[1, 2, 3]$.

This representation is both efficient and convenient for performing various operations on polynomials. For example, to evaluate the polynomial at a specific value of $x$, one can iterate through the array, multiplying each coefficient by the corresponding power of $x$ and summing the results. Similarly, when adding two polynomials, the corresponding coefficients in their respective arrays can simply be added together.

However, this approach assumes that the polynomial is dense, meaning it has a coefficient for every power of the variable up to the highest degree. If the polynomial is sparse, indicating that many powers have a coefficient of zero, this representation may be inefficient in terms of space. In such cases, it can be more advantageous to represent the polynomial using a list of pairs consisting of coefficients and their associated powers, or to utilize a data structure such as a dictionary or map that can efficiently handle sparse data.

Beyond arrays and lists, other data structures may be employed to represent polynomials, depending on the specific requirements of the problem. For example, if the coefficients are large numbers, a linked list may be a more effective structure for managing these values. Additionally, if the polynomial involves multiple variables (i.e., it is multivariate), more complex data structures like multidimensional arrays or trees may be necessary to accommodate the complexity of the representation.
