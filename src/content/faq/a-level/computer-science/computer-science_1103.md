A stack is a data structure that operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue adheres to a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

To elaborate, a stack is a linear data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, commonly referred to as the 'top'. Consequently, the last element added to the stack is the first to be removed, which is the essence of the LIFO concept. This can be likened to a stack of plates; you can only add or remove plates from the top. In computer science, stacks are utilized in a variety of applications, including expression parsing, backtracking algorithms, and memory management.

Conversely, a queue is another type of linear data structure where elements are added at one end, known as the 'rear', and removed from the opposite end, called the 'front'. This arrangement means that the first element added to the queue will also be the first one to be removed, exemplifying the FIFO principle. This is similar to a line of people waiting; individuals join the line at the back and exit from the front. In computer science, queues are widely used in applications such as process scheduling in operating systems, managing requests in web servers, and executing breadth-first search algorithms.

Regarding implementation, both stacks and queues can be constructed using arrays or linked lists. For a stack, the operation used to add an element to the top is called 'push', while the operation to remove an element from the top is called 'pop'. In the case of a queue, the operation to add an element to the rear is referred to as 'enqueue', and the operation to remove an element from the front is called 'dequeue'.

In conclusion, while both stacks and queues are linear data structures, they differ significantly in the order in which elements are added and removed. Stacks adhere to a LIFO policy, whereas queues follow a FIFO policy. This fundamental distinction makes them suitable for different applications in the realm of computer science.
