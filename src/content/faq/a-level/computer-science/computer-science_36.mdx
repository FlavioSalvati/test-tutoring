To convert a hexadecimal number to its octal equivalent, you need to follow a two-step process: first, convert the hexadecimal number to binary, and then convert the binary representation to octal.

Hexadecimal and octal are both numeral systems commonly used in computing, but they cannot be directly converted into one another. Therefore, binary serves as a useful 'bridge' for this conversion. Below is a clear, step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

1. **Convert the Hexadecimal Number to Binary**: 
   Hexadecimal is a base-16 numeral system, while binary is a base-2 system. Each hexadecimal digit can be represented using a 4-digit binary number. For instance, the hexadecimal digit 'A' corresponds to the binary value '1010', and 'F' corresponds to '1111'. You can utilize a hexadecimal-to-binary conversion table to assist with this step.

2. **Convert the Binary Number to Octal**: 
   Octal is a base-8 numeral system, and each octal digit can be represented by a 3-digit binary number. For example, the binary number '101' translates to '5' in octal, and '111' translates to '7'. To perform this conversion, group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right. If there are not enough digits to form a complete group of three, add zeros to the left. Then, use a binary-to-octal conversion table to find the corresponding octal value for each group.

### Example Conversion
Let's illustrate this process with an example. If we want to convert the hexadecimal number $2A3$ to octal, we start by converting it to binary. The hexadecimal digits convert as follows:
- '2' is represented as '0010'
- 'A' is represented as '1010'
- '3' is represented as '0011'

Thus, the hexadecimal number $2A3$ converts to binary as:

$$
0010 \, 1010 \, 0011
$$

Next, we group the binary digits into sets of three from the right:

$$
(001) \, (010) \, (100) \, (011)
$$

Using a binary-to-octal conversion table, we find that each group corresponds to the following octal digits:
- '001' is '1'
- '010' is '2'
- '100' is '4'
- '011' is '3'

Therefore, the octal representation of the hexadecimal number $2A3$ is:

$$
1243
$$

### Conclusion
Remember, practice is key to mastering these conversions. The more you engage with these processes, the more proficient you will become. Although the conversions may appear tedious at first, a solid understanding of them is essential for grasping how computers manage and store data.
