The conversion of a binary number to an octal number entails grouping the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the rightmost digit.

To begin, it's important to recognize that each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits. This relationship arises because the octal number system is base-$8$, and $2^3$ (which equals $8$) is the closest power of $2$ that fits within the base-$8$ system. Consequently, each octal digit can be represented by a group of three binary digits.

The conversion process initiates with the rightmost binary digit (the least significant bit). You should group the binary digits into sets of three while moving from right to left. If there are not enough digits to form a complete group of three at the leftmost end (the most significant bit), you can prepend zeros to complete the group.

Once the groups of three are established, the next step is to convert each group into its corresponding octal digit. The following conversions apply:

- Binary group $000$ corresponds to octal digit $0$,
- $001$ corresponds to $1$,
- $010$ corresponds to $2$,
- $011$ corresponds to $3$,
- $100$ corresponds to $4$,
- $101$ corresponds to $5$,
- $110$ corresponds to $6$, and
- $111$ corresponds to $7$.

After converting each group, you should write down the octal digits in the same order as they correspond to their respective binary groups. The final result will be the octal equivalent of the original binary number.

For illustration, let's convert the binary number $110101101$ to octal. First, we group the binary digits into sets of three from right to left: $110$, $101$, $101$. Next, we convert each group to its octal equivalent: $6$, $5$, and $5$, respectively. Therefore, the octal equivalent of the binary number $110101101$ is $655$.

In summary, understanding the relationship between the binary and octal systems is crucial for this conversion process. With practice, converting between binary and octal digits will become intuitive.
