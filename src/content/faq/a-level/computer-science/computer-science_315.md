Sequential algorithms execute operations one at a time, whereas parallel algorithms perform multiple operations simultaneously.

A sequential algorithm is characterized by executing each step in a specific, linear orderâ€”one after the other. This means that the next step cannot begin until the previous one has been completed. Such algorithms are typically employed when the output of one step is necessary as the input for the next. While sequential algorithms are generally easier to design and implement, they may not be as efficient as parallel algorithms, particularly when handling large datasets or complex computations.

In contrast, parallel algorithms tackle problems by dividing them into multiple sub-problems that can be solved concurrently. This is accomplished by utilizing several processing elements, such as cores in a multi-core processor, to execute different parts of the algorithm simultaneously. The results from these concurrent operations are subsequently combined to yield the final output. However, designing and implementing parallel algorithms can be more complex, as they require meticulous coordination and synchronization to ensure that all processing elements work together correctly. Despite this added complexity, parallel algorithms can significantly reduce the time needed to solve a problem, making them particularly suitable for tasks that involve processing large amounts of data or performing intricate computations rapidly.

In summary, the primary distinction between sequential and parallel algorithms lies in their execution methods. Sequential algorithms follow a step-by-step approach, executing one operation at a time, while parallel algorithms break the problem into smaller components and solve them concurrently. The decision to use either a sequential or parallel algorithm depends on the nature of the problem, the available resources, and the performance requirements.
