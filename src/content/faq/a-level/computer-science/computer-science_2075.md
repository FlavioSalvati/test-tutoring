A min-max heap is a specialized data structure that combines the properties of both min heaps and max heaps within a binary tree. It is a complete binary tree that adheres to the min-max heap property, which stipulates that at every level of the tree, nodes at even levels must have keys that are less than or equal to the keys of their children, while nodes at odd levels must have keys that are greater than or equal to the keys of their children. The root of the tree is positioned at level $0$, which is classified as an even level.

To implement a min-max heap, you begin by constructing a complete binary tree. Each node in this tree must contain a key and have two child nodes. Specifically, the left child should always have a key that is less than or equal to its parent's key, and the right child should have a key that is greater than or equal to its parent's key. This arrangement is crucial for maintaining the min-max heap property.

When inserting a new element into the min-max heap, you should place it at the next available position in the tree to preserve its complete binary tree structure. Subsequently, you will need to "bubble up" the new element to its appropriate position by comparing it with its parent node. If the element is at an even level and has a key that is less than its parent's key, or if it is at an odd level and has a key that is greater than its parent's key, you should swap it with the parent node. This process continues until the element reaches its correct position in the tree.

To delete an element from the min-max heap, you remove the root node and replace it with the last element in the tree. Following this, you must "bubble down" the new root by comparing it with its children. If the new root is at an even level and has a key that is greater than one of its children, or if it is at an odd level and has a key that is less than one of its children, you should swap it with the appropriate child (the smaller child for even levels and the larger child for odd levels). This process is repeated until the element is positioned correctly within the heap.

In summary, implementing a min-max heap involves creating a complete binary tree that alternates between levels of min and max heaps. The insertion and deletion of elements are managed through the "bubble up" and "bubble down" processes, respectively, ensuring that the min-max heap property is maintained throughout.
