A **segment tree** is a specialized data structure designed for storing information about segments or intervals, enabling efficient range queries and updates.

A segment tree is organized as a binary tree, where each node corresponds to a specific interval or segment of an array. The root node represents the entire array, while each child node represents half of the segment of its parent. The leaf nodes correspond to individual elements of the array. This hierarchical structure is constructed to facilitate efficient querying and updating of ranges within the array.

The primary function of a segment tree is to execute **range queries**, which retrieve information about a specified range of elements in the array. For instance, a range query might request the sum, minimum, or maximum value of a specified range. Without a segment tree, answering such a query would necessitate scanning all elements within the range, incurring a time complexity of $O(n)$. In contrast, with a segment tree, this time complexity is significantly reduced to $O(\log n)$.

In addition to range queries, segment trees can efficiently handle **range updates**, which modify a range of elements within the array. For example, a range update might involve incrementing all elements in a specific range by a designated value. Similar to range queries, the use of a segment tree allows these updates to be performed more efficiently compared to a direct approach.

Beyond basic range queries and updates, segment trees can also support a variety of additional operations involving intervals or segments. For example, they can be utilized to find the next smaller or larger element within a range, count the number of distinct elements in a specified range, or identify the most frequently occurring element in that range.

In conclusion, a segment tree is a versatile and efficient data structure well-suited for managing intervals or segments. It proves particularly advantageous in scenarios with numerous range queries or updates, especially when the underlying array remains relatively stable and is not frequently modified.
