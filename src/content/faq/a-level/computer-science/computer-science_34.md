The Pigeonhole Sort algorithm operates by categorizing each item into a 'pigeonhole' that corresponds to its key value.

This sorting algorithm is particularly effective for organizing lists where the number of elements is roughly equivalent to the number of possible key values. Its time complexity is $O(n + \text{Range})$, where $n$ represents the number of elements in the input array, and 'Range' denotes the total number of distinct key values.

The algorithm begins by creating an array of 'pigeonholes' that matches the size of the range of input values. Initially, each pigeonhole is empty, containing no 'pigeons'. The algorithm then iterates through the input list, placing each element into the appropriate pigeonhole based on its key value. To find the correct index for a pigeonhole, the algorithm subtracts the minimum value from the key value of the element.

After all elements are assigned to their respective pigeonholes, the algorithm processes these pigeonholes in sequential order. For each non-empty pigeonhole, the algorithm retrieves the elements and reinserts them back into the input list. This procedure results in a sorted list, as the pigeonholes are accessed in the order of their key values.

Pigeonhole Sort can be classified as a type of bucket sort. It is most efficient when the number of elements is approximately equal to the range of possible key values. However, it is less suitable for sorting large lists or when the range of key values significantly exceeds the number of elements. This limitation arises because the size of the pigeonhole array corresponds to the range of key values, potentially leading to excessive memory usage when the key range is large.

In summary, the Pigeonhole Sort algorithm is a straightforward and efficient sorting method for specific types of lists. It effectively organizes elements by allocating them into pigeonholes based on their key values and subsequently collecting them in order.
