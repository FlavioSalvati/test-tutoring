Separate chaining is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables, which employs linked lists to manage multiple keys that hash to the same index.

In a hash table, collisions can occur when two or more keys hash to the same index. To handle such situations, the separate chaining method stores these keys in a linked list at the affected index. This approach is referred to as "separate chaining" because each index in the hash table maintains its own distinct chainâ€”a linked list of keys.

The process of separate chaining begins when a key-value pair is inserted into the hash table. First, a hash function is applied to the key to generate an index. If this index is unoccupied, the key-value pair is directly stored there. Conversely, if the index is already occupied, the new key-value pair is appended to the end of the linked list at that index.

When retrieving a value from the hash table, the hash function is applied to the key once more to generate the corresponding index. If the index is unoccupied, it indicates that the key does not exist in the hash table. If the index is occupied, the linked list at that index is traversed until the key is located, at which point its corresponding value is returned.

Separate chaining offers several advantages. It can accommodate an unlimited number of keys within the hash table, as long as sufficient memory is available. Additionally, it enables efficient value retrieval, with a best-case time complexity of $O(1)$ and a worst-case time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ represents the number of keys stored in the hash table.

However, separate chaining also has its drawbacks. It necessitates extra memory to store the linked lists. If the hash function is poorly designed, resulting in many keys hashing to the same index, the linked lists can become lengthy, which can degrade retrieval efficiency and lead to a time complexity approaching $O(n)$.

In conclusion, separate chaining is an effective strategy for managing collisions in hash tables. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs, but it requires a well-constructed hash function and additional memory to achieve optimal performance.
