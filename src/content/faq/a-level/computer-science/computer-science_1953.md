Integers are represented in binary as sequences of 0s and 1s, which is based on the binary number system.

The binary number system, also known as base-2, is a method of numerical representation that utilizes only two digits: 0 and 1. This system is fundamental to computers, as it directly corresponds to the on/off states of digital circuits.

To represent a positive integer in binary, you begin by identifying the highest power of 2 that fits into the number. You then place a 1 in the corresponding position of the binary sequence. Next, subtract this power of 2 from the integer and repeat the process with the remaining value. If a power of 2 does not fit into the number, you place a 0 in that position. This iterative process continues until you reach the power of 2 that is less than or equal to 1.

For instance, to represent the number $13$ in binary, you would start with the highest power of $2$ that fits into $13$, which is $2^3$ (or $8$). Therefore, you write a 1 in the $2^3$ position. After subtracting $8$ from $13$, you are left with $5$. The next highest power of $2$ that fits into $5$ is $2^2$ (or $4$), so you write a 1 in the $2^2$ position. Subtracting $4$ from $5$ gives you $1$, which corresponds to $2^0$, allowing you to place a 1 in the $2^0$ position. Consequently, the final binary representation of $13$ is $1101$.

Negative integers are represented in binary using a technique known as two's complement. To compute this representation, you first flip all the bits of the positive version of the number (changing 1s to 0s and vice versa), and then add $1$. This method facilitates straightforward arithmetic operations involving negative numbers.

Understanding binary representation is essential in computer science, as it underpins all digital computation. It is the foundational method by which computers store and manipulate numerical data. Gaining insight into binary representation can deepen your understanding of how computers function at a fundamental level.
