To convert a decimal number to its octal equivalent, you need to divide the decimal number by $8$, while recording both the quotient and the remainder at each step.

The detailed conversion process consists of repeated divisions by $8$, where the remainder from each division corresponds to an octal digit. This division continues until the quotient reaches zero. The octal number is then constructed by reading the remainders in reverse order, starting from the last remainder obtained to the first.

Letâ€™s illustrate this process with an example. Suppose we want to convert the decimal number $125$ to octal. Here are the steps involved:

1. Divide $125$ by $8$. The quotient is $15$ and the remainder is $5$.
2. Divide the quotient ($15$) by $8$. The new quotient is $1$ and the remainder is $7$.
3. Divide the new quotient ($1$) by $8$. The final quotient is $0$ and the remainder is $1$.

Next, we read the remainders in reverse order: $175$. Thus, the octal equivalent of the decimal number $125$ is $175$.

It is important to note that this method is applicable to any decimal number, regardless of its size. However, for very large numbers, the process may become lengthy and cumbersome. In such cases, using a calculator or computer program designed for this conversion can be much more efficient.

Additionally, octal numbers are typically represented with a leading '0' to differentiate them from decimal numbers. Therefore, you might write the octal equivalent of $125$ as $0175$.

In summary, converting a decimal number to octal involves repeated division by $8$ while recording the remainders. The final octal number is formed by reading these remainders in reverse order.
