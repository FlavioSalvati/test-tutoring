To convert an octal number to its hexadecimal equivalent, you need to follow a two-step process: first, convert the octal number to binary, and then convert the binary number to hexadecimal.

Let's break this process down step by step. Octal numbers are base-$8$, which means they utilize digits ranging from $0$ to $7$. In contrast, hexadecimal numbers are base-$16$ and employ digits from $0$ to $9$ as well as letters from $A$ to $F$. Binary numbers, on the other hand, are base-$2$ and consist solely of the digits $0$ and $1$.

### Step 1: Convert Octal to Binary

The initial step involves converting the octal number to binary. Each digit in an octal number can be represented by a three-digit binary number. For instance, the octal digit $7$ is represented as $111$ in binary, while the octal digit $2$ is represented as $010$. Therefore, for an octal number like $72$, you would convert it to binary by replacing each digit with its binary equivalent, resulting in $111\ 010$.

### Step 2: Convert Binary to Hexadecimal

The subsequent step is to convert the binary number to hexadecimal. Each digit in a hexadecimal number corresponds to a four-digit binary number. For example, the hexadecimal digit $F$ is represented as $1111$ in binary, and the hexadecimal digit $2$ is represented as $0010$. To perform the conversion from binary to hexadecimal, group the binary digits into sets of four, starting from the right. If there arenâ€™t enough digits to form a complete group of four, you can add zeros to the left.

Continuing with our previous example, the binary number $111\ 010$ can be grouped into $0111\ 0010$. The binary group $0111$ translates to $7$ in hexadecimal, while the binary group $0010$ translates to $2$ in hexadecimal. Therefore, the hexadecimal equivalent of the octal number $72$ is $72$.

### Summary

Remember, this conversion process involves two distinct steps: converting from octal to binary, and then from binary to hexadecimal. Although it may appear complex initially, with practice, it becomes more intuitive. This skill is particularly valuable for those studying computer science, as these number systems are frequently used in computing and programming.
