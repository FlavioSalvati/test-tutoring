Web servers play a crucial role in processing HTTP requests by receiving the request, interpreting its contents, and returning the requested resource or an appropriate error message.

When a client, such as a web browser, sends an HTTP request to a web server, the server begins by receiving the request. This communication typically occurs over the internet using the TCP/IP protocol. The server listens for incoming requests on a specific port, which is usually port $80$ for HTTP and port $443$ for HTTPS.

Upon receiving the request, the server must interpret its contents. An HTTP request includes various components that help the server understand what the client is requesting. Key elements include the request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE), the URL, and potentially additional data found in headers or the message body. The server analyzes this information to ascertain which resource the client seeks and how to process the request accordingly.

After interpreting the request, the server attempts to fulfill it. If the client has requested a specific file or web page, the server locates that resource within its file system. Provided that the resource exists and the client has the necessary permissions, the server sends the resource back to the client within the body of an HTTP response. This response also contains a status code and headers that deliver additional information regarding the outcome of the request.

However, not all requests can be successfully fulfilled. If the requested resource is unavailable, the server returns a $404$ Not Found status code. Conversely, if the client lacks the necessary permissions to access the resource, the server responds with a $403$ Forbidden status code. Numerous other status codes exist, each indicating different outcomes related to the request's processing.

In addition to handling individual requests, web servers must manage multiple simultaneous connections. This is typically achieved through a combination of multi-threading and multiplexing techniques. Furthermore, servers often implement caching mechanisms to store the results of frequently requested resources, thereby reducing the workload for future requests.

In summary, the process of handling an HTTP request encompasses receiving the request, interpreting its contents, and returning either the requested resource or an error message. This fundamental process underpins the operation of the World Wide Web.
