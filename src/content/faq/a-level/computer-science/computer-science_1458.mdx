A self-join in SQL is a specific type of join where a table is joined with itself.

In SQL, a self-join allows you to combine rows from the same table based on a matching condition. It is called a self-join because, unlike traditional joins that connect two different tables, this operation involves joining a table to itself. This is accomplished using the SQL JOIN clause, but instead of referencing two separate tables, you reference the same table twice.

To execute a self-join, SQL requires that you use an alias for the table. An alias serves as a temporary name that distinguishes the two instances of the table within the query. It is important to note that the alias is only applicable for the duration of that specific SQL query.

Self-joins are particularly useful when you want to find relationships among rows within a single table. For instance, consider a table of employees; you may want to identify all pairs of employees who reside in the same city. A self-join enables you to merge the 'employee' table with itself to uncover these pairs.

The essence of self-joins lies in their ability to combine rows from the same table based on a specified condition. This condition is defined in the ON clause of the JOIN statement. The result of a self-join is a new table that merges columns from the original table, where each row represents a match based on the criteria specified in the ON clause.

In summary, a self-join in SQL is a powerful technique that facilitates the analysis of data within a single table by revealing relationships among its rows. This method is particularly beneficial when dealing with hierarchical data structures or when searching for patterns within the data.
