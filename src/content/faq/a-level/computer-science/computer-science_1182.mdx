A linked list serves as a foundational data structure that is commonly used to implement other data structures, including stacks, queues, and hash tables.

A linked list is a dynamic data structure capable of growing or shrinking during program execution, which makes it particularly suitable for implementing various other structures. It consists of nodes, each containing a data field and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This arrangement allows for efficient insertions and deletions at any position within the list, a crucial characteristic for many applications.

For example, stacks and queues are frequently implemented using linked lists. A stack is a data structure that adheres to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added is the first one to be removed. This behavior can be efficiently achieved with a linked list by adding and removing elements from the head of the list. Conversely, a queue operates on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. In this case, the linked list allows for elements to be added at the tail and removed from the head.

Hash tables, another prevalent data structure, can also utilize linked lists for their implementation. A hash table employs a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, where the desired value can be located. Collisions may occur when the hash function produces the same index for multiple keys. One effective method for dealing with collisions is to use linked lists. In this scenario, each bucket in the hash table contains a linked list. When a collision happens, the new key-value pair is appended to the end of the linked list associated with the corresponding bucket.

Additionally, linked lists play a crucial role in the implementation of graphs. In an adjacency list representation of a graph, each vertex maintains a linked list of the vertices it is connected to. This structure facilitates efficient traversal and manipulation of the graph.

In summary, the dynamic and adaptable nature of linked lists makes them an essential tool in the implementation of various data structures. Their capability to efficiently manage insertions and deletions at any position is a key feature that is leveraged in stacks, queues, hash tables, and graphs.
