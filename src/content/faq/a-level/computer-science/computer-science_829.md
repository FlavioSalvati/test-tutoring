Wireless network protocols encompass a variety of technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Infrared, LTE, and NFC.

**Wi-Fi** is the most prevalent wireless network protocol, primarily used to establish local area networks (LANs). It operates on the $2.4 \text{ GHz}$ and $5 \text{ GHz}$ frequency bands and adheres to the IEEE 802.11 standard. Wi-Fi facilitates the connection of devices such as computers, smartphones, and smart home appliances to the internet. Its high data transfer rates make it particularly suitable for streaming media and downloading large files.

**Bluetooth** is another widely used wireless protocol, designed for short-range connections between devices. It also operates on the $2.4 \text{ GHz}$ band and is commonly employed to connect devices such as headphones, speakers, keyboards, and mice to computers or smartphones. Bluetooth is ideal for low-power, short-range applications due to its minimal energy consumption.

**Zigbee** and **Z-Wave** are wireless protocols primarily utilized in smart home applications. Zigbee operates on the $2.4 \text{ GHz}$ band and conforms to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, enabling the connection of smart home devices like lights, locks, and thermostats. In contrast, Z-Wave operates on the sub-$1 \text{ GHz}$ band and serves similar functions as Zigbee. Both protocols are specifically designed for low-power, low-data-rate applications and support mesh networking capabilities, enhancing their efficiency in smart environments.

**Infrared** is a wireless protocol that transmits data using infrared light. It is commonly found in remote controls for televisions and various consumer electronics. However, infrared communication is limited to line-of-sight and has a short range, which reduces its versatility compared to other wireless protocols.

**LTE** (Long Term Evolution) is a wireless protocol used for mobile broadband communication. It operates across various frequency bands and connects mobile devices to the internet. LTE provides high data transfer rates and extensive coverage, making it an excellent choice for mobile internet access.

**NFC** (Near Field Communication) is a wireless protocol that facilitates short-range communication between devices. It operates at a frequency of $13.56 \text{ MHz}$ and is commonly used for applications such as contactless payments and data transfer between smartphones. NFC is specifically designed for very short-range (a few centimeters) and low-data-rate applications, emphasizing convenience and security in close-proximity interactions.
