Functional dependency is a critical concept in database normalization, serving as a constraint between two sets of attributes within a database relation.

To elaborate, functional dependency refers to the relationship between attributes in a database where the value of one attribute determines the value of another. Specifically, an attribute is said to be functionally dependent on another if, for each value of the first attribute, there exists a unique corresponding value of the second attribute. For instance, in a student database, the student's ID can determine their name, course, and grade. In this scenario, the name, course, and grade are functionally dependent on the student's ID.

Functional dependencies are essential for the process of normalization, which aims to organize data in a database to eliminate redundancy and inconsistency. Normalization involves decomposing larger tables into smaller, less redundant tables while preserving essential information. The primary objective of normalization is to facilitate the addition, deletion, and modification of data without introducing anomalies or inconsistencies.

By understanding functional dependencies, database designers can identify the logical relationships among various attributes, leading to the construction of an appropriate schema. For example, if a functional dependency $A \to B$ exists, it indicates that each unique value of $A$ is associated with exactly one value of $B$. This relationship helps to reduce redundancy, as it eliminates the need to repetitively store the same information about $B$ for each occurrence of $A$.

Furthermore, functional dependencies are instrumental in defining keys within a database. A key is an attribute or a combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a record in the database. If an attribute $A$ uniquely determines another attribute $B$, then $A$ can serve as a key. A deeper understanding of how various data types are managed in a relational database management system can enhance one's grasp of functional dependencies.

In summary, functional dependency in database normalization signifies the reliance of one set of attributes on another. For instance, a student's ID determines their name and grades. This concept is fundamental for organizing data effectively, preventing redundancy and inconsistencies, and ensuring that the data remains accurate and manageable. Mastering functional dependencies is crucial for designing efficient databases.
