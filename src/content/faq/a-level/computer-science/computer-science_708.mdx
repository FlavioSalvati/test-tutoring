Static typing checks variable types at compile-time, whereas dynamic typing performs this check at runtime.

To elaborate, static typing is a characteristic of certain programming languages where type checking occurs during compile-time, rather than at runtime. This means that the type of a variable is determined before the program is executed. For example, in Java, which is a statically-typed language, you must declare the type of a variable when you create it. Once declared, the type cannot be changed. This feature helps identify errors early in the development process, as the compiler can detect type mismatches and other type-related issues before the program runs.

In contrast, dynamic typing is a property of programming languages where type checking is performed at runtime. This means the type of a variable is only verified when the code is executed. Languages such as Python and JavaScript are dynamically-typed, allowing you to change the type of a variable even after it has been defined. In these cases, no errors will be raised until the code is executed. This flexibility can make these languages more user-friendly, particularly for beginners, but it may also lead to unexpected errors if a variable's type changes unintentionally.

In static typing, type information is directly associated with the variable itself, while in dynamic typing, the type information is linked to the value that the variable references. This fundamental distinction results in several practical implications. For instance, statically-typed languages tend to be more verbose because they require explicit type declarations. Conversely, dynamically-typed languages are often less verbose but may necessitate more extensive testing to identify type-related errors.

In summary, the choice between static and dynamic typing should be based on the specific needs and constraints of your project. Statically-typed languages can offer greater safety and performance benefits, while dynamically-typed languages provide increased flexibility and ease of use.
