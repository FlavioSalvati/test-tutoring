A post-order traversal in a binary search tree is executed by visiting the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

In a binary search tree, post-order traversal is a specific form of depth-first traversal. This means that the algorithm explores each branch of the tree as deeply as possible before backtracking. During a post-order traversal, the process begins with the left subtree, followed by the right subtree, and concludes with the root node. This recursive approach is applied to each subtree until the entire tree is traversed.

To implement a post-order traversal, a recursive function is typically employed. The function first invokes itself on the left child of the current node, then on the right child, and finally processes the current node. This sequence ensures that all nodes in the left subtree are visited before those in the right subtree, and that all nodes in both subtrees are processed prior to the root node.

Here is a simple pseudocode example of a post-order traversal function:

'''
function postOrder(node)
    if node is not null then
        postOrder(node.left)
        postOrder(node.right)
        visit(node)
    end if
end function
'''

In this pseudocode, 'node' refers to the current node being processed, while 'node.left' and 'node.right' represent its left and right children, respectively. The function 'visit(node)' is responsible for processing the node, such as printing its value.

Post-order traversal is particularly beneficial in certain applications. For instance, it can be used to delete a tree, as it ensures that a node is deleted only after its children have been processed. Additionally, it can be utilized to evaluate specific types of mathematical expressions represented in a tree structure.

The defining feature of post-order traversal is that it processes the root node after its subtrees have been fully traversed. This characteristic distinguishes it from other types of depth-first traversals: pre-order traversal (which follows the sequence root, left, right) and in-order traversal (which follows the sequence left, root, right).
