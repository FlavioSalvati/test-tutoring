Static typing checks variable types at compile-time, while dynamic typing checks them at runtime.

To elaborate, static typing is a feature found in certain programming languages where type checking occurs during compile-time rather than at run-time. This means the type of a variable is determined and fixed during compilation. For instance, in Java, which is a statically-typed language, you must specify the type of a variable at the moment of its creation. Once declared, the variable's type cannot be changed. This early type verification helps to catch errors in the development process, as the compiler can identify type mismatches and other related issues before the program is executed.

Conversely, dynamic typing is a characteristic of programming languages where type checking is performed at run-time. In this case, the type of a variable is only evaluated when the code is executed. Languages such as Python and JavaScript are examples of dynamically-typed languages, allowing you to alter the type of a variable even after it has been defined. No errors will surface until the code is executed, which can make these languages more flexible and user-friendly, particularly for beginners. However, this flexibility can also lead to unexpected errors if a variable's type is changed unintentionally.

In static typing, type information is directly associated with the variable itself, whereas in dynamic typing, the type information is linked to the value that the variable references. This fundamental distinction results in several practical implications. For example, statically-typed languages tend to be more verbose due to the necessity of explicit type declarations. In contrast, dynamically-typed languages are often less verbose but may require more extensive testing to uncover type-related errors.

In conclusion, the choice between static and dynamic typing depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. Statically-typed languages can offer greater safety and performance advantages, while dynamically-typed languages provide increased flexibility and simplicity.
