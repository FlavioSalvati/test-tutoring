A post-order traversal in a binary search tree is implemented by visiting the left subtree, right subtree, and then the root node.

In a binary search tree, a post-order traversal is a type of depth-first traversal. This means that it explores the tree as deeply as possible before backtracking. In a post-order traversal, the algorithm first visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node. This process is recursively applied to each subtree until the entire tree has been traversed.

To implement a post-order traversal, you would typically use a recursive function. The function would first call itself on the left child of the current node, then on the right child, and finally process the current node. This ensures that all nodes in the left subtree are visited before those in the right subtree, and that all nodes in both subtrees are visited before the root node.

Here is a simple pseudocode example of a post-order traversal function:

```
function postOrder(node)
if node is not null then
postOrder(node.left)
postOrder(node.right)
visit(node)
end if
end function
```

In this pseudocode, `node` is the current node being processed, `node.left` and `node.right` are its left and right children respectively, and `visit(node)` is a function that processes the node (for example, by printing its value).

The post-order traversal is particularly useful in certain applications. For example, it can be used to delete a tree (since it ensures that a node is deleted after its children), or to evaluate certain types of mathematical expressions stored in a tree.

Remember, the key characteristic of post-order traversal is that it processes the root node after its subtrees. This is what distinguishes it from the other types of depth-first traversals, pre-order (root, left, right) and in-order (left, root, right).
