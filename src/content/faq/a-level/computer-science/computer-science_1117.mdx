The ShellSort algorithm operates by sorting elements at designated intervals, progressively decreasing the interval until the entire list is sorted.

Named after its inventor, Donald Shell, ShellSort is an extension of the insertion sort that permits the exchange of items located far apart. The fundamental concept is to organize the list of elements such that if you start from any position and consider every $h$-th element, those elements will form a sorted sequence. This structure is referred to as an $h$-sorted list. Alternatively, you can visualize it as $h$ interleaved lists, each of which is sorted independently.

The algorithm begins by defining an initial gap, typically set to half the size of the list, denoted as $\frac{n}{2}$. It then compares elements that are separated by this gap, swapping them if they are out of order. This comparison and swapping process continues until the end of the list is reached. Subsequently, the gap is halved, and the procedure is repeated. This cycle continues until the gap is reduced to $1$, at which point the algorithm effectively performs a standard insertion sort. By this stage, the list is guaranteed to be nearly sorted, creating an optimal scenario for insertion sort and leading to efficient performance.

The key to the enhanced performance of ShellSort compared to traditional insertion sort lies in its ability to allow elements to move significant distances in a single operation, rather than incrementally. This feature makes ShellSort particularly effective for lists in which elements are nearly in reverse order, allowing them to be swiftly repositioned into their correct locations.

The selection of gap values is a complex subject, with numerous sequences proposed throughout the years. The original sequence suggested by Shell involved starting with a gap of $\frac{n}{2}$ and halving it with each iteration. However, alternative sequences such as the Pratt sequence and the Sedgewick sequence have been shown to yield better performance under certain conditions.

Regarding computational complexity, ShellSort's worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$. Nevertheless, with the appropriate choice of gap sequences, it can achieve a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, making it more efficient than simpler comparison sorts like bubble sort or standard insertion sort. However, it remains less efficient than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort when dealing with larger datasets.
