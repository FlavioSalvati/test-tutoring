Lambda functions are a key feature in functional programming, allowing the creation of anonymous functions for quick and inline processing.

Also known as anonymous functions, lambda functions represent a fundamental concept in functional programming. Unlike standard functions, which are defined using the `def` keyword in Python, lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword. This is why they are often referred to as lambda functions.

Utilizing lambda functions can enhance the conciseness and readability of your code. They enable you to perform simple, one-off computations without the need for a complete function definition. Typically, lambda functions are used in scenarios where a short-lived function is required, often as arguments to higher-order functionsâ€”functions that accept other functions as inputs.

Lambda functions are widely employed in functional programming languages such as Lisp and Haskell, where they serve as the foundation for many complex programming constructs. In these languages, lambda functions can be utilized to create and manipulate other functions, promoting highly flexible and powerful programming techniques.

In Python, the syntax for a lambda function is as follows:

$$
\text{lambda arguments: expression}
$$

In this syntax, the expression is evaluated and the result is returned. A lambda function can accept any number of arguments, but it is limited to a single expression. It cannot contain multiple statements, and it returns a function object that can be assigned to a variable.

For instance, consider a lambda function that adds $10$ to the number provided as an argument. The implementation would look like this:

$$
\text{add10} = \text{lambda } x: x + 10
$$

You can then call this function and print the result:

$$
\text{print(add10(5))}
$$

This will produce an output of $15$.

In summary, lambda functions in functional programming are a powerful tool that promotes more concise and readable code. They are especially beneficial for performing simple, one-off computations and for use as arguments in higher-order functions.
