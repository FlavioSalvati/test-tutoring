The primary mechanisms for linking and loading programs include static linking, dynamic linking, load-time dynamic linking, and run-time dynamic linking.

**Static linking** is the process by which a linker combines all modules of a program—including the main program and any libraries it utilizes—into a single executable file. This occurs at compile-time, meaning all the necessary code is embedded within the executable before it is executed. While this results in a larger executable file, it guarantees that all required code is available, allowing the program to run independently of any external libraries.

In contrast, **dynamic linking** does not embed the library code directly into the executable file. Instead, it includes references to the library functions, with the actual linking to the library code occurring either at load-time or run-time. This approach leads to a smaller executable file, but it necessitates that the required libraries be present on the system where the program is executed.

**Load-time dynamic linking** is a specific form of dynamic linking in which the linking to the library code occurs when the program is loaded into memory, prior to execution. The operating system's loader manages this linking process, verifying the references to library functions in the executable file and associating them with the corresponding library code in memory. If the necessary libraries are unavailable on the system, the loader will generate an error, preventing the program from running.

**Run-time dynamic linking** represents another variant of dynamic linking, whereby linking to the library code takes place while the program is actively running. This method is often employed for libraries that are only required in specific circumstances, allowing them to be loaded into memory only when needed. Although this can conserve memory and enhance performance, it also implies that errors related to missing libraries may not be identified until the program is in execution. If the needed libraries are absent when required, the program will report an error and may terminate unexpectedly.
