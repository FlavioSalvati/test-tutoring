An inverted index is a data structure designed to associate content, such as words or numbers, with their locations within a database.

More specifically, an inverted index, often referred to as a posting file, is a critical element used by most search engines. This data structure maintains a mapping from words, numbers, or other types of data to their respective locations across a collection of documents or within a database. The term "inverted" refers to the structure's design, which flips the traditional page-centric organization (where pages point to words) into a keyword-centric format (where words point to pages).

The main objective of an inverted index is to enhance the speed and performance of retrieving relevant documents in response to a search query. In the absence of an inverted index, a search engine would need to examine every document in its corpus, resulting in a time-consuming and inefficient process.

Building an inverted index involves several steps. Initially, the system scans through all documents, and for each word it encounters, the word is added to the index, along with a record of the document in which it appears. This procedure is known as "indexing." Once the index is constructed, the search engine can efficiently process incoming search queries by looking up the words in the inverted index and returning the corresponding documents.

Inverted indexes are utilized not only in search engines but also in various other domains where efficient full-text searches are necessary. For instance, they are employed in databases to accelerate data retrieval, in information retrieval systems to locate documents containing specific word queries, and in natural language processing to determine the document frequency of words across extensive corpora.

In conclusion, an inverted index is a powerful tool in computer science, especially within the realm of information retrieval. It facilitates rapid and efficient searching through vast amounts of data, making it an indispensable component of any search engine or database system.
