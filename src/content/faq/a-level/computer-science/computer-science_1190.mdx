The permutation sort algorithm is a sorting method that generates all possible permutations of an input list and checks each one to determine if it is sorted.

Also known as exhaustive sort, permutation sort is a straightforward yet highly inefficient algorithm. It operates by systematically generating every possible permutation of the input list, checking each permutation for sorted order. When it finds a permutation that is sorted, the algorithm terminates and returns that permutation as the sorted list.

The process begins with the generation of the first permutation, which is usually the original, unsorted list. The algorithm then generates the next permutation and checks it for sorted order. This procedure continues until either a sorted permutation is located or all permutations have been generated and checked.

There are several methods to generate all permutations of a list, with recursion being one of the most common approaches. The algorithm starts with the first element and swaps it with each of the other elements sequentially, recursively generating permutations of the remaining elements. This process is repeated for each element in the list.

To determine if a list is sorted, the algorithm simply iterates through the list from the beginning to the end, comparing each element with the subsequent one. If it encounters an element that is greater than the next one, it concludes that the list is not sorted. Conversely, if it reaches the end of the list without finding any such discrepancies, it confirms that the list is sorted.

The primary drawback of permutation sort is its inefficiency. The total number of permutations of a list containing $n$ elements is $n!$ (n factorial), a value that grows rapidly as $n$ increases. Consequently, the worst-case and average time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n!)$. For this reason, permutation sort is impractical for large lists. However, it can be beneficial for educational purposes, as it clearly illustrates the concept of permutations and the methods for generating and verifying them.
