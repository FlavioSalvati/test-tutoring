The Gnome Sort algorithm operates by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are not in the correct order.

Also referred to as Stupid Sort, Gnome Sort is a straightforward yet effective sorting method that shares similarities with the Bubble Sort algorithm. Its name derives from the way a garden gnome would sort a line of flower pots. The process begins with the gnome at the start of the line, where it compares the current pot with the one next to it. If the pots are in the correct order, the gnome moves forward. However, if they are not, the gnome swaps the two pots and steps back to compare the newly swapped pot with the one before it. This iterative process continues until the gnome reaches the end of the line, ensuring that all the pots are sorted.

The algorithm commences with the first element of an array. It compares this current element with the next one. If the current element is smaller than the next (indicating they are correctly ordered), the gnome advances to the next element. Conversely, if the current element is larger (indicating they are incorrectly ordered), the two elements are swapped, after which the gnome moves back one position to compare the swapped element with the one preceding it. This backward step ensures that the newly swapped element is checked again, as it could still be larger than the previous one.

This forward and backward movement continues, with the algorithm progressing when elements are in the correct order and reverting when they are not, until it reaches the end of the array. At this point, all elements have been sorted into their correct order.

Although Gnome Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm—exhibiting a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$—it is easy to understand and implement. Additionally, it is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements. This characteristic can be significant in applications where maintaining the original sequence of equal items is essential.
