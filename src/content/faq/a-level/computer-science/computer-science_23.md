Global variables are accessible throughout the entire program, while local variables are restricted to the function or block in which they are declared.

To elaborate, a global variable is defined outside of all functions or blocks. Due to its broad scope, it can be accessed and modified by any part of the code, making it universally available. This can be advantageous in scenarios where multiple functions need to work with the same data. However, the downside is that any part of the program can alter the variable, which may lead to unexpected behavior and introduce bugs that are challenging to identify and resolve.

Conversely, a local variable is defined within a specific function or block. Its scope is limited to that function or block, meaning it cannot be accessed or modified by any code outside of its immediate context. This limitation can help prevent bugs since the variable can only be changed in a controlled manner within its designated area. However, this also means that local variables are not accessible to other parts of the program, which can be restrictive in certain situations.

In general, it is advisable to utilize local variables whenever possible and to resort to global variables only when absolutely necessary. This practice promotes modular and comprehensible code, as each function or block operates with its own set of variables. A solid understanding of how these variables interact with standard algorithms is essential for effective programming. For a more in-depth exploration of how different programming constructs work with variables, please refer to the relevant literature.
