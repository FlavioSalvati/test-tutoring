The library sort algorithm is a combination of insertion sort and binary search, designed to efficiently sort a list.

Library sort, also referred to as gapped insertion sort, is a sorting algorithm developed by Michael A. Bender and Martin Farach-Colton in 2004. This algorithm integrates the strengths of insertion sort and binary search to optimize the sorting process. It operates by maintaining a dynamic array that contains gaps, or empty spaces, between elements. These gaps facilitate the efficient insertion of new elements during sorting.

The algorithm begins by inserting the first element of the input list into the dynamic array. For each subsequent element, it employs binary search to determine the appropriate position within the already sorted portion of the array. If the designated position is occupied, the algorithm shifts existing elements to the right until it locates a free space, where the new element is then inserted.

The efficiency of library sort hinges on the strategic maintenance of these gaps. The algorithm ensures that a sufficient number of gaps are evenly distributed throughout the array. If the array becomes too congested—meaning there are insufficient gaps—the algorithm increases the size of the array and redistributes elements to restore the necessary gaps.

The average-case time complexity of library sort is $O(n \log n)$, making it comparable in speed to other efficient sorting algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, and mergesort. However, library sort has a higher space complexity due to the requirement for additional gaps, which may render it less suitable for memory-constrained environments.

In conclusion, library sort is an innovative algorithm that merges the advantageous features of insertion sort and binary search. By maintaining a dynamic array with gaps, it allows for efficient insertions and employs binary search to swiftly identify the correct position for each element. While this results in a fast and effective sorting method, it does come at the cost of increased memory usage.
