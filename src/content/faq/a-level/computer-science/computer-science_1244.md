Fiber-optic cables transmit data by sending pulses of light through strands of glass or plastic, representing a significant advancement in data transmission technology.

These cables operate on the principle of total internal reflection. A core made of glass or plastic is surrounded by a cladding layer with a lower refractive index. This difference in refractive indices ensures that light signals remain confined within the core, allowing them to travel vast distances with minimal signal loss.

The data transmission process begins when electronic signals are converted into light signals by a transmitter. This device generates light pulses that are then sent down the fiber-optic cable. As the light travels through the cable, it reflects off the inner walls, a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. This mechanism enables the light to cover extensive distances while maintaining signal integrity.

At the receiving end, an optical receiver plays a crucial role in converting the light signals back into electronic signals that electronic devices can interpret. The receiver employs a photodetector to sense the light pulses and transform them into electrical signals. These electrical signals are subsequently processed and decoded into usable data.

The speed and efficiency of data transmission through fiber-optic cables are unmatched. They can transmit vast amounts of data at extremely high speeds, far surpassing the capabilities of traditional copper cables. This superiority arises from the fact that light travels faster than electricity and can carry a greater volume of information. Additionally, fiber-optic cables are immune to electromagnetic interference, which can often disrupt data transmission in copper cables.

In conclusion, fiber-optic cables facilitate data transmission by converting electronic signals into light signals, guiding these signals through the cable via total internal reflection, and finally converting them back into electronic signals at the receiving end. This innovative technology has transformed data transmission, providing remarkable speeds and substantial data capacity.
