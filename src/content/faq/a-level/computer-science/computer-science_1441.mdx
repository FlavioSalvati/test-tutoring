Normalization in database design is a process that organizes data into tables and columns, aiming to reduce data redundancy and enhance data integrity.

More specifically, normalization is a systematic approach that decomposes tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics, such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. This multi-step process converts data into a tabular format by removing duplicate entries from relational tables. The primary objectives of normalization are twofold: to eliminate redundant (unnecessary) data and to ensure that data dependencies are logical, meaning that data is stored in a coherent manner.

The concept of normalization was first introduced by E.F. Codd at IBM in 1970. He established a series of normal forms, each representing a higher standard of normalization. These are known as First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), Fourth Normal Form (4NF), and Fifth Normal Form (5NF). Each normal form comes with a specific set of criteria that a database schema must satisfy in order to be classified under that form.

For instance, a table is considered to be in First Normal Form (1NF) if all its columns contain only atomic (indivisible) values. A table qualifies for Second Normal Form (2NF) if it is already in 1NF and every non-key column is fully dependent on the primary key. Similarly, a table is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if it meets the criteria for 2NF and every non-key column is non-transitively dependent on the primary key.

The primary goal of normalization is to minimize the storage space required by a database while ensuring that data is logically organized. This process eliminates redundancy, such as having the same data across multiple tables, and guarantees that only related data is stored within each table. Moreover, normalization helps prevent complications arising from database modifications, such as insertions, updates, and deletions.

In summary, normalization is an essential aspect of database design that promotes data integrity and efficient storage. It is a concept that every computer science student should grasp and apply when working with databases.
