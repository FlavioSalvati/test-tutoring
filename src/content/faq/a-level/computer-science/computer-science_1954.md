The conversion of a binary number to octal involves grouping the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the rightmost digit.

To effectively convert a binary number to an octal number, it's important to recognize that each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits. This relationship exists because the octal system is base-$8$, and $2^3$ (which equals $8$) is the nearest power of $2$ that is less than or equal to $8$. Consequently, each digit in an octal number can be represented by three binary digits.

The conversion process begins with the least significant bit (the rightmost digit) of the binary number. You should group the binary digits into sets of three, moving from right to left. If you encounter a situation where there are not enough digits to form a complete group of three at the leftmost end (the most significant bit), you can add zeros to the left to complete the group.

Once you have formed your groups of three, the next step is to convert each group into its corresponding octal digit. The mappings are as follows:
- The binary group $000$ corresponds to the octal digit $0$,
- $001$ corresponds to $1$,
- $010$ corresponds to $2$,
- $011$ corresponds to $3$,
- $100$ corresponds to $4$,
- $101$ corresponds to $5$,
- $110$ corresponds to $6$, and
- $111$ corresponds to $7$.

After converting each binary group, write down the octal digits in the same order as their respective binary groups. The resulting sequence of digits will represent the octal equivalent of the original binary number.

For instance, letâ€™s convert the binary number $110101101$ to octal. First, we group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right: $110$, $101$, and $101$. Next, we convert each of these groups to their octal equivalents: $110$ converts to $6$, $101$ converts to $5$, and $101$ converts to $5$. Therefore, the octal equivalent of the binary number $110101101$ is $655$.

In summary, the key to successfully converting between binary and octal systems lies in understanding the relationship between the two and being able to accurately convert between their respective digits. With practice, this process can become second nature.
