An Object-Relational Database (ORD) acts as a bridge between relational and object-oriented databases, offering a flexible and efficient approach to data management.

In contemporary applications, the significance of an Object-Relational Database (ORD) is paramount. It merges the characteristics of both relational databases (RDBMS) and object-oriented databases (OODBMS), providing a more adaptable and effective strategy for data management. This hybrid model enables developers to handle complex data types and intricate relationships, which are prevalent in today's multifaceted applications.

The relational model of an ORD is advantageous for managing structured data and executing complex queries. It utilizes tables to organize data, where each row represents a record and each column corresponds to a field. This structure simplifies searching, sorting, and analyzing data. Moreover, the relational model adheres to ACID properties—Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability—ensuring reliable and secure transactions.

Conversely, the object-oriented model of an ORD allows for a more natural representation of real-world entities and their interrelations. It incorporates fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This model is especially beneficial for applications that involve complex data structures, such as multimedia data, geographic information systems, and computer-aided design.

The integration of these two models within an ORD offers several advantages. Firstly, it enhances flexibility in data modeling. Developers can select the most appropriate model for different parts of the application based on the specific nature of the data and the operations required. Secondly, it boosts performance by facilitating more efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Complex queries can be executed more rapidly, and data can be accessed and updated in a more direct manner. Lastly, it encourages code reuse and maintenance, as the object-oriented model fosters modular and reusable code.

In summary, an Object-Relational Database plays a crucial role in modern applications. It provides a flexible and efficient solution for managing diverse and complex data, addressing the demands of today's dynamic and data-intensive environments.
