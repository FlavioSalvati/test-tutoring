The time complexity of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is $O(V + E)$.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that systematically explores all the vertices in a graph in breadth-first order. This means it visits all vertices at the current depth level before advancing to vertices at the next depth level. The time complexity of BFS is expressed as $O(V + E)$, where $V$ denotes the number of vertices and $E$ represents the number of edges in the graph.

The BFS algorithm begins at a designated root node and visits all adjacent nodes. For each of these nearest nodes, it then explores their unexplored neighboring nodes, continuing this process until it reaches the target node. A queue data structure is utilized to keep track of the nodes that need to be explored next.

In terms of time complexity, BFS visits each vertex exactly once and traverses each edge once. As a result, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the graph, which is the sum of the number of vertices and the number of edges. This is mathematically represented as $O(V + E)$.

The notation $O$ in the time complexity signifies the upper bound on the time required for the algorithm, indicating that the algorithm will not exceed this time limit. The variable $V$ stands for the number of vertices in the graph. Since BFS traverses from one node to all its adjacent nodes, it visits each vertex only once, which is why $V$ is included in the time complexity.

Similarly, the variable $E$ represents the number of edges in the graph. BFS examines each edge once as it checks for connections between nodes and their adjacent neighbors. Therefore, $E$ is also a crucial component of the time complexity.
