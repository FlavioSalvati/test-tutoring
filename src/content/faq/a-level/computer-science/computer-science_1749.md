A mesh topology interconnects all devices within a network, ensuring redundancy, while a star topology links all devices to a central hub.

In a mesh topology, each device is directly connected to every other device in the network. This configuration creates multiple pathways for data to travel between any two devices, enhancing the network's reliability. If one connection fails, data can still be transmitted through an alternative route. This redundancy contributes to the robustness of mesh networks; however, it also results in increased complexity and higher costs for both setup and maintenance. Mesh topologies are particularly advantageous in environments where network reliability is paramount, such as data centers and telecommunications networks.

Conversely, a star topology features a design where all devices connect to a central hub or switch. This hub serves as the primary conduit for transmitting messages. When a device wishes to send data to another device, it first sends the data to the hub, which then forwards it to the intended recipient. This architecture makes star networks relatively straightforward and cost-effective to establish and maintain. However, a significant drawback is that if the central hub fails, the entire network becomes inoperable. Star topologies are widely utilized in home networks and small business settings.
