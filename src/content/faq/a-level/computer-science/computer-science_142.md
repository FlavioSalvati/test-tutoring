The linker, also referred to as a link editor, is an essential component in the process of program compilation and execution. Its primary responsibilities include resolving symbol references and merging multiple code files into a single executable.

### Role of the Linker

A linker is a specialized computer program that takes one or more object files produced by a compiler and combines them into a cohesive executable program. 

#### Resolving Symbol References

One of the linker's key functions is to resolve symbol references. In programming, symbols represent names assigned to variables, functions, and other identifiers. During the compilation process, the compiler replaces these symbols with their corresponding memory addresses. However, not all symbols can be resolved at this stage, particularly those defined in different source files or libraries. 

This is where the linkerâ€™s role becomes critical. It scans the object files to identify unresolved symbols and replaces them with the appropriate addresses, a process known as symbol resolution.

#### Combining Code Files

Another fundamental task of the linker is to combine separate code files. When a program is divided into multiple source files, each file is compiled into its own object file. The linker then merges these object files into a single executable file, a process known as file linking. Additionally, the linker ensures that code from one file can correctly access code from another file. This capability is especially important in large projects where code organization and maintainability are enhanced by distributing code across multiple files.

### Additional Functions

Beyond these primary tasks, the linker also performs several other critical functions, including memory allocation and relocation. It determines the appropriate memory locations for the program's static data and code, adjusting the code and data to reflect these memory addresses. This adjustment process is known as relocation.

### Conclusion

In summary, the linker plays a vital role in program execution. It not only resolves symbol references and combines separate code files but also handles memory allocation and relocation. Without the linker, the individual pieces of code generated by the compiler would be unable to function together as a unified, executable program.
