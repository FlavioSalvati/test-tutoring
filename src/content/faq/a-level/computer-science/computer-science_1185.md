IntroSort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines the strengths of QuickSort and HeapSort, delivering both fast average performance and optimal worst-case performance.

The name "IntroSort" is derived from "Introspective Sort." This algorithm was first implemented in the C++ Standard Library and was specifically designed to address the limitations found in QuickSort and HeapSort. QuickSort is known for its speed and efficiency in average cases; however, it can degrade to a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst-case scenario. Conversely, HeapSort guarantees a consistent performance of $O(n \log n)$, but it is generally slower than QuickSort in average cases.

IntroSort begins its sorting process using QuickSort. It then switches to HeapSort when the recursion depth exceeds a predetermined threshold, which is typically based on the logarithm of the number of elements being sorted. This adaptive behavior is where the term "introspective" comes into play, as the algorithm assesses its performance and changes its strategy if it detects that QuickSort is underperforming.

During the QuickSort phase, IntroSort employs a variation known as 'median-of-three' QuickSort. In this approach, the pivot is selected as the median of the first, middle, and last elements of the partition. This strategy helps mitigate the risk of encountering QuickSort's worst-case performance.

When the recursion depth surpasses a specific limit—commonly set at $2 \cdot \log_2(n)$—the algorithm transitions to HeapSort. Since HeapSort is inherently non-recursive, it avoids the potential stack overflow issues that can arise with recursive algorithms like QuickSort. Additionally, HeapSort ensures a performance of $O(n \log n)$, which is a reliable alternative when QuickSort's performance is suboptimal.

In summary, IntroSort effectively merges the average-case efficiency of QuickSort with the worst-case performance guarantees of HeapSort. By monitoring its own performance and dynamically switching between these two sorting strategies, IntroSort provides both rapid average performance and optimal worst-case performance. This adaptability makes it a robust and efficient choice for a wide range of practical sorting tasks.
