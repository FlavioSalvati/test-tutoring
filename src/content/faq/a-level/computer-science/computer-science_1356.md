Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that centers around the concept of objects as its fundamental building blocks. This approach enables developers to organize and structure code in a way that fosters flexibility and efficiency. The four core features of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

**Encapsulation** refers to the practice of bundling data and the methods that manipulate that data into a single unit known as an object. This feature promotes data hiding, meaning that the attributes of the object are concealed from the outside world and can only be accessed through the object's methods. Encapsulation helps prevent unintended modifications to data and enhances the overall security of the application.

**Inheritance** is a feature that allows a class (often referred to as the child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (known as the parent class). This mechanism promotes code reusability, enabling the child class to leverage the code defined in the parent class while also adding its own unique functionalities. Inheritance facilitates hierarchical classification, which mirrors many natural organizational structures found in the real world.

**Polymorphism** allows a single interface to be used for a general class of actions, meaning that the specific method invoked is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. This characteristic provides significant flexibility, as it allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly as instances of a common superclass.

**Abstraction** is the process of modeling complex real-world problems by simplifying them to capture only the relevant details. This is achieved through the creation of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly but can be subclassed, while an interface consists of a collection of abstract methods (methods without implementations).

These four features of OOP work in harmony to create a code structure that is easy to understand, modify, and maintain. They also provide a framework for modeling complex real-world problems in a manner that aligns with human cognitive patterns.

**A-Level Computer Science Tutor Summary:** In object-oriented programming (OOP), the key concepts are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Think of it as a toolkit for organizing your code: encapsulation safeguards data, inheritance enables code reuse and extension, polymorphism enhances code flexibility by allowing various objects to respond to the same command, and abstraction simplifies complex ideas by concentrating on the essential elements.
