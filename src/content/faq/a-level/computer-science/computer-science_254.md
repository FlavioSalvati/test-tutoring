The 'STRING_AGG' function in SQL is a powerful tool designed to concatenate multiple rows from a specified column into a single string.

More specifically, 'STRING_AGG' is a built-in aggregate function that takes multiple string values and concatenates them while inserting specified separator values between each one. Notably, this separator is not appended to the end of the resulting string. This function is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to merge values from numerous rows into one cohesive string in your result set.

For instance, consider a table containing information about students and their respective subjects. If you wish to compile a list of all the subjects that a specific student is enrolled in, you could utilize the 'STRING_AGG' function. It would gather the individual subject entries for that student and merge them into a single string, using a comma or any other separator of your choice.

The syntax for the 'STRING_AGG' function is as follows:

$$
\text{STRING\_AGG ( expression, separator )}
$$

In this syntax, the 'expression' refers to the column or string you want to concatenate, while the 'separator' indicates the character or string that you want to insert between each combined value. The separator can be of any string type, including multiple characters.

It is important to keep in mind that the 'STRING_AGG' function disregards null values present in the expression being concatenated. However, if the separator itself is null, the function will return a null result.

In summary, the 'STRING_AGG' function is an invaluable asset in SQL, allowing you to seamlessly merge multiple rows of data into a single string. This capability enhances the readability and analysis of your data.
