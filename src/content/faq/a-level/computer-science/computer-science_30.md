To convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent, you can follow a systematic process that involves dividing the number by $16$ and recording the remainders. The hexadecimal system is a base-$16$ numeral system, using $16$ distinct symbols to represent values. These symbols include the digits $0$ through $9$ and the letters $A$ through $F$, where $A$ represents $10$, $B$ represents $11$, $C$ represents $12$, $D$ represents $13$, $E$ represents $14$, and $F$ represents $15$.

Here’s how to perform the conversion step by step:

1. **Divide the Decimal Number**: Start by dividing your decimal number by $16$. The quotient from this division will be used for the next step, while the remainder will represent the least significant digit (the rightmost digit) of your hexadecimal number.

2. **Record the Remainder**: If the remainder is greater than $9$, replace it with the corresponding hexadecimal letter (i.e., $10$ becomes $A$, $11$ becomes $B$, and so on up to $15$, which becomes $F$).

3. **Repeat the Process**: Continue dividing the quotient by $16$ and recording the remainders until the quotient becomes $0$. 

4. **Read the Remainders**: The hexadecimal equivalent is formed by reading the remainders in reverse order, from the last remainder obtained to the first.

Let’s illustrate this process with an example by converting the decimal number $254$ to hexadecimal:

- **First Division**: Divide $254$ by $16$. This yields a quotient of $15$ and a remainder of $14$. The remainder $14$ corresponds to the letter $E$ in hexadecimal, making $E$ the least significant digit.

- **Second Division**: Next, take the quotient $15$ and divide it by $16$. This gives a quotient of $0$ and a remainder of $15$. The remainder $15$ corresponds to the letter $F$ in hexadecimal.

Since the quotient is now $0$, we stop the division process. 

Now, by reading the remainders in reverse order, we find that the hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal number $254$ is $FE$.

This method is applicable to any decimal number, and understanding it is particularly beneficial in fields like computer science, where hexadecimal notation is frequently used in programming and data representation.
