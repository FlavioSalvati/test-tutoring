The octal representation of the hexadecimal number $AF$ is $257$.

To convert a hexadecimal number to octal, we first transform it into binary, and then from binary to octal. Hexadecimal is a base-$16$ number system, while octal is a base-$8$ number system.

Let's begin with the hexadecimal number $AF$. In hexadecimal, the digit $A$ represents $10$ and the digit $F$ represents $15$. The binary representation of $A$ (which is $10$ in decimal) is $1010$, and the binary representation of $F$ (which is $15$ in decimal) is $1111$. Consequently, the binary representation of $AF$ is $10101111$.

Next, we will convert this binary number to octal. To do this, we group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right. Thus, $10101111$ can be grouped as $010\ 101\ 111$. Now, we convert each of these binary groups into their octal equivalents: $010$ in binary is $2$ in octal, $101$ in binary is $5$ in octal, and $111$ in binary is $7$ in octal. Therefore, the octal representation of the binary number $10101111$ is $257$.

In conclusion, the octal representation of the hexadecimal number $AF$ is $257$. This conversion process is fundamental in computer science since different number systems are utilized in various computing contexts. For instance, hexadecimal is often employed in programming and web design, while octal is frequently used in systems programming and for managing file permissions in Unix-like operating systems. Mastering how to convert between these systems is an essential skill for any computer science student.
