Pipelining enhances CPU performance by enabling the simultaneous execution of multiple instructions, thereby reducing overall processing time.

This technique is commonly employed in the design of modern microprocessors to boost instruction throughput, which refers to the number of instructions executed per unit of time. The fundamental concept of pipelining involves decomposing the execution of an instruction into a sequence of independent steps, with each step processed by a different component of the processor. This approach allows the processor to work on several instructions concurrently, analogous to an assembly line in a manufacturing setting.

Consider a simplified CPU that executes instructions in four distinct stages: fetch, decode, execute, and write back. In a non-pipelined architecture, the CPU must complete all four stages for one instruction before initiating the next. Consequently, many of the CPU's components remain idle during this time. However, with pipelining, once the CPU finishes fetching the first instruction, it can immediately begin fetching the second instruction, while the first instruction transitions to the decode stage. This overlapping of stages ensures that all parts of the CPU are actively engaged in different stages of various instructions simultaneously, significantly enhancing the CPU's efficiency and speed.
