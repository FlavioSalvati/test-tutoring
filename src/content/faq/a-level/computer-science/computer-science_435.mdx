A dynamic array is a versatile data structure that can automatically adjust its size as elements are added or removed.

Often referred to as an array list, a dynamic array differs from a static array in that it has a variable size. This flexibility allows it to accommodate elements even after its initial creation, unlike a static array, which has a fixed size determined at compile time. Consequently, with dynamic arrays, there's no need to predefine the size of the array.

The operation of a dynamic array involves allocating memory for a larger array when the current one reaches its capacity. When an attempt is made to add an element to a full dynamic array, the array will allocate a new, larger block of memory. It then copies all existing elements from the old array to this newly created array and finally adds the new element. This process is commonly known as 'resizing' or 'reallocation'.

Typically, the size of the new array is a multiple of the old array's size. This strategy is employed to minimize the frequency of resizing operations, which can be computationally intensive. However, this can lead to a situation where a dynamic array consumes more memory than a static array, as it may have unused 'slots' within the array.

When elements are removed from a dynamic array, the array may shrink to reclaim memory. Nevertheless, this resizing is less common because reducing the size of an array is also a resource-intensive process. If elements are subsequently added again, this could trigger additional resizing operations.

In summary, a dynamic array is a flexible and powerful data structure that adjusts its size as needed. It achieves this by creating a new, larger array when it becomes full and may shrink when elements are removed. While dynamic arrays offer significant advantages in programming, itâ€™s important to consider the potential memory and computational costs associated with the resizing operations.
