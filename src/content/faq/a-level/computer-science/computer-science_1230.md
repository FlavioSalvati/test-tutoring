A physical network topology refers to the actual arrangement of the network hardware, while a logical topology describes how data flows within that network.

The physical network topology encompasses the tangible layout of devices, cables, and other hardware components that constitute a network. This layout includes the physical positioning of devices and their interconnections. For instance, in a star topology, all devices connect to a central hub or switch. In contrast, a bus topology features all devices connected to a single communication line, referred to as the bus. Additional types of physical topologies include ring, mesh, and tree configurations. The significance of physical topology lies in its influence on the network's performance, reliability, and overall cost.

Conversely, a logical network topology focuses on the pathways that data takes as it travels through the network, independent of the physical arrangement. It emphasizes the data transmission routes rather than the actual hardware layout. For example, in a logical bus topology, data is broadcast to all devices on the network, but only the intended recipient processes the information. In a logical ring topology, data circulates from one device to the next in a continuous loop until it reaches its destination. Understanding logical topology is vital, as it affects how data is transmitted and can influence the speed and efficiency of data transfer.

In many instances, the physical and logical topologies of a network may align. However, they can also differ significantly. For example, a network could exhibit a physical star topology while operating under a logical bus topology. This scenario implies that although all devices are physically connected to a central hub, data is transmitted as if the devices were arranged in a linear fashion along a bus.

Grasping the distinctions between physical and logical network topologies is essential for effective network design and management. The choice of topology can greatly affect the network's performance, cost, and reliability. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate both physical and logical topologies during the network design process.
