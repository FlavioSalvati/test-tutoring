In functional programming, closures are functions that retain access to variables from their outer scope, even after the outer function has completed execution.

To elaborate, a closure is essentially a function that is bundled with its lexical environment. The term "lexical environment" refers to the context in which the function was defined, encompassing all local variables that were in scope at the time the closure was created. This characteristic enables closures to access variables from an outer function that has already returned, despite the fact that the scope of that outer function is considered "closed" over its local variables. This is why they are referred to as "closures," as they effectively "close over" the variables they require.

In the realm of functional programming, closures serve to encapsulate private variables, mirroring the role of objects in object-oriented programming. They can also facilitate the creation of function factories, where a function generates and returns another function with specific properties.

To illustrate this concept, let's examine the following example. Consider a function `outer` that defines a variable `x` and a nested function `inner`. The `inner` function acts as a closure that has access to the variable `x`. Remarkably, even after the `outer` function has finished executing, the `inner` function retains access to `x`. This occurs because `inner` is a closure that "closes over" the variable `x`.

Hereâ€™s the code to demonstrate this:

```javascript
function outer() {
    let x = 10;
    function inner() {
        console.log(x);
    }
    return inner;
}

let myFunction = outer();
myFunction(); // This will log '10' to the console
```

In this example, `myFunction` is a closure that can access the variable `x` from its outer scope. Despite the fact that the `outer` function has completed its execution, `myFunction` is still able to access `x`. This capability is a powerful feature of functional programming, allowing for data privacy and the creation of function factories.

In summary, closures are a fundamental concept in functional programming that empower functions to maintain "private" variables that persist even after the function has returned. They are invaluable tools for encapsulating data and facilitating the construction of complex function structures.
