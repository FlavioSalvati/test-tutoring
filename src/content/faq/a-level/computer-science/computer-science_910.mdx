FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, serves as a standard network protocol designed for the transfer of computer files between a client and a server within a computer network.

The File Transfer Protocol is a structured set of rules that computers adhere to when transferring files from one system to another over the internet. It is an integral part of the TCP/IP protocol suite and operates under the client-server model for data exchange. In this model, the client initiates a connection to the server, which houses the files. Upon receiving the connection request, the server establishes a link with the client, allowing for the subsequent transfer of files.

FTP operates using two distinct channels: the command channel and the data channel. The command channel is responsible for managing the connection and handling commands exchanged between the client and the server. In contrast, the data channel is utilized for the actual transfer of files.

There are two modes of operation in FTP: active mode and passive mode. In active mode, the client opens a port and listens for incoming connections, while the server actively connects to this port. Conversely, in passive mode, the server opens a port and waits for the client to establish a connection to it. This passive mode is particularly useful when the client is situated behind a firewall and is unable to accept incoming connections.

Additionally, FTP supports secure file transfers through protocols such as FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol). FTPS enhances FTP by incorporating support for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols. On the other hand, SFTP operates over Secure Shell (SSH) to facilitate file transfers. Unlike FTPS, SFTP encrypts both commands and data, providing robust protection against common network security threats.

In conclusion, FTP is a powerful, reliable, and secure method for transferring files across networks. It is a fundamental protocol in the realm of networking and is extensively used in various applications, including web hosting, file sharing, and certain aspects of cloud storage.
