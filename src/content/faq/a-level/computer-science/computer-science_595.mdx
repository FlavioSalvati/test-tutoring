A one-to-one relationship in a database is established by connecting two tables through a primary key-foreign key relationship.

In a relational database, a one-to-one relationship occurs when a record in one table is linked to exactly one record in another table. This linkage is achieved by creating a primary key in the first table and a corresponding foreign key in the second table. The primary key serves as a unique identifier for each record in the first table, while the foreign key in the second table is used to reference that unique record.

To effectively model a one-to-one relationship, you must first identify the two entities that share this relationship. For instance, consider a database for a school. In this scenario, a student has a single record in the 'Student' table and a corresponding record in the 'StudentDetails' table. The 'Student' table may include fields such as StudentID (the primary key), Name, and Age. Meanwhile, the 'StudentDetails' table might contain fields like StudentID (the foreign key), Address, and ContactNumber.

In this setup, the StudentID in the 'StudentDetails' table acts as a foreign key that references the StudentID in the 'Student' table. This arrangement creates a one-to-one relationship between the two tables, ensuring that each student has one unique set of details, and each set of details is associated with one specific student.

It is crucial to understand that in a one-to-one relationship, the foreign key must also be unique. This uniqueness guarantees that each record in the first table corresponds to precisely one record in the second table. If the foreign key were not unique, a record in the first table could potentially link to multiple records in the second table, thereby transforming the relationship into a one-to-many relationship.

In summary, to model a one-to-one relationship in a database, you should identify the two entities that possess this relationship, establish a primary key in the first table, and then create a corresponding unique foreign key in the second table. This connection effectively links the two tables, ensuring that each record in the first table corresponds to exactly one record in the second table.
