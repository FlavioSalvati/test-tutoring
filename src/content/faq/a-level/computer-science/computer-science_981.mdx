A database ensures consistency during concurrent transactions through various mechanisms, including locking, timestamping, and transaction logs.

To maintain consistency amidst concurrent transactions, databases employ a range of techniques. One of the most prevalent methods is locking. In this approach, the database system locks the data items being accessed by a transaction, thereby preventing other transactions from modifying them until the initial transaction is completed. This mechanism ensures that transactions do not interfere with one another and that the database remains in a consistent state. There are two primary types of locks: shared locks and exclusive locks. Shared locks permit multiple transactions to read the same data item simultaneously but prohibit any write operations, whereas exclusive locks allow only a single transaction to read and write a data item.

Another important method for ensuring consistency is timestamping. Each transaction receives a unique timestamp upon initiation, which the database system uses to determine the sequence in which transactions access data items. If a transaction attempts to access a data item that has already been accessed by a later transaction, the database system will roll back the initial transaction and restart it with a new timestamp. This process helps to prevent conflicts and guarantees that all transactions are executed in a serializable manner.

Transaction logs serve as another critical tool for maintaining consistency in database systems. A transaction log is a comprehensive record of all changes made to the database by each transaction. In the event that a transaction is interrupted—due to a system crash or power failure, for example—the database system can utilize the transaction log to roll back the transaction and restore the database to its prior state. This functionality ensures that the database remains consistent, even in the face of system failures.

In addition to these techniques, database systems often implement protocols such as the two-phase commit protocol to uphold consistency across multiple databases. This protocol divides a transaction into two distinct phases: a prepare phase, during which the transaction is executed and the changes are logged, and a commit phase, when the changes are applied to the database. By ensuring that all databases involved in the transaction agree on the outcome before any changes are finalized, this protocol maintains consistency across all participating databases.
