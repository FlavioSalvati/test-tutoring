Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) are both protocols designed to facilitate secure communication over computer networks. However, they differ significantly in their approaches to providing security.

S-HTTP secures individual messages by encrypting the data contained within each message. This means that every message sent using S-HTTP is protected independently, allowing for security measures to be applied on a per-message basis. This method can be particularly useful in scenarios where only specific parts of the communication require protection.

In contrast, HTTPS establishes a secure connection between the client and the server, ensuring that all data transmitted over this connection is encrypted. This is accomplished through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Once the secure connection is established, every piece of data exchanged between the client and server is protected, regardless of the nature of the individual messages. This comprehensive protection can offer a higher level of security since it safeguards all communication rather than isolating specific messages.

Another important distinction between these two protocols is their prevalence in usage. HTTPS is extensively used across the internet for secure transactions, particularly those involving sensitive information such as credit card details, and is supported by all modern web browsers. Conversely, S-HTTP has not gained widespread adoption and is used less frequently. One reason for this is that S-HTTP typically requires more computational resources to secure individual messages, which can make it less efficient than HTTPS when dealing with large volumes of data.

In summary, while both S-HTTP and HTTPS serve the purpose of securing communication, they employ different strategies. S-HTTP focuses on securing individual messages, making it suitable for cases where only certain segments of the communication need protection. In contrast, HTTPS secures all data transmitted over a secure connection, thereby offering a more robust level of security for all interactions between the client and the server.
