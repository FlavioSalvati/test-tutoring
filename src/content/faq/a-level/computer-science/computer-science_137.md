A self-compiling compiler, often referred to as a self-hosting compiler, is a specialized type of compiler that has the capability to compile its own source code.

This type of compiler distinguishes itself by being able to take its own source code as input and produce an executable file as output. This functionality is a defining characteristic of self-compiling compilers and is frequently used as a benchmark for assessing the compiler's correctness and overall performance.

One of the primary advantages of a self-compiling compiler is its proficiency in generating code that is as efficient as, or even more efficient than, code produced by a human programmer. This efficiency stems from the compiler's in-depth understanding of the programming language it is compiling, allowing it to apply optimizations that a human might overlook or be unable to implement.

Another significant feature of a self-compiling compiler is its capacity to evolve and enhance itself over time. As it compiles its own source code, any improvements or optimizations made to the compiler can be directly implemented, leading to continuous enhancements in its performance and capabilities.

Self-compiling compilers also exhibit a high degree of portability. Since they can compile their own source code, they can be easily transferred from one system to another. The only requirement is an existing basic compiler to bootstrap the self-compiling compiler on the new system. Once operational, the self-compiling compiler can compile its own source code as well as any other code written in its language.

In summary, the key features of a self-compiling compiler include its ability to compile its own source code, generate efficient code, evolve and improve over time, and maintain portability. These attributes make self-compiling compilers powerful tools in the realm of computer science.
