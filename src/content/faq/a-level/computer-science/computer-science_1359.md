Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts a list by splitting it into halves, sorting those halves, and then merging them back together.

The merge sort algorithm begins by dividing the unsorted list into $n$ sublists, each containing a single element. Since a list with only one element is inherently sorted, this step effectively initializes the sorting process. The algorithm then repeatedly merges these sublists to create new sorted sublists until only one sublist remains, which will be the final sorted list.

The algorithm can be broken down into three primary steps: **divide**, **conquer**, and **combine**. 

1. **Divide**: In this step, the list is recursively divided into two halves. The function calls itself with smaller and smaller portions of the list until it can no longer be divided, resulting in sublists of size one.

2. **Conquer**: During this phase, the algorithm sorts the sublists. Since each sublist contains only one element, it is already sorted. As the recursion unwinds, these one-element sublists are merged back together, forming larger sorted sublists.

3. **Combine**: In the final step, the sorted sublists are merged to create a larger, fully sorted list. This process involves comparing the first elements of each sublist and adding the smaller of the two to a new list. This comparison and addition continue until all elements from both sublists have been merged into the new list.

Merge sort is known for its efficiency, boasting a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, which makes it particularly effective for sorting large data sets. However, one drawback of this algorithm is that it requires additional space for temporary arrays used during the merging process, which can be a concern when memory usage is critical.

In summary, merge sort is a recursive, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that decomposes a list into single-element sublists and then merges these sublists back together in sorted order. It is a robust sorting method, especially well-suited for handling larger data sets, although it does require extra memory for its operations.
