The Pigeonhole Sort algorithm organizes elements by allocating each item to a designated 'pigeonhole' that corresponds to its key value.

Pigeonhole Sort is a sorting technique that involves creating an array of 'pigeonholes' or 'buckets' for every possible key value present in the input data. The algorithm begins by iterating through the input and placing each item in the pigeonhole that matches its key value. After all items have been assigned to their corresponding pigeonholes, the algorithm traverses the pigeonholes sequentially, outputting the items contained in each one. This process ultimately yields a sorted list of items.

The first step in the Pigeonhole Sort algorithm is to identify the range of key values within the input data. This requires determining the minimum and maximum key values. The total number of pigeonholes needed is calculated by subtracting the minimum key value from the maximum key value and then adding one. This calculation ensures there is a pigeonhole allocated for every possible key value.

Following this, an array of pigeonholes is created, with each one initially empty. The algorithm then iterates through the input data once more, placing each item into the appropriate pigeonhole based on its key value. This placement is achieved by subtracting the minimum key value from the item's key value, which provides the index of the corresponding pigeonhole.

After all items have been distributed into their respective pigeonholes, the algorithm proceeds to iterate through the pigeonholes in order. For each pigeonhole, it outputs the items contained within it, maintaining the order in which they were initially placed. This step culminates in a sorted list of items.

While Pigeonhole Sort is a straightforward and efficient algorithm when the range of key values is relatively small, its performance can degrade significantly if the range is large. This inefficiency arises from the substantial memory requirement needed to create the pigeonholes. Moreover, the algorithm is not suitable for sorting items with non-integer key values, as it relies on these key values being used as indices within an array.
