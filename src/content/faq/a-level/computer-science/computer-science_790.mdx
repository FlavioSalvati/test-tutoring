A depth-first search (DFS) in a graph is executed by exploring each branch as deeply as possible before backtracking to investigate other neighbors.

DFS is a fundamental algorithm in graph theory, designed for systematic traversal or searching within a graph. The algorithm begins at a designated node—commonly the root node if the graph has a tree structure—and explores as far along each branch as it can before returning to previous nodes.

To implement DFS, a stack data structure is typically employed. The algorithm starts at a chosen node (often the root), pushes this node onto the stack, and marks it as visited. It then examines the node at the top of the stack and checks for any unvisited neighboring nodes. If an unvisited neighbor is found, it is pushed onto the stack and marked as visited. If no unvisited neighbors are available, the algorithm pops the top node from the stack. This process continues until the stack is empty.

The pseudocode for the DFS algorithm is as follows:

```
DFS(graph, root):
    create a stack S and push root into S
    create a set V (visited nodes)
    while S is not empty:
        pop the top node N from S
        if N is not in V:
            add N to V
            push all unvisited neighbors of N into S
```

DFS is inherently recursive, meaning it calls itself to tackle sub-problems. This characteristic is evident in its approach of diving deep into a branch before backtracking. Consequently, DFS is particularly well-suited for problems that require exploring as deeply as possible into a graph, such as solving mazes or finding connected components.

However, DFS is not universally applicable. For example, in a weighted graph, DFS does not guarantee the shortest path to a node. In such cases, algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* are more appropriate choices.

In summary, DFS is a powerful method for traversing and searching graphs. Like all algorithms, it possesses both strengths and weaknesses, and its application should be considered carefully based on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
