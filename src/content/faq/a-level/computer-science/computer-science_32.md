The bead sort algorithm operates by visualizing the elements of a list as beads positioned on vertical rods.

Bead sort, also referred to as gravity sort, is a natural sorting algorithm that functions as both a distribution sort and a bin sort. It conceptualizes the elements of the list as beads on vertical rods, where the height of each rod corresponds to the value of the respective element. The beads then "fall" down the rods, naturally arranging themselves in sorted order.

To better understand the bead sort algorithm, consider an abacus. Each rod on the abacus signifies a digit in the number to be sorted, while the beads on each rod represent the actual numbers. When the abacus is inverted, the beads descend down the rods, organizing themselves from the highest to the lowest value.

The algorithm initiates by placing the beads on the rods according to the input list. Each bead symbolizes an individual element of the list, and the height of each rod reflects the value of that element. Once positioned, the beads are allowed to "fall" down the rods. As they descend, they sort themselves from highest to lowest value. This occurs because the beads representing larger numbers will fall further down compared to those representing smaller numbers.

After all the beads have settled, the algorithm reads the new arrangement of the beads. This final arrangement indicates the sorted list. The algorithm then returns this sorted list as the output.

While bead sort is a straightforward and intuitive algorithm, it is not commonly used in practical applications. This is largely due to its high space requirements and relatively poor time complexity compared to other sorting algorithms. Nevertheless, bead sort serves as an excellent educational tool for illustrating the fundamental principles of sorting algorithms, offering a clear and tangible representation of the sorting process.
