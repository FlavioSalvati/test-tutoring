The bead sort algorithm operates by visualizing the elements of a list as beads positioned on vertical rods.

Bead sort, also referred to as gravity sort, is a natural sorting algorithm that combines characteristics of both distribution sorting and comparison sorting, although it is not classified as a stable sort. The algorithm conceptualizes the elements of the list as beads on vertical rods, where each bead represents one unit. When the rods are metaphorically 'shaken', the beads fall down and stack on top of one another. The height of each stack of beads ultimately represents the sorted order of the list.

The algorithm begins by mapping each element of the input list to a corresponding rod, with the height of each rod reflecting the value of the element. Following this setup, the rods are 'shaken', causing the beads to descend to the bottom. The beads then stack together, with taller stacks forming on the left and shorter stacks on the right. This process continues until all beads have settled. Once completed, the heights of the stacks are read, yielding the sorted list.

Bead sort can be implemented using either arrays or linked lists. In an array implementation, the algorithm traverses the array from left to right, replacing each element with a representation of beads (typically denoted as 1s). After this replacement, the array is 'shaken' by summing the columns and updating the original array with these sums. In a linked list implementation, each node contains a counter and a pointer to the next node. The list is traversed, and for each node, a new node is created with a counter reflecting the value of the current node, which is then inserted into the sorted list at the appropriate position.

While bead sort is a straightforward and intuitive algorithm, it is rarely used in practical applications due to its relatively poor time complexity. Specifically, the time complexity of bead sort is $O(n^2)$, making it inefficient for large lists. Nonetheless, it can serve as a valuable educational tool, as it provides a clear visualization of the sorting process.
