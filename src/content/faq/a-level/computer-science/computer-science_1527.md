In functional programming, trees are often represented as recursive data structures and are traversed using recursive techniques.

Functional programming languages, such as Haskell and Scala, typically define trees as recursive data structures. This means that a tree is defined in terms of itself, accompanied by a base case to terminate the recursion. For instance, a binary tree can be represented as either an empty tree or a node that contains a value along with two child trees. This recursive definition aligns closely with the inherent recursive structure of trees, where each subtree is itself a tree.

Tree traversal in functional programming also relies heavily on recursion. There are various methods for traversing a tree, including depth-first and breadth-first traversals. Depth-first traversal explores the nodes of a tree by advancing as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. In contrast, breadth-first traversal visits the nodes level by level. Both traversal strategies can be implemented recursively. For example, a depth-first traversal may involve recursively visiting the left child of a node, then processing the node itself, followed by the right child.

It is crucial to note that in functional programming, trees, like all data structures, are immutable. This immutability implies that operations performed on trees do not alter the original tree; instead, they return a new tree. This characteristic can lead to more efficient algorithms, as portions of the original tree can be shared with the newly created tree. However, it also requires careful management to avoid unnecessary copying of the tree.

In summary, trees in functional programming are represented and traversed in a manner that reflects their recursive nature. This characteristic makes them particularly well-suited for functional programming languages, which excel in expressing recursive algorithms and managing recursive data structures.
