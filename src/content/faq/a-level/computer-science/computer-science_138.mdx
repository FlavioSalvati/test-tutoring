The process of assembling a source program consists of five key stages: preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking, and loading.

### 1. Preprocessing
The initial stage, preprocessing, involves several important tasks. During this phase, the preprocessor removes comments and expands macros. It also processes preprocessor directives, which are special instructions for the preprocessor. These directives can include commands to include header files—files that contain declarations of functions and variables that can be utilized in the program. Additionally, the preprocessor handles conditional compilation and macro definitions, ensuring that the source code is prepared for the next stage.

### 2. Compiling
The second stage is compiling. Here, the compiler translates the preprocessed source code, written in a high-level programming language, into assembly language. This stage is critical because the compiler checks the source code for syntax errors and reports any issues it finds. Furthermore, the compiler optimizes the code to enhance its efficiency. The output of this stage is an assembly language program.

### 3. Assembling
The third stage is assembling. In this phase, the assembler converts the assembly language program into machine language, which the computer can understand. The assembler resolves symbolic names for memory locations, replacing them with actual addresses in memory. The result of this stage is an object file, which contains machine language instructions and data.

### 4. Linking
The fourth stage is linking. The linker combines the object file with other object files and library files to produce an executable file. It resolves references to functions and variables that may be defined in different object files or libraries, determining their memory locations in the process.

### 5. Loading
The final stage is loading. The loader takes the executable file and loads it into memory, preparing it for execution by the computer's processor. It sets up the stack and the heap—areas of memory designated for temporary storage and dynamic memory allocation, respectively. Once everything is in place, the loader transfers control to the program's starting point, initiating the execution of the machine language instructions.

Each of these stages is vital in transforming a source program written in a high-level language into an executable program that can be run on a computer. A clear understanding of these stages can enhance your comprehension of how programs are created and executed.
