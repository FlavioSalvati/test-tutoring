Multivalued attributes in database design are typically managed by creating separate tables or utilizing complex data types.

In the realm of database design, multivalued attributes refer to those attributes that can hold multiple values for a specific entity. For example, a person may have several phone numbers or email addresses. These multivalued attributes present a challenge, as they violate the principles of the First Normal Form (1NF), which stipulates that each attribute in a table must contain atomic (indivisible) values.

One effective method for addressing multivalued attributes is to create separate tables. For instance, if we have a table named 'Person' containing a multivalued attribute called 'Phone Numbers', we can establish a distinct 'Phone Numbers' table. This new table would consist of two columns: 'Person ID' and 'Phone Number'. Each row in the 'Phone Numbers' table would represent a single phone number associated with a person. The 'Person ID' would serve as a foreign key, linking back to the 'Person' table. By employing this structure, we can store multiple phone numbers for each individual while ensuring that the data adheres to the First Normal Form. For a more comprehensive understanding of database systems, consider exploring related topics.

Another strategy is to utilize complex data types, such as arrays or JSON objects, to accommodate the multiple values of an attribute. This approach is supported by various modern database management systems (DBMSs), such as PostgreSQL. However, using complex data types can complicate the querying and manipulation of data, potentially making it less efficient compared to the separate table method. Familiarity with foundational concepts can provide clarity on these different approaches.

In some instances, multivalued attributes may be handled by concatenating values into a single string, separated by a delimiter. While this method is possible, it is generally discouraged because it complicates querying and data manipulation, leading to potential data anomalies. Gaining further insight into how different systems handle such attributes could be advantageous.

In summary, when an attribute possesses multiple values, such as a person having various phone numbers, it is best to create a separate table or utilize complex types like arrays. The new table should link to the original using a foreign key. While concatenating values into a string or using complex data types is possible, these methods often introduce unnecessary complications.
