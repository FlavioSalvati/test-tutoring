A max heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that utilizes a binary tree structure while maintaining the heap property during insertions and deletions.

In a max heap, for any given node $I$, the value of $I$ is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This condition must hold for every node in the tree. Typically, a max heap is represented as an array, where each element corresponds to a node in the tree, and the parent-child relationships are defined by their indices.

To implement a max heap, you begin by defining the binary tree structure. Each node contains a value and can have two children. The root node, which does not have a parent, holds the maximum value in the heap. Each child node must have a value that is less than or equal to its parent's value. In an array representation, for a node at index $i$, the left child is located at index $2i + 1$, and the right child is at index $2i + 2$.

When inserting a new element into the max heap, you place it at the end of the array (the bottom of the tree) and then perform a "bubble up" operation if necessary to maintain the heap property. This involves comparing the newly inserted element with its parent. If the new element is larger, you swap them. This process continues until the new element is either smaller than or equal to its parent or becomes the root of the tree.

Deletion in a max heap typically involves removing the root node, which contains the maximum value. After the root is removed, the heap property may be violated. To restore this property, you can replace the root with the last element in the array and then perform a "bubble down" operation. This entails swapping the new root with its largest child until the new root is larger than both of its children.

In summary, implementing a max heap involves creating a binary tree structure, generally represented as an array, and ensuring the heap property is maintained during insertions and deletions. This is accomplished through the "bubble up" and "bubble down" procedures, which guarantee that each parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes.
