Collision handling in hash tables is essential for resolving conflicts that arise when two keys hash to the same index.

A hash table organizes data in an array format, where each data element is assigned a unique index value calculated by a hash function. However, it is possible for different keys to generate the same hash value, leading to a collision. This is where collision handling techniques come into play.

There are several methods for handling collisions, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The simplest approach is known as **separate chaining**. In this method, each cell in the hash table points to a linked list of records that share the same hash value. When a collision occurs, the new key is simply appended to the end of the corresponding linked list. While this method is straightforward and effective, it can result in long linked lists that may degrade search performance.

Another approach is called **open addressing**, in which all elements are stored directly within the hash table itself. When a collision occurs, the hash table searches for the next available slot to store the key. This method is generally more space-efficient than separate chaining; however, it can lead to a phenomenon known as clustering, where a contiguous group of filled cells slows down search operations.

A more sophisticated technique is **double hashing**, which employs a second hash function to compute a new index when a collision takes place. This method can effectively mitigate clustering issues but tends to require additional computational resources.

In summary, collision handling is a vital component of hash tables. It ensures that every key is assigned a unique index, thereby preventing data loss and facilitating efficient data retrieval. Without effective collision handling, the performance of a hash table can be severely impacted.
