Content Security Policies (CSPs) are implemented to restrict the sources of content that a web browser can load, thereby enhancing web security.

CSPs are a crucial security measure in web development designed to mitigate threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other forms of code injection attacks. Web developers implement CSPs, which are then enforced by web browsers. Essentially, a CSP functions as a whitelist that specifies which sources of content the browser is permitted to load. This list can include scripts, images, stylesheets, and various other resources.

When a web page containing a CSP is accessed, the browser examines the sources of all requested content against the established policy. If any piece of content originates from a source not included in the policy, the browser will block it from loading. This mechanism effectively prevents the loading of malicious content from untrusted sources.

CSPs are established using HTTP headers. The server conveys the policy to the browser through the 'Content-Security-Policy' HTTP response header. The policy itself is a string of directives, each one specifying a type of content along with a list of trusted sources for that content. For instance, a directive might state:

$$
\text{script-src 'self' https://trusted.com}
$$

This directive means that scripts can only be loaded from the same domain as the web page or from the specified trusted domain, `https://trusted.com`.

Furthermore, CSPs offer a 'report-only' mode, which does not block any content but instead sends reports about any policy violations to a designated URL. This feature is particularly useful for testing a new policy or for monitoring an active website for attempted attacks.

While CSPs are a powerful asset for enhancing web security, they must be implemented correctly to be truly effective. It is essential to make the policy as specific as possible to minimize the risk of inadvertently allowing harmful content. Additionally, CSPs should be regularly updated to reflect changes in the website and the addition of new content sources. However, it is important to note that even a well-implemented CSP is not a comprehensive solution and should be integrated into a broader web security strategy.
