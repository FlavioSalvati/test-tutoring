The odd-even sort algorithm, also referred to as brick sort, is a straightforward sorting technique designed to arrange numbers in a specified order. This algorithm functions by repeatedly traversing the list of numbers, comparing and swapping adjacent pairs.

The process consists of two main passes: one targeting odd-indexed elements and the other targeting even-indexed elements.

In the first pass, the algorithm begins at the first element (index $0$) and iterates through the list. During this traversal, it compares each pair of adjacent elements. If a pair is found to be out of order, the algorithm swaps them. This initial pass is termed the 'odd' pass because it starts with the odd-indexed element (specifically, index $1$ in zero-based indexing).

In the second pass, the algorithm follows a similar approach but starts at the second element (index $1$). This is referred to as the 'even' pass since it begins with the even-indexed element (index $0$ in zero-based indexing).

The algorithm alternates between these odd and even passes until the entire list is sorted. During each pass, it systematically compares and swaps adjacent elements as required. The process continues until a complete pass is conducted without any swaps, signifying that the list is sorted.

While the odd-even sort algorithm is relatively easy to understand and implement, it is not the most efficient sorting method, particularly for large lists. It has a worst-case and average time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Nevertheless, its simplicity makes it an excellent choice for educational purposes or for sorting small lists.

In terms of functionality, the odd-even sort algorithm bears resemblance to the bubble sort algorithm, as both methods involve repeatedly traversing the list and swapping adjacent elements that are out of order. However, the key difference lies in the odd-even sort's alternating approach, which can potentially enhance the sorting process by facilitating greater movement of elements across the list during each pass.
