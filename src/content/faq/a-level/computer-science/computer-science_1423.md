Boolean values are represented in binary notation as $1$ for true and $0$ for false.

The binary number system, which operates in base $2$, consists of only two possible values for each digit: $0$ and $1$. These two values correspond to the two states of a Boolean variable: $0$ signifies false, while $1$ signifies true. This concept is foundational in computer science, as binary represents the fundamental language of computers.

When a computer processes information, it manipulates binary digits, commonly referred to as bits. Each bit can be either a $0$ or a $1$, and these bits form the basis for representing all types of data, including numbers, text, images, and much more. However, the representation of Boolean values is particularly straightforward: a Boolean value of true is depicted as a binary $1$, whereas a Boolean value of false is depicted as a binary $0$.

The binary representation of Boolean values finds application across various domains in computer science. For instance, in programming, Boolean values are frequently employed to dictate the flow of a program. If a specified condition evaluates to true ($1$), then a designated block of code is executed; conversely, if the condition evaluates to false ($0$), that block of code is bypassed.

In digital electronics, Boolean values are used to indicate the state of electronic switches, or gates. An active switch that permits current to flow is represented as $1$, while an inactive switch that does not allow current to flow is represented as $0$. This binary representation underpins how computers process and store data.

In summary, Boolean values are represented in binary as $1$ for true and $0$ for false. This straightforward binary representation is a core principle of computer science, utilized across various fields, from programming to digital electronics.
