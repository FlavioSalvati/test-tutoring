An in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST) follows a specific sequence: first, it visits the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. This process is executed recursively.

In a binary search tree, an in-order traversal is a method for visiting all the nodes in a defined order. The order of visitation is as follows: begin with all the nodes in the left subtree, proceed to the root node, and conclude with all the nodes in the right subtree. The recursive nature of this process means that these steps are repeated for each subtree until every node has been visited.

To implement an in-order traversal, you begin at the root node. If the root has a left child, you move to that left child and repeat the traversal process. This continues until you encounter a node that does not have a left child, marking it as the first node to be visited. After visiting a node, if it has a right child, the traversal proceeds to that right child and repeats the process starting with its left subtree. If a node lacks a right child, the traversal backtracks to its parent. This cycle continues until all nodes have been visited.

In terms of code, an in-order traversal can be implemented using a recursive function. This function typically follows three steps: first, it calls itself for the left child of the current node; second, it visits the current node; and third, it calls itself for the right child of the current node. This structure guarantees that all nodes are visited in the appropriate order.

In-order traversal is particularly advantageous in binary search trees because it allows for the nodes to be accessed in ascending order. This is a direct consequence of the properties of binary search trees, where for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree are less than the node itself, and all nodes in its right subtree are greater. Consequently, an in-order traversal can be employed to retrieve all the elements from a binary search tree in sorted order.
