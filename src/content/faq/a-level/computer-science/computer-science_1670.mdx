FTP and HTTP are distinct protocols utilized for data transfer over the internet, each with unique functionalities and applications.

**FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol designed for transferring files between a client and a server within a computer network. Developed in the 1970s, FTP facilitates file sharing between users and servers and remains widely used for uploading and downloading files. It operates using two separate connections: the control connection and the data connection. The control connection is responsible for transmitting control information, such as user credentials (username and password) and commands to the server, while the data connection is dedicated to the actual file transfers.

In contrast, **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol employed for transmitting hypertext over the internet. Hypertext refers to structured text that incorporates logical links, or hyperlinks, between nodes containing textual information. HTTP serves as the foundation for all data exchange on the World Wide Web and is primarily used for transmitting web pages. Unlike FTP, HTTP utilizes a single connection for data transfer and is stateless, meaning it does not maintain any record of previous interactions.

The primary distinction between FTP and HTTP lies in their intended purpose. FTP is tailored for efficient file transfers, whereas HTTP is focused on transmitting hypertext and other information necessary for displaying web pages. Specifically, FTP requires two connections to facilitate data transfer and maintains state between transactions, while HTTP operates over a single connection and does not retain any state.

Another significant difference pertains to their data handling methods. FTP transmits data in binary format, making it suitable for a wide range of file types, including text, images, videos, and software. Conversely, HTTP typically transfers data in the form of plain text, HTML, XML, or JSON, which are primarily used for web content.

When it comes to security, FTP is generally less secure than HTTP. FTP transmits data, including passwords, in plain text, which can be easily intercepted and read by anyone with access to the network. In contrast, HTTP can be secured through HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which employs SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt data during transmission, enhancing the security of web communications.
