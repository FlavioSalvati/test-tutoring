The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the fundamental protocol used for transmitting and receiving data across the internet, particularly for web pages.

HTTP is a standardized set of rules designed for transferring various types of files—including text, graphic images, audio, video, and other multimedia—over the World Wide Web. As an application layer protocol, HTTP operates on top of the TCP/IP suite, facilitating the transmission of hypertext and enabling the linking and browsing of web pages.

When you enter a URL in your web browser, it sends an HTTP command to the web server, instructing it to retrieve and transmit the requested web page. Another key standard that governs the functioning of the World Wide Web is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which dictates the formatting and presentation of web pages.

One important characteristic of HTTP is that it is a stateless protocol. This means that each command is processed independently, without retaining any information about previous commands. This statelessness presents challenges for developing websites that can respond intelligently to user interactions. To address this limitation, various technologies such as ActiveX, Java, JavaScript, and cookies have been developed.

HTTP functions as a request-response protocol within the client-server computing model. In this model, a web browser acts as the client, while an application running on a server hosts the website. The client initiates communication by sending an HTTP request message to the server. In turn, the server, which provides resources like HTML files and other content or performs specific actions on behalf of the client, sends a response message back to the client. This response includes information about the status of the request and may contain the requested content within its message body.

In summary, HTTP serves as a crucial protocol for retrieving resources, such as HTML documents, and forms the foundation for data exchange on the web. It enables the transmission of hypertext over the internet, facilitating the seamless linking and browsing of web pages.
