A higher-order function is defined as a function that can either accept other functions as arguments or return functions as its results.

Higher-order functions play a crucial role in functional programming, which is a programming paradigm that treats functions as first-class citizens. This concept means that functions can be handled just like any other data type, such as numbers or strings. By extending this idea, higher-order functions allow us to use functions as inputs to other functions or to produce new functions as outputs.

This capability significantly expands the possibilities in programming. For instance, we can design functions that alter the behavior of other functions, or generate new functions based on specific criteria. As a result, this leads to code that is more concise, readable, and maintainable.

One prevalent application of higher-order functions is in data transformations. For example, the `map` function found in many programming languages is a higher-order function that applies a specified function to each element of a list, ultimately returning a new list containing the results. This enables us to perform intricate data transformations with just a single line of code.

Another significant application of higher-order functions is in constructing control structures. For instance, we can create a function that accepts another function as an argument and applies it a specified number of times. This abstraction of control structure details enhances the modularity of our code, making it easier to understand.

In summary, higher-order functions are a powerful feature of functional programming. They empower us to write more expressive, concise, and maintainable code, while also facilitating the implementation of complex behaviors with remarkable ease.
