A Fenwick tree, commonly referred to as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure designed to efficiently manage cumulative frequency tables.

This structure, introduced by Peter M. Fenwick in 1994, serves as a binary tree representation that is particularly effective for solving range queries and update problems in computer science. The Fenwick tree utilizes an array to represent the binary tree, with each node corresponding to a specific interval of the input data. It is especially beneficial in scenarios where frequent updates to elements and calculations of prefix sums are required.

The Fenwick tree operates on the principle of binary indexing, which is the reason for its alternative name, the Binary Indexed Tree. Each node in the Fenwick tree stores the sum of a range of values from the original array. The range associated with each node is determined by the binary representation of its index. Specifically, the least significant bit (LSB) in the binary representation of an index defines the range of values that index is responsible for.

The Fenwick tree supports two primary operations: updating and calculating prefix sums. The update operation involves adding a specified value to an element in the array, which in turn updates all relevant nodes within the Fenwick tree. Conversely, the prefix sum operation computes the sum of all elements up to a given index in the array. Both operations can be executed in $O(\log n)$ time, representing a significant improvement over the naive $O(n)$ time complexity associated with a standard array or the $O(n \log n)$ time complexity of a balanced binary search tree.

The applications of the Fenwick tree are extensive. It is frequently employed in computational geometry to count points within a specified range, in data compression for computing cumulative frequency tables, in competitive programming for addressing range update and range query challenges, and in machine learning for calculating cumulative distribution functions. Furthermore, it has relevance in the implementation of various algorithms, such as the Schensted algorithm used for finding the longest increasing subsequence. The Fenwick tree's ability to perform both updates and queries in logarithmic time makes it an exceptionally powerful tool across these diverse applications.
