In functional programming, the 'filter' and 'find' functions are essential tools for manipulating lists based on specific conditions.

The 'filter' function is a higher-order function that processes a list of data according to a provided condition. It takes two arguments: a predicate function and a list. The predicate function is applied to each element of the list. If the predicate returns true for an element, that element is included in the resulting list; otherwise, it is excluded. Importantly, the 'filter' function generates a new list without modifying the original list, adhering to the principles of functional programming, where data is treated as immutable and functions do not have side effects.

For example, consider a list of numbers and a predicate function that checks whether a number is even. When you apply the 'filter' function with this predicate to the list, it produces a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.

Conversely, the 'find' function is used to locate the first element in a list that meets a specified condition. Similar to the 'filter' function, it takes a predicate function and a list as its arguments. The predicate is applied to each element in order, and the 'find' function returns the first element for which the predicate evaluates to true. If no such element exists, the 'find' function typically returns a special value, such as null or undefined.

For instance, if you have a list of numbers and a predicate function that checks whether a number is greater than $10$, the 'find' function will return the first number in the list that exceeds $10$. If no numbers in the list are greater than $10$, the function will return null or undefined.

In summary, the 'filter' and 'find' functions are powerful tools in functional programming that enable you to manipulate lists based on specific conditions. They exemplify the principles of functional programming by being stateless and producing no side effects.
