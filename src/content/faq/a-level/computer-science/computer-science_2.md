The hexadecimal equivalent of the binary number $10110101$ is $B5$.

To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, we begin by grouping the binary digits into sets of four, starting from the right. If the total number of binary digits is not a multiple of four, we can prepend extra zeros to the left. In this case, the binary number $10110101$ can be grouped into two sets: $1011$ and $0101$.

Next, we convert each group of four binary digits into its decimal equivalent. The binary group $1011$ corresponds to the decimal number $11$, while the binary group $0101$ corresponds to the decimal number $5$.

Finally, we convert each decimal number into its hexadecimal representation. The decimal number $11$ is represented as the hexadecimal digit $B$, and the decimal number $5$ is represented as the hexadecimal digit $5$. Thus, the hexadecimal equivalent of the binary number $10110101$ is $B5$.

This conversion method is effective because both binary and hexadecimal are positional numeral systems. Hexadecimal is particularly useful for representing binary data, as each hexadecimal digit corresponds precisely to four binary digits. This characteristic simplifies the reading and writing of binary data, especially when dealing with large numbers.

When converting from binary to hexadecimal, it is crucial to group the binary digits correctly and to ensure accurate conversion of each group. Any errors in these steps can lead to an incorrect final result. Therefore, take your time to double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
