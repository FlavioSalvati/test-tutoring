An algorithm in computer programming is a sequence of step-by-step instructions designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task.

More precisely, an algorithm is a well-defined procedure that enables a computer to address a problem effectively. One of the most vital characteristics of an algorithm is that it has a clear termination point; once the algorithm has successfully solved the problem, it will conclude its execution. Additionally, an algorithm can be executed within a finite amount of time and space, and it is typically articulated in a formal language that is designed for calculating a function.

Algorithms form the core of computer programming, providing systematic and logical methods for problem-solving. They can range from simple processes, such as a recipe for baking a cake, to complex systems, like the algorithms that power Googleâ€™s search engine. Before a programmer implements these algorithms in a specific programming language, they can be outlined using pseudocode or flowcharts.

The efficiency of an algorithm can be evaluated based on two key metrics: time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity assesses the computational resources required by an algorithm in terms of the time taken to execute, as a function of the size of the input. On the other hand, space complexity measures the amount of memory that an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input.

Algorithms are indispensable for the operation of all types of software, from video games to web browsers, and they represent a foundational aspect of computer science. Mastering the creation and analysis of algorithms is an essential skill for any aspiring computer programmer.
