In a computer system, logarithmic numbers are represented as floating-point numbers.

To elaborate, logarithmic numbers are typically encoded using floating-point representation, which allows for the approximation of real numbers within the constraints of finite precision available in computers. This representation strikes a balance between range and precision, enabling the representation of very large numbers, very small numbers, and everything in between with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

The floating-point format is fundamentally based on scientific notation, a method for expressing numbers that accommodates values too large or too small to be conveniently written in standard decimal form. In scientific notation, numbers are expressed as a product of a base and an exponent. For instance, the number $300$ can be represented as $3 \times 10^2$ in scientific notation.

Similarly, in a computer system, a floating-point number consists of a base number (also referred to as the mantissa or significand) and an exponent. The base number is typically a fractional binary value, while the exponent is an integer. Both components are stored in binary format. The actual value represented is computed as the base number multiplied by $2$ raised to the power of the exponent.

When it comes to logarithmic numbers, they are effectively represented as floating-point numbers. The logarithm of a number is defined as the exponent to which a specified base must be raised to obtain that number. For example, to represent the logarithm base $2$ of $8$, which equals $3$, we would encode this as a floating-point number within the computer system.

In programming, many languages offer built-in functions to compute logarithms. For instance, in Python, the `math.log()` function can be used to calculate the natural logarithm of a number, and you can specify a second argument to find the logarithm with respect to a different base. The output of these functions is a floating-point number, which is how logarithmic values are represented in a computer system.
