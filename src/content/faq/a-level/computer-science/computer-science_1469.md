A directed graph features edges with a specific orientation, whereas an undirected graph consists of edges without any inherent direction.

In a directed graph, commonly referred to as a digraph, each edge is characterized by its orientation, meaning that it is represented as an ordered pair of vertices. The sequence of the vertices is significant; for instance, if there is an edge from vertex $A$ to vertex $B$, this does not imply the existence of an edge from vertex $B$ to vertex $A$. This property makes directed graphs particularly effective for modeling asymmetric relationships, such as "is the parent of" or "is the supervisor of."

Conversely, an undirected graph comprises edges that lack directional attributes. In this scenario, each edge is represented as an unordered pair of vertices, indicating that the order does not matter. Therefore, if there is an edge between vertex $A$ and vertex $B$, it automatically implies that there is also an edge from vertex $B$ to vertex $A$. This quality makes undirected graphs ideal for depicting symmetric relationships, such as "is a friend of" or "is connected to."

The decision to use either a directed or undirected graph hinges on the nature of the relationships being represented. For symmetric relationships, an undirected graph is more suitable, while for asymmetric relationships, a directed graph is preferable.

Visually, directed graphs are typically illustrated with arrows that indicate the direction of the edges, while undirected graphs are represented by simple lines connecting the vertices. Mathematically, directed graphs can be represented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists, where the order of vertices is crucial. In contrast, undirected graphs are represented by symmetric adjacency matrices or adjacency lists, where the order of vertices is irrelevant.

In summary, the primary distinction between directed and undirected graphs lies in the presence or absence of direction in their edges. This fundamental difference influences how relationships between vertices are depicted and interpreted.
