In functional programming, you can implement a binary search on a sorted list using recursion.

A binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm widely used in computer science to locate a specific element within a sorted list. The algorithm operates by repeatedly dividing the list into halves until the desired element is found. In the context of functional programming, this approach can be elegantly realized through recursion, where a function calls itself until it reaches a base case.

To perform a binary search in functional programming, you would start by defining a function that accepts a sorted list and a target value as parameters. The first step within the function is to check if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns a message indicating that the target value is not present in the list; this serves as the base case for the recursion.

If the list contains elements, the function identifies the middle element. If the middle element equals the target value, the function returns the index of that middle element. If the middle element is greater than the target value, the function recursively calls itself with the first half of the list as the new parameter. Conversely, if the middle element is less than the target value, the function calls itself with the second half of the list.

This recursive process continues until the target value is found or the list becomes empty, at which point the function returns the appropriate message. The recursive nature of this approach allows the binary search algorithm to efficiently narrow down the search space, making it a powerful method for locating specific elements in a sorted list.

It's important to remember that in functional programming, functions are pure and free of side effects. This means that the original list remains unmodified throughout the search process. Instead, new lists are created for each recursive call. This characteristic is fundamental to functional programming and distinguishes it from other programming paradigms, such as imperative programming, where the original data may be altered.
