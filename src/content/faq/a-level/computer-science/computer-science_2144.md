Fiber-optic cables transmit data as pulses of light through strands of glass or plastic.

Fiber-optic cables are a sophisticated technology that revolutionised the way we transmit data. They work on the principle of total internal reflection, where light signals are transmitted through a core of glass or plastic. The core is surrounded by a layer called the cladding, which has a lower refractive index. This difference in refractive index ensures that the light signals are reflected back into the core, allowing them to travel long distances without significant loss.

The data transmission process begins with the conversion of electronic signals into light signals. This is achieved using a transmitter, which generates the light pulses. These pulses are then sent down the fiber-optic cable. As the light travels along the cable, it bounces off the walls of the cable, a process known as total internal reflection. This allows the light to travel great distances with minimal loss of signal.

At the receiving end, an optical receiver converts the light signals back into electronic signals that can be understood by electronic devices. The receiver uses a photodetector to detect the light pulses and convert them into an electrical signal. This signal is then processed and interpreted as data.

The speed and efficiency of data transmission through fiber-optic cables are unparalleled. They can carry large amounts of data at very high speeds, much faster than traditional copper cables. This is because light travels faster than electricity and can carry more information. Moreover, fiber-optic cables are immune to electromagnetic interference, which can disrupt data transmission in copper cables.

In summary, fiber-optic cables transmit data by converting electronic signals into light signals, sending these signals down the cable through total internal reflection, and then converting them back into electronic signals at the receiving end. This technology has revolutionised data transmission, offering high speeds and large data capacity.
