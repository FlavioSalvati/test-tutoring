System calls serve as the interface between a process and the operating system, enabling the process to request various services.

To elaborate, system calls are a fundamental aspect of an operating system's functionality. They function as a bridge between user applications and low-level system operations. When a user application requires access to a resource or service offered by the operating system, it does so through a system call. This can involve a range of actions, such as reading from or writing to a file, sending or receiving data over a network, or interacting with hardware devices.

System calls are crucial for ensuring both the protection and efficiency of the system. They allow the operating system to maintain control over how and when resources are accessed, thereby preventing processes from interfering with each other and safeguarding the stability of the system. For instance, a process cannot directly access the hard drive to perform read or write operations. Instead, it must issue a system call that requests the operating system to carry out this task. This mechanism enables the operating system to regulate access to the hard drive, ensuring data integrity and avoiding conflicts.

Moreover, system calls provide a standardized interface for developers. Rather than writing code to interact directly with hardware, developers can utilize system calls to request services from the operating system. This abstraction simplifies the development process and facilitates the creation of applications that are portable across various hardware configurations.

In summary, system calls are essential to the functioning of operating systems. They offer a controlled and consistent interface for processes to request services, empowering the operating system to manage resources effectively while maintaining system stability.
