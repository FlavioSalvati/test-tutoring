A primary key serves the essential function of uniquely identifying each record in a database table, whereas a unique constraint is designed to prevent duplicate values within a column or a set of columns.

A primary key is a specific column (or a combination of columns) in a relational database table that is designated to uniquely identify every record. The key characteristics of a primary key include: it must contain a unique value for each row of data, it cannot contain null values, and it must be capable of distinctly identifying each record in the table. Notably, a table can have only one primary key, which may consist of a single column or multiple columns. When multiple columns are combined to form a primary key, this is referred to as a composite key.

In contrast, a unique constraint is a rule applied to a column or a set of columns within a table to ensure that no duplicate values exist. This constraint guarantees that all values in the specified column are distinct. Unlike primary keys, unique constraints can include null values, and a table can have multiple unique constraints. However, similar to primary keys, unique constraints also enforce the uniqueness of the values in a column or set of columns.

The primary distinction between a primary key and a unique constraint lies in their intended purposes and applications. A primary key is utilized to ensure that the data within a specific column is accurate and reliable, thereby uniquely identifying each record in the table. This is a foundational aspect of database design and is vital for various database operations.

On the other hand, a unique constraint is employed to guarantee that all values within a column or set of columns are unique throughout the entire table. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where duplicate entries must be prevented, such as with usernames or email addresses. However, unlike a primary key, a unique constraint does not inherently identify a single row uniquely.

In summary, while both primary keys and unique constraints are mechanisms used to enforce uniqueness in database columns, they fulfill different roles and adhere to different rules. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot contain null values, whereas a unique constraint prevents duplicate values in a column or set of columns and can include null values.
