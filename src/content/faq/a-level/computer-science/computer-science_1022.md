The fundamental features of object-oriented programming (OOP) include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the use of objects and classes. This approach allows developers to organize and structure code in a manner that fosters greater flexibility and efficiency in program development. The four core features of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

**Encapsulation** refers to the practice of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit known as an object. This feature facilitates data hiding, meaning that the object's attributes are concealed from external access and can only be manipulated through the object's methods. This encapsulation mechanism helps prevent unintended data modifications and enhances security.

**Inheritance** enables one class, referred to as the child class, to inherit the properties and methods of another class, known as the parent class. This feature promotes code reuse since the child class can leverage the existing code of the parent class while also introducing its own distinct functionalities. Inheritance also supports hierarchical classification, which mirrors the natural organization of many real-world entities.

**Polymorphism** allows a single interface to be utilized for a general class of actions. In practical terms, this means that the specific method invoked is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. This characteristic provides flexibility, enabling objects of various classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass.

**Abstraction** simplifies complex real-world problems by representing them in a way that focuses solely on relevant details. This is accomplished through the creation of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly but can be subclassed, while an interface consists of a collection of abstract methodsâ€”methods that lack a body.

Together, these four features of OOP create a structured approach to coding that enhances understandability, modifiability, and maintainability. They also facilitate the modeling of intricate real-world problems in a manner that aligns with human cognitive patterns.
