A subnet, or subnetwork, is a smaller network created from a larger network through a process known as subnetting.

Subnetting is a technique used to divide a larger network into two or more smaller networks, each referred to as a subnet. This division serves several purposes: it enhances network performance, improves security, and simplifies management. Subnetting involves splitting an IP address into two main components: the network address and the host address. The network address identifies the overall network, while the host address specifies an individual device (such as a computer or printer) within that network.

The subnetting process begins with an IP address, which serves as a unique identifier for a device on a network. An IP address consists of two parts: the network ID and the host ID. The network ID designates the network as a whole, while the host ID identifies a specific device within that network.

Subnetting works by borrowing bits from the host portion of the IP address to create additional network IDs. This is accomplished using a subnet mask, which is a binary pattern that dictates how the IP address is divided. The subnet mask contains the same number of bits as the IP address, and the arrangement of ones and zeros within the mask indicates the boundary between the network and host portions of the IP address.

For instance, consider a network with the IP address $192.168.1.0$ and a subnet mask of $255.255.255.0$. In this case, the first three octets ($192.168.1$) represent the network ID, while the last octet ($0$) serves as the host ID. If you wish to divide this network into two subnets, you can modify the subnet mask to $255.255.255.128$. This change results in two subnets: the first ranging from $192.168.1.0$ to $192.168.1.127$, and the second from $192.168.1.128$ to $192.168.1.255$.

Subnetting is an essential aspect of network management. It facilitates better organization, control, and security of a network. By segmenting a network into smaller subnets, administrators can effectively manage traffic flow, isolate issues, and prevent problems from impacting the entire network.
