In computer systems, imaginary numbers are typically represented as complex numbers, which consist of two components: the real part and the imaginary part.

A complex number can be expressed in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit defined by the equation $i^2 = -1$. In this expression, $a$ represents the real part, while $b$ represents the imaginary part of the complex number.

In programming, complex numbers are generally represented as pairs of floating-point numbers. The first number corresponds to the real part, and the second number corresponds to the imaginary part. For example, the complex number $3 + 4i$ would be represented as the pair of floating-point numbers $(3.0, 4.0)$.

Most programming languages offer support for complex numbers. For instance, in Python, you can create a complex number using the 'complex' function as follows: 

$$
x = \text{complex}(3, 4)
$$

This creates a complex number with a real part of $3$ and an imaginary part of $4$. Additionally, you can use the 'j' notation in Python to create complex numbers like this:

$$
x = 3 + 4j
$$

In C++, you can utilize the 'std::complex' class from the Standard Library to represent complex numbers. You can create a complex number with the following code:

$$
std::complex<double> x(3.0, 4.0)
$$

This statement creates a complex number with a real part of $3.0$ and an imaginary part of $4.0$.

In Java, you can represent complex numbers using the 'Complex' class from the Apache Commons Math library. You can create a complex number with the following code:

$$
Complex x = new Complex(3.0, 4.0)
$$

This statement initializes a complex number with a real part of $3.0$ and an imaginary part of $4.0$.

In all these examples, the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are stored as separate values in the computer's memory. This structure enables the computer to perform operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in a manner similar to operations on real numbers.
