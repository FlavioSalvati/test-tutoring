The selection sort algorithm is a straightforward comparison-based sorting technique that organizes an array by iteratively identifying the minimum element and relocating it to the beginning of the array.

### How Selection Sort Works

The selection sort algorithm operates by partitioning the input array into two sections: a sorted region and an unsorted region. Initially, the sorted region is empty, while the unsorted region contains all the elements. The algorithm continuously selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the desired order) element from the unsorted section and moves it to the end of the sorted section. This process continues until the unsorted region is empty, resulting in all elements being sorted in the correct order.

The algorithm commences by locating the minimum element within the unsorted region of the array and swapping it with the first element of that region. This swap incorporates the newly sorted element into the sorted region, while the remainder of the array remains unsorted. The procedure is repeated for the remaining elements in the unsorted section, with each iteration involving the identification of the minimum element and its exchange with the first element of the unsorted region. This cycle persists until the entire array is sorted.

### Time Complexity

In terms of performance, selection sort is quite efficient for smaller arrays, as it employs a simple linear search to identify the minimum or maximum element. However, its efficiency diminishes significantly with larger datasets, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of elements being sorted. Consequently, selection sort tends to be less efficient than similar algorithms, such as insertion sort, for larger lists.

Despite its simplicity, selection sort is seldom utilized for sorting large arrays in practical applications. More efficient algorithms, such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort, are generally preferred for larger datasets. Nevertheless, selection sort's straightforward nature and ease of implementation make it an excellent choice for educational purposes or for sorting small arrays.

### Summary

In summary, the selection sort algorithm is an uncomplicated, comparison-based sorting method that repeatedly identifies the minimum element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region. While it is easy to understand and implement, its $O(n^2)$ time complexity makes it unsuitable for large datasets in most practical scenarios.
