Cycle sort is an in-place, unstable sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly swapping elements until each one is in its correct position.

The cycle sort algorithm can be visualized as a cyclic graph, where each node represents an element of the array and the edges indicate the desired positions of these elements in sorted order. The algorithm begins by identifying cycles within this graph and moves elements along these cycles until all elements are placed correctly.

To identify a cycle, the algorithm starts with the first element of the array and determines its correct position in the sorted array. If the element is already in the correct position, the algorithm proceeds to the next element. However, if the element is not in the right position, it is swapped with the element that currently occupies its correct position. This process continues until the initial element returns to its correct position, completing one cycle.

Once a cycle is complete, the algorithm moves on to the next unprocessed element in the array to identify the next cycle. This cycle detection and element repositioning continues until all elements have been correctly placed.

A notable feature of cycle sort is its ability to minimize the number of memory writes, making it particularly advantageous in scenarios where write operations are expensive. However, it is important to note that cycle sort is not a stable sorting algorithm; thus, equal elements may not maintain their original relative order in the sorted output.

In terms of time complexity, cycle sort is less efficient than many other sorting algorithms. It has a worst-case and average time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which can make it impractical for large datasets. On the other hand, its space complexity is $O(1)$, indicating that it requires a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input array's size.

In summary, cycle sort is a distinctive sorting algorithm that sorts an array by identifying cycles and repositioning elements accordingly. While it may not be the most efficient algorithm regarding time complexity, its advantages lie in minimizing memory writes and operating with a constant amount of extra space.
