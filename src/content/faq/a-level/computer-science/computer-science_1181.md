The Strand Sort algorithm operates by iteratively extracting sorted sublists from the input and merging them into the output list.

Strand Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by continually identifying and extracting increasing sublists from the input. These sublists are then merged into an initially empty output list. This process continues until the input list is completely processed.

Hereâ€™s a clear step-by-step breakdown of how the algorithm functions:

1. Begin with an empty output list.
2. If the input list is empty, the algorithm terminates. If it is not empty, proceed to the next step.
3. Initialize a new sublist starting with the first element of the input list.
4. Traverse the elements of the input list. If an element is greater than the last element in the sublist, remove it from the input list and append it to the sublist.
5. Merge the sublist into the output list while maintaining sorted order.
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 until the input list is empty.

The essence of Strand Sort lies in the extraction of sorted sublists from the input and the subsequent merging of these sublists into the output list. The extraction process is straightforward: it scans through the input list and selects elements that are in increasing order. The merging process is slightly more intricate; it involves combining two sorted lists into a single sorted list by repeatedly taking the smaller of the first elements from each list and appending it to the output list.

Despite its interesting approach, Strand Sort is not widely used due to its complexity. Its worst-case and average time complexity is $O(n^2)$, which makes it less efficient compared to other sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort, especially for large datasets. However, it may be advantageous in specific scenarios where the data is nearly sorted, as it can perform better under such conditions.
