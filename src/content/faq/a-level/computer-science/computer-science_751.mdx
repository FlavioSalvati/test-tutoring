A ternary search tree (TST) is a specialized type of trie, also known as a prefix tree, designed for the efficient storage and retrieval of strings.

In a TST, each node can have up to three children: a left child, a middle child, and a right child. The left child contains all strings that are lexicographically less than the character represented by the current node, while the right child holds all strings that are greater. The middle child is responsible for storing strings that begin with the character at the current node. 

Each node in a TST contains a single character, and a string is represented by the path from the root to a designated node known as the 'end of string' node. This structure allows a TST to efficiently store multiple strings sharing the same prefix, making it particularly advantageous for applications such as autocomplete, where the goal is to identify all strings that start with a specified prefix.

One of the primary benefits of using a TST compared to other trie types is its reduced memory usage. Unlike a standard trie, which creates a child node for every possible character, a TST only creates child nodes for characters that are actually present in the stored strings. This characteristic enhances space efficiency, particularly when dealing with a large set of potential characters.

Regarding time complexity, searching for a string in a TST typically takes $O(\log n)$ time on average and $O(n)$ time in the worst case, where $n$ is the length of the string. This performance often surpasses that of a binary search tree for various string-related operations.

In summary, a ternary search tree is a powerful data structure that facilitates the efficient storage and retrieval of strings. Its design is especially beneficial for tasks that require the identification of all strings sharing a common prefix, such as in autocomplete functionalities.
