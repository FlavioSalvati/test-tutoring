Compile-time errors and runtime errors are two distinct types of errors that can occur in programming, each occurring at different stages of a program's lifecycle.

**Compile-time Errors**  
Also referred to as syntax errors, compile-time errors are identified by the compiler as it attempts to translate the source code into machine code. These errors arise when the code does not conform to the syntactical rules of the programming language. For instance, if you forget to close a bracket or incorrectly spell a keyword, the compiler will be unable to interpret the code, resulting in a compile-time error. These errors must be resolved before the program can be successfully compiled and executed.

**Runtime Errors**  
In contrast, runtime errors—often called exceptions—occur while the program is running. Unlike compile-time errors, these errors are not detected by the compiler because the syntax of the code is correct. However, they can lead to unexpected program termination due to issues that arise during execution. For example, attempting to divide a number by zero or accessing an array element that is out of bounds will trigger a runtime error. Unlike compile-time errors, runtime errors can sometimes be managed within the program using exception handling mechanisms, allowing the program to continue running even in the presence of an error.

**Summary**  
In summary, the key distinction between compile-time and runtime errors lies in their timing and detection. Compile-time errors are caught by the compiler and must be corrected before the program can run, while runtime errors occur during execution and may be handled by the program itself. Both types of errors are common in programming, and understanding them is essential for effective debugging and error management.
