Address binding during the linking and loading stages is a vital process responsible for converting relative addresses used in a program into absolute addresses in memory.

When a program is written, it utilizes symbolic addresses to reference data and instructions. These symbolic addresses are relative, meaning they do not correspond to actual physical memory locations; instead, they are references based on a certain point within the program. This relative addressing allows the program to be developed without prior knowledge of its eventual memory location.

The primary function of address binding in the linking and loading process is to translate these relative addresses into absolute addresses. This process is aptly named "address binding," as it effectively "binds" the symbolic addresses used in the program to actual physical addresses in memory.

The linker is the first component involved in this process. It takes the object code generated by the compiler, which contains the program's relative addresses, and merges it with any necessary libraries or modules required by the program. Additionally, the linker resolves symbolic references to these libraries or modules, substituting them with appropriate relative addresses.

Following the linker, the loader takes over. The loader is responsible for placing the linked program into memory, preparing it for execution. During this phase, the loader performs address binding by converting the program's relative addresses into absolute addresses. This involves adding the program's starting address in memory to each of the relative addresses.

Address binding is crucial for the correct execution of a program. Without this process, the program would be unable to accurately access its data or instructions, as it would lack knowledge of their memory locations. By converting relative addresses into absolute addresses, address binding ensures that the program can reliably access all the resources it requires for execution.
