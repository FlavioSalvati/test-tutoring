A view in SQL is a virtual table created from the result set of an SQL query, contrasting with a traditional table, which is a structured collection of data.

In SQL, a table serves as the fundamental unit of data storage, organizing information into rows and columns. Each column within a table is designated for a specific type of data, such as numbers, text, or dates. Conversely, each row represents a single, well-defined data entry within that table. Tables are utilized to store logically grouped data and can be manipulated using various SQL operations, including $SELECT$, $INSERT$, $UPDATE$, and $DELETE$.

In contrast, a view is not a physical entity. It acts as a virtual table generated from a query that pulls data from one or more tables. Although a view presents data in the form of rows and columns similar to a table, the data itself is derived from the query rather than stored physically. A view does not occupy physical space in the database; instead, it serves as a reference to the data contained in the underlying tables. Views can simplify SQL operations, provide an additional layer of data abstraction, and restrict access to the underlying table data.

The primary distinction between a view and a table lies in their nature: views are definitions based on existing tables (or other views) and do not store data independently. Consequently, any changes made to the data in the underlying tables are immediately reflected in the corresponding views. In contrast, tables physically store data within the database.

In summary, a table is a structured collection of data stored in a database, while a view is a virtual table that results from a query on one or more tables. Both are essential components of SQL, each fulfilling different roles in data management.
