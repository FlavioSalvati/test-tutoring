Composite attributes in an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) are depicted as oval shapes that are segmented into smaller components.

In an ERD, attributes represent the properties or characteristics of entities and are illustrated using oval shapes. When an attribute is classified as composite, it indicates that the attribute can be subdivided into smaller components, each representing a more fundamental attribute with its distinct meaning. For instance, the attribute 'Address' is a composite attribute since it can be broken down into 'Street', 'City', 'Postcode', and 'Country'.

To illustrate a composite attribute in an ERD, one would begin by drawing an oval for the primary attribute. From this oval, lines extend to additional ovals that represent each of the sub-components. Each of these sub-component ovals should be clearly labeled with the name of the sub-attribute. This visual representation effectively communicates that the primary attribute consists of these smaller, meaningful parts.

It is worth noting that while composite attributes can provide valuable insights in an ERD, they are not always necessary or beneficial. They are particularly useful when it is essential to demonstrate that an attribute is composed of several distinct components, each of which holds significance on its own. Conversely, if the sub-components of an attribute lack independent meaning or are not intended for separate use, it may be simpler and clearer to represent the attribute as a single, non-composite attribute.
