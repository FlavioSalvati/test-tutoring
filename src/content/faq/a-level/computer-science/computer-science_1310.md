In Entity Relationship (ER) modeling, a strong entity is defined as an entity that can exist independently, without relying on another entity for its identification.

A strong entity is characterized by having its own primary key, which serves as a unique identifier for each instance of that entity. This unique identifier allows each instance of a strong entity to be distinctly defined by its own attributes, rather than depending on relationships with other entities.

For example, in a university database system, the 'Student' entity can be considered a strong entity. Each student is uniquely identifiable by their student ID, which functions independently of any other entities. In this case, the student ID acts as the primary key for the 'Student' entity, enabling it to exist independently of relationships with other entities such as 'Course' or 'Lecturer'.

Strong entities are fundamental to the structure of an ER model, forming the primary framework upon which other entities and their relationships are constructed. During the modeling process, strong entities are typically defined first, as they represent the core units of data that the system is designed to manage.

In contrast, weak entities are those that cannot exist independently; they rely on strong entities for their identification. Weak entities lack a primary key of their own and instead use a foreign key, which references the primary key of the associated strong entity. For instance, in the university database system, 'Course Registration' could be classified as a weak entity because it depends on the 'Student' entity (a strong entity) for its existence.

In summary, a strong entity in ER modeling is an independent entity that possesses its own unique identifier, known as a primary key. It constitutes the essential structure of the ER model and can exist without dependency on other entities.
