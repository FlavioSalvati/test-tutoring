A ball tree is a specialized binary tree data structure optimized for efficient nearest neighbor searches in multi-dimensional spaces.

Also referred to as a metric tree, a ball tree organizes data into a binary tree format where each node defines a hyper-sphere (or "ball") that encompasses a subset of the data points. The root node encompasses the entire dataset, while each child node contains a smaller subset of that data. The organization of the data is guided by a heuristic aimed at minimizing the sum of the radii of the child nodes. This hierarchical structure facilitates swift nearest neighbor searches by allowing the algorithm to disregard large portions of the dataset that fall outside the specified search radius.

Building a ball tree involves a recursive process of partitioning the dataset into two subsets. The objective of this partitioning is to minimize the sum of the radii of the two resulting spheres. Typically, this is accomplished by selecting a dimension for the split and identifying a point within that dimension that minimizes the combined radii of the two child nodes. The resulting spheres act as nodes within the tree, where the parent node contains all data points from both child nodes.

Ball trees find their primary application in nearest neighbor searches across multi-dimensional spaces, which are prevalent in various fields of computer science, such as computer vision, machine learning, and data mining. For instance, in computer vision, these searches can facilitate the matching of features between images. In the realm of machine learning, ball trees can assist in locating similar examples within a training dataset.

One of the significant advantages of employing a ball tree for nearest neighbor searches is its ability to significantly reduce the number of distance calculations required. The tree structure enables the algorithm to rapidly eliminate substantial portions of the dataset that do not fall within the search radius. Consequently, ball trees present an efficient solution for nearest neighbor searches, particularly in high-dimensional spaces, where brute-force approaches can be exceedingly time-consuming.
