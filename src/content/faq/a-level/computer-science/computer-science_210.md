In Entity Relationship (ER) modeling, a strong entity is defined as an entity that can exist independently, without relying on another entity for its identification. 

A strong entity possesses its own primary key, which serves as a unique identifier distinguishing each instance of that entity. This independence means that each instance of a strong entity is characterized by its own attributes rather than by its relationships with other entities.

For instance, in a university database system, the 'Student' entity exemplifies a strong entity. Each student can be uniquely identified by their student ID, which functions as the primary key for the 'Student' entity. This allows the 'Student' entity to exist within the database independently of other entities, such as 'Course' or 'Lecturer'.

Strong entities form the backbone of an ER model, providing the primary structure upon which other entities and relationships are built. They are typically the initial entities defined during the modeling process, as they represent the essential units of data that the system will manage.

In contrast, weak entities cannot exist independently; they rely on strong entities for their identification. Weak entities lack a primary key of their own and instead utilize a foreign key, which references the primary key of the associated strong entity. For example, in the university database system, 'Course Registration' could be classified as a weak entity since it depends on the 'Student' entity (a strong entity) for its existence.

In summary, a strong entity in ER modeling is an independent entity characterized by its unique identifier, or primary key. It constitutes the fundamental structure of the ER model and can thrive without dependency on other entities.
