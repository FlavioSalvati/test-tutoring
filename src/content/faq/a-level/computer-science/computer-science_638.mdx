Real numbers in binary are represented using a method known as floating-point representation.

In the field of computer science, real numbers are commonly expressed according to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. This standard encodes real numbers in binary format through three main components: the sign bit, the exponent, and the mantissa (also referred to as the significand).

The sign bit is a single binary digit that indicates whether the number is positive or negative. A value of '0' signifies a positive number, while a '1' denotes a negative number.

The exponent component indicates the magnitude of the number. It is represented as a binary number that specifies the power to which $2$ should be raised. In the IEEE 754 standard, the exponent is biased, meaning a fixed value (for single-precision floating-point numbers, this bias is $127$) is subtracted from the actual exponent to obtain the stored exponent. This biasing technique facilitates the representation of both very large and very small numbers.

The mantissa captures the precision bits of the number. It is a binary fraction that represents the significant digits of the number. In normalized numbers, the mantissa is interpreted as a binary fraction within the range $[1.0, 2.0)$, or $[0.0, 1.0)$ depending on the specific standard in use. Typically, the leading '1' to the left of the binary point is not stored explicitly, as it is understood to be implicit in normalized representations.

For instance, consider the number $-12.375$. In binary, this number would be represented as follows: the sign bit would be '1' (indicating that the number is negative), the exponent would be '10000010' (which corresponds to $130$ in decimal, or $3$ after subtracting the bias of $127$), and the mantissa would be '10001100000000000000000' (which represents the fraction $1.5$).

This floating-point system allows for the representation of a broad range of real numbers, including both very large and very small values, while maintaining a high degree of precision. However, it also has its limitations, such as the inability to represent certain numbers exactly due to the finite precision of the mantissa, as well as the potential for rounding errors.
