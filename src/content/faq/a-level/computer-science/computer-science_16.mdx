A floating-point number in the IEEE 754 format is comprised of three key components: the sign, the exponent, and the mantissa.

The IEEE 754 standard, established in 1985 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), serves as a technical guideline for floating-point computations. It delineates how floating-point numbers are represented and how they behave mathematically. These numbers are essential in computer systems for representing real numbers.

1. **Sign**: The first component is the sign bit, which consists of a single bit indicating whether the number is positive or negative. A sign bit of $0$ indicates a positive number, while a sign bit of $1$ denotes a negative number.

2. **Exponent**: The second component is the exponent, which is represented as an $8$-bit field for single-precision numbers (or an $11$-bit field for double-precision). The exponent is biased, meaning that a specific value is added to the actual exponent to derive the stored exponent. For single-precision numbers, the bias is $127$, whereas for double-precision numbers, the bias is $1023$. This bias enables the representation of a wide range of values, accommodating both very small and very large numbers.

3. **Mantissa**: The third component is the mantissa, also known as the significand. For single-precision, the mantissa consists of $23$ bits, and for double-precision, it comprises $52$ bits. The mantissa captures the precision bits of the number and is interpreted as a binary fraction within the range $[1.0, 2.0)$ for normalized numbers or $[0.0, 1.0)$ for denormalized numbers.

To determine the value of a floating-point number, the following formula is used:

$$
\text{Value} = (-1)^{\text{sign}} \times 2^{(\text{exponent} - \text{bias})} \times 1.\text{mantissa}
$$

In this expression, the term $1.$ preceding the mantissa is implicit for normalized numbers, meaning it is assumed to be present but is not stored in the representation.

In conclusion, the IEEE 754 format provides a standardized method for representing a vast array of real numbers, ensuring accurate and consistent computations across various computer systems. Understanding this format is crucial, as it is widely utilized in computer science and related disciplines.
