A max heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that is implemented using a binary tree structure while maintaining the heap property during both insertions and deletions.

In a max heap, for any given node $I$, the value of $I$ is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This property must hold true throughout the entire tree. Typically, the heap is represented as an array, where each element corresponds to a node in the tree, and the parent-child relationships are determined by their indices.

To implement a max heap, you begin by defining the binary tree structure. Each node in this tree has a value and can have two child nodes. The root node, which has no parent, contains the maximum value in the heap. Each child node has a value that is less than or equal to that of its parent node. This structure can be efficiently stored in an array, where for any index $i$, the left child can be found at index $2i + 1$ and the right child at index $2i + 2$.

When inserting a new element into the max heap, you add it at the end of the array (representing the bottom of the tree) and then "bubble up" if necessary to maintain the heap property. This process involves comparing the newly inserted element with its parent and swapping them if the inserted element is larger. This comparison and potential swapping continue until the element is either in a position where it is less than or equal to its parent, or it becomes the root of the tree.

Deletion in a max heap typically refers to the removal of the root node, as this node contains the maximum value. After the root is removed, the heap property may be violated. To restore this property, the last element in the array is moved to the root, and then the "bubble down" process is applied. This involves swapping the element at the root with its largest child until it is larger than both of its children.

In summary, implementing a max heap involves creating a binary tree structure, usually represented as an array, and ensuring the heap property is maintained during insertions and deletions. This is accomplished through the "bubble up" and "bubble down" processes, which guarantee that each parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes.
