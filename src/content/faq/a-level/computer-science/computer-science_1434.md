To convert a decimal number to its octal equivalent, you need to divide the decimal number by $8$, recording both the quotient and the remainder at each step.

The conversion process entails a series of divisions by $8$, where the remainder obtained at each step corresponds to an octal digit. This procedure continues until the quotient reaches zero. The final octal number is constructed by reading the remainders in reverse order, from the last remainder obtained to the first.

Letâ€™s illustrate this process with an example: converting the decimal number $125$ to octal. Here are the detailed steps:

1. Divide $125$ by $8$. The quotient is $15$ and the remainder is $5$.
2. Next, divide the quotient ($15$) by $8$. The new quotient is $1$ and the remainder is $7$.
3. Finally, divide the new quotient ($1$) by $8$. The final quotient is $0$ and the remainder is $1$.

Now, if we read the remainders in reverse order, we obtain $175$. Thus, the octal equivalent of the decimal number $125$ is $175$.

It's important to note that this method is applicable to any decimal number, regardless of its size. However, for very large numbers, the process can be quite lengthy. In such instances, it may be more efficient to use a calculator or a computer program that can automate the conversion.

Additionally, octal numbers are typically represented with a leading '0' to differentiate them from decimal numbers. Therefore, the octal equivalent of $125$ can be written as $0175$.

In summary, converting a decimal number to octal involves repeated division by $8$, while recording the remainder at each step. The final octal number is formed by reading the remainders in reverse order.
