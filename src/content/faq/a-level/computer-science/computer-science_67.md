You can implement a stack using an array by utilizing the push and pop operations to add and remove elements, respectively.

A stack is a linear data structure that operates in a specific order, which can be defined as either LIFO (Last In, First Out) or FILO (First In, Last Out). The following four basic operations are typically performed on a stack:

1. **Push**: This operation adds an element to the stack. A pointer, referred to as 'TOP', is employed to keep track of the top element in the stack.
2. **Pop**: This operation removes an element from the stack. Elements are removed from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek (or Top)**: This operation returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: This function checks if the stack is empty, returning 'true' if it is and 'false' otherwise.

To implement a stack using an array, you must first initialize an array of a specified size. This size represents the maximum capacity of your stack. Additionally, you will need a variable, which we will refer to as 'top', to track the index of the topmost element in the stack. Initially, this variable is set to $-1$, indicating that the stack is empty.

When you want to add (push) an element to the stack, you should first verify whether the stack is full. This is done by checking if 'top' is equal to the maximum size of the array minus one. If the stack is not full, increment 'top' by $1$ and assign the new element to the array at the index specified by 'top'.

To remove (pop) an element from the stack, first check if the stack is empty by determining if 'top' is equal to $-1$. If the stack is not empty, simply decrement 'top' by $1$ to remove the top element.

To retrieve the top element of the stack (peek), return the element located at the index specified by 'top'.

To determine if the stack is empty, check if 'top' is equal to $-1$. If it is, this means the stack is empty; otherwise, the stack contains elements.

This approach provides a straightforward and efficient way to implement a stack data structure using an array.
