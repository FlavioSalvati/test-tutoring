The DELETE command in SQL is utilized to remove one or more records from a table.

As a Data Manipulation Language (DML) operation, the DELETE command marks the removal of existing records from a table within a relational database management system. It is a potent command that requires careful consideration, as once data is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

The basic syntax for the DELETE command is as follows:

$$
\text{DELETE FROM table\_name WHERE condition}
$$

In this syntax, 'table_name' refers to the name of the table from which you want to delete data, while the 'condition' specifies which records should be removed. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

For instance, if you have a table named 'Students' and wish to delete the record of a student with an ID of $123$, you would execute the following command:

$$
\text{DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 123}
$$

This command will eliminate the student record where 'StudentID' equals $123$.

It's crucial to understand that the DELETE command only removes the data from the table, not the table itself. If your intention is to delete the entire table structure along with its data, you should use the DROP TABLE command.

Moreover, the DELETE command can be executed in conjunction with JOINs and subqueries. For example, you can delete records from one table based on the records in another table. This capability is particularly beneficial for maintaining data integrity across multiple tables.

Lastly, take note that the DELETE command operates transactionally. This means you can roll back the deletion if you realize a mistake has been made; however, this is only feasible if you have not yet committed the transaction. Once you commit the transaction, the deleted data is permanently lost. Therefore, always ensure you are confident about your deletion actions before executing the DELETE command.
