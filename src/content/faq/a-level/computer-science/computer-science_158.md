HTTPS is essential for secure web communication, as it encrypts the data exchanged between a user's browser and the website's server.

HTTPS, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is a protocol that facilitates secure communication over computer networks. It is essentially the secure version of HTTP, the protocol used to transmit data between your browser and the website you are accessing. The 'S' in HTTPS signifies 'Secure', indicating that all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.

The encryption mechanism utilized in HTTPS is provided by Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which are often collectively referred to as 'SSL'. When a user connects to a website through HTTPS, the website establishes a secure session using a digital SSL certificate. You can identify a secure connection by looking for URLs that begin with 'https://' rather than 'http://'.

The primary purpose of using HTTPS is to protect sensitive information transmitted over the Internet, ensuring that only the intended recipient can access it. This is particularly crucial because the data you send travels through various computers before reaching the destination server. If the information is not encrypted with an SSL certificate, any intermediary computer could potentially intercept sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.

When an SSL certificate is in effect, the transmitted information becomes unreadable to anyone other than the designated server. This encryption safeguards your data from potential hackers and identity thieves. Furthermore, a valid SSL certificate offers authentication, ensuring that you are communicating with the legitimate server and not an imposter attempting to steal your information.

In summary, HTTPS secures web communication by employing SSL to encrypt the data transferred between the user and the server. This encryption protects sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers from potential eavesdroppers while also verifying the authenticity of the website server.
