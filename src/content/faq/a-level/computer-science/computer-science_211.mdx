The UNION operation in SQL serves the purpose of combining the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single cohesive result set.

In SQL, the UNION operator is employed to merge the result sets of two or more SELECT statements, while automatically eliminating duplicate rows from the results. Each SELECT statement included in the UNION must have an identical number of columns, and these columns must also share compatible data types. Furthermore, the columns in each SELECT statement must be arranged in the same order.

The primary objective of the UNION operator is to efficiently amalgamate data from multiple tables into a unified view. This functionality is particularly beneficial when you need to extract related data from several tables for analysis. For instance, if you maintain a database of books and wish to compile a list of all authors and publishers, you could utilize a UNION operation to combine the author names from the `authors` table with the publisher names from the `publishers` table.

It is crucial to understand that the UNION operator selects only distinct values. If your goal is to retrieve all values, including duplicates, you would use UNION ALL instead. This distinction between UNION and UNION ALL is significant and should be carefully considered based on your data requirements.

In conclusion, the UNION operation in SQL is a powerful tool for merging and analyzing data across multiple tables. It facilitates the creation of comprehensive and diverse datasets, thereby enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from your database.
