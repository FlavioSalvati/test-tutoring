To implement a circular queue using a linked list, you will create a linked list with a fixed size and maintain two pointers: 'front' and 'rear'.

A circular queue, also referred to as a ring buffer, is a linear data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is termed "circular" because the last element points back to the first element, thereby forming a circular link. To construct this structure with a linked list, you will need to initialize a linked list with a fixed size and use two pointers: the 'front' pointer, which points to the first element in the queue, and the 'rear' pointer, which points to the last element.

Initially, both the 'front' and 'rear' pointers should be set to 'null'. When you want to add an element to the queue (a process known as the enqueue operation), you will first check if the queue is full. If it is not full, create a new node containing the data and add it to the rear of the queue. Subsequently, update the 'rear' pointer to reference this new node. If the queue was previously empty, you should also update the 'front' pointer to point to this new node. In the case that the queue is full, you must either throw an overflow error or overwrite the oldest data.

When removing an element from the queue (a process known as the dequeue operation), check whether the queue is empty. If it is not empty, remove the node that the 'front' pointer is currently pointing to, and then update the 'front' pointer to refer to the next node in the sequence. If this node was the last element in the queue, you should also set the 'rear' pointer to 'null'. In the event that the queue is empty, an underflow error should be raised.

To determine whether the queue is full or empty, you can either keep track of the number of elements within the queue or utilize the 'front' and 'rear' pointers. Specifically, if the 'front' pointer is 'null', the queue is empty. Conversely, if the next element of the 'rear' pointer is the 'front' pointer, then the queue is considered full.

In summary, effectively managing the 'front' and 'rear' pointers is crucial when implementing a circular queue using a linked list. By adhering to these guidelines, you can efficiently add and remove elements from the queue.
