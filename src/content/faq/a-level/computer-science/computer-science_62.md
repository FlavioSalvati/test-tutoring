You can implement a queue using two stacks by managing the flow of elements between them. 

A queue is a data structure that operates on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added is the first one to be removed. In contrast, a stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed. To achieve the FIFO behavior of a queue using two stacks, we need to manipulate these stacks in a specific manner.

Let's designate the two stacks as 'inputStack' and 'outputStack'. When we want to add (enqueue) an element to the queue, we simply push it onto the 'inputStack'. This operation has a time complexity of $O(1)$, indicating that it is a constant time operation, regardless of the number of elements currently in the stack.

To remove (dequeue) an element from the queue, we pop an element from the 'outputStack'. If the 'outputStack' is empty at the time of the dequeue operation, we transfer all elements from the 'inputStack' to the 'outputStack', pushing them one by one. This process reverses the order of the elements, ensuring that the last element added to the 'inputStack' (which should be the first to come out in a queue) becomes the top element in the 'outputStack'. Consequently, we can pop it off while adhering to the FIFO principle. The time complexity of this dequeue operation is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the 'inputStack'.

It is crucial to note that the $O(n)$ time complexity for the dequeue operation occurs only when the 'outputStack' is empty. If the 'outputStack' contains elements, the dequeue operation executes in $O(1)$ time. Therefore, when considering the average time complexity across all operations, the amortized time complexity for both enqueue and dequeue operations is $O(1)$, making this implementation quite efficient.

In summary, by utilizing two stacks—one for enqueuing and the other for dequeuing—we can effectively implement a queue that maintains the FIFO principle. This clever manipulation of stacks allows us to efficiently manage the order of elements in the queue.
