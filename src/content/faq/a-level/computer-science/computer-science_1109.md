A B-tree is a self-balancing, sorted tree data structure that efficiently maintains sorted data for operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.

As a specific type of search tree, a B-tree is optimized for use in secondary storage systems like hard disks. Its self-balancing nature allows the tree to automatically adjust itself when new data is added or existing data is removed, which is essential for maintaining efficient performance during these operations.

The structure of a B-tree is characterized by its order, denoted as $m$, which indicates the maximum number of children each node can have. A B-tree of order $m$ possesses the following properties:

1. Each node can have at most $m$ children.
2. Each non-root and non-leaf node must have at least $\lceil m/2 \rceil$ children.
3. The root node must have at least two children if it is not a leaf.
4. All leaf nodes are located at the same level.

B-trees are extensively employed in databases and file systems, primarily because they are designed to minimize disk I/O operations. Each node in a B-tree contains multiple keys and pointers to its child nodes, allowing a substantial amount of data to be stored within a single node. This design significantly reduces the number of disk reads necessary to find a specific key, making B-trees an exceptionally efficient data structure for large-scale databases.

Beyond databases and file systems, B-trees find applications in various other areas of computer science. They are utilized in the implementation of associative arrays and in-memory databases, as well as in certain types of network routers for storing routing tables.

In conclusion, a B-tree is a versatile and efficient data structure applicable across a diverse array of domains. Its self-balancing features ensure that operations can be executed swiftly, while its architecture is particularly advantageous for environments that demand efficient disk I/O operations.
