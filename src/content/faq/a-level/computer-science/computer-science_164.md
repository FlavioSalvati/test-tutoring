Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a protocol designed to safeguard communications between a web browser (the client) and a web server, ensuring secure data transfer over the internet. By employing encryption techniques, SSL guarantees that the data exchanged between the client and the server remains private and intact. This is especially crucial when transmitting sensitive information, such as credit card details or personal data.

The SSL protocol utilizes a system of trusted certificates to establish secure connections. When a client connects to an SSL-enabled server, the server presents a digital certificate to the client. This certificate contains a public key that the client uses to encrypt data prior to sending it to the server. Upon receiving this encrypted data, the server employs its private key to decrypt it. This encryption method is known as asymmetric encryption.

The certificate also includes information about the server's identity, which is verified by a trusted third-party entity known as a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA validates the server's identity, instilling a level of trust in the client. If the server's certificate is deemed untrustworthy, the client's browser will issue a warning message to alert the user.

In addition to encryption, SSL provides both authentication and integrity. Authentication is achieved through the use of certificates, as previously mentioned. Integrity is maintained through a process known as hashing. Before data is transmitted, it undergoes processing to produce a unique hash value. This hash value is sent along with the data. Upon receipt, the data is processed again to generate a new hash value. If the newly computed hash matches the one sent with the data, the recipient can confidently conclude that the data has not been altered during transmission.

In summary, SSL secures data exchanged between a client and a server through a combination of encryption, authentication, and integrity checks. It is an essential component of secure internet communication, protecting sensitive information from being intercepted or tampered with.
