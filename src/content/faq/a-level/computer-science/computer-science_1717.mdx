A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious effort to disrupt the normal operation of a network, service, or server by inundating it with excessive internet traffic, ultimately leading to disruption or unavailability.

More specifically, a DDoS attack involves overwhelming a target with a massive influx of traffic. This is typically executed using a network of compromised computers or devices, often referred to as a botnet, which are infected with malware and controlled by the attacker. By leveraging this botnet, the attacker can generate a substantial volume of traffic aimed at disrupting a particular service.

The primary objective of a DDoS attack is not to gain unauthorized access to systems or steal sensitive data. Instead, it focuses on causing disruption. The targeted service is inundated with requests that far exceed its processing capacity, resulting in significant slowdowns or complete crashes. This effectively denies access to legitimate users.

DDoS attacks can be categorized into several types:

1. **Volume-Based Attacks**: These attacks aim to consume the bandwidth of the targeted site. Common examples include ICMP floods and UDP floods.

2. **Protocol Attacks**: These attacks, such as SYN floods, Ping of Death, and Smurf DDoS, target the actual resources of the server or associated equipment like firewalls.

3. **Application Layer Attacks**: These attacks focus on the layer where web pages are generated and delivered in response to HTTP requests. Examples include GET/POST floods.

Defending against DDoS attacks can be challenging, as it is often difficult to differentiate between legitimate traffic and malicious traffic. Nevertheless, there are several strategies that can be employed to mitigate the effects of such attacks. These strategies include rate limiting, IP address filtering, and overprovisioning bandwidth to accommodate unexpected traffic surges.

In conclusion, a DDoS attack presents a significant threat to online services by overwhelming them with traffic and causing major disruptions. Understanding the mechanics of these attacks is crucial for developing effective defense strategies.
