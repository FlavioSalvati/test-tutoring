Open addressing is a technique utilized in hash tables to resolve collisions by probing, which involves searching for alternative empty slots within the array.

In a hash table, a collision occurs when two or more keys hash to the same index. Open addressing is one of the methods employed to address these collisions. The fundamental concept is that when a collision takes place, the hash table initiates a probing process, searching through the array to locate another empty slot where the value can be stored. This process continues until an available slot is found.

There are various probing strategies, each with its own characteristics. The simplest method is linear probing, where the hash table sequentially checks the next slot in the array, and continues to do so until an empty slot is located. However, this approach can lead to a problem known as primary clustering, where long sequences of filled slots accumulate, thereby increasing the average search time.

To mitigate this issue, quadratic probing can be employed. In this method, instead of simply checking the next slot, the hash table examines slots that are increasingly farther away, with the distance determined by a quadratic function for each subsequent probe. This strategy helps reduce the likelihood of primary clustering but may introduce another issue called secondary clustering, where certain slots become more frequently probed than others.

Another effective strategy is double hashing, which utilizes a second hash function to determine the probe sequence. This approach can help avoid clustering problems but adds complexity and requires additional computation.

In open addressing, the load factor—defined as the ratio of the number of elements to the size of the array—plays a crucial role. As the load factor increases, the probability of collisions and the average search time also rise. Therefore, it is essential to maintain the load factor below a specific threshold and to resize the array when necessary.

In summary, open addressing is a robust technique for managing collisions in hash tables. However, it necessitates careful handling of the load factor and the selection of an appropriate probing strategy to ensure efficient performance.
