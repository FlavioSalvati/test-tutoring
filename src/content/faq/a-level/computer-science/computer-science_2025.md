A linked hash map is a sophisticated data structure that merges the characteristics of a hash table with those of a linked list.

To elaborate, a linked hash map consists of a hash table supplemented by a doubly linked list. This structure maintains a collection of entries, each comprising a key and a value. The entries are organized within the hash table, facilitating rapid retrieval based on their keys. Simultaneously, the entries are connected in the sequence they were added to the map. This linked list establishes the iteration order of the map, which is typically the order of key insertion, known as insertion-order.

The hash table component of a linked hash map delivers constant-time performance for fundamental operations such as retrieval ('get') and insertion ('put'), provided that the hash function effectively distributes the elements across the buckets. Meanwhile, the linked list aspect allows for iteration over the contents of the map in the order they were added. This feature is particularly beneficial in scenarios where elements need to be accessed in a specific sequence, such as in the implementation of a least recently used (LRU) cache.

In a linked hash map, each entry functions as a node within the linked list. When an entry is accessed, it is repositioned to the end of the list. If the map exceeds its designated capacity, the entry at the front of the list (the least recently accessed entry) is removed. This behavior makes linked hash maps an ideal choice for cache implementations.

For instance, in Java, the 'LinkedHashMap' class is part of the Java Collections Framework. It extends the 'HashMap' class and implements the 'Map' interface. This class provides methods for adding and removing entries, as well as for accessing them. Additionally, it offers methods to iterate over the entries either in insertion order or in the order of most recent access.

In summary, a linked hash map is a versatile and efficient data structure that combines the rapid access capabilities of a hash table with the ordered traversal provided by a linked list. It is especially useful in scenarios where maintaining a collection of key-value pairs and accessing them in a specific order is essential.
