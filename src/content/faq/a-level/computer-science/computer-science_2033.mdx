In-order traversal of a binary tree involves visiting nodes in the following sequence: left subtree, root, and then right subtree.

This traversal method is a depth-first algorithm specifically designed for binary trees. It is termed 'in-order' due to its particular order of visitation: first, the left subtree is explored, followed by the root node, and finally, the right subtree. This traversal order is especially beneficial for retrieving data from the tree in sorted order, which is particularly useful in the case of binary search trees.

To execute an in-order traversal, begin at the root node and move towards the leftmost node. After reaching the leftmost node, visit the left subtree of the root. Once the left subtree has been fully traversed, proceed to visit the root node. Finally, visit the right subtree. This process is recursively applied to each subtree until all nodes have been visited.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to performing an in-order traversal:

1. Start at the root node.
2. Navigate to the leftmost node of the tree (or subtree).
3. Recursively visit the left subtree using the in-order function.
4. Visit the root node and process its data.
5. Recursively visit the right subtree using the in-order function.

It's essential to understand that in-order traversal is a depth-first algorithm, which means it explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. This approach contrasts with breadth-first algorithms, which explore all nodes at the current level before moving on to the next level.

Regarding complexity, in-order traversal has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ represents the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited precisely once during the traversal. The space complexity is $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree, as it requires stack space for recursive calls.

In summary, in-order traversal is a fundamental algorithm for binary tree operations, allowing for an efficient method to visit all nodes in a sorted order. It is characterized as a depth-first algorithm with linear time complexity and logarithmic space complexity.
