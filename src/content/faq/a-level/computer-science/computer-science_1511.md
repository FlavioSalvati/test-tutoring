A priority queue can be effectively implemented using a linked list by organizing elements based on their assigned priority.

In a priority queue, each element is assigned a priority upon insertion. The element with the highest priority is always positioned at the front of the queue. If two elements share the same priority, they are processed according to their order of insertion.

To implement a priority queue using a linked list, you begin by defining a node class. This class should encompass two attributes: the data (or value) of the node and the priority associated with that node. The priority is crucial for determining the arrangement of nodes within the queue.

Next, you will create the priority queue class. This class should include a 'head' property, which points to the first node in the linked list, and a 'size' property, which keeps track of the total number of nodes in the list.

The priority queue class will also feature two primary methods: 'enqueue' and 'dequeue'. 

- The 'enqueue' method is responsible for adding a new node to the queue. When a new node is inserted, the method starts at the 'head' of the list and traverses through the nodes until it encounters a node with a lower priority. At that point, the new node is inserted before the lower-priority node. If no such node exists, the new node is appended to the end of the list.

- The 'dequeue' method is used to remove the node with the highest priority from the queue. Given that the list is organized by priority, this node will always be located at the 'head' of the list. The method simply updates the 'head' property to point to the next node in the list, effectively removing the first node from the queue.

Through this approach, a priority queue can be implemented using a linked list. It is important to note that this implementation has a time complexity of $O(n)$ for 'enqueue' operations, as it may require traversing the entire list to find the appropriate insertion point. In contrast, 'dequeue' operations have a time complexity of $O(1)$, as they only involve removing the head node.
