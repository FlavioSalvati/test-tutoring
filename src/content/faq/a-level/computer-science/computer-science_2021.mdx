Bubble sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm used in computer science, characterized by its method of repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are out of order until the entire list is sorted. The algorithm derives its name from the way the largest unsorted element "bubbles" up to its correct position with each iteration.

Due to its average and worst-case time complexities of $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of items being sorted, bubble sort is not well-suited for large datasets.

The sorting process begins at the start of the list, where the algorithm compares the first and second elements. If the first element is larger than the second, the two elements are swapped. The algorithm then proceeds to compare the second and third elements, continuing this process until it reaches the end of the list. At this point, the largest element will have moved to the end of the list, securing its correct position. This entire sequence is referred to as one pass.

After completing a pass, the algorithm restarts from the beginning of the list. However, it no longer needs to examine the last element, which is already in its correct position. Consequently, with each subsequent pass, the number of elements that need to be checked decreases by one.

This process continues until a complete pass is made without any swaps, indicating that the list is now fully sorted. In the best-case scenario, where the list is initially sorted, bubble sort only requires a single pass through the list with no swaps, resulting in a best-case time complexity of $O(n)$.

Despite its simplicity and ease of implementation, bubble sort is not commonly used in practice due to its inefficiency compared to other sorting algorithms. Nonetheless, it serves as an excellent introductory tool for understanding sorting algorithms. Additionally, bubble sort has the benefit of being able to recognize when a list is already sorted, which allows it to potentially complete its operation early in certain situations.
