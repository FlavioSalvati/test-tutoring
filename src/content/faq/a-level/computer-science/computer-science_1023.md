A **while loop** and a **for loop** are both control flow statements used to repeat a block of code, but they serve different purposes based on the context of their use.

### While Loop

A while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified Boolean condition remains true. You can think of a while loop as a repetitive version of an if statement. The code within the loop runs repeatedly until the condition evaluates to false. Consequently, while loops are particularly useful in scenarios where the number of iterations is not predetermined, such as reading lines from a file until the end is reached.

### For Loop

In contrast, a for loop is designed to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It simplifies the process of writing loops that have a defined range of iterations. A for loop consists of three components:

1. **Initialization**: This part is executed once at the beginning of the loop.
2. **Condition**: This condition is checked before each iteration; if it evaluates to false, the loop terminates.
3. **Iteration**: This step occurs at the end of each iteration, usually updating the loop variable.

For loops are ideal for situations where you know the exact number of iterations needed, such as iterating over elements in an array.

### Summary

In summary, while loops and for loops are both instrumental in code repetition, they cater to different scenarios. Use a while loop when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition, whereas a for loop is appropriate when the number of iterations is known in advance. Understanding the distinction between these two types of loops is essential for writing efficient and effective code.
