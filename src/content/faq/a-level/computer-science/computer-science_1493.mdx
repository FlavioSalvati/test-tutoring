A database cursor is a powerful tool used to retrieve rows from a database sequentially, one at a time.

In essence, a database cursor is a control structure that allows for the navigation of records within a database. Cursors are particularly advantageous when processing the results of SQL queries, as they enable manipulation of records on a row-by-row basis rather than as a single set.

Various database systems, including Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, support the creation of cursors. They are especially beneficial when handling large datasets, which would be inefficient to load all at once due to memory constraints. Instead of retrieving all data in one go, cursors fetch data as needed, thereby minimizing memory usage and enhancing operational efficiency.

To create a cursor, it must be linked to a specific SELECT statement, which serves as the query for fetching data. Once the cursor is opened, it points to a particular row within the result set. You can then retrieve rows one at a time, advancing the cursor through the result set. After fetching a row, you can perform necessary operations on that data before proceeding to the next row.

There are several types of cursors, each with distinct characteristics. For instance, a static cursor presents the result set as it appeared when the cursor was opened, remaining unaffected by any changes made to the database afterward. In contrast, a dynamic cursor reflects any modifications made to the database after it has been opened.

Cursors also offer different fetching methods. A forward-only cursor permits movement only in a forward direction through the result set, whereas a scrollable cursor allows movement both forward and backward.

While cursors can be extremely useful, it is important to use them judiciously. They can consume significant resources and operate more slowly compared to set-based operations. As a result, cursors are best employed in scenarios where complex row-by-row operations are necessary and cannot be accomplished with a single SQL statement.
