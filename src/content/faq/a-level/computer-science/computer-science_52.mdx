A stack is a data structure that operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, whereas a queue functions based on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

To delve deeper, a stack is a linear data structure in which elements are added and removed from the same end, referred to as the 'top'. This characteristic means that the most recently added element is the first to be removed, which is the essence of LIFO. A common analogy is a stack of plates: you can only add or remove plates from the top. In computer science, stacks have various applications, including expression parsing, backtracking algorithms, and memory management.

In contrast, a queue is also a linear data structure, but it operates differently. Elements are added at one end, known as the 'rear', and removed from the opposite end, termed the 'front'. This ensures that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed, encapsulating the FIFO principle. A useful analogy is a line of people waiting; individuals join the queue at the back and exit from the front. Queues are widely used in computer science for applications such as process scheduling in operating systems, managing requests in web servers, and implementing breadth-first search algorithms.

Regarding implementation, both stacks and queues can be constructed using either arrays or linked lists. For a stack, the operation to add elements is known as 'push', and the operation to remove elements is called 'pop'. Conversely, in a queue, the operation to add elements is referred to as 'enqueue', while the operation to remove elements is termed 'dequeue'.

In summary, although both stacks and queues are linear data structures, they differ significantly in the order of element addition and removal. Stacks adhere to a LIFO policy, while queues follow a FIFO policy. This fundamental distinction makes them suitable for a variety of applications in computer science.
