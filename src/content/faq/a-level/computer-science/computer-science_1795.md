The 'TRUNCATE' command in SQL serves the purpose of swiftly and efficiently removing all rows from a table.

As a Data Manipulation Language (DML) operation, 'TRUNCATE' marks the extents of a table for deallocation, effectively erasing all data contained within it. This operation is generally faster than the 'DELETE' command because it bypasses several integrity-enforcing mechanisms designed to protect data.

When you execute a 'TRUNCATE' command, SQL Server does not log the deletion of individual rows. Instead, it only logs the deallocation of the data pages that housed the data, which significantly accelerates the operation, especially for tables containing large amounts of data. However, this lack of individual row logging means that you cannot use the 'TRUNCATE' command on tables that are part of replication or that have foreign key constraints.

Another crucial aspect of the 'TRUNCATE' command is that it is a non-recoverable operation. Once you truncate a table, there is no way to roll back the operation, as the 'TRUNCATE' command does not log each row deletion. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution when using this command, ensuring that you truly intend to remove all data from the table.

Additionally, the 'TRUNCATE' command resets any identity columns in the table. If the table includes an identity column, subsequent inserts after truncation will start from the initial seed value defined for that column.

In summary, the 'TRUNCATE' command in SQL is a powerful mechanism for quickly deleting all data from a table. However, due to its irreversible nature and the fact that it circumvents certain data protection protocols, it should be used judiciously.
