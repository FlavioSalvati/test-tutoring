To convert an octal number to binary, you replace each octal digit with its corresponding three-digit binary representation.

**Understanding the Bases:**
Octal numbers are in base-8, which means they utilize digits from $0$ to $7$. In contrast, binary numbers are in base-2, employing only the digits $0$ and $1$. The conversion process involves substituting each octal digit with its equivalent binary representation.

**Step-by-Step Conversion Guide:**

1. **Identify the Digits:**
   Start by writing down the octal number and identifying each digit. For instance, if you have the octal number $345$, the individual digits are $3$, $4$, and $5$.

2. **Use the Conversion Table:**
   Convert each octal digit to its binary equivalent using the following table:

   $$
   \begin{array}{|c|c|}
   \hline
   \text{Octal} & \text{Binary} \\
   \hline
   0 & 000 \\
   1 & 001 \\
   2 & 010 \\
   3 & 011 \\
   4 & 100 \\
   5 & 101 \\
   6 & 110 \\
   7 & 111 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   $$

   For our example, the octal digit $3$ converts to $011$ in binary, $4$ converts to $100$, and $5$ converts to $101$.

3. **Combine the Binary Equivalents:**
   Write down the binary equivalents in the same order as the original octal digits. Therefore, the octal number $345$ becomes the binary number $011100101$.

**Important Note:**
Each octal digit corresponds to exactly three binary digits. This is necessary because the highest digit in octal, which is $7$, requires three binary digits to be represented (namely $111$). Even if the binary equivalent of an octal digit can be represented with fewer than three digits (for instance, the octal digit $2$ is $10$ in binary), you must always express it as a three-digit binary number ($010$) for consistency.

This conversion method is straightforward and user-friendly. However, it does require you to memorize or have access to the conversion table. With practice, you will be able to convert between octal and binary numbers swiftly and accurately.
