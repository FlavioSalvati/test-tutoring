The cocktail sort algorithm sorts a list by alternating between forward and backward passes, creating a repeated cycle of comparisons and swaps.

Cocktail sort, also referred to as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail shaker sort, shaker sort, ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort, is a variation of the bubble sort algorithm. Unlike standard bubble sort, which sorts the list in a single direction with each pass, cocktail sort operates in both directions. This results in the largest number moving to the end of the list during the forward pass, while the smallest number shifts to the start during the backward pass.

The algorithm initiates by comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order. This process begins from the start of the list and progresses to the end, effectively pushing the highest value to the end, similar to how bubble sort allows the largest number to "bubble up" to its correct position.

In contrast to bubble sort, cocktail sort does not restart the next pass from the beginning of the list. Instead, it reverses direction, moving from the end of the list back to the beginning. During this backward pass, the algorithm again compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if necessary, facilitating the movement of the smallest number towards the start of the list.

This back-and-forth process continues until no further swaps are required, indicating that the list is sorted.

One significant advantage of cocktail sort over bubble sort is its improved efficiency in handling "turtles"â€”small numbers located at the end of the list. In bubble sort, these numbers move to the beginning very slowly, while cocktail sort allows them to shift more rapidly.

Despite its advantages, like bubble sort, cocktail sort is not well-suited for large lists. Its average and worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ represents the number of items in the list. This quadratic growth in sorting time as the number of items increases makes cocktail sort inefficient for large datasets.
