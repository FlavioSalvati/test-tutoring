A full binary tree is characterized by the fact that every node has either 0 or 2 children. This type of tree, also known as a proper or plane binary tree, means that each node can either be a leaf node—having no children—or an internal node—having two children. Consequently, there are no nodes in a full binary tree that possess only one child. Notably, in a full binary tree, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than the number of internal nodes.

In contrast, a complete binary tree is defined as a binary tree where all levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level. In a complete binary tree, all nodes are positioned as far left as possible. This structure allows for nodes with only one child, but such nodes must be positioned to the left of any nodes with two children. Furthermore, the last level of a complete binary tree is filled from left to right.

In terms of applications, full binary trees are frequently utilized in mathematical expressions and Boolean functions due to their clear and straightforward structure. On the other hand, complete binary trees are commonly employed in various data structures, such as binary heaps, which are integral to algorithms like heap sort—a widely used sorting technique.

In summary, while both full and complete binary trees fall under the category of binary trees, they exhibit distinct structural characteristics and serve different purposes. A full binary tree is defined by having all nodes with either 0 or 2 children, with the number of leaf nodes always being one greater than the number of internal nodes. Conversely, a complete binary tree is fully filled except for the last level, where all nodes are positioned as far left as possible.
