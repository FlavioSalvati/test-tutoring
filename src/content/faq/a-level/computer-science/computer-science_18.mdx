A stack operates on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, whereas a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle in data representation.

To elaborate, a stack is a linear data structure where elements are both added and removed from the same end, referred to as the 'top.' Consequently, the last element that is added to the stack will be the first one to be removed, illustrating the LIFO characteristic. This can be visualized with a stack of plates; you can only add or take plates from the top of the stack. In computer science, stacks are employed in various applications, including memory management, expression evaluation, and syntax parsing.

Conversely, a queue is another type of linear data structure, but its operation is distinct. In a queue, elements are added at one end, known as the 'rear,' and removed from the opposite end, referred to as the 'front.' This structure means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed, embodying the FIFO principle. This can be likened to a queue of people waiting in line; the person who has been waiting the longest (at the front of the queue) is served first. Queues are utilized in various computer science applications, such as scheduling processes in operating systems, managing requests in a web server, and implementing breadth-first search algorithms.

In summary, the fundamental difference between a stack and a queue lies in the order of element addition and removal. In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed (LIFO), while in a queue, the first element added is the first to be removed (FIFO). Grasping these concepts is essential in computer science, as they form the foundation for many algorithms and data structures.
