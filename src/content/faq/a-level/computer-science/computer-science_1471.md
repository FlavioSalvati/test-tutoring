A graph can be represented using an adjacency list, which associates each vertex with a corresponding list of its neighboring vertices.

An adjacency list is a widely used data structure in computer science for graph representation. It consists of a collection of unordered lists, with one list for each vertex in the graph. Each list details the set of neighbors connected to that vertex. Consequently, for every edge in the graph, there is a corresponding connection between the vertex and each vertex listed as its neighbor.

For instance, consider a graph with vertices labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. If the connections are as follows: $A$ is connected to $B$ and $C$, $B$ is connected to $A$ and $D$, $C$ is connected to $A$, and $D$ is connected to $B$, the adjacency list representation of this graph would be:

$$
\begin{align*}
A: & \quad B, C \\
B: & \quad A, D \\
C: & \quad A \\
D: & \quad B \\
\end{align*}
$$

The adjacency list is an efficient way to represent a graph because it uses space proportional to the number of edges, which can be significantly less than the number of possible edges in dense graphs. This representation also facilitates efficient traversal of the graph, enabling quick access to all neighbors of a given vertex.

In terms of implementation, the adjacency list can be constructed using various data structures. Common choices include an array of lists, a dictionary where vertices serve as keys and lists as values, or even a linked list of linked lists. The selection of data structure depends on the specific requirements of the problem, such as whether the graph is directed or undirected, and whether operations like adding or removing vertices and edges are necessary.

In summary, an adjacency list is a straightforward and efficient method for graph representation in computer science. It associates each vertex with a list of its neighbors, allowing for effective traversal and manipulation of the graph. This representation can be implemented using different data structures based on the specific needs of the application.
