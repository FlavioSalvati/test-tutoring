A linked hash map is a sophisticated data structure that merges the characteristics of a hash table with those of a linked list.

To elaborate, a linked hash map consists of a hash table that is complemented by a doubly linked list. This structure maintains a collection of entries, each containing a key and a corresponding value. The entries are organized within the hash table, enabling efficient retrieval based on their keys. Simultaneously, the entries are linked in the order they were inserted into the map, establishing an iteration order that typically reflects the sequence of key insertions (known as insertion-order).

The hash table component of a linked hash map offers constant-time performance for fundamental operations such as retrieving (get) and inserting (put) entries, provided the hash function effectively distributes the elements among the available buckets. The linked list aspect of the structure facilitates iteration over the map's contents in the order of their insertion. This feature is particularly advantageous in scenarios where elements must be traversed in a specific sequence, such as when implementing a least recently used (LRU) cache.

In a linked hash map, each entry corresponds to a node within the linked list. When an entry is accessed, it is repositioned to the end of the list. If the map exceeds its predetermined capacity, the entry at the beginning of the list—representing the least recently accessed item—is removed. This behavior makes linked hash maps an excellent choice for cache implementations.

For instance, in Java, the 'LinkedHashMap' class is part of the Java Collections Framework. It extends the 'HashMap' class and implements the 'Map' interface. This class provides methods for adding and removing entries, as well as accessing them. Additionally, it includes methods for iterating over the entries either in the order of their insertion or based on the order of their last access.

In summary, a linked hash map is a versatile data structure that combines the efficiency of a hash table with the ordered access capabilities of a linked list. It is especially useful in scenarios where you need to maintain a collection of key-value pairs while preserving a specific iteration order.
