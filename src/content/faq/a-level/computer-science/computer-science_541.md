Common security measures for internet banking encompass a variety of techniques, including two-factor authentication, encryption, firewalls, and anti-virus software.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is a vital security protocol that requires users to verify their identity using two distinct forms of identification to access their accounts. Typically, this involves something the user knows (such as a password) and something the user possesses (like a mobile device that receives a one-time code). This dual requirement provides an additional layer of security, making it significantly more challenging for unauthorized individuals to access accounts, even if they have obtained the password.

**Encryption** is another essential component of internet banking security. It transforms data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. Financial institutions employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to safeguard the data transmitted between the bank and its customers. SSL establishes a secure connection between the customer's browser and the bank's server, thereby complicating efforts for hackers to intercept and decipher sensitive information.

**Firewalls** serve as a protective barrier for the bank's network against unauthorized access. They filter incoming and outgoing traffic, effectively blocking potentially harmful data from infiltrating the network. Firewalls can be configured to restrict data from specific locations or applications, adding another layer of defense.

**Anti-Virus Software** is also a prevalent security measure designed to safeguard against malware that may compromise sensitive information. This software scans the bank's network and systems for known threats, removing them as needed. Additionally, it helps protect against phishing attacks, where cybercriminals attempt to deceive users into disclosing their login credentials.

In addition to these fundamental measures, banks frequently implement **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to monitor their networks for any suspicious activity. If an IDS identifies potential threats, it alerts the bank's security team, enabling them to take proactive steps to prevent a security breach. Furthermore, banks routinely update their systems and software to defend against emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

Lastly, banks often provide security education to their customers. This education may include guidance on creating strong passwords, recognizing phishing emails, and securing personal devices. By equipping customers with this knowledge, banks help ensure that individuals also take proactive measures to protect their online banking information.
