Detecting loops in a linked list can be effectively accomplished using the "tortoise and hare" method, which employs two pointers moving at different speeds.

In this approach, one pointer, known as the 'tortoise', moves one step at a time, while the other pointer, referred to as the 'hare', moves two steps at a time. If a loop exists within the linked list, the faster-moving 'hare' will eventually meet the slower-moving 'tortoise'. This happens because the 'hare' will enter the loop before the 'tortoise', and as the 'hare' continues to traverse the loop, it will eventually catch up to the 'tortoise' due to its greater speed.

To implement this algorithm, you begin by initializing both pointers at the head of the linked list. During each iteration of the traversal, you advance the 'tortoise' pointer by one step and the 'hare' pointer by two steps. If the two pointers meet at any time, it indicates the presence of a loop in the linked list. Conversely, if the 'hare' pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., it becomes null), this confirms that no loop exists.

This method is efficient, requiring only a single traversal of the linked list, which results in a linear time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the linked list. Additionally, it operates with constant space complexity, $O(1)$, as it does not utilize any extra data structures.

It is crucial to consider edge cases, such as when the linked list is empty or contains only one element. In these situations, you should return a statement indicating that no loop exists. Furthermore, always ensure that the 'hare' pointer and its next pointer are not null before advancing the 'hare' pointer by two steps to avoid encountering a null pointer exception.
