Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a mechanism that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class.

To elaborate, inheritance is a core principle of OOP that facilitates the creation of hierarchical classifications. It enables developers to define a new class based on existing classes. The newly created class is referred to as a 'derived' or 'child' class, while the existing class is known as a 'base' or 'parent' class. The derived class inherits all the features of the base class, and it can also introduce new features or override existing ones.

This mechanism of inheritance promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy. By allowing developers to reuse existing class code, it saves both time and effort. Furthermore, inheritance contributes to more efficient and maintainable code, as modifications made to the base class are automatically reflected in all derived classes.

There are several types of inheritance in OOP, including:

1. **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from a single base class.
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class can inherit from more than one base class.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A derived class is formed from another derived class.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: A single base class serves as the parent for multiple derived classes.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

Different programming languages implement inheritance in various ways. For instance, in Java and C#, inheritance is achieved using the `extends` and `inherits` keywords, respectively. In Python, the base class is specified within parentheses in the class definition of the derived class.

In summary, inheritance is a powerful feature of OOP that fosters code reusability and establishes a logical, hierarchical classification of classes. It is an essential concept that every computer science student should grasp and know how to implement effectively.
