An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array that represents a graph, where each cell corresponds to a potential edge between vertices.

More specifically, an adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of this matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent in the graph. In the matrix, both rows and columns are labeled by the graph's vertices. If there is an edge from vertex $x$ to vertex $y$, the cell at the intersection of row $x$ and column $y$ is filled with the edge weight, which signifies the cost to move from vertex $x$ to vertex $y$. If no edge exists between the vertices, we can either fill that cell with a null value or infinity, depending on the context.

In the case of an undirected graph, the adjacency matrix is symmetric about the diagonal. This symmetry arises because if there is an edge from vertex $x$ to vertex $y$, there is necessarily an edge from vertex $y$ to vertex $x$. Conversely, for a directed graph, the adjacency matrix may not be symmetric, as the edges are directed; that is, an edge from $x$ to $y$ does not imply the existence of an edge from $y$ to $x$.

The dimensions of the adjacency matrix are $V \times V$, where $V$ represents the number of vertices in the graph. The entries in the matrix can take values of either $0$ or $1$ in the case of an unweighted graph, or can represent specific weights in a weighted graph. For instance, in an unweighted graph, the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of the adjacency matrix is $1$ if there is an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$, and $0$ otherwise.

Using an adjacency matrix is beneficial for quickly checking the presence of an edge between two vertices. However, it is not the most space-efficient representation for sparse graphs—those with relatively few edges—because it still requires storage for $V^2$ elements, the majority of which may be $0$. In such scenarios, alternative representations, such as an adjacency list, may prove to be more efficient.
