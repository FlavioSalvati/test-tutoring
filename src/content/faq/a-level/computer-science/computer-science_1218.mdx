Paging in memory management is a technique that enables a computer's physical memory to be divided into small, fixed-size blocks known as pages.

Paging is a fundamental concept in computer science, particularly within the realm of memory management. It is a method employed by operating systems to store and retrieve data from secondary storage for use in main memory. In this approach, the operating system retrieves data from disk storage in blocks of equal size, referred to as pages. One of the primary advantages of paging over simple segmentation is that it allows the physical address space of a process to be noncontiguous.

The paging process involves dividing computer memory into fixed-size chunks or 'pages.' While the size of these pages can vary, they are typically a few kilobytes each. When a program needs to store or retrieve data, it does so within these pages rather than accessing the entire memory space at once. This method enhances memory management efficiency, as the operating system only needs to monitor a list of free and used pages, rather than tracking individual bytes of memory.

Moreover, paging facilitates a clear distinction between a program's logical memory and the physical memory of the computer. The logical memory, often referred to as virtual memory, represents the memory as perceived by an individual program. Conversely, physical memory is the actual hardware memory available on the computer. By utilizing paging, a program can be led to believe it has access to a large, contiguous block of memory, even if the underlying physical memory is fragmented or not fully utilized.

Additionally, paging contributes to the protection of memory spaces between different processes. Each process is allocated its own set of pages in memory, preventing it from accessing the pages of another process without explicit permission. This isolation helps to safeguard against accidental or malicious corruption of one process's memory by another.

In summary, paging is a vital component of memory management in computer systems. It promotes efficient memory utilization, distinguishes between logical and physical memory, and ensures the protection of memory spaces among processes.
