A sequence in SQL is a powerful tool used to generate a series of numeric values in a defined order.

More specifically, a sequence in SQL is a database object that functions as a list of integers. It is primarily utilized to automatically produce unique identifiers for rows in a table. This capability is especially valuable when you need to create unique primary key values for new entries in a database table.

Sequences are created using the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement, and the next value in the sequence can be retrieved with the `NEXT VALUE FOR` function. Importantly, the sequence of numbers generated is not impacted by transaction rollbacks, and the sequence does not reset automatically upon reaching its maximum value.

The sequence object generates numbers based on the parameters defined during its creation, which include the starting point, the increment value, the maximum and minimum values, and whether the sequence should cycle back to the beginning when the limit is reached.

For instance, consider a table of students where you want to assign each student a unique ID. By using a sequence, whenever a new student is added to the table, the sequence will automatically generate a new, unique ID for that student. This ensures that each student can be distinctly identified by their ID, which is particularly useful in large databases where manually assigning unique IDs would be impractical and error-prone.

In summary, a sequence in SQL is an essential mechanism for automatically generating unique identifiers. It helps maintain data integrity and simplifies the management of databases.
