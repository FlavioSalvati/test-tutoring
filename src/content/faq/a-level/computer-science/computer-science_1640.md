A lexer, or lexical analyzer, plays an essential role in a compiler by breaking down source code into meaningful segments called tokens. 

As the first phase of the compilation process, the lexer reads the input characters and generates a sequence of tokens that the parser utilizes for syntax analysis. Each token represents a logically cohesive sequence of characters, which can include identifiers, keywords, or operators.

The lexer operates by scanning the source code from left to right, character by character. It classifies each character and groups them into tokens according to the rules defined by the programming language. For instance, in the C programming language, the string 'int' would be identified as a keyword, while 'x' would be classified as an identifier.

Moreover, the lexer eliminates unnecessary elements from the source code, such as whitespace and comments, which do not contribute to the compilation process. This removal of non-essential content is referred to as 'lexical noise.' By filtering out this noise, the lexer streamlines the workload for subsequent stages of the compiler.

In addition to tokenizing the source code, the lexer also detects lexical errorsâ€”mistakes that violate the programming language's rules. For example, most languages require identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to begin with a letter. If an identifier starts with a number, the lexer flags this as a lexical error.

In summary, the lexer is a crucial component of a compiler. It performs the initial processing of the source code by breaking it down into tokens, removing lexical noise, and checking for lexical errors. This preparation is essential for the next stage of the compilation process, where the parser checks the syntax of the program.
