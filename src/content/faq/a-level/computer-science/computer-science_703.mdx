Bitwise operators and logical operators serve distinct purposes in programming, operating on different levels of data representation.

**Bitwise Operators**  
Bitwise operators manipulate individual bits within the binary representations of numbers. These operators work directly on the binary representations of integers stored in memory. The most common bitwise operators include AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift. 

For instance, consider the binary numbers $1011$ (which corresponds to $11$ in decimal) and $1101$ (which corresponds to $13$ in decimal). When performing a bitwise AND operation on these two numbers, each bit of the first operand is compared with the corresponding bit of the second operand. The result bit is set to $1$ if both bits are $1$; otherwise, it is set to $0$. Therefore, the operation $1011 \, \text{AND} \, 1101$ results in $1001$, which is $9$ in decimal.

**Logical Operators**  
In contrast, logical operators assess boolean expressions and yield a boolean result: either true or false. The primary logical operators are AND (commonly represented as $&&$), OR (represented as $||$), and NOT (represented as $!$). Unlike bitwise operators, logical operators do not operate at the binary level; instead, they function at a higher logical level. 

For example, consider two boolean expressions: 'A' (which evaluates to true) and 'B' (which evaluates to false). A logical AND operation would return true only if both 'A' and 'B' are true. Given that 'B' is false in this case, the expression $A \, \text{AND} \, B$ evaluates to false.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, while both bitwise and logical operators can perform AND, OR, and NOT operations, they do so in fundamentally different ways. Bitwise operators manipulate individual bits of binary numbers, while logical operators evaluate boolean expressions to return a boolean value. Understanding the distinction between these two types of operators is crucial for writing efficient and effective code.
