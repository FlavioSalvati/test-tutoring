Comb sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that enhances the traditional bubble sort by utilizing a larger gap between the elements being compared.

The comb sort algorithm operates by repeatedly sorting pairs of elements that are separated by a specific gap, as opposed to only sorting adjacent pairs like bubble sort. Initially, this gap is set to the length of the list and is gradually decreased until it reaches $1$. At this point, the algorithm functions similarly to bubble sort. Typically, the gap is reduced by a shrink factor at each iteration, commonly chosen to be $1.3$.

The algorithm begins by establishing the gap equal to the length of the list. It then compares each pair of elements that are this gap apart, swapping them if they are out of order. After comparing all such pairs, the gap is reduced by the shrink factor, and the process is repeated. This cycle continues until the gap is reduced to $1$, at which point the algorithm continues to compare and swap adjacent elements until the entire list is sorted.

The primary advantage of this approach is that it allows elements to move to their correct positions more rapidly than bubble sort, as they can "jump" over several positions in a single operation. This feature makes comb sort particularly effective for lists that are highly disordered. However, like bubble sort, it remains relatively inefficient for larger lists when compared to more advanced algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort.

Regarding complexity, comb sort's average and worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$, although it typically has a smaller coefficient than that of bubble sort. This results in better performance in practice for many types of input. Its best-case time complexity is $O(n \log n)$, which is observed for nearly sorted lists. Importantly, it is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional storage space, and it is not stable; thus, equal elements may not maintain their original order.

In summary, comb sort is a straightforward and intuitive sorting algorithm that improves upon bubble sort by comparing and swapping elements that are separated by a specified gap. This technique allows it to position elements correctly more swiftly, making it a more efficient choice for various input scenarios.
