A singly linked list allows traversal in one direction only, while a doubly linked list facilitates traversal in both directions.

A singly linked list is a data structure where each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the subsequent node in the sequence. This structure enables efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position during iteration. However, it allows traversal in only one direction, meaning you can navigate the list from the first node (the head) to the last node (the tail). If you need to traverse the list in the opposite direction, you must start from the head again and move through the list until you reach your desired node.

In contrast, a doubly linked list is a more complex data structure that contains references to both the next node and the previous node in the sequence. This allows for traversal in both directions: from the head to the tail and vice versa. The ability to traverse the list in two directions simplifies navigation and makes operations such as insertion and deletion at both ends of the list easier to implement. However, this increased functionality comes at the cost of additional memory usage, as each node must store a reference to both the next and the previous node.

Regarding memory efficiency, a singly linked list is more efficient since it only requires one reference to the next node. In contrast, a doubly linked list must maintain two references for each node—one for the next node and one for the previous node—resulting in higher memory consumption.

In terms of practical applications, singly linked lists are often utilized in scenarios where memory conservation is crucial and one-way traversal suffices, such as in the implementation of a stack. Conversely, doubly linked lists are preferred in situations where two-way traversal is beneficial, such as in the implementation of a web browser's back and forward navigation buttons.

In summary, the choice between a singly linked list and a doubly linked list depends on the specific needs of your application, including memory constraints and the requirement for one-way or two-way traversal.
