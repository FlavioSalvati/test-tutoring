The `UNION ALL` operator in SQL incorporates duplicate records, whereas the `UNION` operator omits them.

In SQL, both the `UNION` and `UNION ALL` operators are utilized to merge the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements. However, they differ significantly in how they manage duplicate records. The `UNION` operator automatically eliminates duplicate rows, ensuring that every entry in the result set is unique. In contrast, the `UNION ALL` operator retains all records from all `SELECT` statements, including duplicates.

The `UNION` operator functions by comparing each record in the result set to every other record in order to identify and remove duplicates. This process can be resource-intensive, particularly with large datasets. Therefore, if performance is a critical factor and you are confident that there will be no duplicates—or if accepting duplicate records in your result set is permissible—it may be more advantageous to opt for `UNION ALL`.

On the other hand, the `UNION ALL` operator simply aggregates all records from the involved `SELECT` statements without performing any duplicate checks. This characteristic makes it faster than `UNION`, but it also means that your result set may contain duplicate entries. If your requirement is to ensure that all records in your result set are distinct, then you should choose `UNION`.

In conclusion, the choice between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` hinges on your specific requirements. If your goal is to remove duplicate records from your result set, utilize `UNION`. Conversely, if you wish to include all records—regardless of duplication—and prioritize speed, then `UNION ALL` is the appropriate choice.
