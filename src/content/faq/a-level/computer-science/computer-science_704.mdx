In a computer system, logarithmic numbers are represented using floating-point notation.

To elaborate, a logarithmic number is typically encoded as a floating-point number in a computer system. This representation method allows for the encoding of real numbers within the constraints of finite precision available in computers. The floating-point representation strikes a balance between range and precision, enabling us to represent extremely large numbers, very small numbers, and everything in between with reasonable accuracy.

The floating-point representation is fundamentally based on scientific notation, which is a way to express numbers that are too large or too small for conventional decimal representation. In scientific notation, numbers are written in the form of a base and an exponent. For example, the number $300$ can be expressed in scientific notation as $3 \times 10^2$.

Similarly, in a computer system, a floating-point number consists of a base number (also known as the mantissa or significand) and an exponent. The base number is generally a fractional binary number, while the exponent is an integer. Both the base number and the exponent are stored in binary format. The actual value represented is calculated as the base number multiplied by $2$ raised to the power of the exponent.

When it comes to logarithmic numbers, they are straightforwardly represented as floating-point numbers. The logarithm of a number indicates the exponent to which a fixed value, known as the base, must be raised to obtain that number. For instance, the logarithm base $2$ of $8$, which equals $3$, would be represented as a floating-point number in the computer system.

In programming, many languages offer built-in functions to compute logarithms. For example, in Python, the `math.log()` function can be used to calculate the natural logarithm of a number. Additionally, by providing a second argument, you can compute the logarithm with respect to a different base. The output of these functions is a floating-point number, which is the format used to represent logarithmic values in computer systems.
