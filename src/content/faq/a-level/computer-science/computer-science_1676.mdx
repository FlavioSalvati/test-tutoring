A web browser interprets HTML by parsing it to create the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage.

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, serves as the standard language for developing webpages. When a web browser receives HTML from a server, it does not merely display the raw code. Instead, it interprets the HTML, which entails reading and comprehending the structure and content of the webpage as delineated by the HTML.

The process begins with the browser parsing the HTML. This involves breaking down the HTML document into its individual components. These components include various tags such as `<head>`, `<body>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, among others, as well as the content contained within these tags. The browser reads the HTML sequentially from top to bottom, and as it encounters each element, it generates a corresponding node in the Document Object Model (DOM).

The DOM is a tree-like structure representing the webpage, with each node corresponding to an HTML element. This model enables the browser to grasp the layout of the webpage and the relationships between the elements. For instance, a `<p>` tag nested within a `<div>` tag in the HTML would create a 'p' node as a child of a 'div' node in the DOM.

Once the DOM is fully constructed, the browser proceeds to render the webpage. This rendering process involves translating the structure and content described by the DOM into a visual format displayed on the screen, as dictated by the HTML and any associated CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). For example, a `<p>` tag may be rendered as a block of text, while an `<img>` tag appears as an image.

Furthermore, the browser can utilize the DOM to interact dynamically with the webpage. For instance, JavaScript code executing within the browser can manipulate the DOM to modify the content or appearance of the webpage in response to user actions.

In summary, a web browser interprets HTML by parsing it to construct the DOM, which it then employs to render and interact with the webpage. This process enables the browser to understand and present the webpage as intended by the HTML code.
