An internet search engine indexes web pages by employing web crawlers to discover, scan, and store information about those pages.

Web crawlers, often referred to as spiders or bots, are automated software applications designed to systematically navigate the internet to collect data about each web page. This operation is commonly known as web crawling or spidering. The process begins with a list of URLs to visit, termed the "seed." As the crawler accesses these URLs, it identifies all the hyperlinks on each page and adds them to its list of URLs for subsequent visits.

The crawler meticulously scans the content of each web page, which includes text, images, and videos. It analyzes this content to discern the subject matter of the page, focusing on key elements such as the title, meta tags, and descriptions. Additionally, the crawler examines the keywords present on the page and their frequency of occurrence. This analytical process is referred to as parsing.

After thoroughly analyzing a page, the crawler stores the collected information in the search engine's index. This index serves as a vast database that catalogs all the information the crawler has gathered. It is organized in a manner that enables the search engine to quickly retrieve the most relevant web pages in response to a specific search query. This entire operation is known as indexing.

Moreover, the crawler monitors changes to the content of web pages. If a page is updated, the crawler revisits it to refresh the information stored in the index, ensuring that the search engine's results remain current.

In addition to indexing web page content, search engines also rank these pages based on their relevance and quality. This ranking is determined by sophisticated algorithms that consider various factors, including the number and quality of external web pages linking to the page, the relevance of the page's content to the search query, and the user's browsing history. This process is known as ranking.

In summary, an internet search engine utilizes web crawlers to locate and scan web pages, analyze the content to ascertain the subject matter, store the information in an index, and rank the pages according to their relevance and quality.
