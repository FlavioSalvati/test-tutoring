The primary function of a foreign key in a relational database is to create a link between two tables, thereby ensuring data integrity and consistency.

In relational databases, tables are interconnected through keys. A foreign key is a specific field (or a group of fields) in one table that references a particular record in another table. The table that contains the foreign key is referred to as the child table, while the table that holds the corresponding primary key is known as the parent table. Typically, the foreign key in the child table points to the primary key in the parent table.

The main objective of a foreign key is to maintain data integrity and consistency across tables by enforcing constraints on the data. For instance, if a foreign key is defined in an 'Orders' table that references the 'Customers' table, the database will prevent the addition of any orders that do not correspond to a valid customer. This mechanism is known as referential integrity.

Foreign keys also play a vital role in executing database queries, particularly those involving the joining of multiple tables. When a query is performed that involves various tables, the database management system utilizes the relationships established by the foreign keys to combine data meaningfully. For example, a query might join the 'Orders' and 'Customers' tables to generate a list of all orders placed by a specific customer.

Moreover, foreign keys can be utilized to establish hierarchical relationships between tables. This capability is especially beneficial in databases that aim to model real-world systems where such relationships are prevalent. For instance, in a school database, a 'Students' table may contain a foreign key that references a 'Classes' table, thereby creating a relationship that associates each student with a particular class.

In conclusion, foreign keys are a fundamental component of relational databases. They provide a mechanism for linking tables, enforcing data integrity, facilitating complex queries, and modeling real-world relationships.
