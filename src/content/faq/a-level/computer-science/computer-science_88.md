A linked list is a versatile data structure that serves as a foundation for implementing various other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables.

A linked list is a dynamic data structure that can expand or contract during program execution, making it particularly suitable for various applications. It is composed of nodes, where each node contains a data field and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This architecture facilitates efficient insertions and deletions at any position within the list, a vital characteristic for many data structures.

For example, stacks and queues are commonly implemented using linked lists. A stack operates on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added is the first one to be removed. This behavior can be easily achieved with a linked list by adding and removing elements from the head of the list. Conversely, a queue adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. This can also be efficiently implemented with a linked list by adding elements at the tail and removing them from the head.

Hash tables, another widely used data structure, can similarly utilize linked lists. A hash table employs a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, allowing for the retrieval of the desired value. Collisions occur when multiple keys hash to the same index. One effective strategy to manage collisions is through linked lists. In this approach, each bucket in the hash table contains a linked list. When a collision happens, the new key-value pair is appended to the end of the linked list associated with the corresponding bucket.

Additionally, linked lists are instrumental in the implementation of graphs. In an adjacency list representation of a graph, each vertex is associated with a linked list of vertices to which it is connected. This structure supports efficient traversal and manipulation of the graph.

In summary, the dynamic and flexible nature of linked lists makes them an essential tool in the implementation of various data structures. Their ability to efficiently manage insertions and deletions at any position is a crucial feature utilized in stacks, queues, hash tables, and graphs.
