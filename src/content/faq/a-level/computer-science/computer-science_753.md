A weighted graph assigns a numerical value, known as a weight, to each edge, whereas an unweighted graph does not assign any specific value to its edges.

To elaborate, a graph in computer science is a data structure composed of two primary components: a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. In an unweighted graph, all edges are treated equally, meaning there is no cost associated with traversing from one vertex to another. Consequently, when searching for a path between two points, any route that minimizes the number of edges is considered a valid solution.

Conversely, a weighted graph assigns a numerical weight to each edge, which can represent various factors depending on the context of the problem. For instance, in a graph that models a road network, the weights might signify the distance or travel time between locations. In this scenario, the shortest path between two points is determined by the total weight of the edges traversed, rather than simply the count of edges.

Weighted graphs are frequently utilized in algorithms that address real-world challenges, such as finding the shortest route in navigation systems or determining the least expensive combination of purchases in shopping scenarios. Although unweighted graphs are simpler, they still serve valuable purposes in contexts where the crucial factor is merely the presence or absence of connections between nodes, such as in social network analysis or in examining the structure of the internet.

When it comes to implementation, both types of graphs can be represented using similar data structures, such as adjacency matrices or adjacency lists. However, in the case of a weighted graph, these structures must also accommodate the additional weight information for each edge. While this complexity makes weighted graphs more intricate to manage, it also enhances their capability and versatility in solving a broader array of problems.
