A Content Delivery Network (CDN) operates by distributing web content across a network of servers located around the globe, effectively reducing latency for users.

A CDN consists of a network of servers strategically placed worldwide. Its primary objective is to enhance web performance by minimizing the distance between users and the website's original server. When a user requests content from a website, the CDN redirects this request from the website's origin server to the nearest CDN server. This server then delivers the cached content, ensuring that users receive information more quickly.

The CDN duplicates the pages of a website onto a network of servers known as Points of Presence (POPs), which are spread across various geographical locations. By caching the contents of these pages, the CDN can efficiently serve users. When a user requests a webpage that utilizes a CDN, the request is redirected from the original website's server to the nearest CDN server, which provides the cached content. If the requested content hasn't been cached yet, the CDN will communicate with the original server to fetch it.

The process of routing through CDNs is largely transparent to users. The only indication that a CDN has been utilized occurs if the delivered URL differs from the one originally requested.

CDNs offer significant advantages for websites with a global audience. For instance, if a website's server is located in London, a user situated in Australia would likely experience slower load times without a CDN. However, with a CDN in place, that Australian user can access the website via a local server, drastically improving load times and overall performance.

Beyond enhancing web service speed, CDNs are engineered to be robust and secure. They protect websites from sudden spikes in traffic, malicious attacks, and hardware failures. CDNs are capable of managing higher traffic volumes and are more resilient to hardware failures compared to many origin servers.
