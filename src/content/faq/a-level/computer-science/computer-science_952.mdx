A many-to-one relationship in a database is established through the use of foreign keys in the 'many' table that reference the 'one' table.

In the context of a relational database, a many-to-one relationship defines a specific type of cardinality that describes the association between two entities. Specifically, it indicates that multiple records in one table can be linked to a single record in another table. This relationship is implemented using a foreign key, which is a field (or a collection of fields) in one table that serves to connect to the primary key of another table.

For example, consider a library database. In this scenario, the library contains many books, but each book is authored by only one individual. Here, the 'Books' table would include a foreign key called 'AuthorID' that references the 'Authors' table. Each record of a book in the 'Books' table would have an 'AuthorID' that corresponds to the 'AuthorID' of a single record in the 'Authors' table. This illustrates how the many-to-one relationship between books and authors is represented.

Moreover, the foreign key constraint plays a crucial role in maintaining referential integrity within the database. This means that the database ensures all foreign key values point to existing records in the referenced table. For instance, a book cannot have an 'AuthorID' that does not exist in the 'Authors' table. This mechanism prevents orphaned records and upholds data consistency.

In summary, a many-to-one relationship in a database is represented by foreign keys in the 'many' table that link to the primary key in the 'one' table. This approach not only establishes the relationship between the two entities but also safeguards the integrity of the data.
