A linker script plays a pivotal role in the linking process, governing how the sections of input files are organized and mapped into the final output file.

Essentially, a linker script is an integral component in the creation of an executable program from object files. The linker, which is the program responsible for combining one or more object files produced by a compiler, relies on the linker script for guidance on how to carry out this task.

The primary purpose of a linker script is to dictate the memory layout of the output file. It specifies the exact locations in memory where each section of the input files will be placed within the output file. This functionality is particularly vital in embedded systems, where memory resources are often constrained, and certain memory locations may carry specific functions.

Beyond managing memory layout, a linker script can also define symbols, which serve as names for specific memory locations. By introducing symbols in the linker script, developers can reference particular memory addresses in their code by name rather than by their numeric addresses, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the code.

Additionally, linker scripts can determine the order in which sections from the input files are arranged in the output file. This ordering can significantly impact performance, as the sequence of sections in memory can influence how efficiently the program executes.

In summary, a linker script is a powerful tool that provides developers with control over the linking process. It enables the specification of the memory layout for the program, the naming of specific memory locations, and the management of section order in the output file. Gaining an understanding of how to utilize a linker script can deepen your comprehension of your program's architecture and execution.
