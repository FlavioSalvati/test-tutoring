A clustered index in a database serves to sort and store the data rows of a table according to their key values.

To elaborate, a clustered index is a specific type of index that alters the physical arrangement of records in the table. Consequently, a table can have only one clustered index at a time. The leaf nodes of this index contain the actual data pages. A table with a clustered index is referred to as a clustered table. Conversely, if a table lacks a clustered index, its data rows are stored in an unordered structure known as a heap.

The primary purpose of a clustered index is to improve the speed of data retrieval operations within the database. When a clustered index is established on a table, the rows are organized on disk in a way that aligns with the logical order of the index. This organization allows the database to quickly locate the data when a query is executed that references the indexed column. This feature is particularly beneficial for range queries or sorting operations, where multiple contiguous rows must be accessed.

However, it is important to note that because the physical order of data rows is governed by the clustered index, inserting new data can be time-consuming. The database may need to rearrange existing data to maintain the specified order, which can lead to performance overhead. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the selection of the column for the clustered index. Typically, this column is one that is frequently used in queries and possesses a broad range of unique values, such as an identifier column.

In conclusion, a clustered index is a powerful mechanism for optimizing data retrieval in a database. By physically reordering the data to match the logical order of the index, it can significantly accelerate certain types of queries. However, it may also hinder data insertion performance, necessitating thoughtful implementation.
