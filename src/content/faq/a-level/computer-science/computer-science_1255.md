A retargetable compiler is a specialized type of compiler designed to generate machine code for various hardware architectures from a single source code. This capability is achieved through the separation of the compilation process into two distinct stages: the front-end and the back-end.

The front-end of the compiler is responsible for parsing the source code and producing an intermediate representation (IR). This IR serves as a low-level, hardware-independent abstraction of the original source code.

In contrast, the back-end of the compiler takes this IR and translates it into machine code tailored for a specific hardware architecture. This is where the concept of 'retargetability' comes into play. By replacing the back-end, developers can generate code for different hardware types. For instance, one back-end might generate code for $x86$ processors, while another could be designed for $ARM$ processors. Importantly, the front-end remains unchanged, as it operates independently of the target hardware.

The primary advantage of this architecture is that it allows software developers to write code once and compile it for multiple hardware platforms. This approach can significantly reduce the time and effort required, as it eliminates the need to create and maintain separate versions of the code for each hardware type. Furthermore, it simplifies the process of porting software to new hardware, as updates are only needed for the compiler's back-end.

However, retargetable compilers do have some limitations. The quality of the generated machine code can vary based on the sophistication of the back-end. Some back-ends may produce highly optimized code, while others might yield less efficient results. Additionally, while the front-end is hardware-independent, it is not language-independent. Each programming language necessitates a distinct front-end, meaning that a separate retargetable compiler is required for each programming language.
