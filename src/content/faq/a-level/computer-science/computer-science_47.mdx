The Brick Sort algorithm, commonly referred to as Odd-Even Sort, operates by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements within a list.

Brick Sort is a straightforward comparison-based sorting technique, and its name derives from the way bricks are arranged in a wall. The algorithm categorizes the elements of the input list into two types based on their indices: odd and even. It then executes two types of passes: odd passes and even passes. During an odd pass, the algorithm traverses the list, focusing on the elements at odd indices. It compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order. The even pass follows the same protocol, but it targets the elements at even indices.

This alternating process of odd and even passes continues until the list is fully sorted. As a result, the largest element gradually "bubbles up" to its correct position during the even passes, while the smallest element "bubbles down" during the odd passes.

While the Brick Sort algorithm is easy to comprehend and implement, it is not particularly efficient for large lists. The best-case time complexity is $O(n)$, which occurs when the input list is already sorted. However, both the average and worst-case time complexity is $O(n^2)$, making it less efficient compared to other comparison-based sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort.

Despite its inefficiency, Brick Sort possesses some intriguing characteristics. Notably, it is one of the few sorting algorithms that can be efficiently parallelized. This feature enables it to leverage multi-core processors to expedite the sorting process. Additionally, Brick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional space beyond the input list itself to perform the sort.

In conclusion, Brick Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that relies on the repeated comparison and swapping of adjacent elements. Although it is not the most efficient choice for large datasets, its unique properties can make it advantageous in specific scenarios.
