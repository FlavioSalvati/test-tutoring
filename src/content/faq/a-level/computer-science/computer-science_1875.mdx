Functional programming addresses the challenges of state and mutable data by minimizing their use, instead prioritizing immutable data and pure functions.

In functional programming, the concept of state is typically minimized or avoided altogether. This is due to the fact that state can introduce complexity and lead to unpredictable behavior within a program. Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions, which are functions that consistently produce the same output for the same input and do not have side effects. This characteristic enhances the predictability of program behavior and simplifies reasoning about its execution.

Similarly, mutable data is largely eschewed in functional programming. Instead, data is often treated as immutable, meaning it cannot be altered once created. When a change is required, a new version of the data is generated instead of modifying the original. This practice helps to prevent bugs that may arise from unexpected data changes and facilitates clearer reasoning about how data flows within a program.

That said, entirely avoiding state and mutable data is not always practical or efficient. In certain scenarios, utilizing mutable data can yield more efficient algorithms. To address this, functional programming languages often offer mechanisms to manage state and mutable data in a controlled manner. For instance, they may provide specialized data structures that encapsulate mutable data or implement controlled state management techniques, such as monads in Haskell.

In conclusion, functional programming navigates the challenges of state and mutable data by minimizing their use, favoring pure functions and immutable data instead. Nevertheless, when state or mutable data is necessary, functional programming languages offer controlled and predictable methods for managing them. This approach significantly reduces complexity, making programs easier to understand and reason about.
