A circular linked list is a specialized data structure in which the last node links back to the first node, thereby forming a continuous loop.

To elaborate, a circular linked list is an extension of the conventional linked list. In a standard linked list, each node contains data along with a 'next' reference that points to the subsequent node in the sequence. The final node, however, has a null reference that signifies the end of the list. In contrast, in a circular linked list, the 'next' reference of the last node directs back to the first node, establishing a circular or looped configuration.

This circular arrangement proves beneficial in various scenarios. For instance, it can effectively represent cyclical problems or systems, such as a round-robin scheduler in an operating system or a digital media player that returns to the first song after finishing the last one.

In terms of operations, a circular linked list functions similarly to a standard linked list. You can add, remove, or search for elements. However, due to its circular nature, caution is necessary to prevent infinite loops. When traversing the list, it is essential to remember the starting point and to stop the traversal upon returning to it.

Another significant distinction is that in a circular linked list, you can traverse the entire list from any node. Conversely, in a standard linked list, traversal is limited to moving from the first node to the last node. This characteristic renders circular linked lists more versatile in certain applications.

Regarding complexity, the time complexities for operations on a circular linked list are analogous to those of a standard linked list. Specifically, adding or removing elements is generally an $O(1)$ operation if you are at the correct location, while searching for an element typically has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of elements in the list. However, locating the correct position may require up to $O(n)$ time, especially if you lack a reference to the node preceding the one of interest.
