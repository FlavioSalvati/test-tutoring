Binary trees are typically traversed in functional programming through the use of recursion, which is a foundational concept in this paradigm.

In functional programming, recursion refers to the technique in which a function calls itself to tackle a problem. This approach is particularly advantageous when working with data structures like binary trees, where data is organized hierarchically. The three primary types of binary tree traversals are in-order, pre-order, and post-order. Each of these traversal methods can be effectively implemented using recursion.

In an **in-order traversal**, the sequence of visits is as follows: first, the left subtree is traversed, followed by the root node, and finally, the right subtree. This is accomplished by recursively invoking the in-order function on the left subtree, processing the root node, and subsequently calling the in-order function on the right subtree.

In a **pre-order traversal**, the order of visits changes to: the root node is processed first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree. This is achieved by processing the root node first, then recursively calling the pre-order function on the left subtree, and finally on the right subtree.

In a **post-order traversal**, the visits occur in the following sequence: first, the left subtree is traversed, followed by the right subtree, and finally the root node is processed. This is implemented by recursively calling the post-order function on the left subtree, then on the right subtree, and concluding with the processing of the root node.

In functional programming, these recursive functions typically accept the binary tree or subtree to be traversed as an argument and return a list of nodes in the order they were visited. The base case for the recursion is generally defined as encountering a null or empty tree, at which point the function returns an empty list.

It is also essential to recognize that functional programming languages, such as Haskell or Scala, treat functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values, and assigned to variables. As a result, recursion becomes a natural and powerful mechanism for tree traversal in functional programming.
