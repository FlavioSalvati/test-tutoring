A Fenwick tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is an efficient data structure designed for managing cumulative frequency tables.

This data structure represents a binary tree that is particularly useful in computer science for addressing range queries and update problems efficiently. It was introduced by Peter M. Fenwick in 1994. The Fenwick tree is essentially an array-based representation of a binary tree, where each node corresponds to a specific interval of the input data. It is especially advantageous in scenarios that require frequent updates of elements and the computation of prefix sums.

The Fenwick tree leverages the concept of binary indexing, which is why it is commonly referred to as a Binary Indexed Tree. Each node in the Fenwick tree holds the sum of a range of values from the original array. The range associated with each node is determined by the binary representation of its index in the array. Specifically, the least significant bit (LSB) in the binary representation of an index indicates the range of responsibility for that index.

The Fenwick tree supports two primary operations: updating values and calculating prefix sums. The update operation involves adding a value to a specific element in the array, which subsequently updates all relevant nodes in the Fenwick tree. The prefix sum operation, on the other hand, computes the sum of all elements up to a specified index in the array. Both operations can be executed in $O(\log n)$ time, which is a significant improvement over the naive $O(n)$ time required for an array or the $O(n \log n)$ time needed for a balanced binary search tree.

The applications of the Fenwick tree are extensive. It is widely utilized in computational geometry for counting the number of points within a range, in data compression for computing cumulative frequency tables, in competitive programming for solving range update and range query problems, and in machine learning for calculating cumulative distribution functions. Additionally, it plays a role in the implementation of certain algorithms, such as the Schensted algorithm used for finding the longest increasing subsequence. The Fenwick tree's capability to perform both updates and queries in logarithmic time renders it a powerful tool in these and many other applications.
