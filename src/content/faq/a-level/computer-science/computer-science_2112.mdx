The Von Neumann architecture utilizes a single memory space and bus for both data and instructions, whereas the Harvard architecture features distinct memory spaces and buses for each.

Named after the mathematician and physicist John Von Neumann, the Von Neumann architecture is based on a 1945 description by him and his colleagues. This architecture is characterized by a unified memory system that stores both program instructions and data. As a result, both instructions and data share the same memory channels or buses for communication. This design leads to a limitation known as the Von Neumann bottleneck, which refers to the restricted data throughput between the central processing unit (CPU) and memory relative to the overall memory capacity.

In contrast, the Harvard architecture employs physically separate memory systems and buses for instructions and data. Originally implemented in the Harvard Mark I relay-based computer, this architecture enables simultaneous fetching of data and instructions, thereby eliminating the bottleneck experienced in the Von Neumann architecture. The separation of memory allows for enhanced speed and efficiency, making the Harvard architecture particularly advantageous in applications such as real-time signal processing and complex computations.

Despite its advantages, the Von Neumann architecture is simpler and more cost-effective to implement, requiring fewer hardware resources. It also offers greater flexibility, as the memory size does not need to be predetermined during the design phase. Conversely, while the Harvard architecture is faster and more efficient, it is more complex and expensive to implement. Additionally, it lacks the design flexibility of the Von Neumann architecture, as the sizes of the instruction and data memories must be specified at the outset.

Many modern computers adopt a modified version of the Harvard architecture, which features separate instruction and data caches—small, high-speed memory areas—at the first level. This setup provides the speed advantages associated with the Harvard architecture while maintaining shared main memory, which offers the cost benefits and flexibility of the Von Neumann architecture. This hybrid model is often referred to as the Harvard-Von Neumann architecture.
