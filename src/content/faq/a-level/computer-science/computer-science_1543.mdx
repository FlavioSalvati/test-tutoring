An in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST) is a systematic method for visiting the nodes of the tree. This traversal follows a specific sequence: first, it visits the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. This process is carried out recursively, meaning that the same steps are applied to each subtree until all nodes have been visited.

In a binary search tree, the in-order traversal allows you to access all the nodes in a defined order. The steps are as follows:

1. Start at the root node.
2. If the root node has a left child, move to the left child and repeat the process.
3. This continues until you reach a node that does not have a left child. This node will be the first one visited.
4. After visiting this node, if it has a right child, move to the right child and repeat the in-order traversal for its left subtree.
5. If a node does not have a right child, backtrack to its parent node and continue the traversal.

To implement an in-order traversal programmatically, you can use a recursive function. The structure of this function would involve:

- Calling itself for the left child of the current node.
- Visiting the current node.
- Calling itself for the right child of the current node.

This ensures that all nodes are visited in the correct order.

The in-order traversal is particularly beneficial in binary search trees because it visits the nodes in ascending order. This property arises from the structure of binary search trees, where, for any given node, all nodes in the left subtree are less than the node, and all nodes in the right subtree are greater. Consequently, an in-order traversal can be effectively utilized to retrieve all the elements in a binary search tree in sorted order.
