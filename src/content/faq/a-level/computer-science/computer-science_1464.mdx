A B-tree is a self-balancing, sorted tree data structure that efficiently maintains sorted data, enabling quick insertion, deletion, and search operations.

Designed primarily for secondary storage systems, such as hard disks, a B-tree is a type of search tree that optimizes performance for these environments. Its self-balancing nature allows the tree to automatically adjust as new data is added or existing data is removed, which is essential for ensuring that operations like insertion, deletion, and searching can be executed swiftly.

The structure of a B-tree is characterized by its order, denoted as $m$, which indicates the maximum number of children each node can have. A B-tree of order $m$ possesses the following properties:

1. Each node can have at most $m$ children.
2. Every node, except for the root and leaf nodes, must have at least $\lceil m/2 \rceil$ children.
3. The root node must have at least two children unless it is a leaf node.
4. All leaf nodes must reside at the same level.

B-trees are extensively utilized in databases and file systems due to their ability to minimize disk I/O operations. Each node in a B-tree contains multiple keys along with links to its child nodes, allowing a significant amount of data to be stored within a single node. This design effectively reduces the number of disk reads required to locate a specific key, making B-trees a highly efficient data structure for handling large databases.

Beyond their applications in databases and file systems, B-trees find utility in various other areas of computer science. For instance, they are employed in the implementation of associative arrays and in-memory databases. Additionally, certain types of network routers use B-trees to store routing tables.

In conclusion, a B-tree is a versatile and efficient data structure that serves a wide array of applications. Its self-balancing characteristics facilitate efficient operations, while its design is particularly advantageous for systems that demand effective disk I/O performance.
