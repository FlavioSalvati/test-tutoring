B-trees in functional programming languages are represented as recursive data structures and are manipulated using recursive functions.

In languages such as Haskell and Scala, a B-tree is typically defined as a recursive data structure. Each node in the tree can either be a leaf node or an internal node. A leaf node contains a list of values, while an internal node consists of a list of keys and a corresponding list of child nodes. The keys serve as separators, dividing the range of values stored in the tree into distinct intervals, with each child node corresponding to one of these intervals.

The manipulation of B-trees in functional languages is accomplished through recursive functions. For example, to search for a particular value within the tree, you would begin at the root node and recursively traverse the child nodes, following the path dictated by the keys. Similarly, when inserting a value into the tree, you would locate the appropriate leaf node and then recursively split and redistribute nodes as needed to preserve the properties of the B-tree.

A key feature of manipulating B-trees in functional programming is the concept of immutability. In functional languages, data structures are generally immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once created. Instead of modifying an existing B-tree, operations like insertion and deletion generate a new tree that shares most of its structure with the original. This immutability offers several benefits, including simplicity and thread safety; however, it may also lead to increased memory usage compared to the mutable approach prevalent in imperative languages.

Another significant aspect of functional programming is the use of higher-order functions. These functions can accept other functions as arguments or return them as results. In the context of B-trees, higher-order functions can be employed to abstract common recursion patterns, making the code more concise and comprehensible.

In summary, B-trees in functional programming languages are represented and manipulated through recursive data structures and functions, emphasizing immutability and higher-order functions. This methodology contrasts with that of imperative languages, presenting its own set of unique advantages and challenges.
