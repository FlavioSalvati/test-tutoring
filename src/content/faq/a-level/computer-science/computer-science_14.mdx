Bucket sort, also known as bin sort, is a distribution-based sorting algorithm that efficiently organizes the elements of an array by distributing them into a specified number of buckets. Each of these buckets is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm itself. Finally, the sorted values from all the buckets are concatenated to produce a single, sorted array.

The initial step in the bucket sort algorithm involves determining the appropriate number of buckets. This is typically done by identifying the maximum value in the array and dividing it by the size of the array, rounding up when necessary. Each bucket corresponds to a specific range of values, and the elements of the array are allocated to the buckets based on these defined ranges.

Once the elements are distributed among the buckets, each bucket is sorted independently. Although any sorting algorithm can be employed for this task, it is common to use another round of bucket sort or a simple comparison-based sort, such as insertion sort, especially since the elements within each bucket tend to be numerically close. This localized value similarity allows for efficient sorting.

After all the buckets have been sorted, the final step is to concatenate the elements back together to form a single, sorted array. This is achieved by iterating through the buckets in sequence and appending each element to the end of the output array.

One of the primary advantages of bucket sort is its efficiency, particularly in scenarios where elements can be distributed across multiple buckets. Because the sorting of each bucket can occur in parallel, bucket sort can significantly enhance performance on multi-core systems. However, it is important to note that bucket sort is not a comparison-based sorting algorithm and thus does not provide the same performance guarantees as algorithms like quicksort or mergesort. Additionally, bucket sort requires a considerable amount of extra memory to accommodate the buckets, which can be a drawback on systems with limited memory resources.
