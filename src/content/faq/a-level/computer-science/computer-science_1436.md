The hexadecimal representation of the decimal number $1207$ is $4B7$.

To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, you need to divide the decimal number by $16$, which is the base of the hexadecimal system, and keep track of the remainder. You continue this process by dividing the quotient by $16$ until the quotient reaches zero. The hexadecimal number is then formed by reading the remainders in reverse order.

Let’s go through the step-by-step conversion of the decimal number $1207$ to hexadecimal:

1. **Divide $1207$ by $16$.** The quotient is $75$ and the remainder is $7$. In hexadecimal, $7$ remains $7$.

2. **Divide the quotient $75$ by $16$.** The new quotient is $4$ and the remainder is $11$. In hexadecimal, $11$ is represented as $B$.

3. **Divide the new quotient $4$ by $16$.** The quotient is now $0$ and the remainder is $4$. In hexadecimal, $4$ remains $4$.

Now, if we read the remainders in reverse order, we obtain $4B7$. Thus, the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number $1207$ is $4B7$.

It’s important to note that in hexadecimal, the numbers from $10$ to $15$ are represented by the letters $A$ through $F$. Therefore, if you encounter a remainder of $10$, it is represented as $A$ in hexadecimal; $11$ is $B$, $12$ is $C$, $13$ is $D$, $14$ is $E$, and $15$ is $F$. This explains why, in our example, the remainder $11$ was represented as $B$.

This method of converting decimal numbers to hexadecimal is known as the division-remainder method. It is a fundamental concept in computer science, especially relevant in low-level programming and in understanding how data is stored and manipulated at the hardware level.
