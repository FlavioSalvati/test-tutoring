To convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent, you can follow a systematic process of division by $16$ while noting the remainders. This method is grounded in the fact that hexadecimal is a base-$16$ number system, utilizing $16$ distinct symbols to represent values. These symbols include the digits $0$ through $9$, as well as the letters $A$ through $F$, where $A$ represents $10$, $B$ represents $11$, continuing up to $F$, which represents $15$.

Here's how to perform the conversion:

1. **Divide the Decimal Number by 16:** Begin by dividing your decimal number by $16$. The quotient obtained will be used for the next division, while the remainder will be the least significant digit (the rightmost digit) of your hexadecimal number.

2. **Record the Remainder:** If the remainder is greater than $9$, substitute it with the corresponding hexadecimal letter ($A$ for $10$, $B$ for $11$, and so on, up to $F$ for $15$).

3. **Repeat the Process:** Continue dividing the quotient by $16$ and recording the remainders until the quotient reaches zero.

4. **Read the Remainders in Reverse Order:** Finally, the hexadecimal equivalent of your decimal number is formed by reading the remainders in reverse order, from the last remainder obtained to the first.

### Example Conversion

Let's convert the decimal number $254$ to hexadecimal:

1. Divide $254$ by $16$:
   - Quotient: $15$
   - Remainder: $14$

   The remainder $14$ corresponds to the letter $E$ in hexadecimal, so $E$ becomes the least significant digit.

2. Next, divide the quotient $15$ by $16$:
   - Quotient: $0$
   - Remainder: $15$

   The remainder $15$ corresponds to the letter $F$ in hexadecimal.

Since the quotient is now $0$, we stop here. 

3. Reading the remainders in reverse order gives us the hexadecimal equivalent of $254$, which is $FE$.

### Conclusion

This conversion process can be applied to any decimal number and is particularly useful in fields such as computer science, where hexadecimal notation is frequently used in programming and data representation. Understanding how to convert between these number systems enhances your ability to work with various data formats effectively.
