The heapsort algorithm is a method for sorting numbers that involves constructing a binary heap and then systematically removing the maximum element until the heap is empty.

Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that operates on an array of numbers. It utilizes a data structure known as a binary heap, which is a complete binary tree that adheres to the heap property. This property dictates that each parent node is either greater than or equal to its child nodes (in the case of a max heap) or less than or equal to its child nodes (in the case of a min heap).

The heapsort algorithm begins by converting the input array into a max heap. This transformation is achieved by iterating over the array from the middle to the beginning and "sifting down" each element to its appropriate position in the heap. This ensures that the largest element ends up at the root of the heap.

Once the heap has been constructed, the algorithm proceeds by repeatedly swapping the root (which contains the maximum element) with the last element of the heap. This operation effectively places the maximum element in its final sorted position within the array. The size of the heap is then reduced by one (excluding the last element), and the new root is sifted down to its correct position. This process continues until the heap is empty, resulting in a fully sorted array.

The efficiency of heapsort is one of its most appealing features. It has a worst-case and average time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms for handling large datasets. Additionally, heapsort performs sorting in-place, requiring only a constant amount of additional space.

It is important to note that heapsort is not a stable sorting algorithm; that is, equal elements may not retain their original relative order in the sorted array. This occurs because heapsort moves elements to their final positions without regard for their initial placements. Despite this limitation, heapsort is widely used due to its optimal time complexity and minimal space requirements.
