Analog signals are continuous waveforms, whereas digital signals are discrete and represent data in a binary format.

Analog signals are characterized by their continuous nature, changing smoothly over time. They can take on any value within a specific range, allowing for a detailed and accurate representation of information. However, this continuous variability also makes them vulnerable to noise and distortion. In communication systems, analog signals are commonly employed for voice transmission, as they effectively capture the continuous fluctuations in sound pressure that constitute human speech.

Conversely, digital signals are discrete, meaning they represent information using a binary system of ones and zeros. Unlike analog signals, digital signals do not change continuously but rather in distinct steps, with each step corresponding to a specific value. This discrete nature makes digital signals less susceptible to noise and distortion compared to their analog counterparts. Furthermore, digital signals can be easily processed and stored by computers, which enhances their suitability for data transmission.

The primary distinction between analog and digital signals lies in how they represent information. Analog signals can convey information in a more nuanced and precise manner due to their ability to assume any value within a given range. However, this flexibility increases their vulnerability to noise and distortion, as any alteration in the signal can result in a corresponding change in the conveyed information.

In contrast, digital signals represent information in a binary format. While this format may offer less detail and accuracy compared to analog signals, it also provides greater resilience against noise and distortion. The ease with which digital signals can be processed and stored by computers makes them the preferred choice for data transmission in contemporary communication systems.

In summary, although analog signals provide a more precise representation of information, they are more prone to noise and distortion. Digital signals, while potentially less accurate, are more robust and easier to process, making them ideal for data transmission in today's communication landscape.
