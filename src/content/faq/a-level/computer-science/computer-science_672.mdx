The bead sort algorithm operates by visualizing the elements of a list as beads arranged on vertical rods.

Bead sort, also referred to as gravity sort, is a natural sorting algorithm that functions as both a distribution sort and a bin sort. In this algorithm, the elements of the list are represented as beads on vertical rods, where the height of each rod corresponds to the value of the elements. The beads are allowed to "fall" down the rods, which results in them being arranged in sorted order.

To better understand how the bead sort algorithm functions, imagine an abacus. Each rod on the abacus represents a digit of the numbers that are to be sorted, while the beads on each rod represent the actual numbers. When the abacus is flipped, the beads fall down the rods, sorting themselves from the highest value to the lowest.

The algorithm begins by placing the beads on the rods according to the input list. Each bead signifies a single element of the list, while the height of the rod corresponds to the value of that element. Once the beads are positioned, they are allowed to "fall" down the rods. During this process, the beads arrange themselves in order from the highest value to the lowest. This occurs because the beads representing larger numbers will fall farther than those representing smaller numbers.

After all the beads have fallen, the algorithm reads the new order of the beads. This new arrangement represents the sorted list. The algorithm then returns this sorted list as its output.

Although bead sort is a simple and intuitive algorithm, it is not commonly used in practice. This is primarily due to its significant space requirements and its less favorable time complexity compared to other sorting algorithms. Nevertheless, bead sort serves as an effective educational tool for illustrating the principles of sorting algorithms, providing a clear visual representation of the sorting process.
