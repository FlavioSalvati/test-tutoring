An operating system (OS) is essential for managing power consumption in computer systems by employing various power management techniques, such as dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and CPU throttling.

The OS is responsible for optimizing the energy usage of a system's hardware components, which is particularly vital for battery-powered devices like laptops and smartphones. Effective power management can greatly enhance battery life by minimizing energy consumption during operation.

One of the primary techniques utilized by operating systems is dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). This method involves adjusting the voltage supplied to the processor based on its current workload. When the system is idle or handling less demanding tasks, the voltage—and consequently the power consumption—can be decreased. This practice not only conserves energy but also helps mitigate overheating.

Another significant technique is CPU throttling, also referred to as dynamic frequency scaling. This process reduces the CPU speed when the system is not under heavy load, further contributing to energy savings and reduced heat generation. Additionally, the operating system can place the CPU into a low-power state, known as the idle state, when it is not in active use.

Beyond managing CPU power consumption, the operating system also regulates the energy usage of other hardware components. For instance, it can turn off the display or put the hard drive into a low-power state when they are not in use. The OS can also oversee the power consumption of peripheral devices, such as printers and scanners.

Moreover, the operating system offers settings that empower users to customize their power usage. Users can specify when the display should be turned off or when the system should enter sleep mode. They can also adjust the balance between performance and power consumption according to their specific needs.

In summary, the operating system plays a pivotal role in managing power consumption. Through diverse power management strategies, it ensures that the system operates as efficiently as possible, thereby extending battery life and preventing overheating.
