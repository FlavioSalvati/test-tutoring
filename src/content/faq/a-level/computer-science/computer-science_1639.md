Code optimization in a compiler is accomplished through several techniques, including loop optimization, constant folding, dead code elimination, and strength reduction.

**Loop Optimization**  
Loop optimization involves modifying the structure of loops to minimize the overhead associated with loop control. This can take various forms, such as:

- **Loop Unrolling**: Replacing a loop with multiple copies of its body to decrease the number of iterations.
- **Loop Fusion**: Combining two or more loops that iterate over the same range into a single loop, thereby reducing the overhead of loop management.
- **Loop Inversion**: Transforming a 'while' loop into a 'do-while' loop, which can sometimes lead to better performance.

**Constant Folding**  
Constant folding is a technique where the compiler evaluates constant expressions during compilation rather than at runtime. For example, if the code contains the expression $3 \times 4$, the compiler will replace it with $12$ during the compilation process. This reduces the runtime computation needed, thereby enhancing program performance.

**Dead Code Elimination**  
Dead code elimination involves removing code segments that do not impact the program's output. This includes:

- Code that is never executed (such as statements following a 'return' statement in a function).
- Results from computations that are not utilized.
- Repeated calculations yielding the same result.

By eliminating such redundant code, the compiler can decrease the size of the compiled program and improve its execution speed.

**Strength Reduction**  
Strength reduction is a technique that substitutes a more computationally expensive operation with a cheaper one. For instance, a compiler might replace multiplication with addition, or division with multiplication by the reciprocal. This approach can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when the operations are executed frequently.

In addition to these primary techniques, compilers employ other optimization methods, including:

- **Function Inlining**: Substituting a function call with the function's body to eliminate the overhead of the call.
- **Peephole Optimization**: Optimizing small sections of code to improve efficiency.
- **Data-flow Analysis**: Examining the flow of data values within the program to identify optimization opportunities.

These techniques collectively enhance the efficiency and performance of the compiled program, resulting in faster and more effective execution.
