An octree is a tree data structure specifically designed for partitioning three-dimensional space into smaller, manageable sections.

More precisely, an octree is a hierarchical tree structure commonly utilized in computer graphics and 3D game development to efficiently organize and manage spatial data. The term 'octree' is derived from the fact that each node in the tree can have up to eight children, corresponding to the eight octants in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

The root node of an octree encompasses the entire three-dimensional space. This space is recursively subdivided into eight smaller cubes, known as 'octants', each represented by a child node. This subdivision process continues until a predetermined level of detail is reached, or until each node contains a single point or no points at all.

Octrees are particularly advantageous for various tasks, such as collision detection, visibility determination, and data compression within 3D environments. For instance, in a 3D game, an octree can swiftly identify which objects are potentially visible from a specific viewpoint or detect potential collisions between objects. This is accomplished by examining only the relevant nodes (and their associated spatial regions) related to the task at hand, instead of checking every individual object in the three-dimensional space.

Additionally, octrees can be employed to compress 3D data by leveraging spatial coherence. For example, if a large area of three-dimensional space is empty or contains uniform data, it can be represented by a single node in the octree, eliminating the need to store information for every point within that region. This approach can lead to considerable savings in memory and computational resources.

In summary, the primary function of an octree in three-dimensional space is to provide an efficient mechanism for partitioning and managing that space, thereby facilitating tasks such as collision detection, visibility determination, and data compression.
