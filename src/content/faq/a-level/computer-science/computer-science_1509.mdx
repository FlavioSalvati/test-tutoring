In pre-order traversal, a binary tree is explored in a specific sequence: root, left subtree, and then right subtree.

Pre-order traversal is a form of depth-first traversal commonly used for binary trees in computer science. The term 'pre-order' signifies that the root node is processed before (pre) the nodes in its subtrees. This traversal method follows a recursive approach and adheres to a defined order: first, the root node is visited, followed by the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

To begin, you start by visiting the root node of the binary tree, which represents the 'pre' aspect of pre-order traversal. Next, you proceed to the left subtree and repeat the process: visit the root of the left subtree (which now becomes the 'current' root), then explore its left subtree, and continue this pattern until you reach a node that has no left child. At that point, you will begin visiting the right child.

Once the entire left subtree has been traversed, the same process is applied to the right subtree. You will visit the root of the right subtree, then its left subtree, and continue in this manner. If a node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), you simply visit that node.

This traversal method is particularly beneficial when you need to create a duplicate of the tree or obtain a prefix expression from a binary tree. Additionally, pre-order traversal is inherently recursive, with the base case occurring when a null subtree is encountered.

Regarding implementation, pre-order traversal can be executed using both iterative and recursive methods. The recursive approach is generally more intuitive: a function is called on the root, which subsequently calls itself on the left child and then on the right child. The iterative approach, on the other hand, utilizes a stack to keep track of the nodes.

In summary, pre-order traversal is a structured technique for visiting all nodes in a binary tree, ensuring that the root node is visited before its subtrees. It is a fundamental concept in tree-based data structures, with numerous applications in various computer science challenges.
