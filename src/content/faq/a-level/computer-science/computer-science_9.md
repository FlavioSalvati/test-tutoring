In ASCII, each character is represented by a unique 7-bit binary number.

ASCII, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard widely used to represent text in computers and other text-based devices. Each character in the ASCII standard corresponds to a unique 7-bit binary number. For instance, the uppercase letter 'A' is represented by the binary number $1000001$, which is equivalent to $65$ in decimal.

The ASCII standard defines a total of $128$ characters, comprising $95$ printable characters and $33$ non-printable control characters. The printable characters include digits ($0$ to $9$), lowercase letters ($a$ to $z$), uppercase letters ($A$ to $Z$), and various punctuation symbols. The control characters, on the other hand, were originally designed to manage hardware devices. For example, the carriage return (CR) character instructs a printer to return its print head to the beginning of the line.

The ASCII standard was initially developed from telegraphic codes. Its first commercial application emerged as a seven-bit teleprinter code, which was promoted by Bell data services. Work on ASCII commenced in the early $1960$s, with the first version published in $1963$. Early computers utilized ASCII for all text-based input and output operations.

ASCII is also a subset of Unicode, a more extensive standard that encompasses characters from most of the world's writing systems. In Unicode, the first $128$ characters align with those in ASCII, meaning that any text encoded in ASCII is also valid in Unicode.

In summary, ASCII is a method for encoding characters as numerical values that can be processed by computers. Each character is represented by a distinct 7-bit binary number, allowing for the representation of $128$ different characters. This set includes both printable characters, such as letters and numbers, as well as control characters that facilitate the operation of hardware devices.
