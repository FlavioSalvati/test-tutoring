Boolean values are represented in binary using $1$ for true and $0$ for false.

The binary number system, which is a base $2$ system, consists of only two possible values for each digit: $0$ and $1$. These values correspond directly to the two states of a Boolean value: false and true, respectively. This concept is fundamental in computer science, as binary serves as the foundational language for computers.

When a computer processes data, it manipulates binary digits, commonly referred to as bits. Each bit can represent either a $0$ or a $1$, and these bits are utilized to encode various types of data, such as numbers, text, images, and more. The representation of Boolean values, however, is quite straightforward: a Boolean value of true is denoted by a binary $1$, while a Boolean value of false is denoted by a binary $0$.

This binary representation of Boolean values is prevalent in multiple areas of computer science. For instance, in programming, Boolean values are often used to control the flow of execution within a program. If a specific condition evaluates to true ($1$), a designated block of code will be executed; conversely, if the condition evaluates to false ($0$), that block of code will be bypassed.

In the realm of digital electronics, Boolean values represent the states of electronic switches or gates. An "on" switch, which allows current to flow, is represented as a $1$, whereas an "off" switch, which prevents current from flowing, is represented as a $0$. This binary representation forms the basis of how computers process and store data.

In summary, Boolean values are represented in binary with $1$ indicating true and $0$ indicating false. This simple yet powerful binary representation is a cornerstone of computer science and is utilized across various domains, from programming to digital electronics.
