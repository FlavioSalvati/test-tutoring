A compiler utilizes intermediate code as an essential transitional representation of the source code, facilitating the process of translating it into target machine code.

During the compilation process, the source code, which is written by a programmer, is transformed into machine code that can be executed by a computer. This transformation occurs not in a single step, but through a series of distinct stages. One crucial stage in this process is the generation of intermediate code.

Intermediate code serves as a lower-level representation of the source code, yet it is not yet machine code. It occupies a position between the high-level language of the source code and the low-level language of machine code. Typically, this intermediate code resembles assembly language but remains machine-independent, meaning it is not bound to any specific hardware architecture.

The employment of intermediate code offers several significant advantages. First and foremost, it streamlines the compilation process. The compiler can concentrate on translating the high-level source code into intermediate code without needing to consider the particulars of the target machine. Subsequently, a dedicated section of the compiler, often referred to as the code generator, handles the conversion of the intermediate code into machine code.

Secondly, the use of intermediate code enables code optimization. The compiler can analyze the intermediate code to make various enhancements, such as eliminating redundant instructions or rearranging instructions to improve performance. Importantly, these optimizations can be performed without altering the original source code.

Finally, the incorporation of intermediate code enhances the portability of the compiler. Since this intermediate code is machine-independent, the same compiler can be employed to generate code for different types of machines. All that is required is a distinct code generator tailored for each specific machine architecture.

In summary, the compiler leverages intermediate code as a crucial intermediary step in the transformation of source code into machine code. This strategy allows the compiler to decompose the intricate task of compilation into more manageable steps, optimize the code for enhanced performance, and support a diverse range of machine types.
