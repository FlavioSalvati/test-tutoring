The Strand Sort algorithm sorts a list by repeatedly extracting sorted sublists from an unsorted list and merging them together.

Strand Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that operates by dividing the original unsorted list into smaller sorted sublists. It then merges these sublists until the entire list is sorted. The term 'Strand Sort' derives from the way the algorithm 'strands' or isolates sorted sequences from the unsorted list.

The algorithm commences by examining the first element in the list, which serves as the starting point for a new sublist. It then proceeds through the remaining elements of the list, checking each one sequentially. If an element is found that is larger than the last element in the current sublist, it is removed from the main list and appended to the end of the sublist. This process continues until all elements have been examined, resulting in a fully sorted sublist that is then merged back into the main list.

The merging process is also straightforward. The algorithm compares the first elements of both the main list and the sublist. The smaller of the two elements is removed from its respective list and added to the end of the output list. This continues until one of the lists is exhausted, at which point all remaining elements from the non-empty list are appended to the output list.

The algorithm then repeats this process: it creates a new sublist from the remaining unsorted elements in the main list and merges it into the output list. This cycle continues until the main list is empty and all elements have been sorted.

Strand Sort is particularly efficient for sorting lists with many pre-sorted elements. However, it has a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$, which makes it less suitable for large lists or those that are significantly out of order. Nonetheless, it is a valuable algorithm to study as it reinforces the concept of divide and conquer, a fundamental principle in computer science.
