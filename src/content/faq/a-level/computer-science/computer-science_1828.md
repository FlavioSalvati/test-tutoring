The 'COMMIT' command in SQL plays a crucial role in transaction management by permanently saving all changes made during a transaction to the database.

In SQL, the 'COMMIT' command is classified as a transaction control language command. It is used to ensure that all modifications made by the current transaction—such as 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', and 'DELETE' operations—are permanently recorded in the database. Initially, these changes are not immediately reflected in the database; instead, they are stored in a temporary area. This approach allows for error handling: if any of the queries in the transaction fail, all changes can be rolled back, restoring the database to its state before the transaction began.

The significance of the 'COMMIT' command becomes clear at this stage. When you execute the 'COMMIT' command, all changes that were temporarily stored are permanently applied to the database. It is important to note that once the 'COMMIT' command is executed, the changes cannot be undone. Therefore, it is essential to use the 'COMMIT' command with caution. If there is any uncertainty about the correctness of the queries in your transaction, it is advisable to refrain from executing 'COMMIT'. Instead, you should validate your queries first, and only when you are confident in their accuracy should you execute the 'COMMIT' command.

Furthermore, the 'COMMIT' command also releases any locks that were held by the transaction. This release is vital in a multi-user environment, as it enables other transactions to access data that was previously locked by the current transaction. 

In summary, the 'COMMIT' command in SQL is a powerful tool that allows you to manage when the changes made by your transaction are finalized in the database. It ensures that only correct and validated changes are saved, thereby maintaining the integrity of the data.
