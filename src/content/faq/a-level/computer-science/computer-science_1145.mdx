A circular queue can be effectively implemented using an array by maintaining two pointers: `front` and `rear`, which are used to track the elements in the queue.

A circular queue, also referred to as a ring buffer, is a linear data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The term "circular" refers to the way the last element in the queue points back to the first element, creating a circular connection. To implement a circular queue using an array, you must initialize an array of a specified size and set both pointers, `front` and `rear`, to $-1$ initially.

The `front` pointer serves the purpose of removing elements from the queue, while the `rear` pointer is responsible for adding elements. When an element is enqueued (added), the `rear` pointer is incremented, and the new element is placed in the array at the index indicated by `rear`. Conversely, when an element is dequeued (removed), the `front` pointer is incremented, and the element at the index indicated by `front` is removed.

To maintain the circular nature of the queue, the modulus operator is utilized. When incrementing either the `rear` or `front` pointer, the incremented value is taken modulo the size of the array. This method ensures that when the end of the array is reached, the pointer wraps around to the beginning.

For instance, if the size of the array is $5$ and the `rear` pointer is currently at index $4$ (the last index), upon enqueuing a new element, the `rear` pointer would initially increment to $5$. However, applying the modulus operation ($5 \mod 5$) resets the `rear` pointer back to $0$.

It is crucial to manage the conditions when the queue is full or empty. The queue is considered empty when both `front` and `rear` are set to $-1$. Conversely, the queue is deemed full when the next increment of `rear`, taken modulo the size of the array, equals `front`. In this scenario, no additional elements can be added until some are removed.

In conclusion, implementing a circular queue with an array requires careful handling of the `front` and `rear` pointers to preserve the circular structure of the queue, as well as effectively addressing the situations when the queue is either full or empty.
