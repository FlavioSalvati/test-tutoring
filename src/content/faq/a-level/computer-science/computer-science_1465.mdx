An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains a strict balance by ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node does not exceed one.

The term "AVL" stands for the names of its creators, Adelson-Velsky and Landis. This type of binary search tree employs a balancing technique known as AVL balancing, which helps keep the tree approximately balanced. Maintaining this balance is crucial because the efficiency of operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is directly related to the tree's height. A shallower tree results in faster operations, thereby enhancing overall performance.

To preserve balance, an AVL tree tracks the 'balance factor' of each node, defined as the difference in height between the node's left and right subtrees. In an AVL tree, a node's balance factor must be one of the following values: $-1$, $0$, or $1$. If any node's balance factor falls outside this range, a rotation operation is triggered to restore balance.

There are four types of rotations involved in AVL balancing: left-left, right-right, left-right, and right-left. The designation of these rotations indicates the "heavy" side of the unbalanced subtree. For instance, a left-left rotation is applied when the left subtree of a node's left child is heavier than the right subtree. These rotation operations rearrange the nodes in the tree to minimize its height.

When an insertion or deletion occurs in an AVL tree, the operation is first executed as it would be in a standard binary search tree. Following this, the tree checks the balance factors of all affected nodes, starting from the newly modified node and moving up to the root. If an unbalanced node is detected, the appropriate rotation is performed to restore the balance.

In summary, an AVL tree is an intelligent adaptation of a binary search tree that utilizes balance factors and rotation operations to maintain a near-balanced structure. This approach ensures that the tree's depth remains minimal, which in turn optimizes the efficiency of operations performed on the tree.
