The merge sort algorithm operates by dividing an unsorted list into $n$ sublists, each containing a single element, and then successively merging these sublists to create new sorted sublists until only one sublist remains.

Merge sort is a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm that was developed by John von Neumann in 1945. Its fundamental principle involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. Specifically, when sorting a list of items, the merge sort algorithm begins by dividing the unsorted list into $n$ sublists, each consisting of a single element. It then repeatedly merges these sublists to form new sorted sublists until a single sorted sublist remains.

The algorithm initiates the sorting process by splitting the unsorted list into two halves. If the list contains one or zero elements, it is already considered sorted. However, if the list has more than one element, it is divided into two approximately equal halves. This splitting process is applied recursively until sublists of size one are obtained.

Sublists of size one are inherently sorted. At this point, the merging process begins. Adjacent sublists are combined in such a way that the resulting sublist remains sorted. This is achieved by comparing the smallest elements of each sublist and adding the smaller element to the new sublist. This comparison and addition process continues until all elements have been merged back into a single, sorted list.

The merge sort algorithm demonstrates high efficiency, boasting a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$ in all scenarios, including best, average, and worst cases. This efficiency arises from the fact that the list is halved with each recursive call, and every item in the list is eventually processed and sorted.

However, a notable drawback of the merge sort algorithm is that it requires additional space proportional to the size of the input list. This is due to the algorithm's need to create new sublists as it divides the original list. Consequently, this memory requirement can be a significant limitation, especially with large lists or in environments with constrained memory resources.

In conclusion, the merge sort algorithm is a robust and efficient sorting technique that systematically divides a list into smaller sublists and subsequently merges them in a sorted order.
