HTTP/2 enhances web performance by introducing several key features, including multiplexing, header compression, and server push. These innovations work together to reduce latency and accelerate page load times.

HTTP/2, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2, represents a significant update to the HTTP network protocol utilized by the World Wide Web. One of its most notable advancements is **multiplexing**, which allows multiple requests and responses to be processed concurrently over a single TCP connection. This is a considerable improvement over HTTP/1.1, which necessitates establishing a new TCP connection for each request-response pair. As a result, HTTP/1.1 can suffer from increased latency and slower page loads.

Another important feature of HTTP/2 is **header compression**. HTTP headers often contain repetitive data, which can hinder web performance. To address this issue, HTTP/2 employs a compression algorithm known as HPACK, which minimizes the size of these headers. By reducing the amount of data that must be transmitted, this feature contributes to faster page loads.

HTTP/2 also introduces **server push**, a capability that enables servers to proactively send resources to clients before they are explicitly requested. For example, when a client requests an HTML document, the server can simultaneously dispatch the associated CSS and JavaScript files, eliminating the need to wait for the client to request these resources separately. This approach reduces the number of round-trip times (RTTs) required to fully load a page, further enhancing web performance.

In addition to these primary features, HTTP/2 incorporates other improvements such as **stream prioritization**, which allows more critical requests to be processed before less important ones, and **flow control**, a mechanism that prevents senders from overwhelming receivers with excessive data. Collectively, these enhancements make HTTP/2 a powerful tool for boosting web performance.

However, it is crucial to recognize that while HTTP/2 can lead to substantial improvements in web performance, it is not a panacea. Factors such as the quality of a website's code and the user's internet connection speed also play significant roles in determining overall performance. Nevertheless, by facilitating multiplexing, header compression, and server push, HTTP/2 can greatly contribute to lowering latency and accelerating page load times.
