The bucket sort algorithm organizes elements by distributing them into distinct buckets, followed by individually sorting these buckets.

Also referred to as bin sort, bucket sort is a distribution-based sorting algorithm that works by distributing elements of an array into several buckets. Each bucket is then sorted independently, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort itself. Finally, the sorted values from all buckets are merged to form the fully sorted array.

The process begins by establishing a 'bucket range', which defines the range of values that each bucket can accommodate. This is typically achieved by dividing the maximum value in the array by the total number of buckets. For example, if the maximum value is $100$ and there are $10$ buckets, each bucket would cover a range of $10$ values.

Next, the algorithm iterates through the array, assigning each element to the appropriate bucket based on its value relative to the bucket range. For instance, with a bucket range of $10$, an element with a value of $35$ would be placed into the fourth bucket, as it falls between $30$ and $40$.

Once all elements have been allocated to their respective buckets, the next step is to sort each bucket individually. This can be accomplished using any sorting algorithm; however, it is common to apply the bucket sort algorithm recursively. This approach is particularly effective when the elements are uniformly distributed across the range, as it can significantly reduce the overall sorting time.

Finally, the sorted values from each bucket are concatenated to generate the final sorted array. This is done by iterating through the buckets in order and appending the elements from each bucket to the output array.

In terms of complexity, bucket sort performs optimally when the input data is uniformly distributed over the defined range. In such cases, it can achieve a time complexity of $O(n)$, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms available. However, if the input is not uniformly distributed, the performance may degrade to $O(n^2)$, which is comparable to the worst-case performance of simpler comparison-based sorting algorithms.
