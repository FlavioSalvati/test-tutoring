The Gnome Sort algorithm operates by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are not in the correct order.

Also known as Stupid Sort, Gnome Sort is a straightforward yet effective sorting algorithm that resembles the Bubble Sort in its approach. The algorithm gets its name from the whimsical image of a garden gnome sorting a row of flower pots. The gnome begins at the start of the line, comparing the current pot with the next one. If they are in the correct order, the gnome moves forward. However, if they are in the wrong order, the gnome swaps the two pots and steps back to compare the newly swapped pot with the one before it. This process continues until the gnome reaches the end of the line, ensuring that all the pots are sorted.

The algorithm begins by examining the first element of an array. It compares this current element with the subsequent one. If the current element is smaller than the next, they are considered to be in the correct order, and the gnome proceeds to the next element. Conversely, if the current element is larger, indicating they are in the wrong order, the two elements are swapped. The gnome then moves back one position to compare the swapped element with the previous one. This is necessary because the newly swapped element may still be larger than the one preceding it, and thus needs further verification.

This iterative process continues, with the gnome advancing when the elements are correctly ordered and retreating when they are not, until the end of the array is reached. At this point, all elements will have been sorted into their appropriate order.

While Gnome Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, possessing a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$, it is easy to understand and implement. Additionally, it is an example of a stable sorting algorithm, which means it preserves the relative order of equal elements. This characteristic can be crucial in certain applications where maintaining the original sequence of equivalent items is important.
