A suffix tree is a specialized data structure designed for efficient string matching and searching operations within a given text.

Also referred to as a PAT tree, a suffix tree is a compressed trie that contains all the suffixes of the input text as keys, with their corresponding positions in the text as values. This structure serves as a powerful tool in various domains of string manipulation and analysis, including pattern matching, data compression, and bioinformatics.

The primary function of a suffix tree in string matching is to facilitate quick searches for patterns within a text. Once the suffix tree is constructed, one can determine whether a string pattern $P$ of length $m$ exists as a substring in the text in $O(m)$ time, a significant improvement over naive search algorithms. This efficient search is accomplished by traversing the tree from the root and following the path labeled with the pattern $P$. If such a path exists, then the pattern $P$ is confirmed to be a substring of the text.

In addition to searching, suffix trees can tackle a variety of string-related problems. For example, they can be employed to identify the longest repeated substring, the longest common substring between two strings, and the longest palindrome within a given string. All these challenges can be addressed in linear time once the suffix tree for the text is established.

Constructing a suffix tree for a text of length $n$ can be completed in $O(n)$ time using Ukkonen's algorithm. This algorithm builds the suffix tree incrementally by adding one character at a time from the text. After each character is added, the tree accurately reflects all the suffixes of the text processed thus far.

In summary, suffix trees play a crucial role in string matching by providing an efficient data structure that enables rapid searching and the resolution of various string problems. They are fundamental tools in computer science, particularly in fields that require fast and efficient string operations.
