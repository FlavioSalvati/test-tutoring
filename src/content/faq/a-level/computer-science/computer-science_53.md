An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a high-level conceptual framework that describes a collection of data and the operations that can be performed on that data.

More specifically, an ADT encapsulates both the data structures and the set of operations applicable to them. The term "abstract" signifies that it provides a general overview of the functionalities of the data type without delving into the specifics of how these functionalities are executed. This principle, known as data abstraction, keeps the implementation details hidden from the user, allowing programmers to concentrate on what the data type accomplishes rather than how it accomplishes it.

For instance, consider the List ADT. This ADT represents a collection of items and defines various operations, such as:

- Adding an item to the list
- Removing an item from the list
- Checking if the list is empty
- Determining the size of the list

However, the List ADT does not dictate how these operations are carried out. The underlying implementation could utilize an array, a linked list, or another data structure altogether. Users of the List ADT do not need to understand or concern themselves with these implementation details.

Another example is the Stack ADT. A stack is a collection of elements characterized by two primary operations: 

- Push (adding an element to the top of the stack)
- Pop (removing the top element from the stack)

Similar to the List ADT, the Stack ADT does not specify the implementation method for these operations. A stack may be realized using an array, a linked list, or another data structure.

In both examples, the ADT provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface while concealing the complexities of the underlying implementation. This encapsulation is a fundamental principle of software engineering, referred to as abstraction. It enables the construction of complex systems from simpler components, each of which can be understood and tested independently.
