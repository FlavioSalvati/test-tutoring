A relational database effectively manages relationships between tables through the use of keys, specifically primary keys and foreign keys.

In a relational database, data is organized into tables, each identified by a unique identifier known as a primary key. This primary key allows for the unique identification of each record within a table. Relationships between distinct tables are established using these primary keys alongside another type of key known as a foreign key. A foreign key is a field (or a collection of fields) in one table that links to the primary key in another table.

The table that contains the foreign key is referred to as the child table, while the table that holds the primary key is called the parent table. These keys enable databases to match related data across tables, facilitating the integration of data from two or more tables through a single database query. This capability is a fundamental aspect of the relational database model, which organizes data into tables interconnected by common fields.

Several types of relationships can be established between tables in a relational database. The most common types include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. In a one-to-one relationship, each row in the first table corresponds to exactly one row in the second table. In a one-to-many relationship, a single row in the first table can relate to one or more rows in the second table. Conversely, in a many-to-many relationship, multiple records in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table.

Managing these relationships is essential for maintaining data integrity within the database. For example, database systems enforce referential integrity rules to ensure these relationships remain intact. This means that the database will prevent any changes that could lead to inconsistent data. For instance, if a record in a parent table is deleted, the database system will either delete any related records in the child table or prevent the deletion if related records exist.

In summary, a relational database manages relationships between different tables using keys and referential integrity rules. This structure allows for efficient querying and ensures the consistency and reliability of the data stored within the database.
