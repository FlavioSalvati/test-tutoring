The Von Neumann architecture utilizes a single memory and bus system for both data and instructions, whereas the Harvard architecture features distinct systems for each.

The Von Neumann architecture, named after the mathematician and physicist John Von Neumann, is based on his 1945 design. This architecture is characterized by a unified memory space that stores both instructions (the program) and data. Consequently, both instructions and data share the same memory channels, which can lead to a performance limitation known as the Von Neumann bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the restricted data transfer rate between the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, especially when compared to the vast amount of memory available.

In contrast, the Harvard architecture employs separate memory systems and buses for instructions and data. Originally implemented in the Harvard Mark I relay-based computer, this design allows for simultaneous fetching of data and instructions, effectively eliminating the bottleneck that plagues the Von Neumann architecture. This separation enhances speed and efficiency, making the Harvard architecture particularly advantageous for real-time signal processing and complex computational tasks.

Despite its performance benefits, the Von Neumann architecture is simpler and more cost-effective to implement, requiring fewer hardware resources. Furthermore, it offers greater flexibility since the memory size does not need to be predetermined during the design phase. Conversely, while the Harvard architecture provides improved speed and efficiency, it is more complex and expensive to set up. Additionally, it lacks the flexibility of the Von Neumann architecture, as the sizes of the instruction and data memories must be established at design time.

In contemporary computing, many systems adopt a modified Harvard architecture. In this approach, the CPU is equipped with separate instruction and data caches—small, high-speed memory areas—at the first level, allowing for the speed benefits associated with Harvard architecture while still sharing main memory to retain the affordability and flexibility of the Von Neumann design. This hybrid model is often referred to as the Harvard-Von Neumann architecture.
