**Strong Typing vs. Weak Typing in Programming Languages**

In programming languages, the distinction between strong typing and weak typing revolves around how strictly type rules are enforced and how type conversions are handled.

**Strong Typing**  
Strong typing is a concept wherein the type of a variable is checked at compile-time, with strict enforcement of type rules. This means that if you attempt to perform an operation that is incompatible with the variable's type, the compiler will generate an error. For instance, in a strongly typed language like Python, attempting to add a string and an integer together will result in an error, as these two types are not compatible. This rigorous enforcement of type rules helps prevent errors and bugs in the code by ensuring that operations are only conducted on compatible types. 

**Weak Typing**  
Conversely, weak typing offers greater flexibility in terms of type conversions and operations. In weakly typed languages, type checking occurs at runtime, and the language often automatically converts types to facilitate operations. For example, in a weakly typed language like JavaScript, you can add a string and a number together, and the language will automatically convert the number to a string before executing the operation. This can simplify coding, as developers do not need to explicitly manage type conversions. However, this flexibility can also lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-diagnose bugs, as automatic type conversions may not always behave as anticipated.

**Summary for A-Level Computer Science**  
In summary, strong typing strictly enforces type rules and validates types at compile-time, which helps to prevent type-related errors but can introduce complexity. In contrast, weak typing checks types at runtime and allows for automatic type conversions, making coding more straightforward but potentially leading to unexpected results and bugs.
