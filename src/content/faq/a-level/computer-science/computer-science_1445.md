A composite key is defined as a combination of two or more columns in a database table that collectively serve to uniquely identify each row. This contrasts with a primary key, which consists of a single column.

To elaborate, a primary key is a unique identifier for records within a database table. It is characterized by a single column that contains unique values, ensuring that no two rows can have the same value in that column. The primary key plays a critical role in maintaining data integrity and facilitating relationships between tables in a relational database. It is a foundational concept in database design, essential for efficient data storage and quick retrieval.

In contrast, a composite key—also referred to as a compound key or concatenated key—consists of two or more columns. These columns, when combined, serve to uniquely identify a row within the table. While individual columns in a composite key may contain duplicate values, the combination of values across all columns must be unique. This distinction is crucial for understanding the function of keys in databases.

For example, consider a table that records the grades of students across various subjects. This table may include the columns 'StudentID', 'Subject', and 'Grade'. Here, neither 'StudentID' nor 'Subject' can serve as a primary key on their own, as a single student can enroll in multiple subjects, and each subject may be taken by multiple students. However, the combination of 'StudentID' and 'Subject' can function as a composite key, since a student can receive a grade for each subject only once. This understanding is essential for structuring databases that effectively manage the storage, retrieval, and updating of data.
