Public IP addresses are globally unique identifiers that allow devices to be accessed over the internet, whereas private IP addresses are designated for use within local networks and are not directly accessible from the internet.

Public IP addresses are allocated by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and are utilized when connecting to the internet. Each public IP address is unique across the entire web, ensuring that every device connected to the internet has its own distinct address. This can be likened to your home address, which is essential for the accurate delivery of mail. Public IP addresses are essential for websites, servers, and any device that requires direct access from the internet.

In contrast, private IP addresses are employed within local networks, such as those found in homes, offices, or businesses. These addresses cannot be accessed directly from the internet; rather, they are concealed behind a router or another network device that utilizes Network Address Translation (NAT). This allows multiple devices to share the same private IP address, provided that they are on different networks. For instance, the IP address $192.168.1.1$ is a commonly used private IP address and can be found in numerous separate networks.

The primary purpose of private IP addresses is to conserve the limited pool of public IP addresses available. With the increasing number of devices requiring internet connectivity, the IPv4 addressing system—still widely used for public IP addresses—cannot provide a unique address for every device. By employing private IP addresses within local networks, only the router (or similar device) requires a public IP address. All other devices on the network utilize private IP addresses, with the router overseeing traffic and connections to the internet.

In summary, public IP addresses are unique and globally accessible identifiers for devices that connect directly to the internet. In contrast, private IP addresses are utilized within local networks, are not directly accessible from the internet, and can be reused across different networks.
