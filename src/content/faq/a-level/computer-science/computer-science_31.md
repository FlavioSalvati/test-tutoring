The binary representation of the hexadecimal number $2F$ is $0010 \, 1111$.

To convert a hexadecimal number to binary, each digit in the hexadecimal system is replaced by its binary equivalent. The hexadecimal system is a base-16 numeral system, while the binary system is base-2. Hexadecimal utilizes the digits $0-9$ and the letters $A-F$ to represent the decimal values $0-15$. In binary, these values are expressed using four digits.

The hexadecimal number $2F$ consists of two digits: $2$ and $F$. The binary equivalent of the digit $2$ is $0010$, while the letter $F$ corresponds to the decimal number $15$, which is represented in binary as $1111$. Thus, by substituting each hexadecimal digit in $2F$ with its respective binary equivalent, we arrive at the binary representation $0010 \, 1111$.

This conversion process is straightforward because both hexadecimal and binary are positional numeral systems, with $16$ being a power of $2$. As a result, each hexadecimal digit can be directly mapped to a unique four-digit binary number. This direct relationship simplifies the conversion between these two systems, which is particularly useful in computer science. Computers operate using binary to process data, while hexadecimal offers a more compact and human-readable format for representation.
