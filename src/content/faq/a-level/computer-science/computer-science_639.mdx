A syntax error refers to a mistake in the structure of the code, while a runtime error occurs during the execution of the program.

To elaborate, a syntax error is directly associated with the rules and structure of the programming language being used. This type of error arises when the code does not adhere to the specified syntax. For example, in languages like Java or C++, forgetting to include a semicolon at the end of a statement or failing to properly close a bracket can result in a syntax error. These errors are typically caught by the compiler or interpreter before the program is executed, thereby preventing it from running until the issues are resolved. Fortunately, syntax errors are often easier to correct since compilers or interpreters usually provide detailed messages indicating the location and nature of the error.

Conversely, a runtime error is an error that occurs while the program is actively runningâ€”hence the term 'runtime'. Unlike syntax errors, these issues are not identified by the compiler or interpreter during the initial compilation or interpretation phase; they only emerge during program execution. Runtime errors can arise from a variety of situations, such as attempting to divide by zero, trying to access a null object, or using a variable that has not been initialized. These errors can be more challenging to diagnose and fix compared to syntax errors, as they may be unpredictable and their underlying causes can be difficult to trace.

In summary, syntax errors and runtime errors represent two distinct categories of programming errors. Syntax errors pertain to the structure of the code and are detected prior to execution, while runtime errors manifest during program execution and can stem from numerous issues. Recognizing the differences between these two types of errors is essential for effective debugging and problem-solving in programming.
