The Quicksort algorithm is a highly efficient sorting method that organizes an array by dividing it into two smaller sub-arrays around a pivot element and then recursively sorting those sub-arrays.

Quicksort, also referred to as partition-exchange sort, utilizes the divide-and-conquer strategy. The algorithm begins by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the remaining elements into two sub-arrays: those that are less than the pivot and those that are greater than it. After partitioning, the algorithm recursively sorts the resulting sub-arrays.

The initial step in the Quicksort algorithm is to choose a pivot. This can be any element of the array, such as the first element, the last element, the median, or a randomly chosen element. While the choice of pivot does not affect the correctness of the algorithm, it can greatly influence its efficiency. A common approach is to select the last element of the array as the pivot.

Once the pivot is chosen, the algorithm proceeds to partition the array. It employs two pointers—one starting at the beginning of the array and the other at the end. The algorithm moves these pointers toward each other until they find elements that are on the incorrect side of the pivot. When such elements are found, they are swapped. This process continues until the two pointers meet, at which point the pivot is swapped with the element located at the position of the pointers. This ensures that the pivot is placed in its final sorted position, with all elements to its left being smaller and all elements to its right being larger.

After partitioning, the algorithm recursively applies the same procedure to the sub-arrays formed by the elements to the left and right of the pivot. This recursion continues until the base case is reached, which occurs when a sub-array contains only one element or is empty.

Quicksort is classified as an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it sorts the array by directly modifying it, without the need to create a new array. This characteristic makes it space-efficient. However, it is important to note that the worst-case time complexity of Quicksort is $O(n^2)$, which can arise when the array is already sorted or sorted in reverse order. Despite this potential drawback, Quicksort often outperforms other $O(n \log n)$ sorting algorithms, such as mergesort or heapsort, in practice, due to the efficiency of its inner loop on most computer architectures.
