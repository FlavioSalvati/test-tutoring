A 2-3 tree is a type of balanced search tree characterized by its nodes, which can either be 2-nodes or 3-nodes. 

Specifically, a 2-3 tree is a variant of a B-tree that is self-balancing. This means that it automatically restructures itself to maintain balance as elements are inserted or removed, making it an efficient data structure for operations such as searching, inserting, and deleting elements. The "2-3" in its name indicates the possible number of child nodes for each parent node. A 2-node contains one key and has two children, where the left child holds values less than the key and the right child contains values greater than the key. Conversely, a 3-node contains two keys and has three children; in this case, the left child holds values less than the first key, the middle child contains values between the two keys, and the right child holds values greater than the second key.

Inserting a new element into a 2-3 tree involves locating the appropriate leaf node based on the value of the element. If the target leaf node is a 2-node, it can be expanded into a 3-node simply by adding the new element. However, if the leaf node is already a 3-node, it must be split into two 2-nodes, with the middle key being promoted to the parent node. This splitting process may need to recur if the parent node is also a 3-node, potentially continuing up to the root of the tree.

Deletion in a 2-3 tree is somewhat more intricate. If the key to be deleted resides in a leaf node, it can be removed directly. If the key is located in an internal node, it is replaced by its predecessor or successor (which will be in a leaf node), after which that leaf node is deleted. If the deletion results in a node having no keys, the tree must be restructured to ensure all remaining nodes are either 2-nodes or 3-nodes.

In conclusion, a 2-3 tree is a versatile and efficient data structure that maintains balance to facilitate quick operations such as searching, insertion, and deletion. Its flexible structure, allowing each node to have either two or three children, enables it to dynamically adapt as elements are added or removed.
