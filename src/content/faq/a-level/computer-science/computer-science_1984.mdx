The octal representation of the binary number $10101010$ is $252$.

To convert a binary number to its octal equivalent, we begin by grouping the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the rightmost (least significant) digit. If the total number of binary digits is not a multiple of three, we prepend zeros on the left (most significant side) to complete the group.

For the binary number $10101010$, we can group the digits as follows: $001$, $010$, $101$, and $010$. Next, we convert each group into its octal equivalent. The octal equivalent of $001$ is $1$, $010$ corresponds to $2$, and $101$ represents $5$. Thus, the octal representation of the binary number $10101010$ becomes $1252$.

However, it is important to note that the leading zero in the octal number is typically omitted, resulting in the final octal representation being $252$. This conversion process is a fundamental concept in computer science, as it enables us to represent binary data in a more compact and readable format.

In summary, the key steps for converting binary to octal are to group the binary digits into sets of three and then convert each group to its octal equivalent. This method is both straightforward and efficient, making it an invaluable tool for computer scientists and programmers alike.
