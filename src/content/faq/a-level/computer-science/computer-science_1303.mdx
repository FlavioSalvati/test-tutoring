HTML is a fundamental language used to structure and present content on the web. Known as Hypertext Markup Language, HTML employs a system of tags to define various elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images on a webpage.

HTML tags, also referred to as elements, are enclosed in angle brackets and typically exist in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a closing tag. The content is placed between these tags, guiding the web browser on how to render the information.

For example, the `<p>` tag is utilized to denote a paragraph, while the heading tags `<h1>` through `<h6>` define headings, with `<h1>` representing the largest size and `<h6>` the smallest. Images and hyperlinks are designated using the `<img>` and `<a>` tags, respectively. There is a vast array of tags available, each serving a specific function, enabling the representation of diverse content types and styles.

Moreover, HTML facilitates the organization of a webpage into distinct sections using tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>` (for navigation links), and `<section>`. This structural approach enhances content organization and improves navigation for users. Additionally, the `<div>` and `<span>` tags can group other elements, making it easier to apply styles to multiple elements simultaneously.

HTML also supports attributes within its tags, which provide supplementary information about an element. For instance, attributes can specify the source of an image or the destination of a link. These attributes are included in the opening tag and consist of a name and a corresponding value.

In summary, HTML organizes web content through a system of tags that define and format various elements. These elements can represent a wide array of content types and styles, and can be effectively grouped and sectioned for improved organization. The use of attributes within tags adds further detail, enhancing both the structure and functionality of a webpage.
