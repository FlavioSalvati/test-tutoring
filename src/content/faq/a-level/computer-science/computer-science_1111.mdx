A 2-3 tree is a type of balanced search tree in which each node can have either two children (referred to as a 2-node) or three children (known as a 3-node).

Specifically, a 2-3 tree is a self-balancing variant of a B-tree, which means it automatically adjusts its structure to maintain balance as elements are inserted or removed. This property makes it an efficient data structure for essential operations such as searching, insertion, and deletion. The term '2-3' in its name indicates the possible number of children that each parent node can have: a 2-node contains one key and two children (with the left child holding values less than the key and the right child holding values greater than the key), while a 3-node contains two keys and three children (with the left child holding values less than the first key, the middle child holding values between the two keys, and the right child holding values greater than the second key).

When inserting a new element into a 2-3 tree, the process starts by locating the appropriate leaf node where the new element should be placed, based on its value. If this leaf node is a 2-node, it can simply be converted into a 3-node by adding the new element. However, if the leaf node is already a 3-node, it must be split into two 2-nodes, with the middle key being promoted to the parent node. This splitting process may need to be propagated upwards if the parent node is also a 3-node, potentially continuing up to the root of the tree.

The deletion process in a 2-3 tree is somewhat more intricate. If the key to be deleted is located in a leaf node, it can be removed directly. If the key resides in an internal node, it is replaced with either its predecessor or successor (which will always be found in a leaf node), and then that leaf node is deleted. If the deletion results in a node having no keys, the tree must be restructured to ensure that every node remains either a 2-node or a 3-node.

In summary, a 2-3 tree is a versatile and efficient data structure that maintains balance, ensuring that operations such as searching, insertion, and deletion can be executed quickly. Its design, allowing each node to have either two or three children, enables it to dynamically adapt as elements are added or removed.
