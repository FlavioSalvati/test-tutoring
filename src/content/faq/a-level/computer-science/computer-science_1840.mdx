A database view is a virtual table that is generated from the result set of an SQL query referencing one or more existing tables.

To elaborate, a database view is a searchable entity within a database, defined by a specific query. Although it does not physically store data, it presents results that resemble a traditional database table, comprising a set of rows and columns. The fields in a view are derived from one or more actual tables within the database.

The relationship between a database view and a table is that a view acts as a virtual table, created as a result of executing a query on one or more base tables. Importantly, a view does not hold any data itself; rather, it displays data sourced from the base tables. The information shown in a view is retrieved through the SQL statement embedded within the view.

Views serve several purposes, including simplifying data access and enhancing security. For instance, a view can present aggregated data, obscure complex data structures, or protect sensitive information by omitting it from view. This capability allows users to access a specific subset of data without needing to understand the underlying base tables or their structure.

Additionally, views can consolidate and simplify data from multiple tables into a single virtual table. They also provide a means to restrict data access, as a view can selectively display certain columns from a table. Users can be granted permission to access data through the view without being allowed direct access to the entire base table.

In conclusion, a database view is a powerful tool for database administrators, enabling them to manage and organize data in a way that is easily understandable and manipulable for users. It acts as a virtual table that presents data from actual tables in a more simplified and organized fashion.
