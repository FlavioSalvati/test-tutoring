Recursion in programming languages is a technique in which a function calls itself to address a problem.

This concept is fundamental in computer science and programming. Recursion involves a function that, rather than directly solving a problem, breaks it down into smaller subtasks and invokes itself to tackle these subtasks. This process continues until a base case is reached—an instance in which the function can resolve the problem without further recursion.

To illustrate recursion, consider the calculation of a number's factorial. The factorial of a number $n$, denoted as $n!$, is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. A recursive function can compute this by first checking if $n$ is either $0$ or $1$ (the base case); in such cases, it returns $1$. If $n$ is greater than $1$, the function returns the product of $n$ and the factorial of $n$ minus one. This recursive process continues until the base case is reached.

While recursion can be a powerful programming tool, it must be approached with caution. Each recursive call adds a layer to the system's call stack, which can result in a stack overflow if the recursion goes too deep. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that there is a base case that can be achieved within a reasonable number of steps.

Additionally, recursion can sometimes yield inefficient solutions, particularly when the same subproblem is solved repeatedly. This inefficiency can be addressed through techniques such as memoization, which involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

In summary, recursion is a vital concept in programming that enables functions to call themselves in order to solve problems. It can be a powerful approach, but it is crucial to use it judiciously to avoid potential drawbacks.
