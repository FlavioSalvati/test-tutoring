Fragmentation in memory management refers to the inefficient utilization of storage capacity that arises from dividing memory into non-contiguous blocks.

More specifically, fragmentation occurs in a system’s memory when the total amount of free memory is segmented into smaller, non-adjacent blocks. This situation arises when processes are loaded into and removed from memory in such a manner that free memory becomes fragmented into separate chunks, rather than remaining as a single contiguous block.

There are two primary types of fragmentation: external fragmentation and internal fragmentation. 

**External fragmentation** occurs when free memory blocks are dispersed throughout the system, making it impossible to allocate larger contiguous blocks of memory required by new processes. This fragmentation often results from the arbitrary order in which processes are loaded and removed from memory, leaving behind free blocks that are too small to accommodate the needs of incoming processes.

In contrast, **internal fragmentation** arises when memory is allocated to a process, but a portion of that allocated memory remains unused because the process does not require the entire block. This typically occurs when memory allocation is done using fixed-sized blocks. If a process needs less memory than what is allocated, the unused portion of the block becomes wasted space, leading to internal fragmentation.

The presence of fragmentation can lead to significant inefficiencies in memory usage, as it may hinder the loading of larger processes into memory, even when there is sufficient total free memory available. Additionally, fragmentation can slow down the system, as the operating system must expend time and resources searching for suitable blocks of memory for each process.

To mitigate the effects of fragmentation, various memory management techniques can be employed, including compaction, paging, and segmentation. **Compaction** involves rearranging all free memory blocks to consolidate them into one large block of free memory. **Paging** and **segmentation**, on the other hand, divide memory into fixed or variable-sized blocks, respectively, which can then be allocated to processes as needed. This approach reduces the likelihood of fragmentation and enhances overall memory efficiency.
