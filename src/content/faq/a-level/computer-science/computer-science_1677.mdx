A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a malicious technique used to disrupt the normal operations of a network, service, or server by inundating it with an overwhelming volume of requests, ultimately causing service interruptions.

In greater detail, a DoS attack aims to incapacitate a network resource or service by flooding it with excessive internet traffic. Unlike other cyber attacks that seek unauthorized access or data theft, the primary goal of a DoS attack is to render a machine or network resource unavailable to its legitimate users.

The attacker achieves this disruption by sending more requests than the target can manage, leading to system slowdowns or crashes. These requests can manifest in various ways, such as transmitting a large amount of data that exhausts the target's bandwidth or sending specific information that triggers a system failure. In certain scenarios, the attacker may exploit vulnerabilities within the system, causing it to consume resources unnecessarily, thus denying service to legitimate users.

One prevalent method for executing a DoS attack is through the use of a botnetâ€”a network of compromised computers under the attacker's control. Each computer within the botnet sends requests to the target, collectively overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. This type of attack is referred to as a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.

Another common strategy is the SYN flood attack. In this approach, the attacker sends a series of SYN (synchronize) requests to the target's system, attempting to consume sufficient server resources to render the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

DoS attacks can lead to substantial disruptions for online services, affecting everything from small websites to major platforms. They are challenging to prevent due to their straightforward execution. Nonetheless, various measures can be implemented to mitigate the effects of these attacks. Such measures include rate limiting, IP blacklisting, and the deployment of anti-DDoS software solutions.
