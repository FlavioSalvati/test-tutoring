Comb sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that enhances the performance of bubble sort by utilizing a larger gap between the elements being compared.

The comb sort algorithm operates by repeatedly sorting pairs of elements that are separated by a specific gap, rather than only sorting adjacent pairs as bubble sort does. Initially, this gap is set to the length of the list and is progressively reduced until it reaches one. When the gap is one, the algorithm effectively functions like bubble sort. The gap is typically decreased by a shrink factor, which is often chosen to be approximately $1.3$.

The algorithm begins by establishing the gap equal to the length of the list. It then compares each pair of elements that are separated by this gap, swapping them if they are in the incorrect order. After all such pairs have been compared, the algorithm reduces the gap by the shrink factor and repeats the process. This cycle continues until the gap is reduced to one, at which point the algorithm continues to compare and swap adjacent elements until the entire list is sorted.

The primary advantage of this approach is that it allows elements to be moved to their correct positions more efficiently than bubble sort, as they can "jump" over multiple positions in a single operation. This makes comb sort particularly effective for lists that exhibit a significant amount of disorder. However, similar to bubble sort, it remains relatively inefficient for large lists when compared to more advanced sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.

In terms of computational complexity, comb sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$, although it has a smaller coefficient than that of bubble sort. This characteristic often results in faster performance for a variety of input scenarios. The best-case time complexity is $O(n \log n)$, occurring when the list is nearly sorted. Comb sort is an in-place algorithm, meaning it does not require additional space, and it is not stable, which indicates that equal elements may not maintain their original order.

In summary, comb sort is a straightforward and intuitive sorting algorithm that improves upon bubble sort by comparing and swapping elements that are a certain distance apart. This technique enables the algorithm to reposition elements more rapidly, rendering it more efficient for many types of input data.
