The process of linking object modules involves several critical factors, including symbol resolution, relocation, and library management.

**Symbol Resolution**  
Symbol resolution is a fundamental aspect of linking object modules. This process entails resolving references to symbols that are not defined within the current module. The linker is responsible for ensuring that every symbol referenced in the object module has a corresponding definition in another module or in a library. If the linker cannot locate a definition for a referenced symbol, it will generate an error. This occurs because the absence of a definition means that the final executable will be unable to determine the appropriate action to take when encountering that symbol during execution.

**Relocation**  
Relocation is another vital consideration in the linking process. The linker must adjust the addresses of symbols and the references to those symbols within the object module so that they point to the correct locations in the final executable. This adjustment is necessary because the addresses in the object module are typically based on the assumption that the module will be loaded at a specific memory location, which may differ in the final executable. Thus, the linker must modify these addresses to accurately reflect the actual load location of the module in the executable.

**Library Management**  
Effective management of libraries is also crucial when linking object modules. Libraries are collections of object modules that provide commonly used functions and procedures. The linker must search through these libraries to find definitions for symbols that are not defined in the object modules being linked. However, the linker must exercise caution to avoid including unnecessary code from the libraries in the final executable. Including superfluous code can increase the size of the executable and potentially degrade its performance. Therefore, the linker should only include the portions of the library that are actually utilized by the object modules.

In summary, linking object modules is a complex process that involves several key considerations. The linker must effectively resolve symbols, perform relocation of addresses, and manage libraries to produce a correct and efficient executable.
