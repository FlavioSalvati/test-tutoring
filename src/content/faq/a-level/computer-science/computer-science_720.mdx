You can implement a queue using two stacks by managing the flow of elements between them. 

A queue is a data structure that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added is the first one to be removed. Conversely, a stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. To create a queue using two stacks, we need to carefully manipulate these stacks to maintain the FIFO behavior.

Let's designate our two stacks as `inputStack` and `outputStack`. When we want to add an element (enqueue) to the queue, we simply push it onto the `inputStack`. This operation has a time complexity of $O(1)$, indicating that it takes constant time regardless of the number of elements in the stack.

To remove an element (dequeue) from the queue, we pop an element from the `outputStack`. If `outputStack` is empty, we transfer all elements from `inputStack` to `outputStack` by popping them one by one and pushing them onto `outputStack`. This transfer reverses the order of elements, ensuring that the last element added to `inputStack` (which should be the first to be removed in a queue) becomes the top element in `outputStack`. The time complexity of this operation is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in `inputStack`.

It's crucial to note that the $O(n)$ time complexity for the dequeue operation occurs only when `outputStack` is empty. If `outputStack` contains elements, then the dequeue operation can be performed in $O(1)$ time. Consequently, the amortized time complexity (the average time per operation over a series of operations) for both enqueue and dequeue operations is $O(1)$, making this implementation quite efficient.

In summary, by utilizing two stacks, we can effectively implement a queue where the enqueue operation is performed on one stack, while the dequeue operation is conducted on the other. This strategic use of stacks allows us to uphold the FIFO principle inherent in queues.
