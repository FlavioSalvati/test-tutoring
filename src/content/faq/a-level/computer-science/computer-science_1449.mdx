A view in SQL is a virtual table that is derived from the result set of an SQL query, in contrast to a table, which is a structured collection of data.

In SQL, a table serves as the fundamental unit of data storage, organizing information into rows and columns. Each column in a table is designed to hold a specific type of data, such as numbers, text, or dates. Conversely, each row represents a distinct, implicitly structured data item within the table. Tables are utilized to store logically grouped data and can be manipulated through various SQL operations, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

A view, on the other hand, is not a physical entity. It acts as a virtual table that results from a query executed on one or more tables. Like a table, a view consists of rows and columns, but its data is defined by the underlying query. Importantly, a view does not consume physical storage space in the database; instead, it serves as a set of references to the data contained in the underlying tables. Views can simplify SQL operations, offer an additional layer of data abstraction, and restrict access to sensitive information in the underlying tables.

The primary distinction between a view and a table lies in their nature: views are definitions constructed on top of existing tables (or other views) and do not store data independently. Consequently, if the data in the underlying tables changes, those changes are automatically reflected in the corresponding views. In contrast, a table physically retains the data in the database.

In summary, a table is a structured collection of data stored within a database, while a view is a virtual table created as a result of querying one or more tables. Both are essential components of SQL, each fulfilling distinct roles in data management.
