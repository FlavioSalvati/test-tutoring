HTML organizes web content through a system of tags that define various elements, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, on a webpage.

HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create webpages. It employs a tagging system to structure and format content on the web. These tags, also referred to as elements, are enclosed in angle brackets and typically appear in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a closing tag. The content to be displayed is placed between these tags, guiding the web browser on how to render the information.

For example, the `<p>` tag is utilized to define a paragraph, while the heading tags `<h1>` through `<h6>` denote headings, with `<h1>` representing the largest heading and `<h6>` the smallest. Images and hyperlinks are defined through the `<img>` and `<a>` tags, respectively. There is a wide variety of other tags available, each serving a specific purpose, enabling diverse content types and styles to be represented.

HTML also facilitates the structural organization of a webpage using tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>` for navigation links, and `<section>` to create distinct sections. This organization enhances the navigability of the webpage. Furthermore, the `<div>` and `<span>` tags can group other elements together, which is particularly useful for applying styles uniformly across multiple elements.

In addition, HTML allows the incorporation of attributes within its tags. Attributes provide supplementary information about an element, such as the source of an image or the destination of a link. These attributes are included in the opening tag and consist of a name-value pair.

In summary, HTML structures web content through a systematic use of tags that define and format various elements. This capability allows for representing a broad spectrum of content types and styles, enabling effective organization through grouping and sectioning. Moreover, attributes enhance the structural and functional aspects of a webpage by providing additional context about elements.
