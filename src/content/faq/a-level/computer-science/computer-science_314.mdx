The binary representation of the decimal number $239$ is $11101111$.

To convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent, we employ a method that involves dividing the number by $2$ and keeping track of the remainders. Letâ€™s break down the conversion of the decimal number $239$ into binary step by step.

1. Start by dividing $239$ by $2$. The quotient is $119$ and the remainder is $1$. This remainder represents the least significant bit (the rightmost bit) of the binary representation.

2. Next, take the quotient $119$ and divide it by $2$. The new quotient is $59$ and the remainder is again $1$. This remainder becomes the next bit in the binary representation, moving from right to left.

3. Continuing this process, divide $59$ by $2$. This yields a quotient of $29$ and a remainder of $1$.

4. Then, divide $29$ by $2$ to get a quotient of $14$ and a remainder of $1$.

5. Next, divide $14$ by $2$, resulting in a quotient of $7$ and a remainder of $0$.

6. Now, divide $7$ by $2$, which gives a quotient of $3$ and a remainder of $1$.

7. Finally, divide $3$ by $2$ to achieve a quotient of $1$ and a remainder of $1$. Since the quotient is now less than $2$, we conclude the process. The quotient itself ($1$) becomes the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) of the binary representation.

Now, by assembling all the remainders from bottom to top, we find that the binary representation of $239$ is $11101111$.

This technique for converting decimal numbers to binary is known as the "division by 2" algorithm. It is a fundamental concept in computer science, as binary representation forms the basis of how computers process and store information. Mastering this conversion process is essential for understanding more advanced topics in computer science, such as data structures and algorithms.
