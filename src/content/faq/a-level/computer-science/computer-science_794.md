An adjacency list is a data structure used in computer science to represent a graph by storing a list of vertices that are connected to each vertex within the graph.

In essence, an adjacency list defines the relationships between the nodes (or vertices) of a graph. Each vertex has an associated list that contains all the vertices to which it is directly connected. This list is referred to as the adjacency list for that particular vertex.

Typically, the adjacency list is implemented using either an array or a linked list. Each element of the array or each node of the linked list corresponds to a vertex in the graph. The value stored in each element or node consists of a collection of the vertices that are adjacent to the vertex represented by that element or node. This collection can take various forms, such as a dynamic array, a linked list, a set, or any other suitable data structure.

For instance, consider a graph with four vertices labeled $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$. If vertex $1$ is connected to vertices $2$ and $3$, vertex $2$ is connected to vertices $1$ and $4$, vertex $3$ is connected to vertices $1$ and $4$, and vertex $4$ is connected to vertices $2$ and $3$, the adjacency list representation of this graph would look like this:

$$
\begin{align*}
1: & \quad 2, 3 \\
2: & \quad 1, 4 \\
3: & \quad 1, 4 \\
4: & \quad 2, 3 \\
\end{align*}
$$

This representation indicates that the adjacency list for vertex $1$ includes vertices $2$ and $3$, the list for vertex $2$ includes vertices $1$ and $4$, and so forth.

The adjacency list representation is generally more space-efficient compared to the adjacency matrix representation, particularly for sparse graphs (i.e., graphs with relatively few edges), as it only stores the connections that actually exist. However, it may be less efficient than the adjacency matrix for certain operations, such as determining whether an edge exists between two vertices.
