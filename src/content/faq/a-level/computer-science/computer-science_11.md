Heap sort is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilizes a binary heap data structure. The algorithm begins by converting the input list into a max heap, which is a specialized tree structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node $i$, the value of $i$ is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This arrangement ensures that the largest element is always located at the root of the heap.

The next step in the heap sort process involves swapping the root node (the largest element) with the last element in the heap. This operation effectively removes the largest element from the heap and places it in its correct position within the sorted array. Following this swap, the size of the heap is reduced by one, and the heap property is restored by "heapifying" the root node again, which involves rearranging the elements to maintain the max heap structure. This process is repeated until the heap is empty, resulting in a fully sorted list.

Heap sort is classified as an in-place algorithm, which means it does not require additional memory for sorting; it manipulates the original data directly. This characteristic makes it a space-efficient sorting method. However, it is important to note that heap sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that equal elements may not maintain their original relative order in the final sorted list.

The time complexity of heap sort is $O(n \log n)$ in both the best and worst-case scenarios, which makes it suitable for handling large datasets. Despite this efficiency, heap sort tends to be slower in practice compared to other $O(n \log n)$ algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort, primarily due to its higher overhead.

In summary, heap sort is a robust sorting algorithm that works by transforming a list into a max heap and iteratively swapping the largest element with the last one. As an in-place, comparison-based algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, it is effective for sorting, yet it is often outperformed by faster algorithms in practical applications.
