Negative numbers are represented in binary using the two's complement method. This technique involves inverting the bits of the positive number and then adding one to the result.

To elaborate, two's complement is a mathematical operation applied to binary numbers and serves as a method for representing signed numbers in computing. To grasp the concept of two's complement, it's essential to first understand how positive numbers are represented in binary. Binary numbers are based on base 2, where each digit can either be a $0$ or a $1$. For instance, the decimal number $5$ is represented in binary as $101$.

To represent a negative number using two's complement, follow these steps:

1. Determine the binary representation of the corresponding positive number.
2. Invert the bits: change all $1$s to $0$s and all $0$s to $1$s. This process is referred to as finding the one's complement.
3. Add one to the inverted result.

For example, to represent $-5$ in binary using two's complement, you would begin with the binary representation of $5$, which is $101$. Inverting the bits results in $010$, and adding one produces $011$. Therefore, $-5$ is represented in binary as $011$ using two's complement.

It is crucial to recognize that the leftmost bit in a two's complement number is known as the sign bit. If the sign bit is $0$, the number is positive; if it is $1$, the number is negative. This characteristic explains why inverting the bits of a positive number yields a negative number.

Two's complement is widely adopted in computing due to its ability to simplify addition and subtraction operations. When adding or subtracting two's complement numbers, the arithmetic behaves in the same manner as it does with positive numbers, which streamlines the design of computer hardware.
