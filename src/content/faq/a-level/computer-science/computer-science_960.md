The SQL 'DELETE' command is utilized to remove one or more records from a specified table within a relational database management system.

As a Data Manipulation Language (DML) operation, the 'DELETE' command allows you to mark the removal of existing records. It is a potent tool that must be used with care, as once data is deleted, it is typically irretrievable.

The basic syntax for the 'DELETE' command is as follows:

$$
\text{DELETE FROM table\_name WHERE condition;}
$$

In this syntax, 'table_name' refers to the name of the table from which you wish to delete data, while the 'condition' specifies which records should be removed. It is crucial to note that if you omit the 'WHERE' clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

For instance, if you have a table named 'Students' and wish to remove the record of a student with an ID of $123$, you would execute the following command:

$$
\text{DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 123;}
$$

This command will effectively delete the record corresponding to 'StudentID = 123'.

It is essential to understand that the 'DELETE' command only removes the data contained within the table, not the table itself. If your intention is to eliminate both the table structure and its data, you should use the 'DROP TABLE' command instead.

Additionally, the 'DELETE' command can be combined with 'JOIN's and subqueries. This functionality is particularly beneficial when you need to delete records from one table based on the existence of related records in another table, thereby helping to maintain data integrity across multiple tables.

Finally, keep in mind that the 'DELETE' command is a transactional operation. This means that you can roll back the deletion if you realize a mistake has been made, but only if you have not yet committed the transaction. Once the transaction is committed, the deleted data is permanently lost. Therefore, always ensure that you are certain about the records you intend to delete before executing the 'DELETE' command.
