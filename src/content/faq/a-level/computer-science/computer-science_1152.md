A nested data structure refers to a data structure that exists within another data structure, enabling a more intricate organization of data.

To elaborate, a nested data structure is fundamentally a structure that contains one or more other structures, which may be of the same or different types. This concept is significant in computer science because it facilitates the creation of complex data models that can more accurately represent real-world scenarios. For example, in Python, you might have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an individual person, and the entire list collectively represents a group of people.

The functionality of nested data structures varies based on the specific types of structures involved. For instance, in a nested array (an array of arrays), you can access individual elements by using multiple indices. If you have a 2D array, which can be visualized as a grid with rows and columns, the first index indicates the row, while the second index identifies the column.

In the case of a nested dictionary (a dictionary of dictionaries), inner elements can be accessed through chained key lookups. For example, if you have a dictionary where the values are also dictionaries, you can retrieve values from the inner dictionaries by first using the key of the outer dictionary and then the key of the inner dictionary.

Nested data structures can also be traversed using nested loops. For instance, to iterate over a 2D array, you would implement a loop within another loop. The outer loop iterates through the rows, and for each row, the inner loop iterates through the columns.

In summary, nested data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science that enable more complex and flexible data organization. They allow one data structure to contain one or more additional data structures, which can be accessed and manipulated using multiple indices or keys, and can be traversed using nested loops.
