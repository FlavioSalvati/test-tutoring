An abstract data type (ADT) defines a conceptual framework for a data type, while a concrete data type provides a specific implementation of that data type.

An ADT, often referred to as an abstract data type, offers a high-level description of a collection of data along with the operations that can be performed on that data. The term "abstract" signifies that it does not dictate how the data should be stored or the algorithms used for executing the operations. Instead, it outlines what operations can be performed without detailing their implementation. Essentially, an ADT serves as a blueprint for data types, and different implementations of the same ADT can vary significantly in terms of efficiency. Common examples of ADTs include List, Stack, Queue, and Tree.

Conversely, a concrete data type—also known as a data structure—represents a specific implementation of an ADT. It provides the precise method of data storage and the algorithms for the operations, hence the term "concrete." This type is the actual representation of data within a computer program or a physical device, encompassing both the data collection and the operations that can be executed on it. Examples of concrete data types include arrays, linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables.

Understanding the distinction between abstract and concrete data types is fundamental in computer science. ADTs enable programmers to conceptualize data and operations at a high level, allowing them to focus on design rather than the intricacies of low-level implementation. This abstraction simplifies the process of designing and reasoning about software systems. On the other hand, concrete data types empower programmers to translate these high-level designs into actual code. Grasping the differences between these two concepts can significantly enhance your ability to write efficient and maintainable code.
