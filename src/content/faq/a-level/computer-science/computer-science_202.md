SQL databases are structured and utilize a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases are unstructured, scalable, and feature a dynamic schema that accommodates unstructured data.

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, often referred to as relational databases, have been a dominant choice for database management systems since the 1970s. They operate on a relational model, where data is organized into tables, and the relationships between this data are also maintained within tables. SQL databases necessitate a predefined schema, meaning the structure of the data must be determined in advance. They excel in executing complex queries, allowing for operations such as joining tables. Notable examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

Conversely, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases were developed to address the limitations of SQL databases, particularly in handling large datasets and the need for agility, efficiency, and scalability. NoSQL databases are unstructured, which means they do not require a fixed schema. Data can be stored in various formats, such as key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases, or document databases. This inherent flexibility makes NoSQL databases particularly well-suited for semi-structured or unstructured data. They are highly scalable and facilitate easy updates and modifications to the database. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.

Regarding ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties—criteria that ensure reliable processing of database transactions—SQL databases are robust in all four aspects. In contrast, NoSQL databases may not fully adhere to ACID properties, often providing "eventual consistency," which means that changes made to the database are propagated to all nodes over time.

In summary, the decision between SQL and NoSQL databases largely depends on the specific requirements of a given project. SQL databases are typically preferred for scenarios involving structured data and complex queries, while NoSQL databases are advantageous for large datasets and situations where the data structure is not well-defined or may change frequently.
