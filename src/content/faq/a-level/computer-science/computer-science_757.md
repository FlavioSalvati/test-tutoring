Data structures can be categorized into two main types: simple (or primitive) data structures and composite (or non-primitive) data structures. 

**Simple Data Structures**

Simple data structures serve as the fundamental building blocks of data manipulation. They are designed to store a single value at a time and include types such as integers, floats, characters, and booleans. Each of these data types is capable of holding just one value. For instance, an integer variable can hold a number like $5$ or $10$, whereas a character variable can represent a single character, such as 'a' or 'b'. These structures are termed 'simple' because they deal with straightforward data and the operations performed on them are generally uncomplicated and direct.

**Composite Data Structures**

In contrast, composite data structures are more intricate. They can hold multiple values simultaneously, and these values may be of different types. Examples of composite data structures include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. The term 'composite' reflects the fact that these structures are made up of simpler data structures. For example, an array can contain a collection of integers, while a list can maintain a sequence of characters. Working with composite data structures typically involves more complex operations, as one must often manipulate the structure as a whole or access its individual components.

**Choosing Between Simple and Composite Data Structures**

The decision to use either simple or composite data structures hinges on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. If your task only necessitates the storage of a single value, a simple data structure will suffice. However, if you need to store multiple related values or organize your data in a particular manner, a composite data structure is likely the better choice. Understanding the distinctions between these two categories of data structures is essential for effective problem-solving in computer science.
