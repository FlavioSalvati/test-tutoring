Conditional statements in programming languages are essential for executing different computations or actions based on whether a specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.

More specifically, conditional statements—often referred to as conditional constructs or decision-making statements—are foundational elements of programming. They enable control over the program's flow by allowing conditions to be evaluated at runtime. As a result, the execution of certain segments of code can be dictated by the outcomes of these evaluations.

The most common types of conditional statements include 'if', 'if-else', and 'switch'. The 'if' statement specifies a block of code to execute when a condition is true. In contrast, the 'if-else' statement introduces an alternative block of code that runs when the condition is false. The 'switch' statement, on the other hand, allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values, each linked to a corresponding block of code that executes if the condition is satisfied.

For instance, consider a weather application where an 'if' statement could display different messages based on the temperature. If the temperature exceeds $30$ degrees, the program might output "It's a hot day". Conversely, if the temperature is below $30$ degrees, it could display "It's a cool day". This decision-making capability is facilitated by conditional statements.

Moreover, conditional statements extend beyond simple true or false evaluations. They can be combined using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT, allowing for the creation of more complex conditions. This flexibility enables programmers to develop sophisticated applications that can make informed decisions and execute various actions based on a multitude of scenarios.

In summary, conditional statements are a powerful asset in programming, fostering the development of dynamic and interactive applications. Without these constructs, programs would be static and unable to adapt to varying inputs or situations.
