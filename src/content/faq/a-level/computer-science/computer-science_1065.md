Compile-time errors and runtime errors are two distinct types of issues that can arise during the development of a program, each occurring at different stages of the program's lifecycle.

**Compile-time Errors**  
Compile-time errors, often referred to as syntax errors, are identified by the compiler when it attempts to translate the source code into machine code. These errors arise when the code's syntax fails to conform to the rules of the programming language. For instance, forgetting to close a parenthesis or misspelling a keyword will prevent the compiler from correctly interpreting the code, resulting in a compile-time error. Such errors must be resolved before the program can be successfully compiled and executed.

**Runtime Errors**  
In contrast, runtime errors—also known as exceptions—occur while the program is executing. These errors are not detected by the compiler because the syntax of the code is valid. However, they can cause the program to terminate unexpectedly due to issues that emerge during execution. For example, attempting to divide a number by zero or trying to access an element outside the bounds of an array can lead to a runtime error. Unlike compile-time errors, runtime errors can sometimes be managed by the program itself through exception handling mechanisms, allowing it to continue running even when an error occurs.

**Summary**  
In essence, the primary distinction between compile-time and runtime errors lies in their timing and detection. Compile-time errors are caught by the compiler and must be corrected before the program can be executed. Conversely, runtime errors occur during the program's execution and may be addressed by the program's error-handling capabilities. Both types of errors are common in programming, and a clear understanding of them is essential for effective debugging and error management.
