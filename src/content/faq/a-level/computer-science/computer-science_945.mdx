A clustered index determines the physical order of data within a table, whereas a non-clustered index does not influence the data's physical arrangement.

A clustered index is a specific type of index that reorganizes how records are physically stored in a table. Consequently, each table can have only one clustered index. The leaf nodes of a clustered index contain the actual data pages, effectively making the clustered index synonymous with the table itself. This is why clustered indexes are often referred to as index-organized tables. When querying a table that has a clustered index, the database can quickly locate the data because it knows precisely where to search. However, due to the physical reordering of the data, operations that require significant data movement may experience slower performance.

In contrast, a non-clustered index is a distinct type of index where the logical order of the index does not correspond to the physical order of the rows stored on disk. The leaf nodes of a non-clustered index contain index entries rather than data pages. Each index entry includes the non-clustered key value along with one or more row locators that point to the corresponding data row containing that key value. As a result, data rows can be scattered throughout the table, independent of the values in the indexed column(s). A table can support multiple non-clustered indexes, which can enhance query performance. However, these indexes consume additional storage space and may impede the speed of write operations.

In summary, the primary distinction between clustered and non-clustered indexes lies in their data storage and sorting mechanisms. A clustered index organizes and stores the data rows in the table according to their key values, while a non-clustered index keeps a separate record of this data. This separation allows for greater flexibility but comes with the trade-off of increased storage requirements and potential reductions in write performance.
