To convert a binary number to its octal equivalent, the process involves grouping the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right, and then converting each group to its corresponding octal digit.

### Step-by-Step Conversion Process

1. **Understanding the Bases**: 
   Binary numbers are in base $2$, while octal numbers are in base $8$. A crucial aspect of this conversion is recognizing that $2^3 = 8$. This means that three binary digits can represent a single octal digit.

2. **Grouping the Binary Digits**: 
   Begin by organizing the binary number into groups of three digits, starting from the right-hand side. If the binary number does not perfectly divide into groups of three, you can add leading zeros to the left to complete the last group. For instance:
   - The binary number $101101$ can be grouped as $101 \, 101$.
   - The binary number $1101$ can be grouped as $011 \, 101$ after adding a zero to the left.

3. **Converting Each Group**: 
   Each group of three binary digits corresponds to a specific octal digit. The conversions are as follows:
   - $000$ → $0$
   - $001$ → $1$
   - $010$ → $2$
   - $011$ → $3$
   - $100$ → $4$
   - $101$ → $5$
   - $110$ → $6$
   - $111$ → $7$

   Using the previous examples, we can convert:
   - The group $101 \, 101$ represents the octal number $55$.
   - The group $011 \, 101$ represents the octal number $35$.

### Key Takeaway

The essential principle behind this conversion is the relationship between binary and octal systems. Since $2^3 = 8$, a trio of binary digits can effectively represent one octal digit. This method simplifies the conversion process: simply group the binary digits into sets of three and convert each group to its octal equivalent. This approach provides a clear and efficient way to convert binary numbers to octal numbers.
