The binary representation of the octal number $542$ is $101100010$.

To convert an octal number to binary, each digit in the octal number is replaced by its corresponding binary equivalent. The octal number system operates in base $8$, using eight symbols: $0$ through $7$, while the binary system is in base $2$, utilizing just two symbols: $0$ and $1$.

Let's break down the octal number $542$ into its individual digits: $5$, $4$, and $2$. Each of these digits can be converted into a three-digit binary number. The binary equivalents for these digits are as follows:

- The octal digit $5$ converts to binary as $101$,
- The octal digit $4$ converts to binary as $100$, and
- The octal digit $2$ converts to binary as $010$.

Now, if we combine these binary representations, we obtain the binary number $101100010$:

- $5$ becomes $101$,
- $4$ becomes $100$,
- $2$ becomes $010$.

Thus, the overall binary representation of the octal number $542$ is $101100010$.

It is important to note that when converting from octal to binary, each octal digit corresponds to a three-digit binary number. This is because the highest digit in octal, which is $7$, requires three binary digits for its representation ($111$).

In summary, the binary representation of the octal number $542$ is indeed $101100010$. This conversion method can be applied to any octal number to obtain its binary equivalent.
