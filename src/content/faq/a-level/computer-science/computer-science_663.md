Global variables are accessible throughout the entire program, while local variables are restricted to the function or block in which they are declared.

To elaborate, a global variable is defined outside of all functions or blocks. Due to its broad scope, it can be accessed and modified by any part of the code, making it universally available. This can be advantageous in scenarios where multiple functions need to share the same data. However, the downside is that any part of the program can alter the variable, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and bugs that are difficult to diagnose.

Conversely, a local variable is declared within a specific function or block. Its scope is confined to that function or block, meaning it cannot be accessed or modified by code outside of it. This limitation helps prevent bugs, as it ensures that the variable can only be changed in a controlled environment. However, this also means that the variable is not available to other parts of the program, which may be restrictive in some cases.

As a general guideline, it is considered good practice to use local variables whenever possible and to reserve global variables for situations where they are truly necessary. This approach promotes modularity and enhances code readability since each function or block operates with its own set of variables. In contrast, global variables can complicate understanding and debugging of the code, as they can be modified by any part of the program.

In summary, while both global and local variables serve important purposes, they also come with their respective challenges. Understanding the distinctions between them and knowing when to use each type is essential for becoming a skilled programmer.
