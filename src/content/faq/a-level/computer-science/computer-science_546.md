Web browsers communicate with web servers through the exchange of HTTP requests and responses.

When you enter a URL into your web browser, it triggers a sequence of events to retrieve and display the desired webpage. This process starts with the browser sending an HTTP request to the web server hosting the website. HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the standard protocol used for transferring data over the internet. It specifies a set of rules for formatting and transmitting messages, as well as the actions that browsers and web servers should take in response to various commands.

The HTTP request generated by the browser includes several components: the method (such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE), the URL, and additional information such as headers and body content. The method indicates the action the server should perform. For instance, a GET request is utilized to retrieve data from the server, whereas a POST request is employed to send data to the server.

Upon receiving the HTTP request, the web server processes it and returns an HTTP response. This response contains a status code, headers, and the requested content. The status code informs the browser whether the request was successful and provides additional context about the outcome. For example, a status code of $200$ signifies that the request was successful, while a status code of $404$ indicates that the requested resource could not be found.

The headers within the HTTP response deliver further information about the response, such as the content type, content length, and server details. The requested content, which is typically an HTML document, is included in the body of the response.

Once the browser receives the HTTP response, it parses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript included in the response to render the webpage. It may also issue additional HTTP requests for resources referenced in the HTML, such as images, stylesheets, and scripts.

In summary, the interaction between web browsers and web servers follows a request-response cycle. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, the server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, and the browser processes this response to display the webpage. This cycle is repeated for every resource that the browser needs to fully load the webpage.
