An R-tree is a sophisticated tree data structure utilized in spatial databases for indexing multi-dimensional information.

The term R-tree, which stands for Rectangle-tree, refers to a data structure specifically designed for handling spatial data. This structure organizes information in such a way that each node corresponds to a rectangle within the spatial dataset, making it particularly effective for indexing items like geographical coordinates, rectangles, and polygons.

The concept of the R-tree was introduced by Antonin Guttman in 1984 as an adaptation of B-trees for higher dimensions. The fundamental idea behind the R-tree is to cluster nearby objects and represent them using their minimum bounding rectangle at the next level up in the tree hierarchy. While the actual geometrical shapes may not intersect, their bounding rectangles can indeed overlap.

R-trees serve a critical role in spatial access methods, allowing for the efficient indexing of data where each item has an associated position. For instance, the locations of restaurants within a city can be stored in an R-tree, with each restaurant represented as a point in two-dimensional space. This structure enables quick retrieval of all items located within a specified distance from a query point or within a defined query rectangle.

In spatial databases, R-trees are essential for facilitating efficient querying and manipulation of spatial objects. They find applications across various fields, including geographic information systems (GIS), computer graphics, and data mining. The R-tree structure is particularly adept at executing 'nearest neighbor' searches, which aim to identify the object closest to a specified point.

In summary, an R-tree is a specialized data structure designed for organizing and indexing multi-dimensional data within spatial databases. By grouping nearby objects and representing them with their minimum bounding rectangles, R-trees enable efficient spatial queries and data manipulations.
