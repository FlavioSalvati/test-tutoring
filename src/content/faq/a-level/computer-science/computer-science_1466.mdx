The Radix Sort algorithm organizes numbers by processing their individual digits, beginning with the least significant digit and progressing to the most significant one.

Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting technique that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys based on the individual digits that share the same position and value. The term "radix" refers to the base of the number system; for instance, in the decimal system, the radix is $10$.

The algorithm functions by distributing the numbers into buckets according to their radix. It starts with the least significant digit (the rightmost digit) and moves toward the most significant digit (the leftmost digit). For each digit, numbers are collected from the buckets, which maintains the order established in the previous step. This process is repeated for each digit until all digits have been processed.

There are two varieties of Radix Sort: Most Significant Digit (MSD) and Least Significant Digit (LSD). The LSD Radix Sort is the more commonly used variant; it begins with the least significant digit and progresses toward the most significant digit. At each stage, it employs a stable sorting algorithm, such as counting sort or bucket sort, to organize the digits. Conversely, the MSD Radix Sort starts with the most significant digit and moves toward the least significant one, utilizing a recursive sorting method to arrange the digits.

The time complexity of Radix Sort is $O(nk)$, where $n$ is the number of elements and $k$ is the number of digits in the largest number. This characteristic makes it highly efficient for sorting large datasets. However, it does have a space complexity of $O(n + k)$, indicating that it requires additional space to execute the sorting process.

In conclusion, Radix Sort is a distinctive sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit, from the least significant to the most significant. It is particularly effective for handling large datasets but necessitates extra space for sorting.
