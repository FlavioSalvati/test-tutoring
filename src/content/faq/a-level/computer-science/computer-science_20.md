The binary representation of the octal number $756$ is $111\,101\,110$.

To convert an octal number to binary, we replace each octal digit with its corresponding binary equivalent. The octal number system is base $8$, consisting of the digits $0$ through $7$. In contrast, the binary number system is base $2$ and comprises only the digits $0$ and $1$.

The octal number $756$ can be separated into three individual digits: $7$, $5$, and $6$. Each of these digits can be converted into a binary representation.

- The binary equivalent of the octal digit $7$ is $111$.
- The binary equivalent of the octal digit $5$ is $101$.
- The binary equivalent of the octal digit $6$ is $110$.

Thus, when we substitute each octal digit in $756$ with its binary equivalent, we obtain $111$ (for $7$), $101$ (for $5$), and $110$ (for $6$).

Consequently, the binary representation of the octal number $756$ is $111\,101\,110$.

It is important to note that when converting from octal to binary, each octal digit corresponds to a three-digit binary number. This is because the maximum value represented by three binary digits is $7$ (which is $111$ in binary). Since the octal system is based on powers of $8$, the three-digit binary representation fits perfectly.

This conversion method is straightforward and can be applied to any octal number, making it a valuable skill, particularly for computer science students who frequently work with various number systems.
