Composite attributes in an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) are depicted as oval shapes that are subdivided into smaller components.

In an ERD, attributes serve as the properties or characteristics of entities, and they are typically represented by oval shapes. A composite attribute is one that can be broken down into smaller sub-parts, each representing a distinct basic attribute with its own significance. For instance, the attribute 'Address' can be considered a composite attribute, as it can be segmented into 'Street', 'City', 'Postcode', and 'Country'.

To illustrate a composite attribute in an ERD, you would draw a main oval for the primary attribute and connect it with lines to additional ovals representing each of the sub-parts. Each of these sub-part ovals should be clearly labeled with the name of the corresponding sub-attribute. This visual arrangement effectively conveys that the main attribute is composed of these smaller components.

It is important to understand that composite attributes are not always necessary or advantageous in an ERD. They are particularly useful when you want to indicate that an attribute consists of several distinct parts, each of which may hold its own significance. However, if the sub-parts of an attribute lack meaning on their own, or if they are not likely to be used independently, it may be clearer and more straightforward to represent the attribute as a single, non-composite attribute.

In summary, composite attributes in an ERD are represented by a primary oval that is linked to smaller ovals, each labeled with a sub-attribute. This visual representation elucidates the structure and complexity of the attribute, ultimately enhancing the clarity and comprehensibility of the ERD.
