Normalization in database design is a critical process aimed at organizing data into tables and columns. Its primary objectives are to reduce data redundancy and enhance data integrity.

To elaborate, normalization involves a systematic approach to decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics, such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. This multi-step process transforms data into a tabular format by removing duplicated information from relation tables. The two main purposes of normalization are to eliminate redundant (unnecessary) data and to ensure that data dependencies are logically sound, meaning that data is stored in a coherent manner.

The concept of normalization was introduced by E.F. Codd at IBM in 1970. He established a series of normal forms, each representing a higher standard of normalization. These normal forms are known as 1NF (First Normal Form), 2NF (Second Normal Form), 3NF (Third Normal Form), BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form), 4NF (Fourth Normal Form), and 5NF (Fifth Normal Form). Each normal form has specific criteria that a database schema must satisfy to be classified as such.

For instance, a table is considered to be in First Normal Form (1NF) if all columns contain only atomic (indivisible) values. A table is in Second Normal Form (2NF) if it meets the criteria of 1NF and every non-key column is fully dependent on the primary key. Furthermore, a table qualifies as being in Third Normal Form (3NF) if it adheres to 2NF and every non-key column is non-transitively dependent on the primary key.

The primary goal of normalization is to minimize the storage space required by a database and to ensure that data is logically organized. This process eliminates redundancy, such as the occurrence of identical data across multiple tables, and guarantees that only related data is stored within each table. It also mitigates potential issues arising from database modifications, including insertions, updates, and deletions.

In summary, normalization is an essential aspect of database design that promotes data integrity and efficient storage. It is a fundamental concept that every computer science student should comprehend and implement when working with databases.
