A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a mathematical and computational structure characterized by its vertices and directed edges, where the absence of cycles is a defining feature.

A DAG is formally defined as a directed graph that contains no directed cycles. This means it comprises a collection of vertices connected by edges, each of which has a specific direction. Following the direction of the edges will never result in returning to the same vertex, thus preventing the formation of closed loops.

The representation of a DAG is similar to that of other types of graphs. It includes a set of vertices and a set of directed edges. Each edge is associated with a starting vertex, referred to as the 'tail', and an ending vertex, known as the 'head'. The direction of the edge is indicated by an arrow pointing from the tail to the head. In graphical representations, vertices are typically depicted as circles or dots, while edges are illustrated as arrows.

One of the key properties of a DAG is the prohibition of directed cycles. This ensures that it is impossible to start from any vertex $v$ and traverse a sequence of directed edges that eventually leads back to $v$. This lack of cycles is what distinguishes a DAG as acyclic.

In computer science, DAGs can be represented in various ways within memory. The two most prevalent representations are adjacency lists and adjacency matrices. An adjacency list for a vertex $v$ consists of a list of all vertices that $v$ has direct edges to. Conversely, an adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array where the cell located at the $i$-th row and $j$-th column contains a boolean value: it is true if there is an edge directed from the $i$-th vertex to the $j$-th vertex, and false otherwise.

DAGs find applications in numerous algorithms and data structures across computer science. They are utilized in scheduling problems, data compression algorithms, and for representing expressions in compilers. Additionally, they have significant roles in network theory, bioinformatics, and various other fields.

In summary, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is constructed from vertices and directed edges, with the crucial property of being acyclic. Its representation can be visual, using circles and arrows, or stored in computer memory through adjacency lists or matrices.
