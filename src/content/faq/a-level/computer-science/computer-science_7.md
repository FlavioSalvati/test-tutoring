Radix sort is an efficient algorithm used for sorting numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit and progressing to the most significant digit.

This non-comparative integer sorting algorithm organizes data with integer keys by grouping them based on individual digits that share the same position and value. The term "radix" refers to the base of the number system; for instance, in the decimal system, the radix is $10$.

The algorithm initiates the sorting process by examining the least significant digit (LSD). This procedure is repeated for each subsequent digit until the most significant digit (MSD) is reached. At each digit level, a stable sorting algorithm is typically employed to preserve the relative order of items with identical keys. A stable sort ensures that if two elements have the same key, their initial order will remain unchanged, which is crucial for the correct functioning of radix sort.

There are two main variations of radix sort: Most Significant Digit (MSD) and Least Significant Digit (LSD). The LSD approach begins sorting from the least significant digit and moves towards the most significant digit, ensuring the stability of the sort order with each iteration. Conversely, the MSD method starts with the most significant digit and works its way down to the least significant digit. This method is particularly useful for sorting strings of characters, such as words or names.

The efficiency of radix sort is primarily determined by the number of digits in the numbers being sorted. It operates in linear time, making it highly efficient for sorting large lists of numbers. However, its performance may degrade when dealing with numbers that have a substantial number of digits.

In summary, radix sort is a distinctive sorting algorithm that processes numbers digit by digit, utilizing a stable sorting method for each digit. It proves to be efficient for large collections of numbers with a limited number of digits.
