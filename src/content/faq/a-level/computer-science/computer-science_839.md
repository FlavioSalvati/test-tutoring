Fiber-optic cables transmit data by sending pulses of light through strands of glass or plastic, fundamentally transforming the way we communicate information.

These advanced cables operate based on the principle of total internal reflection. Within the cable, a core made of either glass or plastic is surrounded by a layer known as the cladding, which has a lower refractive index. This difference in refractive indices ensures that light signals remain confined within the core, allowing them to travel long distances with minimal signal loss.

The data transmission process begins when electronic signals are converted into light signals. This conversion is performed by a transmitter, which generates the light pulses. These pulses then travel down the fiber-optic cable. As the light moves along the cable, it continuously reflects off the walls due to total internal reflection, enabling it to cover great distances while maintaining signal integrity.

At the receiving end, an optical receiver converts the light signals back into electronic signals that can be processed by electronic devices. This receiver utilizes a photodetector to sense the light pulses and transform them into electrical signals. These electrical signals are then processed and interpreted as data.

The speed and efficiency of data transmission through fiber-optic cables are unmatched. They have the capability to carry vast amounts of data at extremely high speedsâ€”significantly faster than traditional copper cables. This enhanced performance is primarily because light travels faster than electricity and can transmit more information simultaneously. Additionally, fiber-optic cables are immune to electromagnetic interference, which can disrupt signal transmission in copper cables.

In summary, fiber-optic cables transmit data by converting electronic signals into light signals, guiding these signals through the cable using total internal reflection, and then reconverting them into electronic signals at the receiving end. This innovative technology has revolutionized data transmission, offering high speeds and substantial data capacity.
