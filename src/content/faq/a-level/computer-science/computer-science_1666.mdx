Wireless networks can be classified into five primary categories: Personal Area Network (PAN), Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), and Global Area Network (GAN).

A **Personal Area Network (PAN)** is the smallest and most fundamental type of wireless network, typically designed for personal use within a range of approximately $10$ meters. A common example of a wireless PAN is Bluetooth, which enables devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers to connect and share data seamlessly. Other examples include wireless keyboards and mice, which establish a connection to a computer through a PAN.

A **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)** spans a larger area, such as a home, office, or school. WLANs are generally established using a wireless access point that transmits signals to devices within its range. The most prevalent type of WLAN is the Wi-Fi network, which allows multiple devices to connect to the internet or share data with one another within a designated area.

**Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)** cover a broader geographic area than a LAN, typically encompassing a city or town. These networks are frequently employed by local governments and businesses to link multiple locations within a specific region. For instance, a city might utilize a MAN to connect its city hall, public libraries, and other municipal buildings. WiMAX technology is commonly used to implement MANs.

A **Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)** extends over a much larger geographic span, often covering a region, country, or even the entire globe. These networks utilize mobile telecommunication technologies such as $3G$, $4G$, and $5G$. Devices like mobile phones, tablets, and laptops equipped with cellular capabilities can connect to the internet through WWANs.

Finally, a **Global Area Network (GAN)** facilitates global operations by employing satellite systems or a combination of various networks to achieve worldwide coverage. A prime example of a GAN is the internet itself, which interconnects smaller networks across the globe.
