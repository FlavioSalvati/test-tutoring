In Entity Relationship (ER) modeling, an inheritance relationship is depicted using a generalization or specialization hierarchy.

To elaborate, an inheritance relationship in ER modeling refers to a scenario where one entity (the child) inherits attributes and relationships from another entity (the parent). This is commonly known as an "is-a" relationship, signifying that the child entity is a specific type of the parent entity. For example, a 'Car' is a type of 'Vehicle', meaning that the 'Car' entity would inherit attributes such as 'color' and 'size' from the 'Vehicle' entity.

In ER diagrams, this relationship is illustrated through a generalization or specialization hierarchy. In this hierarchy, the parent entity is positioned at the top, with child entities connected to it through lines. These lines typically converge in a circle or ellipse, symbolizing the generalization or specialization relationship. The hierarchy generally flows from the general to the specific, moving from the parent entity to its child entities.

For instance, if 'Vehicle' serves as the parent entity, and 'Car' and 'Bike' are the child entities, the hierarchy would feature 'Vehicle' at the apex, with lines extending downwards to connect it to both 'Car' and 'Bike'. The convergence of these lines in a circle or ellipse indicates that 'Car' and 'Bike' are specializations of 'Vehicle'.

In certain scenarios, child entities can also have their own child entities, leading to a multi-level hierarchy. For example, 'Sports Car' and 'SUV' could be child entities of 'Car', inheriting its attributes while further specializing them.

It's crucial to understand that in an inheritance relationship, child entities inherit all attributes and relationships from the parent entity. However, they can also possess additional attributes and relationships that are not present in the parent entity. For instance, the 'Car' entity might include an extra attribute, such as 'number of doors', which is not relevant to the more general 'Vehicle' entity.
