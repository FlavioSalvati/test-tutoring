An optional relationship in an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is illustrated by a circle on the line connecting two entities.

In an ERD, entities are depicted as rectangles, while relationships between these entities are represented by lines connecting the rectangles. The nature of the relationship is conveyed through specific symbols on these lines. A mandatory relationship, which indicates that an instance of one entity must be associated with an instance of another entity, is represented by a solid straight line. Conversely, an optional relationship, where an instance of one entity may or may not have an association with an instance of another entity, is denoted by a circle placed on the line.

For instance, consider the relationship between two entities: 'Student' and 'Course'. A student has the option to enroll in a course, but this is not a requirement. Therefore, this constitutes an optional relationship. In the ERD, 'Student' and 'Course' would each be represented as rectangles. A line would connect these two rectangles, with a circle positioned on the line near the 'Course' entity. This configuration indicates that a student may or may not be enrolled in a course.

It is crucial to recognize that the placement of the circle is significant. If the circle is placed near the 'Student' entity, it would imply that a course may or may not have a student enrolled, which represents a different type of relationship.

In more intricate ERDs, there can be multiple relationships between entities, each varying in cardinalityâ€”the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity. These relationships can include a combination of mandatory and optional associations. The symbols used to represent these relationships are essential for clearly conveying the rules and constraints of the system being modeled. This makes ERDs an invaluable tool for system design and analysis.
