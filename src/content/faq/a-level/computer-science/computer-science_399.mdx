The odd-even sort algorithm, also known as brick sort, is a straightforward sorting technique used to arrange numbers in a specified order. This algorithm operates by repeatedly traversing the list of numbers and performing comparisons and swaps of adjacent pairs.

The sorting process consists of two primary passes through the list: one targeting odd-indexed elements and the other targeting even-indexed elements.

During the first pass, the algorithm begins at the first element (index $0$) and iterates through the list, comparing each adjacent pair of elements. If the elements are found to be out of order, they are swapped. This initial pass is referred to as the 'odd' pass, as it focuses on pairs starting from the odd-indexed element (index $1$ in zero-based indexing).

In the second pass, the algorithm performs a similar operation but begins at the second element (index $1$). This pass is termed the 'even' pass since it starts at an even-indexed element (index $0$ in zero-based indexing).

The algorithm continues to alternate between odd and even passes until the list is fully sorted. In each pass, the algorithm systematically moves through the list, comparing and swapping adjacent elements as required. The process continues until a complete pass is made without any swaps, indicating that the list is sorted.

Although the odd-even sort algorithm is not the most efficient for larger lists—exhibiting a worst-case and average time complexity of $O(n^2)$—it is straightforward to understand and implement. This makes it a suitable choice for educational purposes or for sorting small lists.

Functionally, the odd-even sort algorithm bears resemblance to the bubble sort algorithm, which also sorts by continuously traversing the list and swapping adjacent elements that are out of order. However, the alternation between odd and even passes in the odd-even sort can potentially accelerate the sorting process by allowing greater movement of elements across the list in each iteration.
