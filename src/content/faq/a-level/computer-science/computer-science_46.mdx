The octal representation of the hexadecimal number $AF$ is $257$.

To convert a hexadecimal number to octal, we first transform it into binary and then convert that binary representation into octal. Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, while octal operates on a base-8 system.

Let's begin with the hexadecimal number $AF$. In the hexadecimal system, the digit $A$ represents $10$, and the digit $F$ represents $15$. The binary representation of $A$ (which is $10$ in decimal) is $1010$, and the binary representation of $F$ (which is $15$ in decimal) is $1111$. Consequently, the binary representation of $AF$ is $10101111$.

Next, we will convert this binary number into octal. To do this, we group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right. Thus, $10101111$ can be grouped as $010 \, 101 \, 111$. We now convert each of these binary groups into their corresponding octal values: 
- $010$ in binary is $2$ in octal,
- $101$ in binary is $5$ in octal,
- $111$ in binary is $7$ in octal.

Therefore, the octal representation of the binary number $10101111$ is $257$.

In summary, the octal representation of the hexadecimal number $AF$ is $257$. This conversion process is fundamental in computer science, as various number systems are utilized across different computing domains. For instance, hexadecimal is frequently employed in programming and web design, while octal is often used in systems programming and managing file permissions in Unix-like operating systems. Mastering the conversion between these systems is an essential skill for any computer science student.
