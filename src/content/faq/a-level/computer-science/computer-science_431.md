A rose tree, also referred to as a multiway tree, is a specialized tree data structure that allows each node to have an arbitrary number of child nodes.

Unlike binary trees, where each node is limited to a maximum of two children, a rose tree enables greater flexibility in its structure. This term is commonly used in functional programming languages, such as Haskell, to describe this particular type of data structure.

In a rose tree, each node holds a value and a list of its children, which are themselves rose trees. The root node is distinguished as the only node without a parent, while the leaf nodes are those that do not possess any children. The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node, while the height of the tree is determined by the maximum depth of any node within the tree.

A significant characteristic of rose trees is their recursive nature. This property allows for elegant and concise implementations of operations, such as applying a function to all values in the tree or folding the tree into a single value, using recursion.

Additionally, rose trees are particularly well-suited for representing hierarchical data structures. For instance, a file system can be modeled as a rose tree, where each node represents a directory or a file, and the children of a directory node correspond to the files and subdirectories contained within that directory.

In terms of computational complexity, operations on rose trees may be more costly than those on binary trees due to the potential for a large number of children per node. However, this issue can be alleviated by employing balanced rose trees, which maintain a relatively small number of children for each node.
