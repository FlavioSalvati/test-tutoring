The core components of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) include entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality.

An Entity Relationship Diagram serves as a visual representation of the significant entities within a system, along with their attributes and relationships. It is an essential tool in database design, helping to clearly and concisely map out the data structure and the interconnections among various elements.

**Entities** are the fundamental components of an ERD. They denote the objects or concepts that hold importance within a system. For instance, in a university database, potential entities might include 'Student', 'Course', and 'Lecturer'. Each entity is depicted as a rectangle in the diagram.

**Attributes** are the characteristics or properties associated with an entity. They offer additional information about that entity. For example, the 'Student' entity could have attributes such as 'Student ID', 'Name', 'Address', and 'Course'. Attributes are represented as ovals connected to their respective entities.

**Relationships** illustrate the associations between entities, showing how one entity relates to another. For example, a 'Student' may have a relationship with a 'Course' defined as 'Enrols in'. Relationships are represented by diamonds, with lines connecting them to the involved entities.

**Cardinality** specifies the numerical aspects of the relationship between two entities. It indicates how many instances of one entity are associated with a single instance of another entity. For instance, one 'Student' can 'Enrol in' multiple 'Courses', but each 'Course' can only be 'Enrolled in' by one 'Student'. Cardinality is represented by placing appropriate numbers or symbols near the entities involved in the relationship.

In summary, an ERD is composed of entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality. Each of these components is vital for defining the structure and relationships of the data within a system. A clear understanding of these elements is crucial for creating an effective and accurate ERD.
