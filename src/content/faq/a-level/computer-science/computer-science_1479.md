The bucket sort algorithm organizes elements by distributing them into multiple buckets, which are then sorted individually.

Also referred to as bin sort, bucket sort is a distribution-based sorting algorithm. It operates by allocating the elements of an array into a specified number of buckets. Each bucket is subsequently sorted on its own, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm itself. The final sorted array is obtained by combining the sorted values from each bucket.

The process begins by establishing a 'bucket range', which defines the range of values that each bucket can accommodate. Typically, this is achieved by dividing the maximum value in the array by the number of buckets. For example, if the maximum value is $100$ and there are $10$ buckets, each bucket would cover a range of $10$ values.

Following this, the algorithm iterates through the array, placing each element into the appropriate bucket based on its value relative to the bucket range. For instance, if the bucket range is $10$, an element with a value of $35$ would be assigned to the fourth bucket, as it falls between $30$ and $40$.

Once all elements have been allocated to their respective buckets, each bucket is sorted independently. Any sorting algorithm can be employed for this step; however, it is common to apply the bucket sort algorithm recursively. This recursive approach is particularly efficient when the elements are uniformly distributed across the range, as it can significantly decrease the sorting time.

Finally, the sorted values from each bucket are concatenated to create the final sorted array. This is accomplished by iterating through the buckets in order and appending each bucket's elements to the end of the output array.

In terms of computational complexity, bucket sort is most effective when the input values are uniformly distributed across the range. In such cases, it can achieve a time complexity of $O(n)$, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms available. However, if the input is not uniformly distributed, the performance may degrade to $O(n^2)$, which is comparable to the worst-case performance of simpler comparison-based sorting algorithms.
