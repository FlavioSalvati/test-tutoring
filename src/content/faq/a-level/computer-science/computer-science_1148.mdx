Universal hashing is a technique for constructing hash functions that minimizes the likelihood of collisions through the use of randomization.

Specifically, universal hashing involves selecting hash functions in a manner that ensures an even distribution, meaning that no particular key is favored over others. This is accomplished by randomly choosing a hash function from a well-defined class of functions. The primary objective of universal hashing is to reduce the probability of hash collisions, which occur when two distinct keys result in the same hash value.

In a universal hashing system, the chosen hash function is not fixed. Instead, it is randomly selected from a set of potential hash functions. This set is specifically designed such that for any two distinct keys, the number of hash functions that yield the same hash value for those keys is minimal. This randomness contributes to a more uniform distribution of keys, thereby decreasing the chances of collisions.

The concept of universal hashing was developed to address the worst-case scenario in hashing, where all keys could map to a single hash value, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$ for search operations. By ensuring a more balanced distribution of hash values, universal hashing helps to maintain an average-case time complexity of $O(1)$ for search operations.

Universal hashing is especially advantageous in situations where the distribution of keys is unpredictable or may vary over time. By randomly selecting a new hash function whenever the hash table is resized, universal hashing can effectively adapt to changing key distributions.

In summary, universal hashing is a method utilized in data structures to achieve a more uniform distribution of keys and to minimize the risk of collisions. It accomplishes this by randomly selecting a hash function from a set of meticulously designed functions. This element of randomness plays a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency of search operations, making universal hashing an essential technique in various computing applications.
