A min heap is a specialized data structure implemented using a binary tree that maintains a specific ordering property during insertion and deletion operations.

A min heap is defined as a complete binary tree in which each node is less than or equal to its children. This characteristic is known as the heap property. The root node of the tree contains the smallest element, which is a fundamental feature of a min heap.

To implement a min heap, you can utilize an array where each element corresponds to a node in the binary tree. The relationships between parents and children can be established through their indices. For a node at index $i$, the left child is located at index $2i + 1$, and the right child is at index $2i + 2$. Conversely, the parent of a node at index $i$ can be found at index $\lfloor (i - 1)/2 \rfloor$.

When you insert a new element into the min heap, you begin by placing it at the end of the array (or at the next available position in the binary tree). To maintain the heap property, you then "bubble up" the new element to its appropriate position. The bubbling up process involves swapping the new element with its parent if the parent is larger. This continues until either the new element is smaller than its parent or it becomes the root of the tree.

When you delete the minimum element (which is the root), you replace the root with the last element in the array (or the last node in the tree). Following this, you perform a "bubble down" operation to reposition this element correctly. Bubbling down entails swapping the element with its smallest child if it is larger than that child. This process repeats until the element is smaller than both of its children or it reaches a leaf node.

Building a min heap from an array containing $n$ elements can be accomplished in $O(n)$ time. Additionally, operations such as insertion, deletion of the minimum element, and decreasing a key can each be performed in $O(\log n)$ time. This efficiency makes min heaps particularly useful for algorithms that frequently need to identify and remove the smallest element, such as Dijkstra's algorithm and the heap sort algorithm.

In summary, the crucial aspect of implementing a min heap is to maintain the heap property during both insertions and deletions. This ensures that the root of the heap consistently holds the smallest element, which can be accessed in constant time.
