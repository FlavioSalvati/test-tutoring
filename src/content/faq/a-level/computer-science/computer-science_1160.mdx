Probing in hash tables is a method used to resolve collisions by identifying alternative slots for data insertion.

In a hash table, data is organized in an array format where each data entry is assigned a unique index. This index is computed using a hash function. However, there are instances where two distinct data elements yield the same index after applying the hash function, leading to a situation known as a collision. To manage these collisions, various techniques can be employed, one of which is probing.

Probing entails searching for another location in the hash table when a collision occurs. The simplest form of probing is linear probing, where the hash table is examined sequentially to locate an empty slot. However, this approach can result in clustering, where a significant number of consecutive elements group together, making it challenging to find a free slot or to search for an element.

To address the issue of clustering, alternative probing techniques such as quadratic probing and double hashing can be utilized. In quadratic probing, instead of searching sequentially, the gap between the cells (where the next free slot is sought) increases according to an increasing sequence of numbers. This method effectively reduces the likelihood of clustering.

Double hashing takes a different approach by employing a second hash function to determine the interval between cells. This second hash function ensures that the interval is variable rather than constant, further minimizing the chances of clustering.

In summary, probing is an essential technique in hash tables for managing collisions. It enables the hash table to efficiently store and retrieve data even in the presence of collisions. The various types of probing—linear, quadratic, and double hashing—each provide distinct methods for handling collisions and clustering, each with its own set of advantages and trade-offs.
