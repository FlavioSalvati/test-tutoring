Complex numbers in computer systems are typically represented as a pair of floating-point numbers, which denote their real and imaginary parts.

More specifically, a complex number can be expressed in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit that satisfies the equation $i^2 = -1$. In the context of computer systems, complex numbers are generally represented as a pair of floating-point values: the first value corresponds to the real part ($a$), while the second value corresponds to the imaginary part ($b$).

To store these numbers in a computer system, a common approach is to use a data structure that holds two floating-point numbers. For instance, in the C++ programming language, the standard library includes a template class called `std::complex` for handling complex numbers, where the real and imaginary components are stored as separate floating-point values. Similarly, Python's built-in `complex` type utilizes two floating-point numbers to represent a complex number.

The floating-point representation enables a wide range of values and supports fundamental operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, it is crucial to recognize that due to the inherent characteristics of floating-point arithmetic, operations involving complex numbers can be affected by rounding errors. This issue is prevalent in numerical computations and is not limited to complex numbers alone.

In addition to the basic arithmetic operations, many programming languages offer functions to compute various properties of complex numbers, such as their magnitude (or absolute value), phase (or argument), and conjugate. These functions are particularly useful in various scientific and engineering fields—such as electrical engineering, control systems, and quantum physics—where complex numbers are frequently utilized.

In summary, complex numbers in computer systems are represented as pairs of floating-point numbers, allowing for a diverse range of values and enabling various operations. Nevertheless, due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic, these operations may be susceptible to rounding errors.
