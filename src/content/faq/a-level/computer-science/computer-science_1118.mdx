A Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), also known as a Fenwick Tree, is a data structure designed for efficient range queries and updates. It enables operations such as calculating prefix sums and updating elements in an array in logarithmic time.

The BIT is represented as an array where each element corresponds to the sum of a specific range of elements from the original array. This range is defined by the binary representation of the index. For instance, if the binary representation of an index ends with a series of zeros, the range covered by that index will be larger. Conversely, if it ends with a series of ones, the range will be smaller. This unique property allows for both updates and queries to be executed in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the array.

To illustrate how a BIT operates, letâ€™s consider an example with an array consisting of $8$ elements. The BIT for this array will also contain $8$ elements, each storing the cumulative sum of certain elements from the original array. Specifically, the first element of the BIT contains the first element of the original array, the second element holds the sum of the first two elements, the third element stores the third element of the original array, and so forth.

When updating an element in the original array, it is imperative to also update the corresponding elements in the BIT. For example, if we wish to update the third element in the original array, we would modify the third element in the BIT along with all other elements that encompass the range of the third element.

Similarly, executing a range query involves summing specific elements in the BIT. For instance, to find the sum of the first five elements in the original array, we would compute the sum of the fifth element and the fourth element in the BIT.

In summary, a Binary Indexed Tree is a powerful data structure that facilitates efficient range queries and updates. It is particularly advantageous in situations where these operations need to be performed frequently, making it an essential tool in data structures.
