title: "What is the effect of free entry and exit in perfect competition?"
summary: "In perfect competition, free entry and exit of firms result in zero economic profit in the long run, as any profits attract new entrants, driving profits down to equilibrium."

Free entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market ultimately results in zero economic profit in the long run.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms act as price takers, meaning they have no influence over the market price. They can only adjust their output levels to maximize profits. When firms begin to earn supernormal profits, this serves as a signal for new firms to enter the market, as there are minimal or no barriers to entry in perfect competition. The influx of new firms increases the overall supply of the product, leading to a decrease in the market price. Consequently, as the price declines, the supernormal profits of existing firms begin to erode.

Conversely, if firms are incurring losses, they will exit the market due to the absence of exit barriers in perfect competition. The departure of these firms decreases the supply of the product available in the market, which in turn raises the price. As the price increases, the losses experienced by the remaining firms start to diminish.

This ongoing process of entry and exit continues until all firms in the market are earning only normal profits. Normal profit occurs when total revenue equals total costs, including the opportunity cost of capital. This state is referred to as long-run equilibrium in perfect competition. At this equilibrium point, there is no incentive for new firms to enter the market, nor for existing firms to exit.

Thus, the mechanisms of free entry and exit in perfect competition ensure that resources are allocated efficiently within the market. Firms operate at the lowest point on their average cost curves, thereby maximizing productive efficiency. Moreover, because the market price equals the marginal cost of production, allocative efficiency is also achieved. This indicates that the combination of goods and services produced in the market aligns perfectly with consumer preferences.

In summary, the free entry and exit characteristic of perfect competition is fundamental in determining market prices and profit levels. This dynamic ensures that firms do not experience supernormal profits or losses in the long run, leading to an efficient allocation of resources.
