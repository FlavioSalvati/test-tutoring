The effectiveness of government economic policy is assessed based on macroeconomic stability, which is evaluated through key indicators such as inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and the balance of payments.

Macroeconomic stability refers to a condition in which essential economic indicators fall within acceptable ranges, reflecting steady growth, low and stable inflation, and a manageable level of public debt. To achieve this stability, governments implement various economic policies, and the effectiveness of these policies can be determined by examining the aforementioned indicators.

**Inflation** serves as a primary indicator of macroeconomic stability. An effective economic policy should successfully manage inflation within a designated target range. High inflation can diminish the purchasing power of money and generate uncertainty within the economy, whereas deflation can result in reduced economic activity. Consequently, an effective policy aims to maintain a low and stable rate of inflation.

**Unemployment** is another vital indicator. An effective economic policy should strive to achieve full employment or, at the very least, maintain a low unemployment rate. High levels of unemployment can lead to significant social and economic challenges, while low unemployment rates typically signify a robust economy. Thus, the government's capacity to manage unemployment is a crucial measure of its policy effectiveness.

**Economic growth** is also a critical factor. Government economic policies should promote steady and sustainable economic growth, which is often measured by the growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). High economic growth can enhance living standards and create more job opportunities, whereas low growth may result in economic stagnation. Therefore, the government's ability to foster economic growth is a significant indicator of its policy effectiveness.

Finally, the **balance of payments** reflects a country's international economic transactions. An effective economic policy should aim to maintain a sustainable balance of payments. A substantial deficit can lead to economic instability, while a surplus may indicate a robust economy. Hence, the government's management of the balance of payments is a key measure of its policy effectiveness.

In summary, the effectiveness of government economic policy in terms of macroeconomic stability can be evaluated by analyzing key indicators such as inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and the balance of payments. These indicators collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the economy's health and the efficacy of the government's economic strategies.
