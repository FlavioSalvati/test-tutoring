Imperfectly competitive markets are characterized by a limited number of firms that dominate the majority of the market share. 

In these markets, often referred to as monopolistic competition, a few key firms exert significant influence over both the pricing and output of their products or services. This stands in stark contrast to perfectly competitive markets, where numerous firms each hold a small market share, and no single firm can sway the market price or output.

Firms operating within an imperfectly competitive market are classified as price makers rather than price takers. This distinction means that they possess the ability to set their own prices instead of merely accepting the prevailing market price. Their market power arises from various factors, including brand loyalty, product differentiation, and barriers to entry that inhibit potential competitors from joining the market.

A defining feature of imperfect competition is product differentiation. Each firm offers products that are distinct from those of its competitors, which may vary in quality, design, location, or other attributes that render the product unique. This differentiation enables firms to have some control over their pricing, as consumers might be willing to pay a premium for products they perceive as superior.

Barriers to entry also play a crucial role in maintaining imperfect competition. These barriers can be legal, such as patents or licenses, or they can be natural, like substantial start-up costs or limited resources. Such obstacles deter new firms from entering the market and competing with established players.

Additionally, firms in imperfectly competitive markets often engage in non-price competition. This includes strategies such as advertising, product development, and enhanced customer service, which aim to attract customers without resorting to price reductions. Lowering prices could instigate a price war, ultimately diminishing profits for all firms within the market.

In summary, imperfectly competitive markets are characterized by a few dominant firms that control a substantial portion of the market share. These firms operate as price makers, leveraging strategies of product differentiation and non-price competition. Barriers to entry serve to protect the existing firms and help them sustain their market power.
