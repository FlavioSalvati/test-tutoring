Fiscal policy serves to regulate public debt by overseeing government spending and taxation, thus ensuring economic stability and sustainable debt levels.

This policy is an essential instrument for governments to influence their economies and manage public debt effectively. It comprises two primary components: government spending and taxation. By adjusting these elements, a government can regulate the amount of money it borrows and, consequently, its overall debt level.

When a government spends more than it collects in tax revenue, it incurs a budget deficit and must borrow to cover this shortfall, which leads to an increase in public debt. Conversely, if the government spends less than it receives, it achieves a budget surplus, enabling it to utilize the excess funds to reduce its debt. Thus, by managing spending and taxation, a government can exert control over its borrowing and debt levels.

One approach that governments may employ is countercyclical fiscal policy. This strategy involves increasing spending and/or reducing taxes during a recession to stimulate economic activity, while cutting spending and/or raising taxes during periods of economic expansion to cool the economy down. Such measures can help to mitigate economic fluctuations and maintain stability, ensuring that debt remains at a manageable level.

For instance, during a recession, a government may choose to increase investment in infrastructure projects. This creates jobs and stimulates economic activity, aiding in the recovery from the recession. However, this approach also raises the budget deficit and public debt. To counterbalance this effect, the government may later increase taxes or reduce spending once the economy has stabilized, thereby lowering the deficit and facilitating debt repayment.

Nevertheless, managing public debt through fiscal policy requires a delicate balancing act. If a government excessively cuts spending or raises taxes during a recession, it risks exacerbating the economic downturn. Conversely, if it spends excessively or reduces taxes too much during a boom, it may overheat the economy, leading to inflationary pressures.

Furthermore, there are limits to how much a government can borrow. Excessively high public debt can result in elevated interest rates, as lenders demand higher returns to offset increased risks. This situation can make borrowing more costly for the government, worsening the debt dilemma.

In conclusion, fiscal policy is vital for controlling public debt. By judiciously managing government spending and taxation, a government can maintain economic stability and ensure that its debt remains at a sustainable level. However, achieving this requires careful judgment and a deep understanding of the prevailing economic conditions.
