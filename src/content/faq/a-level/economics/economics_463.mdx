The UK government employs fiscal policy as a primary means of managing the budget deficit, which arises when government expenditures exceed its revenues, primarily derived from taxation.

Fiscal policy serves as a crucial instrument for addressing the budget deficit. To mitigate this shortfall, the government has two main options: increasing its revenues or decreasing its expenditures.

One approach to enhancing government revenues is through tax increases. This can involve raising direct taxes, such as income tax and corporation tax, or indirect taxes, such as value-added tax (VAT). Nonetheless, increasing taxes can be politically contentious and may adversely affect the economy by diminishing consumer spending and business investment. Consequently, the government must carefully evaluate the potential repercussions of tax hikes before implementation.

Alternatively, the government may opt to reduce its spending. This could entail cuts to public services, reductions in welfare benefits, or implementing efficiency savings across government departments. Similar to tax increases, spending cuts can also provoke political backlash and may yield negative economic consequences. For instance, cuts to public services could result in job losses and diminished service quality, while reductions in welfare benefits could exacerbate poverty and inequality.

Another critical component of fiscal policy is government borrowing. When faced with a budget deficit, the government often resorts to borrowing to cover the gap. This is typically accomplished by issuing government bonds, which investors purchase. However, excessive borrowing can lead to elevated levels of public debt, resulting in costly debt servicing and potentially necessitating higher taxes in the future.

Additionally, the government utilizes fiscal policy to stimulate economic growth, which can help alleviate the budget deficit. For example, investing in infrastructure projects can create jobs and enhance productivity. Similarly, providing tax incentives may encourage increased business investment.

In summary, the UK government leverages fiscal policy to manage the budget deficit through strategic adjustments in spending and taxation levels. However, these decisions are often complex and politically sensitive, necessitating a careful balance between fiscal objectives and their potential economic impacts.
