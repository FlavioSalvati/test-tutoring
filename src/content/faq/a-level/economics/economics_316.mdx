Market failure associated with common resources primarily stems from overuse and depletion, which occurs due to the absence of property rights.

Common resources are defined as goods that are non-excludable yet rival in consumption. This means that while individuals cannot be prevented from using these resources, the consumption of one party diminishes the availability for others. Examples of common resources include fisheries, forests, and the atmosphere. The absence of property rights implies that these resources are accessible to everyone but owned by no one. This scenario often leads to what is termed the 'Tragedy of the Commons.' In this situation, individuals, acting independently and rationally in pursuit of their self-interest, inadvertently undermine the collective welfare of all users by depleting the shared resource.

The crux of the issue lies in the fact that each individual user does not bear the full cost of their actions. For instance, when a fisherman catches a fish, he enjoys the complete benefit of that fish without incurring the total cost of depleting the fish stock. Instead, the cost of depletion is distributed among all users of the resource. Consequently, each user is incentivized to exploit the resource to the fullest extent before it is depleted by others. This behavior results in overuse and eventual depletion of the resource, leading to a market failure.

Moreover, the absence of property rights can contribute to underinvestment in the maintenance and preservation of common resources. Since no individual owns the resource, there is little motivation for anyone to invest in its upkeep. This lack of investment can exacerbate the depletion and degradation of the resource.

Additionally, the challenges posed by common resources are often intensified by information asymmetry. Users may not fully understand the consequences of their actions on the resource, or they might underestimate the rate at which the resource is being depleted. This deficiency in information can result in even greater overuse and depletion of the resource.

In summary, market failure concerning common resources arises from a combination of factors, including the lack of property rights, subsequent overuse and depletion, underinvestment in maintenance, and information asymmetry. These factors collectively create a scenario where the market, when left to operate on its own, fails to allocate resources in an efficient or sustainable manner.
