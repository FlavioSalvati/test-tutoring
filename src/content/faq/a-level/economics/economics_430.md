Prospect Theory offers a comprehensive framework for understanding economic decision-making, emphasizing how perceived gains and losses influence choices rather than just the final outcomes.

Originally formulated by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, Prospect Theory challenges the traditional economic assumption that individuals always make rational decisions aimed at maximizing utility. Instead, it posits that decisions are primarily driven by the potential value of losses and gains, leading to seemingly irrational or inconsistent behaviors.

The theory is founded on two key concepts: reference dependence and loss aversion. 

1. **Reference Dependence**: This principle asserts that individuals assess outcomes relative to a specific reference point, typically their current situation or status quo. Any deviation from this reference point is interpreted as either a gain or a loss. For example, if you anticipated a discount of £10 but only received £5, you would perceive this as a loss, despite the fact that you are still better off than before.

2. **Loss Aversion**: The second principle of Prospect Theory indicates that the discomfort associated with losing is felt more acutely than the joy of gaining. In other words, losses are perceived as more significant than equivalent gains. This can lead to risk-averse behavior in the face of potential losses and risk-seeking behavior when potential gains are at stake. For example, individuals may opt to purchase insurance to guard against the potential loss of their property, even if the likelihood of such an event is low.

Additionally, Prospect Theory introduces the concept of **diminishing sensitivity**. This means that the perceived difference in value between £0 and £1000 is more significant than the difference between £1000 and £2000. This concept helps explain why people may be willing to travel a considerable distance to save £10 on a £20 purchase, but may not find it worthwhile to do the same for a £200 purchase.

In conclusion, Prospect Theory provides a nuanced perspective on economic decision-making by examining how individuals perceive gains and losses. It underscores that human decisions are not always rational or consistent; rather, they are shaped by perceptions and emotional responses. This understanding has profound implications for fields such as behavioral economics, finance, and policy-making, where grasping human behavior is essential for effective strategies and interventions.
