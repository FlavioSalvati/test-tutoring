The primary objectives of fiscal policy during a deflationary period are to stimulate economic activity and elevate price levels.

In an environment characterized by deflation, the overall price level within an economy is declining. This situation can create a detrimental cycle of reduced spending, diminished production, job losses, and further decreases in prices. Consequently, the foremost aim of fiscal policy in such circumstances is to disrupt this cycle and revitalize economic activity. This is commonly achieved through expansionary fiscal policies, which may involve increasing government expenditure, lowering taxes, or implementing a combination of both strategies.

Increasing government spending can invigorate economic activity through several mechanisms. First, it can directly enhance demand for goods and services, contributing to upward pressure on prices. Second, government spending can generate job creation, which subsequently raises income levels and boosts consumer spending. Third, such spending can facilitate increased investment in infrastructure and other public goods, thereby enhancing the economy's productive capacity and supporting sustainable long-term growth.

On the other hand, decreasing taxes can also spur economic activity by increasing the disposable income available to households and the after-tax profits for businesses. This boost in disposable income can lead to greater consumer spending and heightened business investment, which in turn can stimulate demand and help raise prices. However, it is crucial to recognize that the effectiveness of tax reductions can vary based on factors such as the propensity of consumers and businesses to utilize their additional disposable income for consumption or investment.

In addition to stimulating economic activity, fiscal policy during deflation aims to prevent the emergence of a deflationary spiral. This spiral occurs when falling prices lead to reduced spending, which then results in further price declines, perpetuating the cycle. By increasing demand and elevating prices, fiscal policy can disrupt this negative feedback loop and help stabilize the economy.

However, the implementation of expansionary fiscal policy during a deflationary period may carry potential drawbacks. For instance, it could result in an increase in government debt, which might impose long-term economic challenges. Therefore, it is essential for policymakers to carefully evaluate the potential benefits and costs when determining the appropriate fiscal policy response to deflation.

In summary, the primary goals of fiscal policy during a deflationary period are to stimulate economic activity and raise price levels. This can be accomplished through expansionary fiscal measures, such as increasing government spending and reducing taxes. Nevertheless, the anticipated benefits of these measures must be weighed against potential costs, including the risk of escalating government debt.
