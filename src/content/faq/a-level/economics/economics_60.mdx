In a perfectly competitive market, a firm's market power does not affect its profit because all firms are price takers, lacking any control over the prices of the goods or services they offer.

Under perfect competition, numerous firms sell identical products, which means that if one firm attempts to raise its price, consumers will simply purchase from a competitor offering the same product at the market price. As a result, a firm's ability to influence prices—its market power—is virtually non-existent.

Market power is generally associated with monopolies or oligopolies, where either a small number of firms dominate the market or a single firm holds a significant position. In these market structures, firms can affect prices and, consequently, their profits by adjusting their output levels. In contrast, in a perfectly competitive setting, firms are unable to influence prices, regardless of their production quantities. Instead, prices are dictated by the interplay of supply and demand.

To maximize profits in perfect competition, firms focus on minimizing costs. They achieve this by producing at the level where marginal cost ($MC$) equals marginal revenue ($MR$). Producing at this equilibrium point ensures maximum profitability; any departure from this level would result in diminished profits. For instance, if a firm produces fewer units than this equilibrium, the marginal revenue from selling additional units would exceed the marginal cost of producing them. Conversely, if a firm produces more than this optimal quantity, the marginal cost of additional production would surpass the marginal revenue earned from selling those extra units.

In summary, in a perfectly competitive market, a firm's market power does not influence its profit. Prices are determined by market forces, and firms can only maximize profits by producing at the point where $MC = MR$. Any attempt by a firm to alter prices would be ineffective, as consumers would simply turn to other firms that sell at the prevailing market price.
