Poverty poses a significant barrier to international economic development by constraining human capital, diminishing productivity, and fostering economic instability.

In developing countries, the effects of poverty on international economic development are particularly pronounced. One of the primary mechanisms through which poverty operates is by limiting human capital. Human capital encompasses the skills, knowledge, and experience that individuals or populations possess, and it is critical to their value to organizations and nations. In impoverished regions, access to quality education and healthcare is often severely restricted. This leads to a workforce that is both less skilled and less healthy, which consequently hampers economic growth and development. A skilled and healthy workforce is essential for driving productivity and fostering innovation.

Additionally, poverty directly affects productivity levels. Individuals living in poverty frequently lack access to essential resources that enable productivity, such as adequate nutrition, safe housing, and reliable transportation. Such conditions can create a vicious cycle of poverty, where diminished productivity prevents individuals from escaping their circumstances, thereby perpetuating their economic challenges. This cycle has profound implications for economic development, as productivity is a crucial driver of economic growth.

Poverty also contributes to economic instability. When a significant portion of a country's population lives in poverty, it can lead to social unrest and political instability, which in turn can deter investment and obstruct economic development. Moreover, poverty is often linked to increased crime rates, further destabilizing the economy and discouraging investment.

Furthermore, poverty can intensify income inequality, which also hinders economic development. High levels of income inequality can foster social tension and political instability, deterring investment and stalling economic growth. Additionally, significant income disparities can restrict economic mobility, further entrenching poverty and impeding economic progress.

In summary, poverty has a profound impact on international economic development. It restricts human capital, lowers productivity, generates economic instability, and worsens income inequality, all of which can severely obstruct economic growth and development. Therefore, addressing poverty is not only a moral obligation but also an essential economic strategy.
