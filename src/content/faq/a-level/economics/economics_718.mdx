National income is determined by aggregating all the income generated by a nation's residents and businesses, providing a comprehensive representation of the total economic output.

This metric reflects the monetary value of goods and services produced within a country over a designated period, typically one year. National income is a fundamental concept in macroeconomics, offering insights into a nation's economic health and performance. Its calculation involves summing all income earned by individuals and businesses, which includes wages, profits, and rents. After this, adjustments are made for various factors such as taxes, depreciation, and net income from abroad.

There are three primary methods for calculating national income: the income approach, the output (or product) approach, and the expenditure approach. 

1. **Income Approach**: This method aggregates all incomes received by individuals and businesses in the form of wages, rents, interest, and profits.
2. **Output Approach**: This approach assesses the total value of all goods and services produced within the country.
3. **Expenditure Approach**: This method sums all spending on goods and services in the economy, which includes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.

In theory, all three approaches should yield the same national income figure. However, in practice, discrepancies may arise due to statistical inaccuracies, measurement errors, or activities within the underground economy. As a result, economists often calculate an average of the three methods to arrive at a more accurate estimate of national income.

National income serves as a crucial economic indicator, measuring the level of economic activity within a country. It provides a basis for comparing the economic performance of different nations or tracking the economic progress of a single country over time. However, it is important to recognize that national income does not reflect the distribution of income within a country, nor does it account for non-market activities or the informal economy.

In summary, national income is a comprehensive measure of a nation's economic output, calculated by aggregating all income earned by its residents and businesses. It is an invaluable tool for economists and policymakers to evaluate and compare economic performance, although it does have its limitations.
