The European Union (EU) has played a pivotal role in fostering cross-border investment by implementing a range of policies that facilitate the free movement of capital, goods, services, and people among its member states.

A cornerstone of the EU's efforts is the establishment of a single market, which encourages cross-border investment by allowing for the seamless movement of goods, services, capital, and individuals. This framework enables businesses to operate across borders without the burden of tariffs or other trade barriers. For instance, a company located in France can easily invest in a business in Germany without having to navigate a complex web of trade regulations.

In addition to the single market, the EU has introduced policies aimed at enhancing financial integration. These initiatives are designed to create a more interconnected financial landscape within the EU, simplifying the process for businesses and individuals to invest across borders. A significant step in this direction is the introduction of the common currency, the euro, which is adopted by $19$ of the $27$ member states. By eliminating exchange rate fluctuations and associated costs, the euro makes cross-border investments more attractive for both businesses and individuals.

Moreover, the EU has established regulatory frameworks that safeguard investors. These regulations are intended to ensure fair treatment of investors and protect their investments, thereby creating a more secure investment environment that can stimulate additional cross-border investment. A notable example is the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which provides a comprehensive regulatory structure for investment services throughout the EU.

Furthermore, the EU has launched various funding programs to support cross-border investment initiatives. These programs offer financial assistance to businesses and individuals interested in investing in other EU countries. For example, the European Investment Fund (EIF) provides funding specifically targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the EU, thereby promoting cross-border investment opportunities.

In summary, the EU has significantly advanced cross-border investment through a combination of policies and regulations that foster the free movement of capital, goods, services, and people, enhance financial integration, protect investors, and provide funding opportunities. These efforts have not only simplified the investment process for businesses and individuals but have also contributed to the overall economic growth and development within the EU.
