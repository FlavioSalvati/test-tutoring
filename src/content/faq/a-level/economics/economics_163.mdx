The UK government manages inflation primarily through the monetary policy implemented by the Bank of England, which primarily involves adjusting interest rates.

As the central bank of the UK, the Bank of England is tasked with executing the government's monetary policy. The principal mechanism it employs to control inflation is the modification of the base interest rate. This is the rate at which the Bank lends to other banks, and it has a significant impact on all other interest rates throughout the economy. By increasing or decreasing this rate, the Bank can influence overall levels of spending and investment, which subsequently affects the inflation rate.

When inflation rises above acceptable levels, the Bank can opt to increase the base interest rate. This adjustment makes borrowing more costly while making saving more appealing, which tends to curtail spending and slow economic activity. As demand decreases, businesses face challenges in raising prices, thereby contributing to a reduction in inflation. Conversely, in periods of low inflation, the Bank can lower the base interest rate to encourage spending and help drive inflation back toward its target level.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England convenes monthly to determine the appropriate base interest rate. The MPC's decisions are informed by a comprehensive analysis of the UK's economic landscape, which includes indicators such as growth rates, unemployment figures, wage growth, and various inflation metrics. The primary objective of the MPC is to maintain inflation as close as possible to the government's target of $2\%$ per annum, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI).

In addition to adjusting the base interest rate, the Bank of England has other monetary policy tools at its disposal to manage inflation. One such tool is quantitative easing (QE), which involves the Bank creating new money to purchase assets like government bonds. This action increases the money supply within the economy, potentially stimulating spending and aiding in the rise of inflation. However, QE is typically reserved for exceptional circumstances, such as during significant economic downturns.

In summary, the UK government controls inflation through the monetary policy actions of the Bank of England. The primary approach is the adjustment of the base interest rate, although additional methods, such as quantitative easing, may be employed when necessary. The overarching goal is to keep inflation close to the government's target of $2\%$ per year, thereby ensuring economic stability and preserving the value of money.
