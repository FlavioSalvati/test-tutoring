In addition to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), economic performance can be evaluated using various other indicators, including the unemployment rate, inflation rate, and the Human Development Index (HDI).

The unemployment rate serves as a crucial indicator of economic health. It represents the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking work. A low unemployment rate typically reflects a robust economy, suggesting that a significant portion of the population is gainfully employed and contributing to economic output. However, it is essential to consider the nature of employment. For example, a high unemployment rate accompanied by a substantial number of underemployed individuals—those working fewer hours than desired—or those in low-skilled jobs may indicate underlying economic issues.

The inflation rate is another vital metric for assessing economic performance. It quantifies the rate at which the general price level of goods and services is increasing. Moderate inflation is generally perceived as a sign of economic vitality, indicating strong demand for goods and services. Conversely, high inflation can diminish purchasing power and create economic uncertainty, while deflation, characterized by falling prices, can lead to decreased economic activity.

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite measure that incorporates life expectancy, education levels, and per capita income to rank countries into tiers of human development. This index offers a broader perspective on economic performance by accounting not only for income but also for health and educational outcomes. A high HDI score signifies that a country is not only economically prosperous but also provides a high quality of life for its citizens.

Additional measures include the Gini coefficient, which evaluates income inequality within a country, and the Happiness Index, which assesses the overall well-being of a population. The Gini coefficient ranges from $0$ (indicating perfect equality) to $1$ (indicating perfect inequality), with higher values signifying greater inequality. The Happiness Index is influenced by various factors, including social support, individual freedoms, and perceptions of corruption.

In summary, while GDP is a valuable measure of economic performance, it does not encompass all dimensions of a country's economic health and well-being. Indicators such as the unemployment rate, inflation rate, HDI, Gini coefficient, and the Happiness Index provide a more comprehensive understanding of a nation's economic performance and quality of life.
