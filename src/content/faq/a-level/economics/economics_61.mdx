An indirect tax is a government-imposed tax on goods and services, rather than on individual income or corporate profits. This type of tax is typically added to the selling price of a product or service, leading to an increase in costs for consumers. Consequently, as the price rises, the quantity demanded usually decreases, as consumers may opt to purchase less of the taxed item or switch to more affordable alternatives.

To understand the effects of an indirect tax on market price and quantity, we can utilize the concepts of supply and demand. When an indirect tax is introduced, the supply curve shifts upward by the amount of the tax. This upward shift occurs because the tax raises the production costs for suppliers, prompting them to decrease the quantity supplied at every price level. As a result, the market equilibrium price tends to increase, while the equilibrium quantity declines.

The extent of the price increase and the reduction in quantity sold is influenced by the price elasticity of demand and supply. If demand is price inelastic, meaning consumers are relatively unresponsive to price changes, the price will rise significantly while the quantity demanded will only decrease slightly. Conversely, if demand is price elastic, indicating that consumers are highly responsive to price changes, the price will experience a smaller increase, but the quantity demanded will decrease more significantly.

Similarly, the responsiveness of supply to price changes also plays a crucial role. If supply is price inelastic, suppliers will not significantly adjust their output in response to price changes, leading to a larger price increase and a smaller decrease in quantity supplied. However, if supply is price elastic, suppliers will respond more vigorously to price changes, resulting in a smaller price increase and a larger reduction in quantity supplied.

In summary, an indirect tax raises the price of a product or service and typically lowers the quantity demanded within a market. Nevertheless, the specific impact of the tax is contingent upon the price elasticity of both demand and supply.
