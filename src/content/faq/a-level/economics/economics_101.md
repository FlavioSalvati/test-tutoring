Government intervention plays a vital role in addressing the under-provision of public goods by financing and regulating their production and distribution.

By definition, public goods are characterized as non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that once these goods are made available, they can be used by everyone without diminishing their availability to others. Common examples of public goods include street lighting, public parks, and national defense. Due to these inherent characteristics, public goods often suffer from under-provision. This occurs because private firms, motivated by profit, may find it unprofitable to supply these goods, as they cannot exclude non-paying individuals from benefiting. This scenario leads to what economists refer to as "market failure."

Government intervention can effectively rectify this market failure through several mechanisms. 

Firstly, the government can take on the direct provision of public goods. This is evident in sectors such as national defense and law enforcement, where the government serves as the primary provider. By assuming this role, the government guarantees that these essential services are accessible to all citizens, irrespective of their financial means.

Secondly, the government can finance the provision of public goods via taxation. This approach is commonly applied to goods like public parks and street lighting. The costs associated with these goods are covered by the government using tax revenues collected from individuals and businesses. This method ensures that these goods are available to everyone, effectively overcoming the free-rider problem that contributes to their under-provision.

Thirdly, the government can regulate the provision of public goods. For example, it can establish standards for the quality and quantity of public goods, ensuring that they adequately meet the needs of the community. Additionally, the government can enforce regulations that prevent private firms from excluding individuals from accessing public goods, thereby ensuring that these resources remain available to all.

In summary, government intervention is essential for correcting the under-provision of public goods. By directly providing, funding, and regulating these goods, the government ensures their availability to all citizens, thereby addressing the market failure that frequently occurs in their provision.
