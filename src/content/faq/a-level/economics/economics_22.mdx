The short run costs of production are characterized by the presence of at least one fixed factor, whereas in the long run, all factors of production are considered variable.

To elaborate, the short run in economics refers to a time frame during which at least one factor of production remains fixed. Typically, this fixed factor is capital—such as machinery or buildings—which cannot be rapidly altered or adjusted. As a result, in the short run, a firm can only modify its output by varying the factors that are flexible, such as labor or raw materials. This leads to the concept of short run costs, which consist of both fixed costs, which do not change with the level of output, and variable costs, which do fluctuate with output.

For instance, if a bakery seeks to increase its bread production in the short run, it cannot swiftly construct an additional oven (a fixed cost), but it can hire more bakers or purchase extra flour (variable costs). Consequently, in the short run, the bakery’s costs will comprise a combination of fixed costs (the oven) and variable costs (the bakers and flour).

Conversely, the long run represents a period during which all factors of production can be adjusted. In this timeframe, there are no fixed inputs, as firms have sufficient time to modify every aspect of their production processes. This leads to the notion of long run costs, which are entirely variable. In the long run, firms can adapt their production scale to reach the most efficient output level.

Continuing with the bakery example, in the long run, the bakery could invest in additional ovens to boost its output capacity. Therefore, in the long run, all of the bakery’s costs—including those associated with ovens, labor, and raw materials—are variable.

In summary, the fundamental distinction between short run and long run costs of production lies in the composition of costs: short run costs encompass both fixed and variable costs, while long run costs are entirely variable, as all factors of production can be adjusted accordingly.
