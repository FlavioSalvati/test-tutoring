In a competitive market, the price is determined by the interplay of supply and demand.

A competitive market is characterized by a large number of buyers and sellers, each of whom has little to no influence over the market price. These participants are often referred to as "price takers." The market price emerges from the interaction of supply and demand.

On the demand side, consumers determine how much of a good or service they are willing and able to purchase at various price levels. Generally, as the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. This inverse relationship is depicted by a downward-sloping demand curve on a graph.

On the supply side, producers decide how much of a good or service they are willing and able to sell at different price levels. Unlike demand, the relationship between price and quantity supplied is direct: as the price increases, the quantity supplied also increases, and vice versa. This direct relationship is represented by an upward-sloping supply curve.

The point at which the supply and demand curves intersect is known as the equilibrium. At this equilibrium point, the quantity demanded matches the quantity supplied. The price at this intersection is referred to as the equilibrium price, or the market-clearing price, which is the price that prevails in a competitive market.

It is important to recognize that this equilibrium price is not fixed. Any changes in the conditions of demand or supply can shift the respective curves, resulting in a new equilibrium price. For example, if there is an increase in consumer income that leads to higher demand for a product, the demand curve will shift to the right, causing the equilibrium price to rise. Conversely, if a technological advancement reduces production costs, the supply curve will shift to the right, resulting in a lower equilibrium price.

In summary, the price in a competitive market is dictated by the forces of supply and demand, establishing a price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. Changes in these forces will lead to adjustments in the equilibrium price.
