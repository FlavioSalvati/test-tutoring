A dominant firm possesses the capacity to influence market prices by controlling the supply of a product or service.

To elaborate, a dominant firm, typically the largest player in a market, wields considerable power over the pricing of a product or service due to its substantial market share. By adjusting the quantity of the product or service it produces, the firm can directly impact the market price.

For example, if a dominant firm opts to increase its production, the overall supply of the product or service in the market will rise. Assuming demand remains constant, this increase in supply will result in a decrease in the market price. Conversely, if the dominant firm chooses to reduce its production, the supply will diminish. If demand stays constant in this scenario, the reduction in supply will lead to an increase in the market price.

Additionally, a dominant firm can exert influence over prices by establishing a price that other firms in the market must adhere to. This practice is referred to as price leadership. In this context, the dominant firm acts as the price leader, while other firms become price takers, compelled to accept the price set by the dominant firm since they lack the market power to set prices independently.

Furthermore, a dominant firm may resort to predatory pricing to manipulate market prices. This strategy involves setting prices exceptionally low to drive competitors out of the market. Once the competition has been eliminated, the dominant firm can subsequently increase its prices. This tactic may lead to a temporary decrease in market prices, followed by a significant rise once competitors are no longer in the field.

In summary, a dominant firm can influence market prices through various mechanisms. It can control the supply of products or services, set prices that other firms are obliged to follow, or engage in predatory pricing strategies. These tactics enable the dominant firm to manipulate market prices to its advantage.
