Changes in interest rates significantly influence aggregate supply within the UK economy by affecting both production costs and investment decisions.

Interest rates serve as a crucial tool for the Bank of England in managing economic conditions. When interest rates are elevated, borrowing costs increase, which may deter businesses from securing loans for investments in new machinery, technology, or other capital goods. This reluctance can hinder the growth of the economy's productive capacity, thereby reducing the long-run aggregate supply.

In contrast, when interest rates are lower, borrowing becomes more affordable, incentivizing businesses to invest. This increased investment can enhance the economy's productive capacity, leading to an expansion in long-run aggregate supply. However, it is essential to recognize that the effects of these changes are not instantaneous; businesses require time to plan and implement new investments.

Moreover, fluctuations in interest rates can impact production costs. An increase in interest rates raises the cost of borrowing, which can elevate production expenses and subsequently decrease short-run aggregate supply. Conversely, when interest rates decline, the cost of borrowing reduces, leading to lower production costs and an increase in short-run aggregate supply.

The relationship between interest rates and aggregate supply is also contingent on various external factors. For instance, if businesses harbor pessimism regarding future economic conditions, they may refrain from investing, even in a low-interest-rate environment. Conversely, if they are optimistic about the economy's trajectory, they may decide to invest despite high interest rates.

Additionally, the competitive landscape of the economy plays a role in how interest rates affect aggregate supply. In highly competitive markets, businesses may opt to absorb the increased costs associated with higher interest rates rather than passing them on to consumers through elevated prices. This behavior can mitigate the overall impact of interest rate changes on aggregate supply.

In conclusion, fluctuations in interest rates can indeed influence aggregate supply in the UK economy by shaping production costs and investment decisions. However, the effects of interest rates on aggregate supply are intricate and are influenced by a multitude of factors, including business confidence and the level of market competition.
