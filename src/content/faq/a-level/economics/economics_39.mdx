A dominant firm possesses the ability to influence market prices by controlling the supply of a product or service.

Typically characterized as a monopoly, a dominant firm wields substantial market power. This means it can affect the price of a product or service by adjusting its supply. For instance, if the firm chooses to reduce the supply of a product, the price is likely to rise due to the law of supply and demand. Conversely, if the firm increases the supply, the price may decrease. This capacity to manipulate prices is a defining feature of a dominant firm and is often associated with market failure.

One method a dominant firm may use to influence market prices is predatory pricing. This strategy involves setting prices artificially low, often below cost, with the intention of driving competitors out of the market. Once competition is diminished, the firm can subsequently raise prices significantly. While this approach can be effective, it carries risks and may result in legal challenges, as it is considered anti-competitive behavior.

Another tactic is price discrimination, where the firm charges different prices to different consumers for the same product or service. This variation in pricing can depend on factors such as location, time of purchase, or specific consumer characteristics. Price discrimination enables the firm to capture maximum consumer surplus and enhance its profits.

Additionally, a dominant firm might engage in limit pricing, which entails setting the price low enough to discourage potential entrants from entering the market. This price remains sufficiently high for the firm to earn a profit, yet low enough to deter new competitors. This strategy aids the dominant firm in maintaining its market power and controlling prices.

In some instances, a dominant firm may also practice price leadership, wherein it establishes a price that other firms in the market follow. This can result in a form of tacit collusion, where firms implicitly agree to sustain high prices instead of competing on price. Such a strategy is particularly effective in industries with a limited number of large firms, but it can also lead to anti-competitive behavior and market failure.

In conclusion, a dominant firm can manipulate market prices through various strategies, including controlling supply, predatory pricing, price discrimination, limit pricing, and price leadership. While these tactics can enhance the firm's profits and market power, they also pose risks of market failure and are often subject to legal and regulatory scrutiny.
