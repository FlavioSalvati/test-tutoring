Fiscal policy is essential for managing external debt by shaping government spending, taxation, and borrowing practices.

Fiscal policy encompasses the strategies employed by the government to collect revenue through taxation and allocate funds through expenditure, significantly impacting a nation's economy. It serves as a vital instrument for controlling external debt levels, ensuring they remain within sustainable boundaries. This is crucial, as excessive external debt can trigger various economic issues, such as inflation, currency depreciation, and even default.

One effective approach for managing external debt through fiscal policy is prudent spending. By judiciously overseeing its expenditures, the government can minimize the need for excessive borrowing. This entails prioritizing investments in critical sectors such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare while avoiding unnecessary waste. Additionally, it is important for government spending to be financed sustainably, whether through taxation or by borrowing at manageable interest rates.

Effective taxation also plays a significant role in managing external debt. By setting tax rates at appropriate levels, the government can generate sufficient revenue to cover its expenditures without resorting to excessive borrowing. Achieving this balance is delicate: excessively high taxes may deter economic activity and shrink the tax base, while excessively low taxes could result in budget deficits, necessitating further borrowing.

Moreover, fiscal policy can influence the terms under which the government borrows. By demonstrating fiscal responsibility and reliability as a borrower, the government can negotiate more favorable borrowing conditions. This may involve maintaining a balanced budget or ensuring that the overall debt remains at manageable levels.

In summary, fiscal policy is crucial for managing external debt effectively. Through its impact on government spending, taxation, and borrowing, fiscal policy helps to ensure that external debt remains at sustainable levels. This is vital for preserving economic stability and mitigating the risks associated with excessive external debt.
