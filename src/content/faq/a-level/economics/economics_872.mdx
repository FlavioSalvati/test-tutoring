Global deforestation poses significant economic challenges, including the loss of biodiversity, diminished carbon sequestration, and potential disruptions to international trade.

Deforestation, defined as the permanent removal of trees to make way for non-forest uses, is a pressing global issue with far-reaching economic consequences. One of the most immediate effects of deforestation is the loss of biodiversity. Forests are home to approximately $80\%$ of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. This biodiversity is essential not only for maintaining planetary health but also carries substantial economic value. Many pharmaceuticals are derived from plant species that are exclusively found in forests; the extinction of these species could severely impact the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, numerous communities depend on forests for their livelihoods, whether directly through activities such as logging and hunting or indirectly through tourism. Consequently, the destruction of forests can lead to significant economic repercussions at both local and global levels.

Another critical economic consequence of deforestation is the reduction in carbon sequestration. Forests play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) from the atmosphere and storing it in their biomass. This process, known as carbon sequestration, is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change. When forests are cleared, not only is this essential service lost, but the stored carbon is also released back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. The economic costs associated with this phenomenon can be staggering, as climate change may result in a variety of expensive consequences, including an increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and reduced agricultural productivity.

Lastly, deforestation can significantly affect global trade. Many countries rely on forest products for a substantial portion of their export revenues. For instance, in $2019$, the global value of exports of wood and wood products exceeded $300$ billion. However, deforestation threatens the availability of these resources, which could disrupt global trade and adversely affect the economies of both exporting and importing nations.

In summary, global deforestation negatively impacts the economy by leading to a loss of biodiversity, decreasing carbon absorption, and disrupting global trade. As forests, which harbor the majority of the world's terrestrial biodiversity and are crucial in combating climate change, continue to be destroyed, the repercussions extend to fields as diverse as medicine and employment. This destruction not only releases stored carbon, further intensifying climate change, but also jeopardizes the trade of forest products, affecting economies on a global scale.
