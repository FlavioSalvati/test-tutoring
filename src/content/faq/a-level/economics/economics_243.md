Predatory pricing in an imperfectly competitive market involves a dominant firm setting prices at an unusually low level to eliminate or hinder competition.

In such a market, a limited number of dominant firms possess the ability to influence the overall market price. Predatory pricing is a tactic employed by these firms to lower their prices to a point where competing firms cannot match them. Consequently, this forces rivals either out of the market or discourages new entrants from participating. This approach is typically temporary, as it is abandoned once the dominant firm achieves its goal of reducing competition.

The process begins when the dominant firm significantly reduces its prices. This aggressive pricing strategy compels other firms to follow suit and lower their prices to remain competitive. However, smaller firms or new entrants may lack the financial resources to sustain these reduced prices for an extended period. As a result, they may incur substantial losses and eventually exit the market. Once competition is eliminated or significantly diminished, the dominant firm can then raise its prices, thereby enjoying increased profits.

However, predatory pricing comes with inherent risks. It necessitates that the dominant firm absorb losses in the short term, with the expectation of recouping these losses later when prices are increased. There is also the danger that competitors may endure the low pricing period or that new firms could enter the market once prices rise.

Additionally, predatory pricing is often regarded as anti-competitive behavior and is illegal in many jurisdictions. Regulatory bodies, such as the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK, are responsible for maintaining market competitiveness and preventing firms from abusing their dominant position to the detriment of consumers and other businesses.

In summary, predatory pricing in an imperfectly competitive market is a strategy used by dominant firms to stifle competition by setting prices low. While it can potentially lead to higher long-term profits, it is a risky strategy that may result in financial losses and possible legal repercussions.
