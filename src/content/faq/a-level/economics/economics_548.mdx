The economic impact of global water scarcity is projected to reach as much as $6\%$ of the gross domestic product (GDP) in certain countries.

Water scarcity is a pressing global challenge with far-reaching economic consequences. By the year $2050$, it is anticipated that nearly half of the world's population will reside in areas experiencing water stress. This scarcity can negatively influence agricultural productivity, escalate healthcare costs due to waterborne diseases, and potentially trigger conflicts over water resources. Collectively, these factors can significantly affect a country's GDP.

Agriculture is the primary consumer of freshwater resources, responsible for approximately $70\%$ of all global water withdrawals. In regions facing water shortages, agricultural productivity can be drastically hindered, leading to food shortages and rising food prices. This situation can create a cascading effect throughout the economy, impacting not only the agricultural sector but also associated industries such as food processing and retail.

The health-related costs stemming from water scarcity can also be considerable. Insufficient access to clean water can facilitate the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, resulting in high healthcare expenses and decreased productivity due to illness. In developing nations, where access to clean water is often limited, these health costs can be particularly burdensome.

Moreover, water scarcity can incite conflicts over water resources, which can have profound economic repercussions. Such conflicts may disrupt trade, damage infrastructure, and divert resources from other critical areas of the economy. In extreme scenarios, they can even lead to political instability and conflict, further complicating economic challenges.

The World Bank estimates that the overall effects of water scarcity could cost specific regions up to $6\%$ of their GDP. This represents a significant economic strain, especially for developing countries where resources are already limited. Additionally, these costs are expected to rise as climate change exacerbates existing water scarcity issues.

In summary, the economic costs associated with global water scarcity are substantial, affecting various sectors of the economy, including agriculture and health. Addressing this complex issue requires comprehensive and sustainable solutions to alleviate its impact on the global economy.
