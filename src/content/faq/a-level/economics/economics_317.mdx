In an imperfectly competitive market, collusion occurs when rival firms agree to cooperate for their mutual benefit, often by fixing prices or dividing markets.

Collusion in an imperfectly competitive market refers to a situation in which firms, rather than competing against one another, choose to collaborate. This cooperation is typically aimed at enhancing their collective market power, enabling them to exert control over prices, output, or even the entire market. The primary forms of collusion include price fixing, where firms agree to sell their products at a predetermined price, and market sharing, where firms distribute the market among themselves.

Firms may opt to collude in order to maximize their joint profits. In an imperfectly competitive market, firms possess some degree of market power, allowing them to influence the price of their products. However, competition among these firms can lead to lower prices and diminished profits. By engaging in collusion, firms can circumvent this competition, thereby maintaining elevated prices and securing higher profits.

Nevertheless, sustaining collusion is often challenging. It necessitates a high level of trust and cooperation among the firms involved, which can be difficult to achieve. There is always the temptation for individual firms to deviate from the agreement, such as by secretly lowering their prices to attract more customers. Such actions can ultimately lead to the collapse of the collusion agreement.

Furthermore, collusion is generally regarded as illegal and unethical, as it can result in higher prices and reduced choices for consumers. Competition authorities, such as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK, are responsible for detecting and preventing collusion. These authorities have the authority to impose substantial fines on firms found to be engaging in collusive behavior.

In conclusion, collusion in an imperfectly competitive market involves firms cooperating to enhance their market power, often through price fixing or market division. While this practice can result in increased profits for the participating firms, it is typically detrimental to consumers and is thus subject to strict regulation by competition authorities.
