The absence of public goods can result in market failure, which creates inefficiencies in the allocation of resources within a market economy.

In an ideally functioning market, goods and services are produced and consumed according to the forces of supply and demand. However, public goods, such as street lighting, public parks, and national defense, possess two key characteristics: they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that one person's use of a public good does not diminish its availability for others, and it is not possible to prevent anyone from using it. Due to these characteristics, private firms find it unprofitable to produce public goods, as they cannot exclude non-payers from benefiting, leading to the issue of free-riders.

When public goods are not made available, market failure can occur. Market failure refers to a situation in which the market fails to allocate resources efficiently, resulting in a loss of economic and social welfare. The lack of public goods can lead to significant inefficiencies. For instance, the unavailability of public infrastructure such as roads would severely hinder the transportation of goods and services, adversely impacting trade and commerce. Furthermore, the absence of public parks could degrade the quality of life in urban environments, potentially giving rise to various social issues.

Additionally, the lack of essential public goods like national defense can create insecurity and instability, which in turn could negatively affect economic growth and development. In these scenarios, the market fails to achieve an optimal outcome for society, leading to a situation where the social cost surpasses the private cost. This phenomenon is known as a negative externality, which is another form of market failure.

In summary, the absence of public goods can lead to market failure by creating inefficiencies in resource allocation. Public goods possess unique characteristics that render them unprofitable for private enterprises to produce, resulting in their under-provision. The lack of these goods can have profound economic and social implications, resulting in a loss of welfare and a failure of the market to deliver optimal outcomes for society. Therefore, government intervention is often necessary to provide these essential goods and rectify market failures.
