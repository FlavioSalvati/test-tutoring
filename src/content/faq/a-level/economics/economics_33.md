In the long run, perfectly competitive markets naturally adjust to achieve economic equilibrium, where supply equals demand and firms earn normal profits.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms are considered price takers, meaning they cannot influence the price of the products they sell; they can only modify their output levels. In the short run, firms may experience supernormal profits (profits exceeding the normal level) or incur losses. However, these scenarios prompt market adjustments that ultimately lead to long-run economic equilibrium.

When firms in a perfectly competitive market generate supernormal profits, this situation attracts new firms to enter the market due to low barriers to entry. The influx of new firms increases the overall supply of the product, which subsequently drives down the market price. As the price decreases, the supernormal profits begin to diminish. This process continues until firms are left earning only normal profits. At this equilibrium point, no new firms are incentivized to enter the market, and existing firms have no reason to exit. Consequently, the market reaches a state of long-run equilibrium.

Conversely, if firms are facing losses, some will exit the market. This exit reduces the overall supply of the product, leading to an increase in market price. As the price rises, the losses begin to decrease. This adjustment continues until the remaining firms are earning only normal profits. At this stage, there is no incentive for firms to leave the market, nor are there incentives for new firms to enter. Thus, the market achieves long-run equilibrium.

In the long run, all factors of production are variable, enabling firms to adjust their scale of production. Firms will expand or contract their production scale until they reach the minimum point on their long-run average cost curve, which signifies productive efficiency. At this point, firms produce at the lowest possible cost per unit and earn only normal profits. This characteristic further illustrates long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market.

In summary, the long-run adjustments in a perfectly competitive market involve changes in the number of firms and the scale of production, leading to economic equilibrium where supply equals demand, firms earn normal profits, and productive efficiency is achieved.
