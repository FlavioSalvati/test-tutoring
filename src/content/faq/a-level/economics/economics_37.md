A change in income has a direct effect on the demand for goods in a market. Generally, an increase in income leads to a rise in demand, while a decrease in income results in a decline in demand.

This relationship between income and demand is a fundamental principle in economics. As an individual's income increases, their purchasing power also grows, enabling them to buy more goods and services, which results in higher demand. Conversely, a decrease in income diminishes a person's purchasing power, leading to a reduction in the demand for goods and services.

This connection is particularly pronounced for normal goodsâ€”products for which demand increases as income rises. Normal goods typically include necessities or higher-quality items. For instance, as a person's income grows, they may opt to purchase more organic food, invest in a larger home, or buy a newer vehicle.

However, it is crucial to recognize that not all goods follow this trend. Inferior goods, in contrast, experience a decrease in demand as income rises. These are products that consumers tend to buy less of when they have more income, often because they can afford to choose higher-quality alternatives. For example, as individuals' incomes increase, they may reduce their consumption of fast food in favor of dining at upscale restaurants.

The concept of income elasticity of demand quantifies this relationship. It measures the percentage change in the quantity demanded resulting from a one percent change in income. A positive income elasticity of demand indicates that the good is a normal good, whereas a negative income elasticity of demand signifies that it is an inferior good.

In summary, changes in income significantly affect the demand for goods in a market. However, the direction and extent of this impact can vary depending on the type of good and the specific characteristics of the market.
