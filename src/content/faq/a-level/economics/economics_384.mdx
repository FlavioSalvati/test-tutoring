Imperfect competition generally leads to a reduction in consumer surplus while increasing producer surplus, primarily due to elevated prices and limited output.

In markets characterized by imperfect competition, such as monopolies or oligopolies, firms possess some degree of market power. This market power enables them to influence the prices of their products or services, in contrast to perfectly competitive markets where firms are price takers. Consequently, firms operating under imperfect competition typically set prices above marginal cost, which ultimately diminishes consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price they pay. When prices rise, consumers either purchase less or pay more, resulting in a decrease in their surplus.

Conversely, producer surplus—which is the difference between the lowest price producers are willing to accept for a good and the price they receive—tends to increase in conditions of imperfect competition. This occurs because firms can charge higher prices, thereby boosting their revenue and, subsequently, their surplus. However, this scenario is not universally applicable. If a firm wields significant market power, it may choose to restrict output to maintain high prices, which could potentially decrease producer surplus in the long run.

In addition, imperfect competition often results in market inefficiencies. In a perfectly competitive market, equilibrium occurs where supply equals demand, maximizing both consumer and producer surplus. In contrast, firms in imperfect competition frequently produce less than the socially optimal level of output, which leads to deadweight loss. Deadweight loss represents a decline in economic efficiency that arises when marginal benefit does not equal marginal cost. This inefficiency results in a reduction of total surplus, which includes both consumer and producer surplus.

In summary, imperfect competition significantly affects consumer and producer surplus. Consumers typically encounter higher prices and fewer choices, leading to a decrease in consumer surplus. On the flip side, producers may benefit from increased prices, resulting in a higher producer surplus. Nevertheless, the overall impact on surplus is contingent upon the degree of market power and the specific characteristics of the market.
