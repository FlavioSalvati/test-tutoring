Collusion among firms can result in market failure by diminishing competition, which in turn leads to elevated prices and reduced output.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms strive to offer consumers the best prices and products. This competition fosters innovation, enhances efficiency, and ensures fair pricing. However, when firms engage in collusion, they effectively operate as a single entity, coordinating their actions to set prices and output levels in order to maximize their joint profits. This behavior erodes the competitive market structure and may precipitate market failure.

Collusion can manifest in several ways, including price fixing, market sharing, and bid rigging. Price fixing occurs when firms agree to sell their products at a predetermined price, usually higher than what would prevail in a competitive market. As a consequence, consumers end up paying more for goods and services than they would in a competitive environment. Market sharing involves firms partitioning the market among themselves, with each agreeing to refrain from competing in specific areas. This practice diminishes consumer choice and can lead to higher prices. Bid rigging involves firms colluding to determine the winner of a bid, thereby undermining the integrity of the competitive bidding process.

When firms collude, they effectively create a monopoly or oligopoly, where either a single firm or a small group of firms exerts control over the market. This market structure can result in allocative inefficiency, where resources are not distributed in a manner that maximizes consumer and producer surplus. In a competitive market, the price of a good or service is determined by the forces of supply and demand, reflecting the marginal cost of production and the marginal benefit to consumers. Conversely, in a collusive market, firms can set prices above the marginal cost, resulting in a loss of consumer surplus and a deadweight loss to society.

Furthermore, collusion can inhibit innovation. In a competitive market, firms are motivated to innovate to gain a competitive advantage. However, when firms collaborate, this incentive diminishes, as they are no longer competing against one another. This can lead to technological stagnation and a decline in dynamic efficiency.

In conclusion, collusion between firms can lead to market failure by undermining competition, resulting in higher prices, reduced output, allocative inefficiency, and a decline in dynamic efficiency. For these reasons, collusion is typically deemed illegal under competition law. However, detecting and proving collusion can be quite challenging, making it a persistent issue in many markets.
