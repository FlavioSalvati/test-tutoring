**Absorption and Action Spectra**

Absorption spectra display the specific wavelengths of light that are absorbed by a pigment, while action spectra illustrate the effectiveness of various wavelengths in facilitating a biological process.

**Absorption Spectra**  
Absorption spectra are instrumental in identifying the wavelengths of light absorbed by a specific pigment. This process involves shining a beam of white light through a sample containing the pigment and measuring the amount of light transmitted through the sample. The resulting graph illustrates the absorbed wavelengths, which can aid in identifying the pigment and understanding its functional role. For a more detailed examination of this in the context of photosynthesis, please refer to the relevant resources.

**Action Spectra**  
Conversely, action spectra reveal the effectiveness of different wavelengths of light in promoting biological processes. For instance, the action spectrum for photosynthesis depicts the wavelengths most effective in driving this process. This is determined by measuring the rate of photosynthesis at various wavelengths and plotting the results on a graph. Additional information can be found in the corresponding literature.

While absorption spectra are valuable for identifying pigments and understanding their functions, action spectra provide deeper insights into the biological processes influenced by light. By comparing the absorption and action spectra of a pigment, scientists can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the pigmentâ€™s role in critical biological functions such as photosynthesis or vision. For further exploration of these processes within plant cells, please consult the designated resources.

**A-Level Biology Tutor Summary:**  
Absorption spectra indicate which wavelengths of light are absorbed by a pigment, whereas action spectra highlight the most effective wavelengths for biological processes. Absorption spectra assist in pigment identification, while action spectra elucidate how light drives processes like photosynthesis. By analyzing both spectra, scientists can enhance their understanding of the pigment's role in biological functions. Detailed mechanisms are explored in the provided literature.
