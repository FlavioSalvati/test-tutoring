Oxidative phosphorylation is a vital process in aerobic respiration that generates ATP by harnessing energy from the electron transport chain.

This final stage of aerobic respiration takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It involves the transfer of electrons from the electron carriers NADH and FADH2 to the electron transport chain (ETC) through a series of redox reactions. The energy released during these reactions is utilized to pump protons ($\text{H}^+$) from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, thereby establishing an electrochemical gradient.

Once the protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase—a complex enzyme—they drive the synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate. This process is known as chemiosmosis and accounts for the majority of ATP generated during aerobic respiration.

Oxidative phosphorylation is remarkably efficient, capable of producing up to $34$ ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Its efficiency is closely regulated by the availability of oxygen, which serves as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. In the absence of oxygen, the electron transport chain ceases to function, resulting in an accumulation of NADH and FADH2 and a significant reduction in ATP production.

In summary, oxidative phosphorylation is essential for aerobic respiration, producing the bulk of ATP through the mechanisms of the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis. Its high efficiency and regulation by oxygen availability underscore its importance in cellular energy production.
