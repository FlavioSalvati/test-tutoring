The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium provides a mathematical framework for predicting the frequency of alleles within a population.

This model operates under several key assumptions: the population is sufficiently large, mating occurs randomly, and there are no influences from mutation, migration, or natural selection. Under these conditions, the model predicts that allele frequencies will remain constant across generations. Consequently, the proportions of homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive individuals will also remain stable.

The fundamental equation used to calculate allele frequencies in a population is given by 

$$
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1,
$$ 

where $p$ represents the frequency of the dominant allele and $q$ denotes the frequency of the recessive allele. This equation can also be utilized to predict the distribution of genotypes within the population.

If the observed frequencies of alleles or genotypes significantly deviate from the predicted values, it indicates that one or more assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium may have been violated. Such deviations can help identify various factors that influence the genetic composition of a population, including natural selection or genetic drift.

The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium serves as a valuable tool for understanding the genetic structure of diverse populations, applicable to a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to humans.
