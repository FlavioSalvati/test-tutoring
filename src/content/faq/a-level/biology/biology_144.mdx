A genotype represents the genetic composition of an organism, while a phenotype encompasses its observable characteristics.

The term "genotype" refers to the genetic information inherited from an organism's parents. This includes all the genes and alleles that contribute to an individual's traits. Genotypes are often denoted using letters or symbols, such as $AA$, $Aa$, or $aa$, which indicate the different forms of a gene based on the inheritance pattern.

In contrast, the "phenotype" pertains to the physical and behavioral traits that can be observed in an organism. These traits arise from the interaction between the organism's genotype and its environment. Examples of phenotypic traits include eye color, height, and various behaviors.

Although genotype and phenotype are interconnected, they do not always align perfectly. For instance, an individual may inherit two recessive alleles for a particular trait from both parents (resulting in the genotype $aa$). However, if a dominant allele is present, it can overshadow the expression of the recessive allele, leading to the dominant phenotype (which could be represented by genotypes $Aa$ or $AA$).

Grasping the relationship between genotype and phenotype is crucial in fields such as genetics, evolution, and medicine. By investigating the genetic foundations of phenotypic traits, scientists can uncover insights into the development and evolution of organisms, as well as the origins and potential treatments of genetic disorders.
