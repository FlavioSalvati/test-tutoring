Amino acids can be classified into two categories: essential and non-essential. 

**Essential Amino Acids**  
Essential amino acids are those that the body cannot synthesize on its own, meaning they must be obtained through dietary sources. There are nine essential amino acids: 
- Histidine 
- Isoleucine 
- Leucine 
- Lysine 
- Methionine 
- Phenylalanine 
- Threonine 
- Tryptophan 
- Valine 

These amino acids play a vital role in protein synthesis, and a deficiency in any of these can result in adverse health effects.

**Non-Essential Amino Acids**  
In contrast, non-essential amino acids can be produced by the body, so they do not necessarily need to be consumed through diet. There are eleven non-essential amino acids: 
- Alanine 
- Arginine 
- Asparagine 
- Aspartic acid 
- Cysteine 
- Glutamic acid 
- Glutamine 
- Glycine 
- Proline 
- Serine 
- Tyrosine 

While these amino acids are not essential for survival, they perform important functions in the body, including the synthesis of enzymes and hormones.

**Conclusion**  
It is crucial to understand that the term "non-essential" does not imply a lack of importance. Both essential and non-essential amino acids are vital for optimal bodily function. However, a balanced diet that includes all nine essential amino acids is particularly important for maintaining overall health.
