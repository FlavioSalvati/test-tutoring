Innate immunity is present from birth, whereas acquired immunity develops over time as a result of exposure to various pathogens.

Innate immunity serves as the body's first line of defense against pathogens and is already established at birth. This type of immunity includes physical barriers such as skin and mucous membranes, as well as chemical barriers like enzymes and antimicrobial peptides. Additionally, innate immunity involves immune cells, including macrophages and natural killer cells, which are capable of recognizing and eliminating pathogens.

In contrast, acquired immunity emerges over time through exposure to pathogens. It is characterized by the production of specific antibodies and immune cells that can identify and respond to particular pathogens. Acquired immunity can be classified as either active or passive. Active immunity is generated by the bodyâ€™s own immune response, while passive immunity is obtained from another source, such as through the placenta or breast milk.

A significant distinction between innate and acquired immunity lies in their specificity. Innate immunity is non-specific; it can respond to a broad range of pathogens, whereas acquired immunity is highly specific, targeting distinct pathogens. Another key difference is their memory capabilities. Innate immunity lacks memory, meaning it cannot recognize or respond more effectively to pathogens it has previously encountered. In contrast, acquired immunity possesses memory, enabling it to mount a faster and more effective response to pathogens it has encountered in the past.

To summarize, innate immunity is a non-specific defense mechanism present at birth, while acquired immunity is a highly specific response that develops over time and has the ability to remember previous encounters with pathogens.
