Somatic reflexes and autonomic reflexes serve distinct functions in the body, primarily differentiating based on the types of muscles and control mechanisms involved.

**Somatic Reflexes**  
Somatic reflexes are specifically associated with skeletal muscles and are characterized as voluntary responses. These reflexes typically involve three main components: a sensory neuron that detects a stimulus, an interneuron located in the spinal cord, and a motor neuron that triggers the contraction of skeletal muscles. Common examples of somatic reflexes include the knee-jerk reflex, which tests the integrity of the spinal cord, and the withdrawal reflex, which occurs in response to painful stimuli.

**Autonomic Reflexes**  
In contrast, autonomic reflexes pertain to smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glandular activity. These reflexes are involuntary and are regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is further divided into two branches: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for "fight or flight" responses, while the parasympathetic nervous system promotes "rest and digest" activities.

Examples of autonomic reflexes include the pupillary reflex, which adjusts the size of the pupils in reaction to varying light conditions, and the baroreceptor reflex, which plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure. Autonomic reflexes are essential for maintaining homeostasis, ensuring that the internal environment of the body remains stable even as external conditions change.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, somatic reflexes involve skeletal muscles and are under voluntary control, whereas autonomic reflexes involve smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands, functioning involuntarily. Both types of reflexes are vital for preserving homeostasis within the body.
