Sex-linked genes are found on the sex chromosomes, which are the X and Y chromosomes, and they exhibit distinct inheritance patterns compared to autosomal genes.

The inheritance of sex-linked genes differs from that of autosomal genes due to the presence of only one X chromosome in males, while females possess two X chromosomes. As a result, if a male inherits a recessive allele on his X chromosome, he will express the corresponding trait, as he lacks a second X chromosome that could potentially mask the effect of the recessive allele. In contrast, females must inherit two copies of the recessive allele—one from each X chromosome—to express the trait.

A well-known example of a sex-linked gene is the gene responsible for hemophilia, a disorder affecting blood clotting. Hemophilia results from a recessive allele located on the X chromosome, making males more susceptible to the disorder than females. For females to be affected by hemophilia, both of their X chromosomes must carry the recessive allele, which is significantly less common than in males.

Another example of a sex-linked gene is that associated with red-green color blindness. This condition is also caused by a recessive allele on the X chromosome, leading to a higher prevalence of color blindness among males compared to females. Females can only be color blind if both of their X chromosomes carry the recessive allele, but they can still be carriers of the trait and transmit it to their offspring.

In summary, sex-linked genes are crucial in shaping inheritance patterns and can result in unique phenotypic outcomes. Understanding these inheritance patterns is essential for predicting the likelihood of certain traits and disorders in future generations.
