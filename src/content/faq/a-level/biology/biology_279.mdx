Polygenic inheritance refers to the involvement of multiple genes in determining a single trait, while multiple allele inheritance pertains to the existence of more than two alleles for a gene within a population.

Polygenic inheritance represents a complex inheritance pattern in which several genes collectively influence the expression of a single trait. This results in a continuous range of variation for that trait, rather than distinct categories. Common examples of polygenic traits include height, skin color, and intelligence. Such traits are shaped by both genetic and environmental factors, making them challenging to predict or manage.

On the other hand, multiple allele inheritance occurs when a gene has three or more alleles present in a population. This means that there are various forms of the gene that can be expressed. A well-known example of multiple allele inheritance is the ABO blood group system in humans, which consists of three alleles: A, B, and O. The A and B alleles exhibit codominance, while the O allele is recessive. Consequently, this results in four distinct blood types: A, B, AB, and O.

Both polygenic and multiple allele inheritance patterns play significant roles in enhancing the genetic diversity of populations. Understanding these inheritance mechanisms is crucial in fields such as genetics, medicine, and agriculture.
