The greenhouse effect is a natural process that plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's temperature, while global warming refers specifically to the rise in temperatures caused by human activities.

The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, including carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), water vapor ($H_2O$), and methane ($CH_4$), trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back into space. This mechanism is vital for sustaining life on Earth, as it maintains the planet's temperature within a range that supports living organisms.

In contrast, global warming describes the increase in average global temperatures observed over the past century, largely attributed to human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes. These actions have contributed to a rise in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thereby intensifying the greenhouse effect and leading to a rise in the Earth's temperature.

While the greenhouse effect is a necessary and natural phenomenon that supports life, global warming is a human-induced challenge that poses significant environmental and societal consequences. These repercussions include rising sea levels, an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and alterations in ecosystems and biodiversity. Consequently, it is imperative to take proactive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of global warming.
