Freshwater ecosystems are characterized by bodies of water with low salt concentrations, while marine ecosystems are found in saltwater environments.

Freshwater ecosystems, which include rivers, lakes, and ponds, typically have a salt concentration of less than $1\%$. This low salinity influences the types of organisms that can thrive in these environments. For instance, freshwater fish have evolved specialized kidneys that enable them to excrete excess water. Additionally, freshwater ecosystems are influenced by various factors, including temperature, pH, and nutrient levels. For further insights into how populations adapt to their environments, please refer to relevant resources.

In contrast, marine ecosystems are located in saltwater environments such as oceans, seas, and estuaries, where the salt concentration is generally around $3.5\%$. This higher salinity impacts the organisms that can survive there. For example, marine fish have adapted to the saline conditions by developing specialized gills that allow them to excrete excess salt. Marine ecosystems are also shaped by factors like temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability. To gain a broader understanding of these ecosystems, consider exploring additional materials.

Both freshwater and marine ecosystems play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity and providing essential ecosystem services, such as water purification and carbon sequestration. However, they are facing significant threats, including pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change. To delve deeper into the effects of pollution on aquatic ecosystems, please consult relevant studies. Understanding the distinctions between these ecosystems is vital for creating effective conservation and management strategies. Additionally, learning about species interactions within these ecosystems can offer valuable insights.

**A-Level Biology Tutor Summary:** Freshwater ecosystems, found in lakes and rivers, have low salt levels and unique organisms such as fish with specialized kidneys. Marine ecosystems, located in saltwater areas like oceans, have higher salt levels and creatures with adapted gills. Both types of ecosystems are crucial for biodiversity but are threatened by pollution. Recognizing their differences is essential for effective conservation and management.
