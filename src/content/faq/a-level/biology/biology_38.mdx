Stress hormones have the capacity to influence gene expression and behavior through epigenetic modifications.

One prominent stress hormone, cortisol, activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in alterations in gene expression. When cortisol is released, it binds to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) located in the cytoplasm. Upon binding, these receptors translocate to the nucleus and interact with specific DNA sequences known as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). Depending on the target gene and the cellular context, this binding may either upregulate or downregulate gene expression.

Beyond their direct influence on gene expression, stress hormones also facilitate epigenetic modifications. For instance, cortisol can promote an increase in DNA methylation, which may result in long-lasting changes in gene expression patterns. These alterations can impact behavior by modifying the expression of genes associated with stress responses, mood regulation, and cognitive functions.

Moreover, stress hormones can influence behavior through their interactions with neurotransmitters. Cortisol, for example, has been shown to lower serotonin levels, potentially leading to symptoms associated with depression and anxiety. Conversely, it may elevate dopamine levels, thereby enhancing reward-seeking behaviors.

In summary, stress hormones exert intricate effects on both gene expression and behavior. While acute stress responses can be adaptive, chronic stress may induce maladaptive changes in gene expression and behavior, potentially contributing to the onset of mental health disorders.
