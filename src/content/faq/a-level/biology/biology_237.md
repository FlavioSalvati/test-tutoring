Various ecosystems play a crucial role in regulating carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere through a range of natural processes.

Forests are among the most effective ecosystems for managing carbon dioxide levels. Trees absorb carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis and store it in their biomass and the surrounding soil. This phenomenon is referred to as carbon sequestration. Additionally, forests release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, which is vital for the respiration of both humans and animals.

Oceans also significantly contribute to the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Tiny marine plants known as phytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. When these organisms die, they sink to the ocean floor, effectively transporting the carbon dioxide with them. This process is commonly called the biological pump. Furthermore, oceans absorb carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, leading to its dissolution in seawater, where it forms carbonic acid. This interaction is often referred to as ocean acidification.

Wetlands are another ecosystem that effectively regulates carbon dioxide concentrations. They store carbon in their soils, which are rich in organic matter. While wetlands do release methane—a potent greenhouse gas—the amount of carbon they sequester far exceeds the methane emissions, making wetlands overall a net carbon sink.

In summary, different ecosystems contribute to the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations through various processes, including carbon sequestration, the biological pump, and carbon storage in soil. A thorough understanding of these processes is essential for mitigating the impacts of climate change.
