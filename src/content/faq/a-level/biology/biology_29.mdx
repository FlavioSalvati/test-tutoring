A dominant allele is expressed in a heterozygous individual, meaning that only one copy of the dominant allele is needed for its trait to be visible. In contrast, a recessive allele is only expressed when an individual is homozygous, requiring two copies of the recessive allele for its trait to manifest.

Genes are composed of alleles, which are alternative forms of a gene that give rise to different variations of a trait. For instance, if an individual inherits a dominant allele for brown eyes from one parent and a recessive allele for blue eyes from the other parent, they will exhibit brown eyes. This occurs because the dominant allele is sufficient for expression, overriding the recessive allele.

Conversely, recessive alleles can only be expressed in a homozygous condition. This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele to display that trait. For example, if someone inherits two recessive alleles for blue eyes, they will have blue eyes due to the expression of the recessive allele. However, if they inherit one dominant allele for brown eyes and one recessive allele for blue eyes, they will still have brown eyes, as the presence of the dominant allele ensures its expression.

It is important to recognize that a dominant allele is not necessarily the most common allele in a population, nor are recessive alleles always rare. The expression of an allele is influenced by its interaction with other alleles as well as environmental factors. Understanding the distinction between dominant and recessive alleles is crucial for predicting inheritance patterns of traits and genetic disorders.
