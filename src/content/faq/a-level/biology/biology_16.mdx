DNA and RNA exhibit distinct structural and functional characteristics. DNA serves as the genetic material, responsible for the storage and transmission of genetic information, whereas RNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis.

DNA is structured as a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides, each of which includes a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The four nitrogenous bases found in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). During cell division, DNA replication occurs; the two strands of DNA separate, acting as templates for the creation of new complementary strands.

In contrast, RNA is a single-stranded molecule also composed of nucleotides that consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The four nitrogenous bases in RNA include adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). RNA is integral to protein synthesis, as it carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes, where it directs the synthesis of proteins.

There are three primary types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). mRNA is responsible for transmitting genetic information from DNA to ribosomes, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis. tRNA transports specific amino acids to the ribosomes, facilitating the assembly of proteins. rRNA is a fundamental component of ribosomes, playing a key role in catalyzing the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids.

In summary, DNA and RNA differ significantly in both structure and function. DNA functions as the genetic material that stores and transmits genetic information, while RNA is a single-stranded molecule involved in protein synthesis. RNA carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis, with three main types: mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA, each fulfilling a distinct role in this essential process.
