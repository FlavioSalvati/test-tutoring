Genetic recombination occurs during meiosis through a process known as crossing over.

During meiosis, homologous chromosomes align and exchange genetic material in a process called crossing over. This event takes place during prophase I, when the chromosomes condense and become visible under a microscope. The paired chromosomes form a structure known as a tetrad, where segments of the chromosomes can break and swap places with their corresponding segments on the other chromosome. This exchange results in the recombination of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, leading to the formation of new allele combinations.

The frequency of genetic recombination during meiosis can vary based on the distance between genes located on the chromosome. Genes that are situated closer together tend to have a lower likelihood of undergoing crossing over, whereas genes that are spaced further apart are more prone to being separated through this process. This mechanism of genetic recombination significantly enhances genetic diversity within a population, as it generates new allele combinations that can be inherited by offspring.

In summary, genetic recombination during meiosis is a crucial process that fosters genetic diversity within populations. By generating novel combinations of alleles, it plays a vital role in the evolution of new traits and adaptations, which can enhance the survival and adaptability of organisms in changing environments.
