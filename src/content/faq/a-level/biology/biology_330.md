Peptide and steroid hormones exhibit distinct mechanisms of action in their responses within target cells.

Peptide hormones are water-soluble molecules that bind to receptors located on the surface of target cells. This binding initiates a secondary messenger system, which activates various enzymes, including adenylate cyclase and protein kinase. These enzymes subsequently activate transcription factors, leading to changes in gene expression. This process is characterized by its rapid onset and short duration, as peptide hormones are typically degraded quickly after their action.

In contrast, steroid hormones are lipid-soluble and can easily traverse the cell membrane to bind with intracellular receptors. Once formed, the hormone-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. This mechanism is generally slower and results in longer-lasting effects, as steroid hormones are not rapidly broken down.

The specific response of a target cell to a hormone is influenced by several factors: the type of hormone, the receptor to which it binds, and the downstream signaling pathways that are activated. Peptide hormones play critical roles in various physiological processes, including growth and metabolism, while steroid hormones are vital for regulating reproductive functions and stress responses.

In summary, although peptide and steroid hormones operate through different mechanisms, both are essential for maintaining homeostasis within the body.
