Sensory receptors play a vital role in detecting stimuli by converting these stimuli into electrical signals that the nervous system can interpret.

These specialized cells respond to specific types of stimuli, including light, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Sensory receptors are distributed throughout various parts of the body, such as the skin, eyes, ears, tongue, and nose. When a stimulus is detected, the sensory receptor transforms it into an electrical signal, which is subsequently transmitted to the nervous system for processing.

The detection of a stimulus begins with the activation of the sensory receptor. This activation can occur through direct contact with the stimulus, as seen with touch receptors in the skin, or through the binding of a molecule to a receptor, which occurs in taste and smell receptors. Upon activation, the receptor generates an electrical signal called the receptor potential.

This receptor potential is then transmitted to the nervous system through a process known as transduction. During transduction, the receptor potential is converted into an action potentialâ€”a brief electrical signal that travels along the nerve fiber. The action potential is then conveyed to the brain, where it is interpreted as a specific sensation.

In summary, sensory receptors are essential for detecting stimuli and enabling us to perceive the world around us. By converting stimuli into electrical signals that the nervous system can interpret, sensory receptors allow us to experience sensations such as touch, taste, and smell, and to react appropriately to changes in our environment.
