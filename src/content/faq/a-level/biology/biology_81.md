A habitat is defined as the physical environment where an organism resides, while a niche describes the specific role that organism plays within that environment.

The term "habitat" refers to the particular location inhabited by an organism, encompassing both the physical and biological factors that characterize that environment. These factors include elements such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of other living organisms. For instance, the habitat of a polar bear could be the Arctic tundra, which provides essential resources like food and shelter from extreme cold.

Conversely, a "niche" pertains to the distinct role an organism fulfills within its habitat. This concept includes aspects such as dietary habits, interactions with other organisms, and reproductive behaviors. For example, the niche of a polar bear can be described as that of a top predator, primarily feeding on seals and other animals found in the Arctic ecosystem.

While habitat and niche are interconnected concepts, they are fundamentally different. Multiple organisms can inhabit the same habitat but occupy varying niches. Conversely, an organism may occupy the same niche as others while existing in different habitats. Grasping the distinctions between habitat and niche is crucial for understanding the interactions between different species, their environment, and the overall functioning of ecosystems.
