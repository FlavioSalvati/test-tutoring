Invasive species pose a serious threat to ecosystem health and biodiversity.

These non-native organisms are introduced into new environments where they can cause significant harm. Invasive species often outcompete native species for vital resources, alter the physical characteristics of their surroundings, and disrupt essential ecological processes. As a result, biodiversity can decline as native species are either displaced or driven to extinction.

In addition to affecting species diversity, invasive species can disrupt ecosystem functioning by altering key processes such as nutrient cycling, pollination, and seed dispersal. For instance, the introduction of the Asian long-horned beetle in North America has led to the destruction of millions of trees, adversely affecting carbon storage and nutrient cycling within the impacted ecosystems.

Moreover, the economic repercussions of invasive species can be considerable. They may lead to reduced agricultural yields and increased costs associated with managing their spread. Additionally, invasive species can pose risks to human health, exemplified by the transmission of diseases through invasive mosquito populations.

In summary, invasive species represent a significant challenge to ecosystem integrity and biodiversity. It is crucial to prevent their introduction and manage their spread effectively to protect native species and preserve healthy ecosystems.
