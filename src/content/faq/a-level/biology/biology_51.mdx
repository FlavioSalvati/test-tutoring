B cells and T cells play crucial roles in the adaptive immune response by recognizing and responding to specific antigens.

B cells are primarily responsible for the production of antibodies—proteins that bind to specific antigens and mark them for destruction by other immune cells. When a B cell encounters an antigen that matches its specific receptor, it becomes activated and begins to proliferate. Some of the resulting daughter cells differentiate into plasma cells, which produce large quantities of antibodies capable of neutralizing or eliminating the antigen. Other daughter cells develop into memory B cells, which enable a rapid response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen.

In contrast, T cells do not produce antibodies; instead, they help orchestrate the immune response. There are several types of T cells, including helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and regulatory T cells. Helper T cells recognize antigens presented by other immune cells and release cytokines that stimulate the activation and proliferation of additional immune cells. Cytotoxic T cells, also known as killer T cells, directly attack and destroy infected cells, targeting those harboring viruses or other intracellular pathogens. Regulatory T cells play a vital role in maintaining immune tolerance, preventing the immune system from mistakenly attacking the body’s own cells and tissues.

In summary, B cells and T cells collaborate effectively to mount a targeted and specific immune response against invading pathogens.
