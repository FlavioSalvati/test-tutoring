The sex ratio plays a crucial role in influencing both population growth and genetic diversity by determining the number of offspring produced by each sex.

In many species, the sex ratio is approximately equal, with about $50\%$ males and $50\%$ females. However, in certain species, this ratio can be skewed toward one sex. For instance, in some bird species, the sex ratio tends to favor males, while in various reptiles, it is often biased toward females.

The sex ratio significantly impacts population growth. In species where females produce more offspring than males, a skewed sex ratio favoring females can result in rapid population increases. Conversely, in species where males are responsible for producing more offspring, a skewed sex ratio favoring males can lead to slower population growth.

Additionally, the sex ratio influences genetic diversity. In populations with an imbalanced sex ratio, the overall genetic diversity may decline because fewer individuals contribute to the gene pool. This reduction in genetic diversity can heighten the risk of inbreeding and diminish the population's ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

In summary, the sex ratio is a vital factor in both population growth and genetic diversity. Understanding its implications is essential for effectively managing and conserving various species.
