Sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons collaborate to transmit nerve impulses throughout the nervous system.

**Sensory Neurons**  
Sensory neurons are tasked with conveying sensory information from the body's sensory receptors to the central nervous system (CNS). These neurons are activated by various stimuli, including touch, temperature, and pain. They play a critical role by converting these physical stimuli into electrical signals, which are then relayed to the CNS for processing.

**Interneurons**  
Interneurons reside within the CNS and serve as an intermediary between sensory and motor neurons. They receive and integrate information from sensory neurons, subsequently transmitting signals to motor neurons. Interneurons are essential for processing this information and making decisions regarding how the body should respond to different stimuli.

**Motor Neurons**  
Motor neurons transmit signals from the CNS to the muscles and glands throughout the body. These neurons are crucial for controlling movement and regulating various bodily functions. Upon receiving a signal from the CNS, a motor neuron releases neurotransmitters that initiate muscle contractions or stimulate glandular secretions.

In summary, sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons work in concert to enable the body to react to its surroundings. Sensory neurons detect stimuli, interneurons process the incoming information, and motor neurons execute the appropriate responses. This intricate communication system is vital for survival, allowing organisms to adapt effectively to their changing environments.
