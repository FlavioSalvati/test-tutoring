Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are two widely used treatments for cancer, each operating through distinct mechanisms.

Chemotherapy employs the use of drugs to eliminate cancer cells or inhibit their ability to divide. These medications are typically administered either intravenously or orally and circulate throughout the body to target cancerous cells. Chemotherapy may be utilized as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with other therapies, such as surgery or radiation. While it is effective for treating various types of cancer, it may also lead to side effects, including nausea, hair loss, and fatigue.

In contrast, radiation therapy utilizes high-energy radiation to destroy cancer cells. This radiation can be delivered either externally or internally, depending on the specific type and location of the cancer. External radiation therapy involves directing a focused beam of radiation at the tumor from outside the body, while internal radiation therapy, also known as brachytherapy, entails placing a radioactive source inside the body, close to the cancerous tissue. Similar to chemotherapy, radiation therapy can be applied alone or in combination with other treatments. It is particularly effective for localized cancers but may cause side effects such as skin irritation, fatigue, and damage to surrounding healthy tissues.

In summary, chemotherapy and radiation therapy represent two distinct approaches to cancer treatment. Chemotherapy relies on pharmacological agents to kill or inhibit the growth of cancer cells, while radiation therapy employs high-energy radiation to achieve the same goal. Both modalities can be effective in treating cancer, yet they also carry potential side effects that require careful management. The selection of the appropriate treatment is influenced by numerous factors, including the type and stage of cancer, the patient's overall health, and the potential risks and benefits associated with each therapeutic approach.
