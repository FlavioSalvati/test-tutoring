Muscles in the human body serve distinct roles in facilitating movement and responding to various stimuli.

**Skeletal Muscles**  
Skeletal muscles are responsible for voluntary movements, such as walking and lifting weights. These muscles are attached to bones via tendons and typically operate in pairs to produce movement. Under conscious control, skeletal muscles can be trained to enhance their strength and efficiency.

**Smooth Muscles**  
Smooth muscles are located in the walls of internal organs, including the stomach and intestines. They are responsible for involuntary movements, such as the contractions that occur during digestion. Unlike skeletal muscles, smooth muscles are not under conscious control; instead, they are regulated by the autonomic nervous system.

**Cardiac Muscles**  
Cardiac muscles are found exclusively in the heart and play a crucial role in pumping blood throughout the body. These muscles are also involuntary and possess a unique characteristic: they can contract rhythmically without experiencing fatigue. Cardiac muscle activity is regulated by the autonomic nervous system as well as hormones.

All three types of muscles—skeletal, smooth, and cardiac—work in concert to produce coordinated movements and responses. The nervous system sends electrical signals to these muscles, prompting them to contract and generate movement. The specific type of muscle activated depends on the nature of the required movement. For instance, skeletal muscles are engaged during activities like running and jumping, while smooth muscles facilitate processes such as digestion.
