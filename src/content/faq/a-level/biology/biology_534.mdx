Enzymes play a crucial role in biochemical reactions by reducing the activation energy necessary for these reactions to proceed.

As biological catalysts, enzymes accelerate chemical reactions by decreasing the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. They achieve this by binding to reactant molecules, positioning them in close proximity and in the correct orientation, which facilitates the reaction. Consequently, this reduction in energy makes it more likely for the reaction to take place.

Enzymes exhibit a high degree of specificity, catalyzing only a particular reaction or a closely related group of reactions. This specificity arises from the unique shape of the enzyme's active site, which is complementary to the shape of the reactant molecules. When the reactants bind to the active site, the enzyme undergoes a conformational change that further aligns the reactants, thereby enhancing the likelihood of the reaction occurring.

Moreover, the activity of enzymes is influenced by various factors, including temperature, pH, and substrate concentration. Variations in these parameters can alter the shape of the enzyme's active site, potentially increasing or decreasing its catalytic efficiency.

In summary, enzymes are essential for lowering the activation energy required for biochemical reactions. They bind to reactant molecules, aligning them appropriately and facilitating the reaction. Enzymes are highly specific and their activity can be influenced by several environmental factors.
