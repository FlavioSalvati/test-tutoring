Prokaryotic cells are characterized by the absence of a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, whereas eukaryotic cells possess both of these features.

Prokaryotic cells are structurally simple. They do not contain a nucleus; instead, their genetic material is organized into a single circular chromosome located within the cytoplasm. Additionally, prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. They do, however, contain ribosomes, which play a crucial role in protein synthesis. Prokaryotic cells are primarily found in domains such as bacteria and archaea.

In contrast, eukaryotic cells exhibit greater structural complexity. They contain a nucleus that houses their genetic material, which is organized into multiple linear chromosomes. Eukaryotic cells also possess organelles like mitochondria, which are essential for energy production, and the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism. Eukaryotic cells can be found in a variety of organisms, including animals, plants, fungi, and protists.

One of the significant differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is their size. Prokaryotic cells are generally smaller, with diameters typically ranging from $0.1$ to $5$ micrometers, while eukaryotic cells are larger, with diameters ranging from $10$ to $100$ micrometers.

In summary, the distinctions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells illustrate their unique evolutionary pathways and adaptations to diverse environments. Understanding these differences is crucial for comprehending the vast diversity of life on Earth and the fundamental processes that regulate cellular function.
