Passive transport refers to the movement of molecules across a membrane without the expenditure of energy, whereas active transport requires energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient.

In the context of plant nutrient uptake, passive transport occurs primarily through the processes of diffusion and osmosis. Diffusion is defined as the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. On the other hand, osmosis specifically refers to the movement of water molecules from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential. These processes facilitate the absorption of essential nutrients such as water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.

Conversely, active transport necessitates the use of energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient. This mechanism is crucial for the uptake of vital nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Plants utilize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to energize the transport proteins responsible for moving these nutrients across their membranes.

A notable example of active transport in plant nutrient uptake is the proton pump. This pump uses ATP to transport hydrogen ions out of the cell, thereby establishing a concentration gradient that enables the uptake of other nutrients, such as potassium and calcium. Another significant example is the nitrate transporter, which employs ATP to facilitate the movement of nitrate ions into the cell.

In summary, passive transport enables the absorption of certain nutrients through diffusion and osmosis, while active transport is essential for the uptake of critical nutrients against the concentration gradient. Plants rely on ATP to fuel the transport proteins that make active transport possible.
