Monomers undergo a process known as polymerization to create polymers.

Polymerization is the chemical process through which monomers bond together, forming polymers. This process entails the establishment of covalent bonds between monomers, resulting in the formation of long chains consisting of repeating units. There are two primary types of polymerization: addition polymerization and condensation polymerization.

**Addition Polymerization** occurs when monomers containing unsaturated bonds, such as alkenes, join together to form a polymer. In this process, the double bond in the monomer is broken, allowing a new bond to form with another monomer. This reaction continues, leading to the development of a long-chain polymer.

**Condensation Polymerization**, on the other hand, involves the combination of two different monomers to produce a polymer along with a small molecule, typically water. In this process, a functional group is removed from each monomer, and these groups then combine to form the small molecule. The remaining functional groups react to create covalent bonds, resulting in the formation of the polymer.

Polymers exhibit a diverse range of properties, which are influenced by the specific monomers used and the type of polymerization process employed. For instance, addition polymerization often yields polymers with high tensile strength, whereas condensation polymerization can produce polymers with significant elasticity. Understanding the intricacies of polymerization is crucial for developing new materials tailored for various applications, each with distinct properties.
