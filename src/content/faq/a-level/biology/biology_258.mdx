A gene is defined as a sequence of DNA that encodes a protein, which is a molecule responsible for carrying out specific functions within the body.

Both genes and proteins are fundamental components of living organisms. Genes are segments of DNA that contain the precise instructions necessary for synthesizing a particular protein. These instructions are encoded in the sequence of nucleotides that comprise the gene. When a gene is expressed, the DNA sequence undergoes transcription to produce a molecule of RNA, which is subsequently translated into a protein.

Proteins are intricate molecules that serve a diverse array of functions within the body. They consist of chains of amino acids that fold into specific three-dimensional shapes, which ultimately determine their functional roles. Some proteins function as enzymes, catalyzing biochemical reactions in the body, while others serve as structural components of cells and tissues. Additionally, certain proteins act as hormones, which are signaling molecules that regulate various physiological processes.

Although genes and proteins are closely related, they are not interchangeable. Each gene is associated with the coding of a specific protein, and alterations in the DNA sequence of a gene can result in modifications to the corresponding protein. These alterations can have significant effects on an organism's phenotype, which refers to its observable characteristics. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between genes and proteins is crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of life and for developing innovative treatments for genetic disorders.
