Human activities significantly disrupt nutrient cycling and negatively impact ecosystem health in several ways.

One of the most notable impacts arises from the use of fertilizers in agriculture. While fertilizers can enhance crop yields, they can also cause nutrient imbalances and contribute to the pollution of waterways. Excessive nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, can lead to algal blooms, which deplete oxygen levels in aquatic ecosystems. This depletion can result in the death of fish and other aquatic organisms.

Deforestation and changes in land use further disrupt nutrient cycling by altering the nutrient balance within the soil. When forests are cleared, the nutrients stored in plant biomass are lost, leading to decreased soil fertility. This loss can trigger soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and a decline in the productivity of crops and vegetation. Additionally, deforestation exacerbates nutrient imbalances, further disrupting the cycling processes.

Moreover, human activities influence nutrient cycling by altering the carbon dioxide balance in the atmosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation have significantly increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This rise can affect plant growth and nutrient uptake, which in turn can have cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. Changes in plant growth can disrupt the food web and further influence nutrient cycling.
