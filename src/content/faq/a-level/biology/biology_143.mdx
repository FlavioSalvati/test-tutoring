Cilia and flagella are both cellular structures that facilitate movement, yet they exhibit notable differences in size and function.

Cilia are small, hair-like projections found on the surface of various cell types. Typically shorter than flagella, cilia are present in large quantities on a single cell. They operate in a coordinated fashion, generating a wave-like motion that either propels the cell itself or helps move substances across its surface. Cilia are prevalent in a wide range of organisms, from single-celled protists to complex animals, including humans. In humans, for instance, cilia are located in the respiratory tract, where they play a crucial role in moving mucus and other particles out of the lungs.

Conversely, flagella are longer and less numerous than cilia. These structures are generally found either singly or in pairs and are primarily responsible for propulsion. Flagella exhibit a whip-like motion, enabling the cell or organism to navigate through a fluid environment. They are found in various organisms, including bacteria and sperm cells in animals. In bacteria, flagella facilitate movement toward nutrients or away from harmful substances.

In summary, while both cilia and flagella serve the purpose of movement, they differ significantly in their size and function. Cilia are shorter and more abundant, assisting in the movement of substances across the cell surface. In contrast, flagella are longer and less numerous, primarily functioning to propel the organism through its environment.
