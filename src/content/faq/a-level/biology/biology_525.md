Renewable resources can be naturally replenished, whereas non-renewable resources are finite and cannot be replaced once they are exhausted.

Renewable resources are defined as those that can be replenished naturally and sustainably. Examples include solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy. These resources are deemed sustainable because they can be utilized repeatedly without depleting their overall supply. For instance, solar energy is generated by the sun and can be captured using solar panels, while wind energy is produced by the movement of air, which can be harnessed through wind turbines.

In contrast, non-renewable resources are limited and cannot be regenerated once consumed. These include fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as minerals like copper and gold. Non-renewable resources have taken millions of years to form, yet they are being depleted at a rate far exceeding their natural replenishment. Consequently, their use is unsustainable and contributes to significant environmental issues, including climate change and pollution.

In summary, the primary distinction between renewable and non-renewable resources lies in their ability to be naturally replenished. Renewable resources can be utilized sustainably, whereas non-renewable resources are finite, leading to environmental challenges. As we strive for a more sustainable future, it is essential to prioritize the adoption of renewable resources and reduce our dependency on non-renewable ones.
