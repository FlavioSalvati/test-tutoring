The carbon cycle is a vital biogeochemical process that transfers carbon through both living and non-living components of the Earth's ecosystem.

As an essential element for life, carbon plays a significant role in maintaining equilibrium among the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial environments. The cycle initiates when plants absorb carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. In this process, $\text{CO}_2$ is transformed into organic compounds, which plants utilize for growth and energy. When animals consume these plants, they also ingest carbon, which is then incorporated into their own organic structures.

Upon the death of organisms, the carbon contained within their bodies is returned to the environment. This release can occur through respiration, where living organisms exhale $\text{CO}_2$ back into the atmosphere, or through decomposition, where dead organisms are broken down by decomposers such as bacteria and fungi. Additionally, carbon can be sequestered in the soil or stored in fossil fuels, including coal and oil.

However, human activities—such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation—have disrupted the natural balance of the carbon cycle. This disruption has resulted in elevated levels of atmospheric $\text{CO}_2$, which significantly contribute to climate change. Therefore, understanding the carbon cycle and its integral role within the Earth’s ecosystem is essential for devising effective strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote the sustainability of our planet.
