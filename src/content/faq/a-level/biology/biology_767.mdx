Transport proteins and ion channels are integral membrane proteins that play a vital role in facilitating the movement of various substances across cell membranes.

Transport proteins are specifically involved in the movement of large or polar molecules. They bind to particular molecules and undergo conformational changes to transport these molecules across the membrane. There are two main types of transport proteins: carrier proteins and channel proteins. Carrier proteins bind to specific molecules and change shape to facilitate their passage through the membrane. In contrast, channel proteins create a pore in the membrane, allowing molecules to flow through.

Ion channels, a specialized type of channel protein, enable the movement of ions across the membrane. These channels exhibit high selectivity, permitting only specific ions to pass. Ion channels are regulated by different factors, including voltage, ligands, or mechanical stimuli. 

- **Voltage-gated ion channels** open or close in response to changes in membrane potential.
- **Ligand-gated ion channels** respond to the binding of specific molecules, opening or closing accordingly.
- **Mechanically-gated ion channels** react to mechanical stimuli such as pressure or stretch, regulating their state based on physical changes.

In conclusion, transport proteins and ion channels are essential for the regulated movement of substances across cell membranes. They ensure the selective transport of molecules and ions, which is crucial for maintaining the cell's internal environment and enabling its response to external signals.
