Hemoglobin transports oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood during gas exchange in mammals.

During gas exchange, oxygen from the air diffuses into the lungs and then into the bloodstream. Hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells, binds to the oxygen molecules and transports them to the body's tissues. This process is known as oxygenation.

Hemoglobin also plays a crucial role in the removal of carbon dioxide from the body. As cells use oxygen to produce energy, they also produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. This carbon dioxide diffuses into the bloodstream and is transported back to the lungs. Hemoglobin binds to the carbon dioxide molecules and transports them back to the lungs, where they are exhaled.

The ability of hemoglobin to bind to both oxygen and carbon dioxide is due to its unique structure. Hemoglobin is made up of four protein subunits, each containing a heme group. The heme group contains an iron atom that can bind to either oxygen or carbon dioxide.

The efficiency of gas exchange in mammals is dependent on the amount and quality of hemoglobin in the blood. Certain conditions, such as anemia or sickle cell disease, can affect the production or function of hemoglobin, leading to impaired gas exchange and potentially life-threatening complications.
