Cellulose is a complex carbohydrate that serves as the primary structural component of plant cell walls.

Plant cells are encased in a rigid cell wall that provides essential support and protection. This cell wall consists of several layers, including the primary cell wall, secondary cell wall, and middle lamella. Cellulose constitutes approximately $40\%-50\%$ of the cell wall's mass. It is a long, linear polymer composed of glucose monomers linked together by strong beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds. These bonds are notably resistant to hydrolysis, contributing to the overall strength and rigidity of the cell wall.

Cellulose is synthesized by enzymes known as cellulose synthases, which are located in the plasma membrane. Glucose monomers are transported across this membrane and incorporated into the growing cellulose chain. As the chain elongates, it is extruded from the cell, forming microfibrils. These microfibrils are then cross-linked with one another, resulting in the final structure of the cell wall.

The arrangement of cellulose microfibrils within the cell wall is highly organized. The microfibrils are layered and oriented in various directions, which enhances the cell wall's strength and enables it to withstand external forces, such as turgor pressure. Additionally, cellulose microfibrils provide a scaffold for other components of the cell wall, including hemicellulose and pectin, which play crucial roles in maintaining the structure and functionality of the cell wall.

In summary, cellulose is an essential component of plant cell walls, providing strength, rigidity, and support. Its unique structure and synthesis process are fundamental to plant biology.
