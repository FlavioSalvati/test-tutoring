Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of an enzyme, effectively blocking substrate binding and consequently reducing enzyme activity. In contrast, non-competitive inhibitors attach to a different site on the enzyme, known as the allosteric site. This interaction leads to a conformational change in the enzyme, which alters the shape of the active site and diminishes its activity.

Competitive inhibitors directly compete with the substrate for access to the active site. While they do not undergo any chemical reaction with the enzyme, their presence prevents substrate molecules from binding. This inhibition can be counteracted by increasing the concentration of the substrate, which enhances the likelihood of substrate binding to the active site. A notable application of competitive inhibition in medicine is seen in the treatment of heart disease, where statins are employed to inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, thereby reducing cholesterol production.

On the other hand, non-competitive inhibitors bind to the allosteric site, distinct from the active site. Their binding induces a structural change in the enzyme, which modifies the active site's configuration and reduces its activity. Unlike competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be reversed by simply increasing substrate concentration, as the inhibitor does not compete for the active site. An example of therapeutic non-competitive inhibition is the use of methotrexate in cancer treatment, where it inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, leading to a decrease in DNA synthesis within cancer cells.

In summary, both competitive and non-competitive inhibitors reduce enzyme activity but do so through different mechanisms. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for the development of therapeutic drugs and for gaining insights into enzyme functionality.
