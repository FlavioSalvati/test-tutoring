The nervous system and the endocrine system are two critical communication networks within the body, each employing distinct methods to transmit information. 

The nervous system relies on electrical impulses for rapid message transmission, whereas the endocrine system uses hormones to convey messages more slowly, but with effects that tend to last longer.

### Nervous System

The nervous system is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It plays a vital role in controlling and coordinating various body functions. This system is divided into two main components:

1. **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: This includes the brain and spinal cord.
2. **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: This consists of the nerves that extend from the CNS to the rest of the body.

### Endocrine System

In contrast, the endocrine system is made up of glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. These hormones circulate throughout the body and interact with specific receptors on target cells, eliciting various physiological responses. Key glands in the endocrine system include:

- The pituitary gland
- The thyroid gland
- The adrenal glands
- The pancreas

### Interaction Between Systems

Both the nervous and endocrine systems collaborate to maintain homeostasis within the body. For instance, when the nervous system detects a change in body temperature, it can signal the endocrine system to release hormones that help regulate that temperature. Additionally, these two systems interact during the stress response, where the nervous system stimulates the adrenal glands to release stress hormones.

### Conclusion

In summary, the nervous system communicates through rapid electrical impulses, while the endocrine system utilizes hormones for slower but more sustained effects. Together, these systems work in concert to uphold the body's internal balance and respond to changes in the environment.
