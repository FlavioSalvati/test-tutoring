Energy flows through food chains and webs within ecosystems, moving from producers to top predators. 

Energy flow refers to the transfer of energy from one organism to another in an ecosystem. Producers, primarily plants, harness energy from the sun via photosynthesis, converting it into chemical energy stored in organic compounds. This energy is subsequently transferred to herbivores that consume the producers, and then to carnivores that feed on the herbivores. Each stage in this sequence is known as a trophic level, and it is important to note that energy is lost at each level due to metabolic processes and heat dissipation.

Food webs illustrate a more intricate structure than food chains, as they depict the interconnectedness of various food chains within an ecosystem. In a food web, energy can flow in multiple directions, allowing organisms to occupy more than one trophic level. For instance, a predator may feed on both herbivores and other predators, while a herbivore may consume a variety of plant species.

The efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels is relatively low; only about $10\%$ of the energy is transferred from one level to the next. Consequently, the amount of energy available to top predators is significantly less than that available to producers. This limitation results in ecosystems being able to support only a restricted number of top predators.

Human activities, such as deforestation and overfishing, can significantly disrupt energy flow in ecosystems by eliminating producers and altering food webs. Therefore, understanding energy flow is crucial for conservation efforts aimed at preserving the balance within ecosystems.
