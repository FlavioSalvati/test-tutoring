The cytoskeleton serves as a dynamic network of protein filaments that is crucial for maintaining the cell's shape and facilitating movement.

It is composed of three primary types of protein filaments: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. 

1. **Microfilaments** are the thinnest of these filaments, primarily constructed from actin proteins. They play a vital role in supporting the cell's shape and are actively involved in various forms of cell movement, such as muscle contraction.

2. **Intermediate filaments** are thicker than microfilaments and provide significant mechanical strength to cells. These filaments are particularly important in cells that experience substantial mechanical stress, such as skin cells, helping them maintain structural integrity.

3. **Microtubules** are the thickest filaments in the cytoskeleton and are made up of tubulin proteins. They contribute to the overall shape of the cell and are essential for processes such as cell division and the transportation of materials within the cell.

In addition to providing structural support, the cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role in cell movement. Microfilaments and microtubules are integral to the locomotion of cells, such as the migration of white blood cells toward sites of infection. Furthermore, microtubules act as tracks along which organelles can move throughout the cell, ensuring proper distribution and function of cellular components.

In summary, the cytoskeleton is indispensable for maintaining the cell's shape and structural integrity, as well as for enabling movement and division. Without a functional cytoskeleton, cells would struggle to maintain their shape and would be unable to move effectively.
