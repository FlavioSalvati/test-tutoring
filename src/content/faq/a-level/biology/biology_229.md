Action potentials are essential for transmitting electrical signals along the axon of a neuron.

When a neuron encounters a stimulus, such as the binding of a neurotransmitter to receptors on its dendrites, the membrane potential of the neuron undergoes a change. If this change in membrane potential is sufficient to exceed a specific threshold, it initiates an action potential.

An action potential is characterized by a swift depolarization followed by repolarization of the neuron's membrane potential. This process is facilitated by the opening and closing of ion channels in the membrane. When the membrane potential reaches a critical threshold, voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing sodium ions ($Na^+$) to flood into the cell, leading to depolarization.

As the membrane potential peaks, voltage-gated potassium channels open, permitting potassium ions ($K^+$) to exit the cell, which results in repolarization. This rapid alteration in membrane potential generates an electrical signal that propagates along the axon of the neuron.

At the axon terminal, the electrical signal prompts the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse, enabling communication with other neurons or target cells.

In summary, action potentials are vital for transmitting information throughout the nervous system, facilitating rapid and precise communication between neurons.
