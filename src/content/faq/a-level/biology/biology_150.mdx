Mycorrhizal fungi establish symbiotic relationships with plants, facilitating nutrient uptake through a variety of mechanisms.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) penetrate the root cells of plants and form structures called arbuscules. These arbuscules significantly enhance the surface area available for nutrient exchange. Additionally, AMF secretes enzymes that decompose organic matter, thereby releasing essential nutrients for the plant. In return, the plant supplies the fungi with carbohydrates.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) develop a protective sheath around the tips of plant roots, which extends into the surrounding soil to extract nutrients. Similar to AMF, they produce enzymes to break down organic matter and can form mutualistic relationships with various soil microorganisms. In this exchange, the plant provides carbohydrates to the fungi in return for vital nutrients.

Orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) exhibit a high degree of specificity and form symbiotic associations with orchids. These fungi assist in nutrient uptake by breaking down complex organic materials and producing enzymes that release nutrients. Furthermore, OMF play a crucial role in the germination and establishment of orchids by supplying necessary nutrients.

Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ERMF) form symbiotic relationships with plants that thrive in acidic soils, such as those found in heathlands. They facilitate nutrient uptake by producing enzymes that decompose organic matter and access soil nutrients. In this mutualistic relationship, the plant provides the fungi with carbohydrates in exchange for essential nutrients.

In summary, mycorrhizal fungi enhance plant nutrient uptake through multiple mechanisms, including increasing the surface area for nutrient exchange, producing enzymes that decompose organic matter, and forming mutualistic partnerships with other soil microorganisms. Each type of mycorrhizal fungus possesses specific adaptations that optimize nutrient acquisition in various environmental conditions.
