Transcription is the process through which an RNA copy is synthesized from a gene's DNA sequence.

During transcription, the DNA double helix unwinds, and one of the strands serves as a template for the formation of a complementary RNA molecule. The enzyme RNA polymerase reads the DNA sequence and sequentially adds nucleotides to the growing RNA strand according to specific base pairing rules: adenine (A) pairs with uracil (U) and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). This process continues until RNA polymerase encounters a termination signal, completing the RNA molecule.

The RNA molecule produced through transcription is known as messenger RNA (mRNA), as it carries the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it is subsequently translated into a protein. Before exiting the nucleus, the mRNA undergoes several post-transcriptional modifications, including splicing and capping. These modifications are crucial as they help protect the mRNA and regulate its function.

Transcription plays a vital role in gene expression, enabling the genetic information encoded in DNA to be converted into functional proteins. The rate of transcription can be influenced by a variety of factors, including transcription factors and epigenetic modifications, which can impact the accessibility of the DNA to the RNA polymerase enzyme. Disruptions in the regulation of transcription can lead to numerous diseases, including cancer.
