Synapses are essential structures that facilitate communication between neurons by transmitting signals via the release of neurotransmitters.

Neurons interact with one another at synapses, which are specialized junctions formed between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another. When an action potential reaches the terminal end of an axon, it prompts the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors located on the postsynaptic membrane. This binding action opens ion channels, resulting in the depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Depending on the specific type of neurotransmitter and receptor involved, this depolarization can either excite or inhibit the postsynaptic neuron.

The efficacy of a synapse can be altered through a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity. Long-term potentiation (LTP) occurs when repeated activation of a synapse enhances the strength of that synaptic connection. Conversely, long-term depression (LTD) results in a weakening of the synaptic connection. These processes are believed to be fundamental mechanisms underlying learning and memory.

Disruptions in synaptic function can contribute to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. Medications that target specific neurotransmitter systems can be utilized to treat these conditions by modulating synaptic transmission.

In summary, synapses are vital for neuronal communication, enabling the transmission of signals between neurons and allowing for the modulation of synaptic strength through the processes of synaptic plasticity.
