Gibbs free energy is a key concept in thermodynamics that helps determine the spontaneity of chemical reactions by measuring the energy available to perform work.

The Gibbs free energy change, denoted as $\Delta G$, is a thermodynamic property that quantifies the energy available for work within a system. It incorporates both the changes in enthalpy, represented as $\Delta H$, and the changes in entropy, denoted as $\Delta S$, during a reaction. A negative value of $\Delta G$ indicates that the reaction is spontaneous, meaning it can occur without the need for additional external energy. Conversely, a positive value of $\Delta G$ signifies that the reaction is non-spontaneous and requires energy input to proceed.

The connection between $\Delta G$ and spontaneity can be understood through the second law of thermodynamics, which asserts that in any spontaneous process, the total entropy of the universe must increase. Specifically, a spontaneous reaction is associated with a negative $\Delta G$, as it releases energy and thus increases the entropy of both the system and its surroundings. On the other hand, a non-spontaneous reaction, which has a positive $\Delta G$, necessitates an input of energy, resulting in a decrease in the overall entropy of the system and its surroundings.

Moreover, the magnitude of $\Delta G$ is indicative of how far a reaction will proceed towards completion. A significantly negative $\Delta G$ suggests that the reaction is highly exergonic and will likely go to completion. In contrast, a slightly negative $\Delta G$ indicates that the reaction is only marginally exergonic and will reach equilibrium. A positive $\Delta G$ implies that the reaction is endergonic and will not proceed spontaneously.

In summary, Gibbs free energy plays a vital role in determining both the spontaneity of chemical reactions and the extent to which these reactions will proceed towards completion. A thorough understanding of the relationship between $\Delta G$ and spontaneity is essential for accurately predicting and controlling chemical reactions.
