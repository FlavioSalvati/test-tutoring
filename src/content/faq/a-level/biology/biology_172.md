Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a crucial role in regulating the progression of the cell cycle.

Cyclins are a family of proteins that modulate the activity of CDKsâ€”enzymes responsible for controlling various phases of the cell cycle. The interplay between cyclins and CDKs ensures that the cell cycle advances in a regulated and coordinated fashion.

During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, cyclin D is synthesized. This cyclin binds to CDK4 and CDK6, forming a complex that facilitates the transition into the S phase. In the S phase, cyclin E is produced, which associates with CDK2 to trigger DNA replication. As the cell progresses to the G2 phase, cyclin A is synthesized, binding to CDK1 to prepare the cell for mitosis. Finally, during the M phase, cyclin B is produced and binds to CDK1, initiating the process of mitosis.

The levels of cyclins and CDKs are meticulously regulated through various mechanisms, including transcriptional control, post-transcriptional modifications, and targeted degradation. For instance, the degradation of cyclin B by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is essential for the cell to exit mitosis.

Mutations in either cyclins or CDKs can result in unregulated cell division, which is a hallmark of cancer development. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how cyclins and CDKs regulate the cell cycle is vital for advancing cancer therapies.
