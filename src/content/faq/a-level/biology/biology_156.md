Amino acids serve as the fundamental building blocks of proteins. Each amino acid consists of three main components: an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a distinctive side chain, often referred to as the R group.

Proteins are synthesized by linking amino acids together through peptide bonds, resulting in a long chain known as a polypeptide. Each amino acid possesses a unique R group, which defines its chemical properties and influences how it interacts with neighboring amino acids within the chain.

There are 20 different amino acids that are commonly found in proteins, each characterized by its own specific R group. Some of these R groups are hydrophobic, meaning they tend to repel water, while others are hydrophilic, indicating an affinity for water. This variation in properties significantly impacts how the protein folds into its final three-dimensional structure.

The sequence of amino acids in a protein is dictated by the genetic code, where each three-letter codon in DNA corresponds to a particular amino acid. After the polypeptide chain is synthesized, it undergoes a series of folding and modifications to achieve its functional protein structure.

Proteins play a myriad of essential roles in the body, including catalyzing biochemical reactions, transporting molecules, and providing structural support. A protein's specific function is intrinsically linked to its shape, which is ultimately determined by the sequence of amino acids in the chain. Any alteration in this sequence can lead to the formation of a non-functional protein, potentially resulting in various diseases.
