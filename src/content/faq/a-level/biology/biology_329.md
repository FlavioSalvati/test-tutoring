DNA replication occurs through a semi-conservative process that involves multiple enzymes working in concert.

During the replication process, the double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds and separates into two individual strands. Each strand acts as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. The enzyme helicase is responsible for unwinding the DNA double helix, while topoisomerase alleviates the tension that arises from this unwinding. Single-stranded binding proteins play a crucial role by keeping the two strands apart and preventing them from re-annealing.

The enzyme primase synthesizes a short RNA primer on each strand, providing a necessary starting point for DNA synthesis. Following this, DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides to the 3’ end of the RNA primer, creating a new DNA strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The leading strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized in short segments known as Okazaki fragments.

Afterward, DNA polymerase I removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA nucleotides. DNA ligase then seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous DNA strand. Finally, various enzymes proofread and repair the newly synthesized DNA molecules to ensure their accuracy and integrity.

In summary, DNA replication is a sophisticated process that relies on a variety of enzymes working together to guarantee the accurate transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.
