Keystone species and dominant species both play crucial roles in the dynamics of ecosystems, but they fulfill different functions. 

Keystone species exert a disproportionate influence on their ecosystems, even though they are not necessarily the most abundant. These species are vital for maintaining the balance of their environment, and their removal can lead to significant ecological changes. A prime example is the sea otter, a keystone species in kelp forest ecosystems. Sea otters feed on sea urchins, which, if left unchecked, can overgraze kelp. The absence of sea otters would drastically alter the structure and health of the kelp forest ecosystem.

In contrast, dominant species are characterized by their abundance within an ecosystem. While they may influence the ecosystem's functioning, their impact can vary based on their interactions with other species. For instance, grasses often dominate grassland ecosystems; however, they might not play a keystone role in sustaining that ecosystem's overall health. Nevertheless, dominant species can serve as important indicators of ecosystem health, as fluctuations in their populations can signal broader ecological changes.

In summary, keystone species are defined by their significant impact on ecosystem dynamics, while dominant species are recognized for their abundance. Both types of species are essential to understanding and managing ecosystems, but they contribute in different ways. Recognizing the distinct roles of keystone and dominant species is vital for effective ecosystem management and conservation.
