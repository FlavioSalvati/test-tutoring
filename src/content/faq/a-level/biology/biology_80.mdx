An ecological niche and a geographic range are two fundamental concepts in ecology that help us understand the dynamics of species within their environments.

An **ecological niche** refers to the specific role and position of a species within its ecosystem. This concept encompasses the physical and biological factors that influence the species' survival and reproduction. For instance, consider a bird species that occupies a niche as a seed-eater; this means that it primarily feeds on seeds and contributes to seed dispersal in its environment. Various elements can shape a species' niche, including competition with other species, predation pressures, and prevailing environmental conditions.

Conversely, a **geographic range** denotes the area in which a species is found. This includes the physical boundaries of its habitat as well as the distribution of individuals within that habitat. For example, a bird species may have a geographic range that extends across multiple continents, or it might be confined to a specific local region. Several factors can influence a species' geographic range, such as climate variations, topographical features, and human activities.

In summary, although ecological niche and geographic range are interconnected concepts, they pertain to different dimensions of a species' existence. The ecological niche outlines the species' functional role within its ecosystem, whereas the geographic range defines the spatial area where the species can be located. A thorough understanding of these concepts is essential for effective conservation strategies and for grasping the complexities of ecological interactions.
