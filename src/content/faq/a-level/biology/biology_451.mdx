Nucleotides are fundamental units that consist of three components: a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group.

These building blocks form nucleic acids, which serve as the genetic material in living organisms. The nitrogenous base can be classified as either a purine (adenine or guanine) or a pyrimidine (cytosine or thymine in DNA, or uracil in RNA). The sugar molecule varies depending on the type of nucleic acid: it is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA. The phosphate group is linked to the sugar molecule and carries a negative charge, enabling nucleotides to connect with one another through phosphodiester bonds.

In the case of DNA, nucleotides arrange themselves into a double-stranded helix. The nitrogenous bases pair specifically through hydrogen bondsâ€”adenine pairs with thymine, while guanine pairs with cytosine. This specific base pairing is crucial for the accurate replication of DNA during cell division. Conversely, in RNA, nucleotides form a single-stranded chain, where base pairing may occur between complementary sequences.

The order of nucleotides in both DNA and RNA encodes the genetic information that is inherited across generations. Mutations in this nucleotide sequence can result in alterations to the genetic code, potentially affecting an organism's traits and overall health. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of nucleotides is vital for grasping the principles of genetics and the molecular foundations of life.
