Steroid hormones influence gene expression by binding to specific receptors, which either activate or repress the transcription process.

These hormones are lipid-soluble molecules, allowing them to easily traverse the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, they bind to specific receptors located in the cytoplasm or nucleus of target cells. After binding, the hormone-receptor complex can translocate into the nucleus, where it directly interacts with specific DNA sequences known as hormone response elements (HREs) found in the promoter regions of target genes.

The effect of steroid hormones on transcription depends on the specific hormone-receptor complex and the target gene involved. In some cases, steroid hormones activate transcription by recruiting coactivator proteins that facilitate the recruitment of RNA polymerase, thereby initiating the transcription process. Conversely, in other instances, they may repress transcription by recruiting corepressor proteins that inhibit this process.

Moreover, steroid hormones can also exert indirect effects on gene expression by modulating the activity of other transcription factors or signaling pathways. For instance, certain steroid hormones can activate or inhibit kinases or phosphatases that regulate the activities of transcription factors such as AP-1 or NF-ÎºB.

In summary, steroid hormones play a vital role in regulating gene expression across various physiological processes, including development, metabolism, and immune function. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms through which steroid hormones affect gene expression is crucial for grasping the underlying biology of these processes and for developing new therapies to address diseases associated with the dysregulation of steroid hormone signaling.
