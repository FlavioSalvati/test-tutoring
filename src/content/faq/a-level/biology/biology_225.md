Microevolution refers to minor genetic changes within a population, while macroevolution pertains to significant evolutionary transformations that occur over extended periods.

Microevolution encompasses alterations in the frequency of alleles within a population. These changes can arise from mechanisms such as natural selection, genetic drift, or gene flow. Although microevolution can lead to the emergence of new traits or adaptations within a species, it does not result in the formation of new species.

Conversely, macroevolution involves the emergence of new species and higher taxonomic groups through processes including speciation, extinction, and adaptive radiation. These changes unfold over much longer time scales and often coincide with substantial shifts in the environment or the genetic composition of a population.

Although microevolution and macroevolution are distinct concepts, they are closely related. Microevolutionary changes can accumulate over time, leading to macroevolutionary patterns. Likewise, macroevolutionary events can influence the direction and rate of microevolutionary processes.

Grasping the differences between microevolution and macroevolution is crucial for studying the history and diversity of life on Earth. This understanding also helps predict how species may adapt to future environmental changes.
