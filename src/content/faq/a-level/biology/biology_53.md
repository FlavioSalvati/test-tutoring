Exponential growth is characterized by unlimited population increase, while logistic growth eventually stabilizes as it reaches a carrying capacity.

Exponential growth occurs when a population expands at a constant rate, unhindered by limiting factors. In this scenario, the population size doubles over a fixed time interval. This type of growth is commonly observed in newly established populations or those introduced to a new environment. However, exponential growth cannot persist indefinitely, as resource limitations and increased competition inevitably arise. For a more in-depth exploration of population dynamics, refer to the relevant literature.

In contrast, logistic growth incorporates limiting factors such as food availability, predation, and disease. As the population increases, resource availability diminishes, leading to a decrease in the population growth rate. Eventually, the population reaches its carrying capacityâ€”the maximum number of individuals that the environment can sustain. At this stage, the growth rate levels off, and the population size stabilizes. A deeper understanding of these dynamics can be found in specialized sources.

In summary, exponential growth illustrates how populations can expand indefinitely at a constant rate, particularly in new environments with abundant resources. Logistic growth, on the other hand, reflects the impact of resource limitations, causing population growth to decelerate and ultimately stabilize at the carrying capacity. This model offers a more realistic depiction of population behavior in natural settings. The interplay between these growth models is essential for understanding population dynamics and ecological balance.
