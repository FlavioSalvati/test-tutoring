Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes from two parents, whereas asexual reproduction occurs with only one parent.

In sexual reproduction, offspring are produced through the merging of gametes from two distinct parents. This process begins with the formation of haploid gametes via meiosis, which subsequently combine during fertilization to create a diploid zygote. One of the key benefits of sexual reproduction is the genetic diversity it generates, as offspring inherit a unique combination of genes from both parents.

In contrast, asexual reproduction entails the production of offspring from a single parent without the involvement of gametes. This can occur through various mechanisms, such as budding, fragmentation, or parthenogenesis. The result of asexual reproduction is that the offspring are genetically identical to the parent, since there is no exchange of genetic material.

Both sexual and asexual reproduction have their own advantages and disadvantages. Sexual reproduction promotes genetic diversity, which can enhance survival rates in changing environments and reduce the likelihood of genetic diseases. However, it requires the energy-intensive processes of gamete production and mate searching, which can be time-consuming. Conversely, asexual reproduction is efficient and consumes less energy, but it may lead to a decrease in genetic diversity and increased vulnerability to environmental changes.

In summary, sexual and asexual reproduction are two distinct reproductive strategies, each with its unique set of pros and cons. The choice between these methods is influenced by various factors such as environmental conditions, available resources, and overall reproductive success.
