Keystone species are essential for maintaining the integrity and functionality of ecosystems. 

These species exert a disproportionately large influence on their environment relative to their population size. The removal of a keystone species can lead to dramatic alterations in the ecosystem's structure and function. For instance, sea otters are considered a keystone species in kelp forest ecosystems. They predate on sea urchins, which are herbivorous creatures that consume kelp. In the absence of sea otters, sea urchin populations can surge unchecked, resulting in overgrazing of kelp and ultimately leading to the collapse of the kelp forest ecosystem.

Moreover, keystone species enhance biodiversity by creating habitats for other organisms. A prime example is the beaver, which is a keystone species in wetland ecosystems. The construction of dams by beavers creates ponds and wetlands that serve as vital habitats for a diverse range of species, including fish, amphibians, and waterfowl.

Beyond their ecological significance, keystone species also hold economic and cultural importance. The African elephant, for example, is a keystone species in savanna ecosystems, and its presence can draw ecotourism, thereby providing economic benefits to local communities.

In summary, keystone species are crucial for sustaining the health and functionality of ecosystems. Recognizing their significance can enhance our ability to manage and conserve these vital ecosystems for the benefit of future generations.
