Cancer is a complex disease characterized by mutations in cellular processes that result in uncontrolled cell growth.

At its core, cancer arises from alterations in the DNA of cells. These mutations can occur spontaneously or may be induced by external factors, such as exposure to radiation or certain chemicals. The mutations often impact genes responsible for regulating critical processes like cell growth, division, and programmed cell death (apoptosis), ultimately leading to the formation of tumors.

There are two primary categories of genes that frequently undergo mutations in cancer: oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Oncogenes are responsible for promoting cell growth and division, while tumor suppressor genes serve to inhibit these processes. When mutations activate oncogenes, they can cause cells to proliferate uncontrollably. Conversely, mutations that inactivate tumor suppressor genes can remove essential checks on cell growth, allowing cells to continue dividing without regulation.

In addition to mutations in genes that govern cell growth, alterations in genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms can significantly contribute to cancer development. Such mutations can lead to the accumulation of further genetic alterations in other genes, exacerbating the progression of cancer.

In summary, cancer is a multifaceted disease resulting from mutations in the cellular mechanisms that control growth, division, and death. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic and cellular factors that underlie cancer is essential for the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies.
