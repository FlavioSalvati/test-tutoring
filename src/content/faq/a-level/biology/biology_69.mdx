Mitosis and meiosis are two distinct types of cell division that serve different purposes and lead to different outcomes.

**Mitosis** is a process of cell division that results in the formation of two identical daughter cells, each containing the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process is crucial for growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues in multicellular organisms. Mitosis consists of four main stages:

1. **Prophase**
2. **Metaphase**
3. **Anaphase**
4. **Telophase**

In contrast, **meiosis** is a specialized type of cell division that occurs exclusively in the production of gametes, which are the reproductive cells (sperm and egg cells). The primary purpose of meiosis is to reduce the chromosome number by half, ensuring that when gametes fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote has the correct diploid number of chromosomes. Meiosis involves two rounds of division, ultimately producing four haploid daughter cells.

In the context of the cell cycle, mitosis takes place during the M phase, while meiosis occurs during the gamete-producing phase. Mitosis is a continuous process that occurs in all somatic cells, whereas meiosis is a specialized process that only occurs in the cells of the gonads.

In summary, mitosis and meiosis are two distinct forms of cell division with unique roles in the cell cycle. Mitosis is essential for growth and tissue repair, while meiosis is vital for sexual reproduction and promoting genetic diversity.
