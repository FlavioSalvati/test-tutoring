Primary productivity refers to the rate at which energy is transformed into organic matter by photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms.

This process is primarily carried out by autotrophic organisms, such as plants, algae, and certain bacteria, which convert either sunlight or chemical energy into organic matter through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. The organic matter produced serves as an energy source for heterotrophic organisms, like animals and fungi, which obtain energy through respiration. The rate at which this energy conversion occurs is termed primary productivity. For a more detailed exploration of the limiting factors affecting photosynthesis, please refer to our notes on the topic.

In contrast, secondary productivity is defined as the rate at which heterotrophic organisms convert organic matter into biomass.

Secondary productivity involves heterotrophic organisms, such as animals and fungi, consuming organic matter generated by autotrophs and converting it into their own biomass through the processes of digestion and assimilation. The rate at which this conversion takes place is known as secondary productivity. A deeper understanding of this concept can provide valuable insights into how plants maintain their water balance, which is vital for overall productivity.

Both primary and secondary productivity are crucial for the functioning of ecosystems. Primary productivity establishes the foundation for all life within an ecosystem, serving as the primary energy source for all heterotrophic organisms. Secondary productivity, on the other hand, is essential for the growth and reproduction of heterotrophic organisms, supplying the necessary energy and nutrients for these processes. Together, primary and secondary productivity shape the overall productivity of an ecosystem, which, in turn, influences the abundance and diversity of species present within that ecosystem.
