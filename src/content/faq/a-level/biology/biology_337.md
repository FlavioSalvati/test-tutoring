Somatic cells constitute the majority of the body's cellular composition, whereas germ cells play a crucial role in reproduction.

Somatic cells are defined as any cells in the body that do not participate in reproductive processes. They form most of the body’s tissues and organs, including the skin, muscles, and bones. Somatic cells are diploid, which means they contain two sets of chromosomes—one inherited from each parent. These cells proliferate through a process known as mitosis, facilitating growth and tissue repair.

In contrast, germ cells are specifically involved in reproduction. They are located in the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) and are responsible for the production of gametes (eggs and sperm). Germ cells are haploid, meaning they possess only one set of chromosomes. They undergo meiosis, a specialized type of cell division that results in gametes containing half the number of chromosomes found in somatic cells.

The processes of tissue development and repair depend heavily on the division and differentiation of somatic cells. During developmental stages, these cells differentiate into various tissue types, such as muscle or nerve cells. Even in adulthood, somatic cells continue to divide to replace damaged or dead cells, thereby ensuring effective tissue repair. In contrast, germ cells are not involved in tissue development or repair; their primary function is to facilitate reproduction and transmit genetic information to offspring.

In summary, somatic cells are integral to the formation and maintenance of the body's tissues and are essential for tissue development and repair. Conversely, germ cells are vital for reproduction and the transfer of genetic material to the next generation.
