Osmosis and diffusion are two fundamental processes that describe the movement of molecules, but they have distinct characteristics and functions.

Osmosis refers specifically to the movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane. This process occurs when there is a difference in solute concentration on either side of the membrane. Water molecules migrate from an area of high water concentration (which corresponds to low solute concentration) to an area of low water concentration (high solute concentration) until equilibrium is achieved. This movement is crucial for maintaining cellular water balance and plays a vital role in essential biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration.

In contrast, diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This process occurs in both gases and liquids and is critical for the transport of molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of cells. Additionally, diffusion facilitates the movement of nutrients and waste products throughout the body.

While both osmosis and diffusion involve the movement of molecules, they differ in several key ways. Osmosis is specifically concerned with the movement of water molecules and occurs exclusively across a selectively permeable membrane. Diffusion, on the other hand, can involve any type of molecule and can occur in any medium, not just across membranes. 

Understanding the distinctions between osmosis and diffusion is essential for grasping the fundamental processes that sustain life in living organisms.
