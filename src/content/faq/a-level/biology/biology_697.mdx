Different patterns of inheritance can significantly influence the expression of phenotypes in various ways.

In the case of dominant traits, an individual only needs to inherit one copy of a dominant allele for the phenotype to manifest. For instance, if a person inherits one dominant allele for brown eyes and one recessive allele for blue eyes, they will exhibit the phenotype for brown eyes. Conversely, recessive traits require two copies of the recessive allele for the phenotype to be expressed. For example, an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive allele associated with cystic fibrosis for the condition to manifest.

Incomplete dominance occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygote is an intermediate expression between the two homozygotes. For example, when a red flower is crossed with a white flower, the resulting offspring may exhibit pink flowers. On the other hand, codominance arises when both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype. For instance, crossing a black chicken with a white chicken can result in offspring that display both black and white feathers.

Sex-linked inheritance pertains to genes located on the sex chromosomes. A notable example is the gene for color blindness, which resides on the X chromosome. Consequently, males are more prone to color blindness than females, as they possess only one X chromosome.

In summary, various patterns of inheritance can influence phenotype expression in distinct ways. Understanding these patterns is essential for accurately predicting how traits will be inherited.
