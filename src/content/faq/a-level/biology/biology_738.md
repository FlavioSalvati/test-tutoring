Transcription and translation are two fundamental processes involved in protein synthesis.

**Transcription** is the mechanism by which DNA is transcribed into RNA. This process takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. During transcription, RNA polymerase attaches to the promoter region of the DNA, unwinding the double helix to separate the two strands. It then reads the template strand and synthesizes a complementary RNA strand. This newly formed RNA molecule is known as messenger RNA (mRNA), which serves to transport genetic information from the DNA to the ribosome.

**Translation**, on the other hand, is the process where the genetic information encoded in mRNA is utilized to synthesize a protein. This occurs within the ribosome, a molecular machine composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. The ribosome reads the mRNA in sequences of three nucleotides, known as codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules transport the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome, where they are linked together to form a polypeptide chain. This process continues until a stop codon is encountered, at which point the ribosome releases the completed protein.

In summary, transcription is the process of converting DNA into RNA, while translation is the subsequent step where the information in mRNA is employed to produce proteins. Together, these processes constitute protein synthesis, the essential mechanism by which cells generate proteins necessary for life. Understanding transcription and translation is crucial for comprehending how genetic information is translated into the proteins that sustain biological functions.
