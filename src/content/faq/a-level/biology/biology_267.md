The mitotic spindle plays a crucial role in the separation of chromosomes during cell division by attaching to them and pulling them apart.

During cell division, the mitotic spindle is responsible for distributing duplicated chromosomes into two identical sets. This spindle is composed of microtubulesâ€”long, thin protein fibers that extend from two centrosomes located at opposite poles of the cell. The microtubules connect to the chromosomes at a specialized structure known as the kinetochore, which is situated at the centromere of each chromosome.

As the cell enters mitosis, the microtubules begin to extend and attach to the kinetochores, drawing the chromosomes toward the center of the cell. Once all chromosomes are properly aligned along the equatorial plane, the microtubules shorten, pulling the chromosomes apart toward opposite poles of the cell.

Additionally, the mitotic spindle contributes to cytokinesis, the final phase of cell division. During cytokinesis, a contractile ring composed of actin and myosin filaments forms around the cell, effectively dividing it into two daughter cells. The spindle fibers assist in positioning the contractile ring accurately, ensuring that the cell is split evenly.

In summary, the mitotic spindle is an essential component of cell division, guaranteeing that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes. Any malfunction in spindle function can result in chromosomal abnormalities and contribute to diseases such as cancer.
