Molecular clocks utilize genetic data to estimate the divergence time between species and to elucidate their evolutionary relationships.

These molecular clocks operate on the premise that mutations accumulate at a relatively constant rate over time. By analyzing the number of genetic differences in DNA or protein sequences between two species, researchers can infer the time elapsed since they diverged from a common ancestor. A prime example is the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clock, which is frequently employed in studies of animal evolution. This is because mitochondrial DNA evolves more rapidly than nuclear DNA and is inherited exclusively from the maternal line.

Various types of molecular clocks exhibit different evolutionary rates and are tailored for specific taxonomic groups. For instance, the molecular clock associated with ribosomal RNA evolves at a slower pace compared to that of mitochondrial DNA, making it particularly useful for investigating the evolution of bacteria and archaea. Furthermore, the molecular clock for protein-coding genes can be calibrated using fossil evidence, enabling scientists to estimate key events in mammalian evolution, such as the divergence between primates and rodents.

Nevertheless, molecular clocks come with inherent limitations and assumptions that must be carefully considered. For example, mutation rates can fluctuate across different lineages or may change over time, and some mutations may be selectively neutral or advantageous rather than purely random. Consequently, estimates derived from molecular clocks should be interpreted cautiously and corroborated with independent evidence, such as fossil records or biogeographical patterns.

In conclusion, molecular clocks serve as a valuable tool for comprehending the evolutionary relationships among species. However, the accuracy of these estimates is contingent upon the quality of the underlying data and the assumptions that are made.
