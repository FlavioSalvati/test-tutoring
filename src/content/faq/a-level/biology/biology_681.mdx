Microevolution refers to minor changes in gene frequency within a population, while macroevolution encompasses the processes that lead to the emergence of new species.

Microevolution occurs through various mechanisms, including mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. These processes can result in shifts in the frequency of alleles within a population over time. For instance, if a population of birds undergoes a mutation that produces a novel beak shape, natural selection may favor the individuals with this advantageous trait if it better suits their environment. Consequently, over time, the frequency of the allele associated with the new beak shape could increase within the population.

In contrast, macroevolution involves the formation of new species through processes such as speciation. Speciation occurs when a population becomes reproductively isolated from other populations, rendering them incapable of interbreeding and producing viable offspring. This isolation can happen through mechanisms like geographic separation, where a physical barrier divides a population, or through genetic divergence, where genetic differences accumulate over time and hinder interbreeding.

Although microevolution and macroevolution are distinct concepts, they are interconnected. Microevolutionary changes can build up over extended periods, potentially leading to macroevolutionary outcomes, such as the emergence of new species. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of both microevolution and macroevolution is essential for grasping the diversity of life on Earth.
