Afferent neurons transmit sensory information to the central nervous system (CNS), while efferent neurons convey motor information away from it.

Afferent neurons play a critical role in relaying sensory information from the body's sensory receptors to the CNS. These receptors are located in various tissues, including the skin, muscles, and internal organs. Afferent neurons are categorized into three distinct types: somatic afferents, visceral afferents, and special afferents. Somatic afferents are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the skin, muscles, and joints. In contrast, visceral afferents carry signals from the internal organs. Special afferents, on the other hand, relay information from the special senses, such as vision, hearing, and taste.

Efferent neurons, conversely, are tasked with conveying motor information from the CNS to the muscles and glands. These neurons can be further classified into two main categories: somatic efferents and autonomic efferents. Somatic efferents regulate skeletal muscles, enabling voluntary movement, whereas autonomic efferents control smooth muscles, cardiac muscles, and glandular functions. The autonomic efferents are subdivided into sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, which exert opposing effects on various bodily functions, thereby maintaining homeostasis.

In summary, afferent neurons are responsible for transmitting sensory information to the CNS, while efferent neurons carry motor information away from it. Both types of neurons are vital for the proper functioning of the nervous system and overall bodily processes.
