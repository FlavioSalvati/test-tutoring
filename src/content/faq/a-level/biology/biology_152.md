Biotic and abiotic factors are essential determinants of species distribution within ecosystems.

**Biotic factors** encompass the living components of an ecosystem, including organisms and their interactions. In contrast, **abiotic factors** refer to the non-living elements, such as temperature, water availability, and soil type. Both categories significantly influence where species can thrive.

For instance, temperature is a critical abiotic factor that can restrict the range of certain species. Many organisms are adapted to survive within specific temperature ranges and may not endure extreme heat or cold. Similarly, the availability of water is vital; some species require more water than others, which can limit their geographical distribution. Understanding how these abiotic factors affect species is crucial for ecological studies.

On the other hand, biotic factors also play a significant role in shaping species distribution. Competition for resources—such as food and habitat—can constrain where certain species can live. Predation is another influential biotic factor, as predators can reduce the populations of prey species, thereby affecting their distribution. The interactions between various species are fundamental to comprehending these biotic influences.

Moreover, biotic and abiotic factors frequently interact to further influence species distribution. For example, a plant species may thrive in specific soil types but could be limited by competition from other plants for nutrients and sunlight. These intricate relationships contribute to the dynamic nature of ecosystems.

In summary, both biotic factors, such as competition and predation, and abiotic factors, including temperature and water availability, collectively shape the habitats where species can exist. Some organisms may require precise temperature or water conditions for survival. Additionally, these factors can interact; for instance, a plant may need particular soil characteristics while simultaneously contending with other plants for essential resources. Such interactions can drive evolutionary changes and the emergence of new species.
