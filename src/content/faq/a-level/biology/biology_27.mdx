DNA replicates through a semi-conservative process that relies on the action of multiple enzymes.

DNA replication is the mechanism by which a cell duplicates its genetic material prior to cell division. This process is crucial because it guarantees that each daughter cell inherits a complete set of genetic information. The term "semi-conservative" refers to the fact that each newly formed DNA molecule comprises one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.

The initial step in DNA replication involves the unwinding of the double helix, a task performed by the enzyme helicase. This unwinding creates a replication fork, where the two DNA strands are separated. To maintain the stability of these separated strands and prevent them from re-annealing into a double helix, single-stranded binding proteins bind to the exposed DNA.

Following this, the enzyme primase synthesizes a short RNA primer on each strand, which serves as a starting point for DNA synthesis. The enzyme DNA polymerase III then extends the RNA primer by adding nucleotides to form the new DNA strand, using the original strand as a template.

Since the DNA strands are antiparallel, the replication process differs for each strand. The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized in short segments known as Okazaki fragments. These fragments are later joined together by the enzyme DNA ligase.

Finally, the RNA primers are removed by DNA polymerase I, which replaces them with DNA nucleotides. The outcome of this series of events is the formation of two identical DNA molecules, each containing one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.

In summary, DNA replication is a complex and highly coordinated process that involves several key enzymes, including helicase, primase, DNA polymerase III, DNA ligase, and DNA polymerase I. The semi-conservative nature of this process ensures that each daughter cell receives a complete and accurate set of genetic information.
