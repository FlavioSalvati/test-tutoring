Osmosis and diffusion are crucial processes that facilitate the movement of water and solutes across cell membranes via passive transport.

Passive transport refers to the movement of molecules across a cell membrane without the expenditure of energy. Diffusion specifically describes the passive movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This process continues until the concentration of the molecules is equal on both sides of the membrane. 

Osmosis, on the other hand, is the passive movement of water molecules through a selectively permeable membrane. Water moves from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration, also until equilibrium is reached.

In addition to water, solutes can traverse the membrane through two primary mechanisms: simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that requires the assistance of transport proteins. These proteins function as channels or carriers, enabling solutes to cross the membrane more efficiently.

The movement of water and solutes across the cell membrane is vital for cellular survival. The processes of osmosis and diffusion are essential for maintaining the balance of water and solutes both inside and outside the cell. This equilibrium is critical not only for the proper functioning of individual cells but also for the overall health of the organism.
