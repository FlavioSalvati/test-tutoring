DNA replication is a fundamental process for cell division, ensuring that each daughter cell inherits a complete set of genetic information.

This process occurs during the S phase of interphase. During this phase, the double helix structure of DNA unwinds, allowing each strand to function as a template for synthesizing a new complementary strand. Enzymes, particularly DNA polymerase, catalyze this process by adding nucleotides to the growing strand in a 5' to 3' direction.

Replication occurs bidirectionally from multiple origins of replication, ultimately generating two identical DNA molecules. Newly synthesized strands undergo rigorous error-checking through proofreading mechanisms, which ensure the accuracy of the genetic information.

As the cell progresses into mitosis, the replicated chromosomes condense and align at the metaphase plate in preparation for separation. Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres and pull the sister chromatids apart, guaranteeing that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes.

In summary, DNA replication is a critical event in cell division, ensuring that each daughter cell obtains an entire set of genetic material. This intricate process includes the unwinding of the DNA double helix, the synthesis of new strands, and the implementation of proofreading mechanisms for accuracy. Subsequently, the replicated chromosomes are separated during mitosis, yielding two identical daughter cells.
