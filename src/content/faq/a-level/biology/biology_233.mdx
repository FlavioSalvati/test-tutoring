Mitosis and meiosis are two distinct processes of cell division, each serving different biological functions and resulting in daughter cells with varying chromosome numbers.

Mitosis is the process through which a single parent cell divides to produce two identical daughter cells, each retaining the same chromosome number as the parent cell. This is crucial for growth, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction in organisms. During mitosis, chromosomes are first replicated, and then they separate into two identical sets. These sets are distributed equally to the daughter cells, ensuring that each daughter cell contains the same genetic information as the original parent cell.

In contrast, meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that results in four daughter cells, each containing half the chromosome number of the parent cell. This reduction is essential for sexual reproduction, as it leads to the formation of gametes, which are responsible for genetic diversity. During meiosis, chromosomes first replicate and then pair with their homologous counterparts. These homologous pairs separate during the first division, yielding two daughter cells, each with half the chromosome number. These cells then undergo a second division, resulting in a total of four daughter cells, each with a unique combination of genetic material.

In summary, while mitosis produces two identical daughter cells with the same chromosome number as the parent cell, meiosis generates four daughter cells with half the chromosome number and enhanced genetic diversity. This genetic variation is vital for the survival and evolution of species, as it provides the raw material for natural selection and adaptation.
