Environmental factors can significantly influence gene expression and phenotype through mechanisms such as epigenetic modifications and developmental plasticity.

**Epigenetic Modifications**  
Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modification, can modify gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications are susceptible to various environmental influences, such as diet, stress, and exposure to toxins. For instance, research has demonstrated that a mother's diet during pregnancy can lead to changes in the DNA methylation patterns of her offspring. This, in turn, can result in alterations in gene expression and phenotype.

**Developmental Plasticity**  
Developmental plasticity is the capacity of an organism to adapt to its environment during its developmental stages, leading to changes in phenotype. This adaptation can occur through processes such as phenotypic plasticity and acclimation. 

- **Phenotypic Plasticity**: This term describes the ability of a single genotype to produce diverse phenotypes in response to varying environmental conditions. 
- **Acclimation**: This refers to an organism's capacity to adjust its phenotype in reaction to specific environmental factors, such as temperature changes.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, environmental factors can profoundly influence gene expression and phenotype. Gaining a deeper understanding of these mechanisms is essential, as it provides valuable insights into how organisms adapt to changing environments. This knowledge can have significant implications for various fields, including medicine and conservation biology.
