An acute stress response is a short-term reaction to a stressor, whereas a chronic stress response is a long-term reaction.

When an individual encounters a stressful situation, their body initiates an acute stress response. This response is characterized by the release of stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, which prepare the body for a "fight or flight" reaction. During this response, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises, and blood sugar levels elevate to provide additional energy to the muscles. This acute response is designed to be temporary, enabling the individual to effectively confront the stressor.

In contrast, when an individual is subjected to stressors over an extended period, they may develop a chronic stress response. This prolonged response is marked by a sustained release of stress hormones, which can lead to detrimental effects on health. Chronic stress has been associated with various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and depression. Additionally, it can weaken the immune system, making individuals more vulnerable to infections.

In summary, while both acute and chronic stress responses involve the secretion of stress hormones, they differ significantly in their duration and impact on the body. Acute stress responses are short-lived and are aimed at helping individuals manage immediate stressors, whereas chronic stress responses can lead to serious health complications if not addressed.
