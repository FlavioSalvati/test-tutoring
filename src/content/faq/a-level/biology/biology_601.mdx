Somatic cells constitute the majority of the body's cells, whereas germ cells play a crucial role in reproduction.

Somatic cells are defined as any cells in the body that do not participate in the reproductive process. They account for most of the body's cellular composition and are responsible for a wide range of functions, including muscle contraction, nerve signal transmission, and hormone production. Notably, somatic cells are diploid, which means they contain two sets of chromosomesâ€”one set inherited from each parent.

In contrast, germ cells are directly involved in the formation of gametes, which are essential for sexual reproduction. These cells are located within the gonads: testes in males and ovaries in females. Unlike somatic cells, germ cells are haploid, indicating that they possess only one set of chromosomes. This reduction in chromosome number occurs during meiosis, a specialized form of cell division that generates gametes and halves the chromosome count.

Another significant distinction between somatic and germ cells is their division capabilities. Somatic cells undergo mitosis, a process that results in the formation of two genetically identical daughter cells. Germ cells, on the other hand, can divide through both mitosis and meiosis, the latter being necessary for gamete production.

In summary, somatic cells represent the bulk of the body's cellular makeup and are not involved in reproduction, while germ cells are integral to gamete production and are found in the gonads. Germ cells are haploid and can divide via both mitosis and meiosis, whereas somatic cells are diploid and can only divide through mitosis.
