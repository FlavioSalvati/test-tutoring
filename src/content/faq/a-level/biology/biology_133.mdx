Freshwater and marine biomes are two distinct types of ecosystems characterized primarily by their salinity levels. Freshwater biomes are located in bodies of water that possess low salt concentrations, typically ranging from $0.5$ to $5$ parts per thousand, while marine biomes are found in oceans and seas with high salt concentrations, averaging around $35$ parts per thousand.

Freshwater biomes encompass a variety of environments, including lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands. These ecosystems support a rich diversity of plant and animal life, such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Moreover, freshwater biomes are vital for human activities, providing essential resources like drinking water, irrigation, and hydroelectric power. Understanding the dynamics within these biomes is crucial for assessing ecosystem health and sustainability.

In contrast, marine biomes cover more than $70\%$ of the Earth's surface and are teeming with a wide range of species, including fish, sharks, whales, dolphins, sea turtles, and coral reefs. These ecosystems are essential not only for the myriad forms of life they support but also for human use, offering food, transportation, and recreational opportunities. Marine biomes play a critical role in the global ecosystem, sustaining both marine biodiversity and various human industries.

A primary distinction between freshwater and marine biomes lies in their salinity levels, which significantly influence the types of organisms that inhabit each ecosystem and their respective adaptations. For instance, marine organisms have developed specialized mechanisms to maintain their salt balance, while freshwater species are adapted to thrive in environments with low salt concentrations. Additionally, environmental challenges such as pollution and climate change can have profound effects on both freshwater and marine ecosystems, impacting biodiversity and the essential services they provide.

**A-Level Biology Tutor Summary**: Freshwater biomes, located in lakes, rivers, and wetlands, feature low salt concentrations and support a diverse array of species. In contrast, marine biomes, found in oceans and seas, have high salt concentrations and cover over $70\%$ of the Earth's surface. The primary difference between these biomes is their salinity, which influences the organisms present and their adaptations. Furthermore, the process of transpiration in plants plays a vital role in regulating water cycles within these biomes.
