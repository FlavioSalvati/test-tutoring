The acute stress response is characterized as a short-term reaction, whereas the chronic stress response is considered a long-term reaction.

The acute stress response occurs in reaction to immediate stressors, such as sudden threats or dangers. This response is primarily mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which together release stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones activate the immune system, leading to an increase in the production and functionality of white blood cells. In the short term, this response is advantageous, as it equips the body to fend off infections and facilitate wound healing.

In contrast, the chronic stress response emerges from prolonged exposure to ongoing stressors, such as persistent illness or social isolation. Similar to the acute response, this reaction is also mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis. However, it results in a sustained elevation of stress hormones, which can negatively impact immune function. Chronic stress may suppress the immune system by diminishing both the production and effectiveness of white blood cells, thereby increasing susceptibility to infections, autoimmune disorders, and even cancer.

In summary, while the acute stress response can temporarily enhance immune function, chronic stress poses significant risks to immune health. It is crucial to manage stress levels effectively and seek support when confronting chronic stressors to maintain a robust immune system.
