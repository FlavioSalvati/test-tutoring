Dominant alleles are expressed in the phenotype whenever they are present, while recessive alleles are expressed only in the absence of a dominant allele.

Genes, which are segments of DNA, encode specific traits. Each gene consists of two alleles, one inherited from each parent. The dominant allele has the ability to mask the expression of the recessive allele. Thus, when an individual inherits a dominant allele for a trait, such as brown eyes, along with a recessive allele for a different trait, such as blue eyes, the individual will exhibit the dominant trait—in this case, brown eyes—because the dominant allele overrides the recessive allele.

Recessive alleles are expressed in the phenotype only when both alleles are recessive, a condition referred to as homozygous recessive. For instance, if an individual inherits two recessive alleles for blue eyes, they will display blue eyes since there is no dominant allele present to mask the expression of the recessive allele.

It is important to understand that the presence of a dominant allele does not guarantee that the associated trait will be expressed in the phenotype. Some dominant alleles may be expressed only under specific conditions or when paired with certain other alleles. Furthermore, the expression of some traits is influenced by multiple genes and their interactions, adding layers of complexity to phenotypic outcomes.

Grasping the relationship between dominant and recessive alleles is crucial for predicting the inheritance of traits and for diagnosing genetic disorders.
