Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) refers to the transfer of genetic material between organisms that are not directly related through parent-offspring relationships. This process can occur through three main mechanisms: transformation, transduction, and conjugation.

1. **Transformation** involves the uptake of free DNA from the environment by a bacterial cell. 
2. **Transduction** is the transfer of DNA between bacteria mediated by bacteriophages, which are viruses that specifically infect bacteria. 
3. **Conjugation** entails the direct transfer of DNA between bacteria via a physical connection known as a pilus.

HGT can significantly influence the evolution of organisms. It can introduce new genetic material that may enhance an organism's ability to adapt to new environments or acquire novel functions. For instance, the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria can facilitate the widespread emergence of antibiotic resistance. However, HGT can also have detrimental effects, such as the transfer of virulence factors that may increase a bacterium's pathogenicity.

In contrast, vertical gene transfer (VGT) is the transmission of genetic material from parent to offspring. This process occurs through meiosis and fertilization in sexually reproducing organisms. VGT serves as the primary mechanism for passing genetic information from one generation to the next and is responsible for the inheritance of traits from parents to their descendants.
