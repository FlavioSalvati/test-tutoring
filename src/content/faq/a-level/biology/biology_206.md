RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism that regulates gene expression by silencing specific genes through the degradation of mRNA molecules, thereby preventing protein synthesis.

The RNAi process begins with the production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules. An enzyme known as Dicer then processes these dsRNA molecules into small interfering RNA (siRNA) fragments. These siRNA molecules are subsequently incorporated into a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC complex guides the siRNA to its complementary mRNA targets.

When an siRNA molecule binds to its corresponding mRNA, the RISC complex cleaves the mRNA, resulting in its degradation. This degradation prevents the mRNA from being translated into protein, effectively silencing the gene in question. The specificity of RNAi is notable; each siRNA is designed to target a unique mRNA molecule, allowing for precise gene regulation.

RNAi has numerous applications in both research and medicine. It enables scientists to selectively silence specific genes, facilitating the study of their functions. Furthermore, RNAi is being explored as a therapeutic strategy to treat diseases associated with overactive or mutated genes. However, there are concerns regarding potential off-target effects of RNAi, which could inadvertently lead to the silencing of unintended genes and cause adverse consequences.
