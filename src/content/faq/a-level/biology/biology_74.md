Greenhouse gases play a crucial role in the atmosphere by trapping heat and contributing to the greenhouse effect.

These gases, which include carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), and water vapor ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), absorb and re-emit infrared radiation. This process is essential for warming the Earth's surface. Essentially, greenhouse gases act like a thermal blanket, trapping heat and preventing it from escaping into space. Without the presence of greenhouse gases, the Earth's average temperature would plummet to approximately $-18^\circ \text{C}$, rendering the planet uninhabitable for most life forms.

Among greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide is the most recognized, primarily resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. In contrast, methane is generated through natural processes such as the decomposition of organic matter and is also released by livestock and rice paddies. Water vapor, while the most abundant greenhouse gas, is naturally occurring in the atmosphere.

The concentration of greenhouse gases has been steadily increasing due to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This rise in greenhouse gas levels is driving an increase in the Earth's temperature, which in turn leads to climate change. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and alterations in ecosystems.

In summary, greenhouse gases are essential for trapping heat in the atmosphere and facilitating the greenhouse effect. However, the human-induced increase in these gases is resulting in a rise in global temperatures, which has profound implications for the environment and human societies.
