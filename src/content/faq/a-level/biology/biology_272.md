Saturated fatty acids contain no double bonds, while unsaturated fatty acids feature at least one double bond in their structure.

Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids represent two distinct categories of fatty acids, characterized by their chemical structures. Saturated fatty acids are defined by the absence of double bonds between the carbon atoms in their hydrocarbon chains. As a result, each carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. This configuration leads to a straight, rigid structure, allowing these fatty acids to pack tightly together, which is why they are typically solid at room temperature. Common examples of foods rich in saturated fatty acids include butter, cheese, and fatty cuts of meat.

In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids contain at least one double bond between the carbon atoms in their hydrocarbon chains, which introduces a kink in the chain. This structural alteration results in a more fluid and less tightly packed configuration, causing unsaturated fatty acids to generally exist as liquids at room temperature. Unsaturated fatty acids can be further classified into two categories: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Monounsaturated fatty acids possess a single double bond, while polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds. Foods that are high in unsaturated fatty acids include nuts, seeds, and various vegetable oils.

The type of fatty acids consumed can significantly influence health outcomes. High intake of saturated fats has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, whereas the consumption of unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, has been associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Consequently, it is advisable to maintain a diet that is low in saturated fats and rich in unsaturated fats for better health.
