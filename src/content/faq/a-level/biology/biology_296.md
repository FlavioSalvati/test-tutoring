Alternative splicing can contribute to disease by creating abnormal proteins that interfere with essential cellular processes.

Alternative splicing is a biological mechanism whereby different combinations of exons in pre-mRNA are joined together to produce multiple mRNA isoforms. This process is vital for generating protein diversity and regulating gene expression. However, when splicing occurs incorrectly, it can result in the production of abnormal proteins that disrupt cellular functions and lead to various diseases.

A notable example of the role of alternative splicing in disease is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder that primarily affects motor neurons in the spinal cord. SMA is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which encodes the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. In contrast, the SMN2 gene undergoes alternative splicing, leading to the production of a truncated version of the SMN protein that is less stable and functional than the full-length variant. This deficiency in SMN protein within motor neurons ultimately results in their degeneration and manifests as muscle weakness.

Cancer also exemplifies how alternative splicing can influence disease progression and treatment resistance. Aberrant splicing events can generate isoforms of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes with altered functions or expression patterns. For instance, the Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis (programmed cell death). Alternative splicing can yield isoforms that either promote or inhibit cell death, thereby affecting the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy and other therapeutic interventions.

In summary, while alternative splicing is essential for regulating gene expression and enhancing protein diversity, abnormal splicing events can lead to the development of diseases. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying alternative splicing and its effects on cellular processes is critical for advancing new therapeutic strategies for genetic disorders and cancer.
