The fight-or-flight response triggers a series of physiological changes in the body when confronted with stress.

Upon perceiving a threat, the body's sympathetic nervous system activates the fight-or-flight response, preparing the individual to either confront the danger or escape from it. The hypothalamus, a critical region of the brain, sends signals to the adrenal glands, prompting them to release hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline into the bloodstream. These hormones lead to an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, thereby delivering more oxygen and glucose to the muscles for energy.

Additionally, the fight-or-flight response stimulates the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream, offering further energy to the body. Blood flow is redirected away from non-essential organs, such as the digestive system, and directed towards vital organs like the muscles, heart, and lungs. This redirection can result in digestive discomforts, including nausea or diarrhea, as well as a dry mouth.

Beyond adrenaline and noradrenaline, the hypothalamus also triggers the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands. Cortisol plays a crucial role in maintaining blood sugar levels and suppressing the immune system, allowing the body to concentrate on the immediate threat.

While the fight-or-flight response is advantageous in short-term stress situations, prolonged activation can lead to detrimental effects on the body, including an increased risk of heart disease and compromised immune function. Therefore, it is essential to manage stress effectively and to engage in relaxation techniques to prevent the chronic activation of the fight-or-flight response.
