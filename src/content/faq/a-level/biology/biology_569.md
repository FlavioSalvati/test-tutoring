Acute stress is a short-term reaction to perceived threats or challenges, whereas chronic stress is a long-term condition that can have significant health repercussions.

Acute stress is a natural response to immediate challenges, such as a job interview or a near-miss accident. During such moments, the body activates its "fight or flight" response, releasing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to facilitate a quick reaction. Once the danger has passed, the body typically returns to its normal state.

In contrast, chronic stress arises from ongoing pressures, such as persistent financial troubles, relationship difficulties, or a demanding job. This prolonged stress can result in a variety of physical and mental health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, depression, and anxiety.

A key distinction between acute and chronic stress lies in the duration of the stress response. Acute stress is a temporary reaction designed to help us confront immediate threats, while chronic stress can endure for weeks, months, or even years, resulting in ongoing wear and tear on both the body and mind.

Another difference is the intensity of the stress response. Acute stress may be intense but is usually brief in duration. In contrast, chronic stress can be less intense but more enduring, leading to a constant state of heightened arousal.

In summary, while acute stress is a normal and essential response to challenges, chronic stress can lead to serious health issues if not properly managed. Recognizing the signs of chronic stress is crucial, and it is important to take proactive steps to mitigate its effects. Effective strategies include regular exercise, practicing relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends, family, or healthcare professionals.
