Transcription is the process of converting DNA into RNA, while translation refers to the synthesis of proteins from RNA.

Transcription is the initial step in protein synthesis, during which a specific segment of DNA is copied into a complementary RNA molecule. This process is facilitated by the enzyme RNA polymerase, which reads the DNA template and adds nucleotides to form the growing RNA strand. After synthesis, the resulting RNA molecule undergoes processing and modification before being transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Translation, the subsequent step in protein synthesis, involves using the information encoded in the RNA molecule to produce a protein. This process occurs on ribosomes, which interpret the RNA sequence and assemble a chain of amino acids in the correct order. The arrangement of these amino acids ultimately determines the protein's structure and functionality.

Although transcription and translation are distinct processes, they are intricately linked and mutually dependent. Without transcription, there would be no RNA molecules available for translation, and without translation, the information contained in the RNA would remain unused, preventing protein synthesis. Collectively, these processes are crucial for the production of proteins, which serve as the fundamental building blocks of life.
