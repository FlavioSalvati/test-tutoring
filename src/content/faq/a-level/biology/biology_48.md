MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that play a vital role in the regulation of gene expression after transcription. They are transcribed from DNA, processed in the nucleus, and subsequently exported to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, miRNAs interact with target mRNA molecules through base pairing, which can either inhibit their translation or promote their degradation.

The inhibition of translation occurs when miRNAs bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA molecules. This binding can obstruct the ribosome's ability to attach to the mRNA, thereby preventing translation. On the other hand, miRNAs can promote the degradation of target mRNA by binding to the coding region or the 5' UTR. This interaction often leads to the recruitment of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which can either cleave the mRNA or facilitate its degradation.

miRNAs are crucial in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and the progression of diseases. Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been linked to numerous conditions, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which miRNAs operate in post-transcriptional gene regulation is essential for both fundamental research and clinical applications.
