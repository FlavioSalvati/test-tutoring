RNA interference (RNAi) is a fundamental biological process that modulates gene expression through the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and the inhibition of translation. This mechanism represents a form of post-transcriptional gene silencing that is initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).

The dsRNA is processed by an enzyme known as Dicer, resulting in the formation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are typically $21$ to $23$ nucleotides in length. These siRNAs are subsequently integrated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which specifically targets complementary mRNA strands for degradation.

RNAi is vital for various biological processes, including development, cellular differentiation, and the defense against viral infections and transposable elements. Furthermore, it holds significant potential for therapeutic applications, particularly in silencing genes associated with diseases.

Experimental induction of RNAi can be achieved by introducing synthetic siRNAs or by expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), which are processed into siRNAs within the cell. This approach has facilitated the development of RNAi-based therapies aimed at treating a range of conditions, including cancer and viral infections.

In summary, RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent and essential mechanism for regulating gene expression through mRNA degradation and translational inhibition. Its critical biological functions and promising therapeutic applications underscore its importance in molecular biology and medicine.
