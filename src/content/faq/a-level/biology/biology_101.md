Alternative splicing enables the generation of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene.

This process involves the selective inclusion or exclusion of different exons within a precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) molecule, resulting in the formation of distinct protein isoforms. Various factors regulate alternative splicing, including splice site recognition, RNA-binding proteins, and epigenetic modifications.

The resulting protein isoforms can exhibit diverse functions, localizations, and interactions with other cellular molecules. This capability enhances the functional diversity of proteins that can arise from a limited number of genes, thereby increasing the complexity and adaptability of biological systems.

However, disruptions in alternative splicing can contribute to disease. Mutations in splice sites or in the proteins that regulate splicing may lead to aberrant splicing events, resulting in the production of non-functional or deleterious protein isoforms. Consequently, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of alternative splicing is essential for both fundamental research and clinical applications.

In summary, alternative splicing is a vital mechanism in gene expression, enabling the production of multiple protein isoforms with varied functions and characteristics from a single gene.
