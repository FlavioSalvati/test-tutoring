Allergies arise when the immune system reacts excessively to benign substances, leading to an inappropriate immune response.

When an individual with allergies encounters an allergen—such as pollen or pet dander—their immune system mistakenly identifies it as a harmful intruder. In response, the body produces a specific antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE). These IgE antibodies attach to mast cells and basophils, which are types of immune cells. Upon encountering the allergen, these cells release histamine and other chemicals, resulting in inflammation, swelling, and a range of allergy symptoms.

Allergies can be categorized into two main types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. 

- **Immediate hypersensitivity reactions** occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and may manifest as symptoms such as hives, itching, or even anaphylaxis, which is a severe, life-threatening reaction. 
- **Delayed hypersensitivity reactions**, on the other hand, may take hours to days to develop after exposure, leading to symptoms such as eczema and contact dermatitis.

The management of allergies generally involves avoiding the offending allergen and utilizing medications to alleviate symptoms. Common treatments include antihistamines, corticosteroids, and decongestants. In more severe cases, immunotherapy may be suggested. This treatment gradually exposes the individual to increasing amounts of the allergen with the aim of desensitizing the immune system over time.

In summary, allergies represent the immune system's misguided attempt to defend the body from perceived threats. Unfortunately, this overreaction occurs in response to harmless substances, leading to various uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous symptoms.
