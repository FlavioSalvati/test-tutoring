Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that occurs in the reproductive organs of sexually reproducing organisms, leading to the formation of haploid gametes. These gametes are crucial for fertilization, where two gametes combine to create a diploid zygote.

During meiosis, there are two consecutive rounds of cell division, which results in the production of four haploid daughter cells. Each of these daughter cells is genetically distinct from the original parent cell and from one another. This genetic diversity arises from two key processes: the random assortment of chromosomes and the phenomenon known as crossing over, which occurs during the first meiotic division.

The haploid daughter cells produced by meiosis are termed gametes. These gametes participate in sexual reproduction. When gametes from two different individuals unite during fertilization, they form a diploid zygote. This zygote then undergoes mitosis, a process of cellular division, to develop into a multicellular organism that possesses a unique combination of genetic traits inherited from both parents.

Meiosis plays a vital role in sexual reproduction by promoting genetic diversity among offspring. The random assortment of chromosomes and crossing over ensure that each gamete is genetically unique. Thus, when two gametes fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote carries a distinct combination of genetic traits that differs from those of either parent. This genetic variability is essential for the survival of a species, as it enhances adaptability to changing environments and improves resistance to diseases.
