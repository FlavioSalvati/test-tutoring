Plant and animal cells exhibit distinct differences in their structure, organelles, and functions.

Plant cells possess a rigid cell wall composed of cellulose, which offers both support and protection. In contrast, animal cells do not have a cell wall; instead, they are surrounded by a flexible cell membrane that regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Additionally, plant cells contain chloroplasts, the organelles responsible for photosynthesis, which are absent in animal cells. Another significant feature of plant cells is the presence of large central vacuoles that store water, nutrients, and waste products, whereas animal cells typically contain smaller vacuoles or may have none at all.

Both plant and animal cells contain a nucleus that houses genetic material. However, plant cells are equipped with additional organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, which play crucial roles in protein synthesis and transport. On the other hand, animal cells contain centrioles, which are essential for cell division, a feature not found in plant cells.

Functionally, plant cells are primarily responsible for producing food through photosynthesis and storing energy in the form of starch. In contrast, animal cells carry out a variety of functions, including respiration, digestion, and movement.

In summary, while plant and animal cells share some fundamental similarities, their structural and functional differences underscore their unique roles in the ecosystem.
