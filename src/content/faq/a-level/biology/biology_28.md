Climate encompasses the long-term patterns of temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation in a specific region. It reflects the average atmospheric conditions over extended periods, typically spanning decades or longer.

In contrast, weather pertains to the short-term atmospheric conditions present in a particular location. This includes daily or even hourly fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity. Weather can be quite unpredictable, with rapid changes occurring, whereas climate exhibits greater stability and predictability over longer timescales.

Several factors determine climate, including latitude, altitude, ocean currents, and prevailing winds. Weather, however, is influenced by these same factors, as well as local conditions such as topography, vegetation, and human activities.

Understanding the distinction between climate and weather is crucial for predicting and addressing the impacts of climate change. While weather events like heatwaves, droughts, and floods can be linked to climate change, the most significant threats to ecosystems and human societies stem from long-term shifts in climate patterns.

In summary, climate refers to the long-term averages of temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation, whereas weather describes the short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific area. Climate is shaped by global factors, while weather is affected by local environmental conditions.
