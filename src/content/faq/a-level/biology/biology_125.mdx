A gene is defined as a segment of DNA that encodes a specific trait, while an allele refers to a variant form of a gene.

Genes are fundamental units of heredity that dictate the characteristics of an organism. Composed of DNA, they are situated on chromosomes. Each gene is responsible for coding a particular trait, such as eye color or blood type. Importantly, genes can exist in multiple forms known as alleles, which are variations of the same gene that result in differences in the trait.

Alleles are alternative versions of a gene that arise through mutations and are located at the same locus on a chromosome. For instance, the gene responsible for eye color has several alleles that can lead to blue, green, or brown eyes. Alleles can exhibit dominant or recessive characteristics, meaning that one allele may overshadow the expression of another.

The unique combination of alleles inherited from each parent defines an individual's genotype, which is their genetic composition. The manifestation of this genotype in the observable traits of an organism is referred to as the phenotype. The field dedicated to the study of genes and alleles is known as genetics, which plays a vital role in our understanding of inheritance, evolution, and genetic disorders.
