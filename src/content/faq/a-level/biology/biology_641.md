Endocrine glands and exocrine glands serve distinct roles in the body, primarily differentiated by their modes of secretion.

Endocrine glands are ductless glands that release hormones directly into the bloodstream. These hormones travel through the circulatory system to reach target cells and organs, where they regulate a variety of physiological processes, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Notable examples of endocrine glands are the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and adrenal gland.

In contrast, exocrine glands secrete substances through ducts that lead to the surface of the body or into body cavities. The substances produced by exocrine glands include enzymes, mucus, sweat, and saliva, all of which are vital for processes such as digestion, lubrication, and protection. Common examples of exocrine glands include the salivary glands, sweat glands, and the pancreas.

A significant difference between endocrine and exocrine glands lies in their secretion mechanisms. Endocrine glands release hormones in response to specific stimuli, such as fluctuations in blood glucose levels or stress. Conversely, exocrine glands typically secrete their substances continuously or in reaction to mechanical or chemical stimulation.

In summary, endocrine glands directly secrete hormones into the bloodstream to regulate various physiological functions, while exocrine glands release substances through ducts to facilitate digestion, lubrication, and protective mechanisms.
