Introns and exons are fundamental components of genes that play distinct roles in the coding of proteins. 

Introns are non-coding segments of DNA located within a gene. Although they are transcribed into RNA, they do not contribute to the final protein product. During the splicing process, introns are removed from the pre-mRNA, resulting in the formation of the mature mRNA molecule. Introns can vary significantly in length and may comprise a substantial portion of a gene's total sequence. It is believed that introns have evolved to enhance the diversity of proteins that can be synthesized from a single gene, allowing for greater variability in protein function and regulation.

Exons, in contrast, are the coding sequences of DNA that directly determine the amino acid sequence of proteins. These segments are transcribed into RNA and are retained during splicing to form the final mRNA molecule. The specific arrangement of exons dictates the sequence of amino acids in the protein, which is crucial for establishing its structure and function.

The overall process of gene expression encompasses two main stages: the transcription of DNA into RNA and the subsequent translation of RNA into protein. During transcription, both introns and exons are initially included in the RNA transcript. However, introns are excised through splicing, ensuring that the resulting mRNA contains only the essential coding sequences needed for protein synthesis. Exons, being the coding regions, are indispensable for gene expression as they encode the information necessary for protein synthesis.

Together, introns and exons are integral to the regulation of gene expression and the generation of protein diversity from a single gene. Their interplay not only influences the quantity of proteins produced but also the functional capabilities of these proteins within the cell.
