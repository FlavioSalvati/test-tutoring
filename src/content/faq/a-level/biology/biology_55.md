RNA interference and gene editing are two distinct techniques utilized to manipulate gene expression in living organisms.

**RNA Interference (RNAi)** is a natural cellular process that regulates gene expression. This mechanism employs small RNA molecules to specifically target and degrade messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which are crucial for protein synthesis. By degrading these mRNA molecules, RNAi effectively silences the expression of particular genes. The applications of RNAi are vast; it serves as a valuable tool for investigating gene function and holds promise as a therapeutic approach for various diseases.

In contrast, **gene editing** entails making deliberate alterations to the DNA sequence of a gene. This can be accomplished using several advanced techniques, with CRISPR-Cas9 being one of the most prominent. CRISPR-Cas9 uses a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA region, where it introduces a cut in the DNA strand. Following this cut, the cell's inherent repair mechanisms can be harnessed to incorporate precise modifications to the DNA sequence. Gene editing is also applicable in numerous fields, including the study of gene function and the development of innovative treatments for genetic disorders.

In summary, RNA interference and gene editing represent two different strategies for manipulating gene expression. RNAi leverages small RNA molecules to silence gene expression, while gene editing focuses on making intentional modifications to the DNA sequence. Both methods hold significant potential for applications in research and medicine.
