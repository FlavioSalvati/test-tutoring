Genetic engineering and gene therapy are two important fields that involve the manipulation of DNA, but they serve different purposes and applications.

Genetic engineering refers to the process of altering an organism's DNA to change its characteristics or traits. This can be accomplished through various techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, which enables precise editing of specific genes. The applications of genetic engineering are diverse; in agriculture, it can be used to develop crops with desirable traits, such as increased resistance to pests or enhanced nutritional content. In medicine, genetic engineering plays a crucial role in the production of drugs and vaccines that can help combat diseases.

In contrast, gene therapy is a medical intervention aimed at treating genetic disorders in humans by modifying the patient's DNA. This can involve several strategies, including introducing a new gene into the patient's cells, replacing a defective gene with a functional one, or repairing a damaged gene. Gene therapy holds significant promise for curing or alleviating the symptoms of various genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia.

Although both genetic engineering and gene therapy involve the manipulation of DNA, they differ fundamentally in their goals and applications. Genetic engineering is primarily focused on creating new organisms or products, whereas gene therapy is centered on treating genetic disorders in humans. Together, these fields have the potential to revolutionize industries and significantly improve human health.
