Nondisjunction is a crucial process that can result in chromosomal disorders.

During cell division, chromosomes are expected to separate evenly into two daughter cells. However, occasionally this process goes awry, resulting in one daughter cell acquiring an extra chromosome while the other ends up with one less. This phenomenon is known as nondisjunction.

Nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis or mitosis. When it takes place during meiosis, it can produce gametes (sperm or eggs) that contain an abnormal number of chromosomes. If such a gamete is involved in fertilization, the resulting zygote will also have an abnormal chromosomal count. This can lead to various conditions, including Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, or Klinefelter syndrome.

Conversely, when nondisjunction occurs during mitosis, it can result in somatic cells (the cells that compose the body) having an abnormal number of chromosomes. This may lead to conditions such as mosaic Down syndrome, where some cells have an extra chromosome 21, while others do not.

In summary, nondisjunction plays a significant role in the emergence of chromosomal disorders. By disrupting the typical distribution of chromosomes during cell division, it can lead to conditions that impact an individual's physical and intellectual development.
