Passive immunity is acquired externally, while active immunity is developed internally by the body.

Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies from one individual to another, offering immediate protection against specific pathogens. This transfer can occur naturally, such as when a mother provides antibodies to her infant through breast milk, or artificially, through the injection of pre-formed antibodies known as immunoglobulins. However, passive immunity is temporary; the transferred antibodies will eventually degrade and be eliminated from the body.

In contrast, active immunity is generated by the immune system in response to exposure to a pathogen. This can happen naturally, for example, when a person contracts an illness and their immune system produces antibodies to combat it, or artificially, through vaccination. Active immunity is long-lasting, as the body retains memory cells that can rapidly produce antibodies if the same pathogen is encountered again in the future.

Both passive and active immunity serve to protect against infectious diseases, yet they differ significantly in their mechanisms and duration of protection. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and treat infectious diseases.
