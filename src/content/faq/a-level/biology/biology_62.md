Centrioles and spindle fibers are essential components in the process of cell division.

During cell division, centrioles migrate to opposite poles of the cell, where they organize the formation of spindle fibers. These spindle fibers are pivotal for the segregation of chromosomes during both mitosis and meiosis. They attach to the centromeres of chromosomes and exert forces to pull them apart, ensuring that each daughter cell receives the correct number of chromosomes.

In addition to their roles in cell division, centrioles contribute to the formation of the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining the cell's shape and structural integrity. Furthermore, centrioles are involved in producing cilia and flagella, which are important for the locomotion of certain cells.

In animal cells, centrioles exist as pairs and are located near the nucleus. Each centriole is composed of microtubulesâ€”long, slender protein fibers that also constitute the spindle fibers. Conversely, plant cells lack centrioles; instead, they form spindle fibers directly from the microtubules of the cytoskeleton.

In summary, the functions of centrioles and spindle fibers are vital for the proper division of cells. Without these structures, chromosomes would fail to separate accurately, potentially leading to genetic abnormalities and cell death.
