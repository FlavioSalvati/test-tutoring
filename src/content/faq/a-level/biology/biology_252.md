Inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks can significantly undermine populations and their genetic diversity.

**Inbreeding** refers to the mating of closely related individuals within a population. This practice can lead to a decline in genetic diversity, as alleles tend to become more homozygous. Consequently, the likelihood of harmful recessive traits being expressed increases. Additionally, inbreeding can result in **inbreeding depression**, a phenomenon where the fitness of the population diminishes due to reduced heterozygosity. Inbreeding can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as selective breeding.

**Genetic bottlenecks** arise when a population experiences a substantial reduction in size, leading to a loss of genetic diversity. These bottlenecks can be triggered by various factors, including natural disasters, human actions like habitat destruction, or disease outbreaks. The individuals that survive may possess a limited array of alleles, which constrains their potential for adaptation and heightens the risk of inbreeding depression. Furthermore, genetic bottlenecks can give rise to **founder effects**, where a small group of individuals establishes a new population with restricted genetic diversity.

Both inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks can have long-lasting repercussions for populations. These include diminished fitness, heightened vulnerability to diseases, and a reduced capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions. To counteract these effects, conservation efforts focus on enhancing genetic diversity through strategies such as habitat restoration, captive breeding programs, and the reintroduction of individuals from distinct populations.
