Translation is the biological process through which the sequence of nucleotides in messenger RNA (mRNA) is transcribed into a sequence of amino acids in a protein.

During translation, the ribosome interprets the mRNA sequence in sets of three nucleotides known as codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid, which is transported to the ribosome by a molecule of transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has an anticodon that is complementary to the codon on the mRNA, enabling it to bind to the ribosome and deliver the appropriate amino acid.

As the ribosome traverses the mRNA strand, it sequentially incorporates each amino acid into a growing polypeptide chain, following the specific order dictated by the mRNA sequence. This process continues until the ribosome encounters a stop codon, at which point the synthesis of the protein is complete, and the newly formed protein is released from the ribosome.

Translation is a meticulously regulated process that is vital for the proper functioning of cells. Errors that occur during translation can result in the synthesis of non-functional or even deleterious proteins, potentially leading to various diseases. Consequently, researchers are conducting extensive studies on translation to gain a deeper understanding of its mechanisms and to explore potential therapeutic applications.
