Vitamins and minerals are vital nutrients that the body requires to function optimally.

**Vitamins** are organic compounds necessary in small quantities for the maintenance of normal physiological functions. They are crucial for growth, development, and overall well-being. Vitamins can be classified into two categories: water-soluble and fat-soluble. 

- **Water-soluble vitamins**, such as vitamin $C$ and the B vitamins, are not stored in the body and must be replenished daily through dietary intake. 
- **Fat-soluble vitamins**, including vitamins $A$, $D$, $E$, and $K$, are stored in the body's fatty tissues and liver. It is important to note that excessive consumption of these vitamins can lead to toxic levels in the body.

In contrast, **minerals** are inorganic substances that the body needs in smaller amounts to maintain essential bodily functions. They are fundamental for the development of strong bones and teeth, the transmission of nerve impulses, and the support of a healthy immune system. Minerals can be divided into two groups: macrominerals and trace minerals.

- **Macrominerals**, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, are required in larger quantities. 
- **Trace minerals**, including iron, zinc, and copper, are needed in smaller amounts.

Both vitamins and minerals are integral to the bodyâ€™s health, working synergistically to support overall wellness. While a balanced diet typically provides adequate amounts of these nutrients, certain individuals may require supplements to meet their needs. It is essential to consume these nutrients within the recommended guidelines to prevent deficiencies or toxicities.
