RNA processing plays a vital role in regulating gene expression by modifying the mRNA molecule before it exits the nucleus.

In eukaryotic cells, RNA processing is an essential step that involves several modifications to the precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) molecule prior to its transport out of the nucleus and subsequent translation into protein. The main modifications include capping, splicing, and polyadenylation.

Capping refers to the addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5' end of the mRNA molecule. This cap serves to protect the mRNA from degradation and facilitates its binding to ribosomes during the translation process. Splicing involves the removal of introns—non-coding regions of the pre-mRNA—and the joining of exons, which are the coding regions. This process results in the formation of a mature mRNA molecule. Furthermore, splicing allows for alternative splicing, enabling different combinations of exons to be joined together, thus generating various protein isoforms from a single gene. 

Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule. This tail not only protects the mRNA from degradation but also plays a crucial role in regulating its stability and translation efficiency.

Consequently, RNA processing significantly influences gene expression by altering both the structure and stability of the mRNA molecule. It also contributes to the diversity of protein isoforms that can be produced from a single gene. Mutations or dysregulation in the RNA processing pathway can lead to various diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders.
