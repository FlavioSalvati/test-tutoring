Gene expression and epigenetic modifications are fundamental processes that significantly influence evolution by altering an organism's phenotype.

**Gene Expression**  
Gene expression is the process through which genetic information is utilized to synthesize proteins or other functional molecules. Variations in gene expression can lead to the emergence of new traits, which may benefit or hinder an organism's survival. For instance, if a mutation results in a gene being expressed at an elevated level, it may confer a selective advantage, such as increased resistance to a specific disease.

**Epigenetic Modifications**  
Epigenetic modifications refer to changes in the structure of DNA that do not alter the underlying nucleotide sequence. These modifications can be inherited across generations and can influence gene expression without modifying the DNA sequence itself. A notable example is DNA methylation, a process that can silence a gene by inhibiting its transcription into RNA. Such modifications can profoundly impact an organism's phenotype and drive evolutionary changes.

**Influence of Environmental Factors**  
Both gene expression and epigenetic modifications can be affected by environmental factors, including diet, stress, and exposure to toxins. These environmental influences can lead to alterations in gene expression or epigenetic changes that may be transmitted to subsequent generations. This phenomenon, known as epigenetic inheritance, offers a mechanism for organisms to adapt to shifting environmental conditions, thereby facilitating evolutionary change.

**Conclusion**  
In conclusion, gene expression and epigenetic modifications serve as vital mechanisms for evolutionary change. They can modify an organism's phenotype, resulting in new traits that may either enhance or impede survival. Furthermore, environmental factors play a crucial role in shaping these processes, contributing to the capacity of organisms to adapt to their ever-changing environments.
