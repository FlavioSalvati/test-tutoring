Mitosis and meiosis are two distinct types of cell division processes, each serving different biological purposes.

**Mitosis** is a form of cell division that results in the creation of two genetically identical daughter cells. This process is crucial for growth and tissue repair in multicellular organisms. Mitosis involves a single division of the nucleus and can be broken down into four key stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. It takes place in somatic cells and produces diploid cells, meaning these daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

In contrast, **meiosis** is a specialized type of cell division that produces four genetically diverse daughter cells. This process is vital for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. Meiosis consists of two sequential divisions of the nucleus and is divided into two main stages: meiosis I and meiosis II. It occurs in germ cells and results in haploid cells, which contain half the number of chromosomes compared to the parent cell.

One significant difference between mitosis and meiosis lies in how they handle genetic information. During mitosis, there is no exchange of genetic material between the parent and daughter cells. In meiosis, however, a critical process known as **crossing over** occurs, where homologous chromosomes exchange segments of genetic material. This exchange contributes to genetic diversity in the resulting daughter cells.

In summary, mitosis and meiosis are fundamentally different processes of cell division. Mitosis produces two genetically identical daughter cells, while meiosis generates four genetically diverse daughter cells. Mitosis is essential for growth and tissue repair, whereas meiosis is crucial for sexual reproduction.
