Endothermic and exothermic reactions are two fundamental types of chemical reactions characterized by their energy exchange with the surroundings.

Endothermic reactions are defined as those that absorb energy from their environment in order to proceed. Consequently, the products of these reactions possess more energy than the reactants. A classic example of an endothermic reaction is the interaction between baking soda and vinegar, which absorbs heat from the surrounding environment, resulting in a noticeable drop in temperature of the mixture.

In contrast, exothermic reactions release energy into the environment during the reaction process. This leads to the products having less energy than the reactants. A common example of an exothermic reaction is the combustion of wood, where heat and light energy are emitted as the wood reacts with oxygen from the air.

The energy involved in these reactions is quantified as the enthalpy change, denoted as $\Delta H$. In an exothermic reaction, the enthalpy change is negative ($\Delta H < 0$), signifying that energy is being released. Conversely, in an endothermic reaction, the enthalpy change is positive ($\Delta H > 0$), indicating that energy is being absorbed.

Grasping the distinctions between endothermic and exothermic reactions is crucial in various biological contexts, such as metabolism and cellular respiration. These biological processes encompass a series of chemical reactions that either release or absorb energy, making an understanding of their thermodynamic properties essential for comprehending the functioning of living organisms.
