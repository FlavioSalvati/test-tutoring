DNA and RNA are two fundamental molecules that play crucial roles in the storage and expression of genetic information. 

**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)** is a long, double-stranded molecule located in the nucleus of cells. It is composed of units called nucleotides, each of which consists of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The four nitrogenous bases found in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). These bases pair in a specific manner: adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine. This complementary base pairing is essential for the stability and structure of the DNA double helix.

**RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)**, on the other hand, is a single-stranded molecule that plays a key role in the process of protein synthesis. There are three primary types of RNA: 

1. **Messenger RNA (mRNA)**: This type carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where proteins are synthesized.
2. **Transfer RNA (tRNA)**: tRNA is responsible for translating the genetic code by delivering amino acids to the ribosome, facilitating their assembly into proteins.
3. **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)**: rRNA is a structural component of the ribosome itself.

One of the key distinctions between DNA and RNA lies in the type of sugar present in their structures. DNA contains deoxyribose, whereas RNA contains ribose. Furthermore, while DNA includes thymine, RNA substitutes it with uracil (U). Another notable difference is their cellular locations: DNA is primarily found in the nucleus, while RNA can be located both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

In summary, although DNA and RNA share some common features, their differences in structure and function are vital for their respective roles within the cell.
