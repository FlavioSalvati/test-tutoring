The genetic code refers to the sequence of nucleotides in DNA that dictates the order of amino acids in proteins.

This code is interpreted during a process known as protein synthesis, which consists of two primary stages: transcription and translation. In the transcription phase, the DNA sequence is transcribed into a complementary RNA sequence by the enzyme RNA polymerase. This resulting RNA molecule, known as messenger RNA (mRNA), transports the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosome, where it will be translated into a protein.

During the translation phase, the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and employs transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver the appropriate amino acids to the growing protein chain. Each tRNA molecule carries an anticodon that pairs with a specific codon on the mRNA, ensuring the correct amino acid is incorporated into the protein. As the ribosome progresses along the mRNA, it reads each codon and adds the corresponding amino acid to the chain until it encounters a stop codon, which signals the termination of protein synthesis.

The genetic code is described as degenerate, indicating that multiple codons can specify the same amino acid. For instance, both the codons $UUU$ and $UUC$ encode the amino acid phenylalanine. However, it is important to note that each codon corresponds to only one amino acid, and the sequence of these codons determines the overall amino acid sequence of the protein. Mutations in the DNA sequence can modify the genetic code, potentially altering the amino acid sequence and affecting the function of the resulting protein.
