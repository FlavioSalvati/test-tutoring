A virus is classified as a non-living infectious agent, whereas a retrovirus is a specific type of virus that utilizes RNA for replication.

Viruses are minuscule infectious entities that can only reproduce within living cells. They comprise genetic material, which can be either DNA or RNA, encased within a protein coat. Additionally, some viruses possess an outer lipid envelope. Viruses are not regarded as living organisms because they lack the ability to perform metabolic processes independently and depend on a host cell for replication.

Retroviruses are distinct from other viruses in that they use RNA as their genetic material. What sets retroviruses apart is the presence of an enzyme known as reverse transcriptase. This enzyme enables retroviruses to convert their RNA into DNA after they infect a host cell. The resulting DNA is then integrated into the genome of the host cell, allowing it to be transcribed and translated into viral proteins. Retroviruses are associated with various diseases, including HIV/AIDS and certain forms of cancer.

In summary, the primary distinction between a virus and a retrovirus lies in the fact that retroviruses utilize RNA for replication and possess the capability to transform their RNA into DNA through the action of reverse transcriptase. This transformation facilitates the integration of their genetic material into the host cell's genome, which can lead to long-lasting effects on the infected organism.
