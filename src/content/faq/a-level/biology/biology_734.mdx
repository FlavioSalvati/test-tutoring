The Golgi apparatus is a vital organelle that plays a key role in the modification and sorting of proteins within eukaryotic cells.

Structurally, the Golgi apparatus consists of a series of flattened, membrane-bound sacs. It is primarily responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids that have been synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The Golgi apparatus is organized into three main regions: the cis-Golgi, medial-Golgi, and trans-Golgi. Proteins enter the Golgi at the cis-Golgi and undergo a series of modifications as they transit through these distinct regions.

The Golgi apparatus modifies proteins through several biochemical processes. These include the addition or removal of carbohydrate chains, the phosphorylation or sulfation of amino acids, and the cleavage of signal sequences. Such modifications can significantly impact the protein's function, stability, and localization within the cell. Additionally, the Golgi apparatus sorts proteins according to their final destinations. Proteins intended for secretion are packaged into vesicles and transported to the plasma membrane, while those destined for lysosomes are directed into vesicles and sent to the endosome, where further sorting occurs before delivery to the lysosome.

In summary, the Golgi apparatus is an essential organelle that modifies and sorts proteins in eukaryotic cells. Its critical functions in protein modification and sorting are indispensable for maintaining cellular function and homeostasis.
