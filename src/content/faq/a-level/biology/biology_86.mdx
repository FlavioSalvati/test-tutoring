Antigens and antibodies are crucial components of the immune system. Antigens are foreign substances that provoke an immune response, whereas antibodies are proteins generated by the immune system in reaction to these antigens.

Antigens can encompass a wide range of foreign entities, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and even cancer cells. When an antigen enters the body, the immune system identifies it as a foreign invader, triggering a defensive response. This response activates various immune cells, notably T cells and B cells, which collaborate to eliminate the antigen.

In contrast, antibodies are proteins produced by B cells specifically in response to antigens. Each antibody is tailored to bind to a particular antigen, marking it for destruction by other immune cells. Additionally, antibodies are capable of neutralizing toxins released by bacteria and viruses, and they can activate complement proteins that assist in the elimination of pathogens.

In summary, antigens are foreign substances that elicit an immune response, while antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to these antigens. Together, they create a sophisticated defense mechanism that protects the body from infections and diseases.
