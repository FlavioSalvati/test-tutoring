Substrate-level phosphorylation takes place in the cytoplasm, whereas oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondria.

**Substrate-Level Phosphorylation**  
Substrate-level phosphorylation is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm of cells, specifically during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. This process involves the direct transfer of a phosphate group from a substrate molecule to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), resulting in the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction is facilitated by specific enzymes and does not require oxygen. For more in-depth information about this process, please refer to the relevant literature.

**Oxidative Phosphorylation**  
In contrast, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondria and is characterized by the transfer of electrons from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) to the electron transport chain. This transfer establishes a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which ultimately drives the synthesis of ATP by ATP synthase. Unlike substrate-level phosphorylation, oxidative phosphorylation requires oxygen and serves as the primary source of ATP production during aerobic respiration. To explore the reasons why organisms require this energy, please see the corresponding resources.

Additionally, further context on these metabolic processes can be found in the suggested readings.

**Summary for A-Level Biology Students**  
To summarize, substrate-level phosphorylation occurs in the cytoplasm and produces ATP without the need for oxygen. It is a critical component of both glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Conversely, oxidative phosphorylation takes place in the mitochondria, requires oxygen, and is responsible for generating the majority of ATP during aerobic respiration by creating a proton gradient. Although substrate-level phosphorylation is less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation, it is essential for ATP generation, especially in anaerobic conditions.
