Natural selection occurs in nature, whereas artificial selection is a process governed by human intervention.

Natural selection is the mechanism through which organisms possessing advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing those traits on to their offspring. This process unfolds naturally in the wild, free from human interference. The environment plays a pivotal role in natural selection, as it dictates which traits confer advantages for survival and reproduction.

In contrast, artificial selection is the intentional process by which humans breed organisms with desirable traits to produce offspring exhibiting those traits. This method is commonly employed in agriculture and animal husbandry to cultivate crops and livestock with specific characteristics, such as increased yields or improved meat quality. Here, humans actively direct the selection process, rather than allowing environmental factors to take precedence.

While both natural and artificial selection involve the selection of advantageous traits, the primary distinction lies in the influence of humans. Natural selection is primarily driven by environmental factors, while artificial selection is propelled by human choices and actions. Understanding these differences is crucial for comprehending the evolution of species and the impact of human activities on the natural world.
