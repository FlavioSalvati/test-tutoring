Autoimmune disorders arise when the immune system mistakenly targets and attacks healthy cells and tissues within the body.

The primary function of the immune system is to safeguard the body against harmful pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. It achieves this by identifying and attacking foreign substances that invade the body. However, in the case of autoimmune disorders, the immune system fails to differentiate between these foreign invaders and the body's own healthy cells and tissues. Consequently, the immune system launches an attack on these healthy components, resulting in damage and a variety of symptoms and health issues.

There are numerous types of autoimmune disorders, each impacting different areas of the body. Some well-known examples include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. In each of these conditions, the immune system targets specific cells or tissues, causing inflammation, pain, and other associated symptoms.

While the precise causes of autoimmune disorders remain unclear, they are thought to stem from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Certain individuals may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more susceptible to these disorders, while others might develop them following exposure to specific environmental triggers, such as infections or toxins.

The treatment of autoimmune disorders generally focuses on alleviating symptoms and reducing inflammation. This may involve the use of medications, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, alongside lifestyle modifications that promote a healthy diet and regular exercise. In some instances, autoimmune disorders may enter a state of remission, while in others, they may necessitate ongoing management and treatment.
