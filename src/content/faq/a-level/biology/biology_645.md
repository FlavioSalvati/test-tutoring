Anabolism and catabolism are two key processes that together constitute metabolism. 

Metabolism encompasses all chemical reactions that take place within an organism. It can be categorized into two main processes: anabolism and catabolism. 

Anabolism refers to the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones, a process that requires energy input. This energy is utilized to generate new cells, tissues, and organs within the body. Examples of anabolic reactions include photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and the formation of glycogen.

In contrast, catabolism involves the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy in the process. This energy is essential for the body to carry out its various functions. Common examples of catabolic reactions include cellular respiration, digestion, and the breakdown of glycogen.

Both anabolism and catabolism are vital for sustaining life and are intricately linked. The energy released during catabolic processes is harnessed to fuel anabolic activities, while the products generated through anabolism serve as substrates for catabolism. Consequently, these two processes occur simultaneously within the body.

The regulation of metabolism is primarily governed by enzymes, which act as biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions. Each enzyme is specific to a particular reaction, ensuring that only the appropriate reactions occur and that energy is utilized efficiently.

In conclusion, anabolism and catabolism are fundamental processes within metabolism. Anabolism is responsible for constructing complex molecules, whereas catabolism breaks them down. Both processes are essential for life, interdependent, and regulated by enzymes to maintain the efficiency of biochemical reactions in the body.
