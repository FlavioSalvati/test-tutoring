A biomass pyramid illustrates the quantity of living matter at each trophic level, while an energy pyramid depicts the energy transferred between these levels.

Biomass and energy pyramids serve as distinct representations of the flow of energy and matter within an ecosystem. The biomass pyramid quantifies the amount of living matter, or biomass, present at each trophic level. At the base of the pyramid are the producers, such as plants, which possess the highest biomass. As we ascend the pyramid, the higher trophic levels consist of consumers, including herbivores and carnivores, which exhibit progressively lower biomass. This reduction occurs because energy diminishes as it ascends the food chain, with only about $10\%$ of energy being transferred from one trophic level to the next.

Conversely, the energy pyramid represents the transfer of energy across trophic levels. The base of the energy pyramid is occupied by primary producers that harness energy from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. For further insights into how chloroplasts facilitate this process, please visit our dedicated page. The higher levels of the pyramid depict consumers that acquire energy by feeding on other organisms. Similar to the biomass pyramid, energy is lost as it progresses up the food chain, with only a small fraction of energy being transferred from one trophic level to the next.
