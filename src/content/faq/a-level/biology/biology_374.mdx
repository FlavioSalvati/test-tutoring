Genes serve as the fundamental units of heredity, responsible for determining an individual's traits, while alleles represent the various forms that a gene can take.

Inheritance is the biological process through which genetic information is transmitted from parents to their offspring. Genes, which are composed of sequences of DNA encoding specific proteins, play a crucial role in defining traits such as eye color and height. Importantly, genes can exist in different versions known as alleles, leading to variations in the traits they influence.

For instance, the gene responsible for eye color has multiple alleles, including those for brown, blue, and green eyes. If an individual inherits two copies of the same allele, they will exhibit the corresponding eye color. Conversely, if they inherit two different alleles—one from each parent—the dominant allele will dictate their eye color.

The inheritance of alleles adheres to the principles of Mendelian genetics. According to these principles, each parent contributes one allele to their offspring. Consequently, an offspring may inherit either two copies of the same allele or one copy of each allele from their parents. The specific combination of alleles inherited determines the individual’s genotype, which refers to their genetic makeup. This genotype, in turn, influences the phenotype, or the observable traits expressed by the individual.

In summary, genes and alleles are integral to the inheritance process, shaping an individual's genetic composition and the traits inherited from their parents. A solid understanding of genetic principles is crucial for comprehending how traits are passed through generations and how genetic disorders may arise.
