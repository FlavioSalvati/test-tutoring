To integrate the polynomial expression $ x^3 + 2x^2 + x $, we will utilize both the power rule and the constant multiple rule of integration.

We start by applying the power rule to the term $ x^3 $. According to the power rule, the integral of $ x^n $ is given by 

$$ 
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C 
$$ 

for any real number $ n \neq -1 $. Therefore, integrating $ x^3 $ yields:

$$ 
\int x^3 \, dx = \frac{1}{4} x^4. 
$$ 

Next, we apply the power rule to the term $ 2x^2 $. By factoring out the constant $ 2 $, we have:

$$ 
\int 2x^2 \, dx = 2 \int x^2 \, dx = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} x^3 = \frac{2}{3} x^3. 
$$ 

Finally, we integrate the term $ x $. Again using the power rule, we find:

$$ 
\int x \, dx = \frac{1}{2} x^2. 
$$ 

Combining all these results, we find that the integral of the entire expression $ x^3 + 2x^2 + x $ is:

$$ 
\int (x^3 + 2x^2 + x) \, dx = \frac{1}{4} x^4 + \frac{2}{3} x^3 + \frac{1}{2} x^2 + C, 
$$ 

where $ C $ represents the constant of integration.
