Cluster sampling is a statistical technique in which a population is divided into distinct groups, known as clusters, and a random selection of these clusters is chosen for analysis.

This method is particularly useful when the population is too large or dispersed to feasibly sample every individual directly. Instead of surveying the entire population, researchers identify clustersâ€”groups of individuals that share similar characteristics. For instance, a cluster might consist of residents from a particular neighborhood or students from a specific school.

After defining the clusters, researchers randomly select a subset of these clusters for further analysis. This selection can be executed using various techniques, such as simple random sampling or systematic sampling. Once the clusters are chosen, every individual within the selected clusters is included in the sample.

Cluster sampling can enhance efficiency compared to other sampling methods, as it enables researchers to gather data from a large population without needing to survey each individual. However, it may also lead to reduced accuracy because there can be greater variability within clusters than between them. To mitigate this issue, researchers might opt to sample a greater number of clusters or increase the sample size within each selected cluster.

In summary, cluster sampling is an effective approach for studying large populations. Nonetheless, it is crucial to carefully design the clusters' size and composition to ensure that the resulting sample accurately represents the overall population.
