Topological sorting is a technique used to arrange the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a linear order.

In the context of graph theory, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is defined as a graph that consists of directed edges and contains no cycles. A cycle occurs when there is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex. The goal of topological sorting is to organize the vertices of a DAG in such a way that for every directed edge $(u, v)$, vertex $u$ appears before vertex $v$ in the ordering. This specific arrangement is referred to as a topological order.

Topological sorting is particularly useful for solving various problems involving dependencies, such as scheduling tasks. For instance, if task $A$ must be completed before task $B$ can begin, and task $B$ must be completed before task $C$ can start, the tasks can be scheduled in the order $A$, $B$, $C$.

To perform a topological sort, one effective method is to utilize a depth-first search algorithm. The process begins at any vertex, where we explore all of its neighboring vertices and mark them as visited. We then recursively visit all unvisited neighbors of the currently visited vertices. Once we have finished exploring all neighbors of a vertex, we add that vertex to the front of the topological order.

It is important to note that if the graph contains a cycle, a topological sort cannot be performed. A cycle introduces a circular dependency that cannot be resolved in a linear order. Therefore, it is essential to check for cycles before attempting to execute a topological sort.
