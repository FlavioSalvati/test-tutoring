To calculate the sine of a complex number, we utilize the formula:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}
$$

In this expression, $z$ represents a complex number, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. This formula can be derived from the exponential representation of a complex number, which is given by:

$$
z = x + iy = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
$$

Here, $r$ is the modulus and $\theta$ is the argument of the complex number. For a deeper understanding of the trigonometric form, you may wish to review relevant resources.

To apply the sine formula, start by expressing the complex number $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts, such that:

$$
z = x + iy
$$

Next, substitute this expression into the sine formula:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{e^{i(x + iy)} - e^{-i(x + iy)}}{2i}
$$

Then simplify the expression using the properties of exponents and trigonometric functions. It can be helpful to refer to additional resources to clarify the trigonometric calculations involved.

As an example, letâ€™s find the sine of the complex number $z = 2 + 3i$. We begin by substituting $z$ into the sine formula:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{e^{i(2 + 3i)} - e^{-i(2 + 3i)}}{2i}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{e^{2i - 3} - e^{-2i + 3}}{2i}
$$

Next, we can express this in terms of trigonometric functions:

$$
= \frac{(\cos(2) + i \sin(2)) e^{-3} - (\cos(2) - i \sin(2)) e^{3}}{2i}
$$

Now, we can separate the components:

$$
= \frac{\cos(2)e^{-3} - \cos(2)e^{3}}{2i} + \frac{\sin(2)e^{-3} + \sin(2)e^{3}}{2}
$$

Combining these, we find:

$$
= \frac{\sin(2)}{2} + \frac{\cos(2)}{2} i
$$

Thus, the sine of the complex number $z = 2 + 3i$ is:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{\sin(2)}{2} + \frac{\cos(2)}{2} i
$$

**Summary for A-Level Maths Tutors:** To compute the sine of a complex number, utilize the formula:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}
$$

Start by breaking down the complex number into its real and imaginary components. Then, apply the formula and simplify the resulting expression using the rules of exponents and trigonometry. For instance, for the complex number $z = 2 + 3i$, we find:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{\sin(2)}{2} + \frac{\cos(2)}{2} i
$$

This result highlights the combination of both sine and cosine components.
