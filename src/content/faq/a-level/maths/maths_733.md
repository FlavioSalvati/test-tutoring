An object will maintain its circular motion only if a centripetal force is acting upon it.

Circular motion refers to the movement of an object along a circular trajectory. While the direction of the object's velocity is continuously changing, the magnitude of the velocity remains constant. This indicates that there must be a force at work to consistently alter the direction of the object's motion. This force is termed the centripetal force.

The centripetal force is always directed toward the center of the circular path. It can be mathematically expressed by the equation:

$$ F = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$

where:
- $F$ represents the centripetal force,
- $m$ denotes the mass of the object,
- $v$ signifies the velocity of the object, and
- $r$ is the radius of the circular path.

For an object to sustain its circular motion, the centripetal force must be supplied by an external force acting on the object. This force can originate from various sources, such as the tension in a string, gravitational attraction, or frictional forces.

If the necessary centripetal force is not provided, the object will cease to follow a circular path and will instead move in a straight line, tangent to the circular path at the point where it last moved. This phenomenon is referred to as tangential motion.

In conclusion, an object will continue to move in a circular motion only if it is acted upon by a centripetal force that is consistently directed toward the center of the circular path.
