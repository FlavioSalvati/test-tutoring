Bézout's theorem asserts that for any two polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ defined over a field, there exist polynomials $h(x)$ and $k(x)$ such that:

$$
h(x)f(x) + k(x)g(x) = d(x),
$$

where $d(x)$ represents the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.

In essence, Bézout's theorem guarantees the existence of a linear combination of the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that equals their gcd. This result is particularly useful for determining the roots of polynomials and for polynomial factorization.

To establish Bézout's theorem, we begin by defining the ideal generated by the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ as:

$$
I = \{h(x)f(x) + k(x)g(x) : h(x), k(x) \text{ are polynomials}\}.
$$

We can demonstrate that $I$ is indeed an ideal within the polynomial ring $F[x]$, where $F$ is the field over which the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined.

Since $F[x]$ is a principal ideal domain, the ideal $I$ is generated by a single polynomial $d(x)$, which serves as the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Consequently, there exist polynomials $h(x)$ and $k(x)$ such that:

$$
h(x)f(x) + k(x)g(x) = d(x).
$$

To find the specific polynomials $h(x)$ and $k(x)$, we can employ the extended Euclidean algorithm. We begin with the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and apply the Euclidean algorithm to compute their gcd, $d(x)$. During each step of this process, we express the remainder as a linear combination of the two preceding polynomials until we eventually reach a remainder of zero. We then backtrack through the equations to determine the values of $h(x)$ and $k(x)$.

For illustration, consider the polynomials $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1$. We can execute the Euclidean algorithm as follows:

1. Divide $f(x)$ by $g(x)$:
   $$
   x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1 = (x^2 - 2x + 1)(x - 1) + 0.
   $$
   
2. Next, perform the division in reverse:
   $$
   x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x)(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (x - 1).
   $$

From this calculation, we find that the gcd is:

$$
d(x) = x - 1.
$$

Now, we can backtrack to find the polynomials $h(x)$ and $k(x)$ that satisfy Bézout's theorem.
