To determine the derivative of the function \( y = 10^x \), we can apply the general formula for the derivative of exponential functions, which is given by:

$$
y' = a^x \cdot \ln(a)
$$

where \( a \) is the base of the exponential function. In our case, \( a = 10 \). Substituting this value into the formula, we obtain:

$$
y' = 10^x \cdot \ln(10)
$$

By rearranging the terms, we can express the derivative as:

$$
y' = \ln(10) \cdot 10^x
$$

Thus, we conclude that the derivative of \( y = 10^x \) is:

$$
y' = \ln(10) \cdot 10^x
$$

This expression indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \( y = 10^x \) at any point \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( \ln(10) \cdot 10^x \). 

It's noteworthy that the derivative \( y' \) is always positive. This is because \( \ln(10) \) is a positive constant and \( 10^x \) is also always positive for all real values of \( x \). Consequently, the graph of \( y = 10^x \) is continuously increasing, exhibiting no local maxima or minima.
