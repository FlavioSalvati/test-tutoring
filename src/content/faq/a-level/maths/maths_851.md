The derivative of the function $ y = \log(x) $ with base $ e $ is given by $ \frac{1}{x} $.

To derive this result, we utilize the formula for the derivative of a natural logarithm function:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}
$$

where $ x $ represents the input variable. This formula is applicable to logarithms of any base, provided that the base is a positive constant.

To understand why this formula is valid, we start with the definition of the natural logarithm:

$$
\ln(x) = y \quad \text{if and only if} \quad e^y = x
$$

Next, we differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to $ x $:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(e^y) = \frac{d}{dx}(x)
$$

Applying the chain rule to the left-hand side results in:

$$
e^y \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = 1
$$

Rearranging this equation to solve for $ \frac{dy}{dx} $, we find:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{e^y}
$$

Now, substituting $ y = \ln(x) $ into this expression gives us:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}
$$

Thus, we conclude that the derivative of $ y = \log(x) $ with base $ e $ is indeed $ \frac{1}{x} $.
