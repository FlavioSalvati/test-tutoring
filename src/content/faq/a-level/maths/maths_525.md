To complete the square in a quadratic equation, you need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$. 

Completing the square is a powerful technique that allows us to rewrite a quadratic equation in standard form, making it easier to solve. This process involves adding and subtracting a constant term to both sides of the equation, resulting in a perfect square trinomial.

For an equation of the form 

$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0, $$ 

the first step is to divide all terms by $a$, yielding 

$$ x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0. $$ 

Next, take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $\frac{b}{a}$, square it to get $\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$, and add and subtract this value on the right-hand side of the equation:

$$ x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a} = 0 + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \frac{c}{a}. $$

The left-hand side simplifies to form a perfect square trinomial:

$$ \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \frac{c}{a}. $$

Taking the square root of both sides and solving for $x$ leads to the quadratic formula:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. $$

This formula can be used to solve any quadratic equation. Completing the square not only helps derive the quadratic formula but is also a valuable method for solving quadratic equations that are difficult to factor.
