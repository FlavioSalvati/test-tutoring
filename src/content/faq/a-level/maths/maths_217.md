Sequential games are characterized by players making decisions in a specific order, with each player's actions influencing the choices available to subsequent players.

In a sequential game, players take turns making decisions, and the outcome of one player's choice can significantly impact the options for the next player. This dynamic requires players to not only consider their own preferences and strategies but also to anticipate the likely responses of their opponents.

A well-known example of a sequential game is chess. In chess, players alternate turns, moving their pieces in a manner that shapes the available options for their opponent. Each player must think carefully about not only their own moves but also the potential responses from their adversary.

Another illustrative example of a sequential game is poker. In poker, players take turns placing bets, and each bet modifies the options for the following players. Players need to evaluate not only their own cards and betting strategies but also the possible cards and strategies that their opponents might employ.

To analyze sequential games, game theorists employ various tools and techniques, including decision trees, backward induction, and subgame perfect equilibrium. These methodologies assist players in identifying the optimal strategies for each participant, considering the actions taken by previous players.
