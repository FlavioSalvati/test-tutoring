The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is utilized to determine the maximum flow in a flow network.

This algorithm operates iteratively, starting with an initial feasible flow, and progressively enhancing it until the maximum flow is achieved. The core mechanism of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm involves identifying an augmenting path in the residual network. The residual network illustrates the available capacity of the edges after accounting for the initial flow. An augmenting path is defined as a route from the source to the sink where all edges have positive residual capacity.

Upon discovering an augmenting path, the algorithm increases the flow along this path by the minimum residual capacity of its edges, known as the bottleneck capacity. Subsequently, the residual network is updated: the bottleneck capacity is subtracted from the residual capacities of the edges along the path, while the same amount is added to the residual capacities of the reverse edges.

This iterative process continues until no augmenting path can be found within the residual network. At this stage, the flow is considered maximal, and the algorithm concludes.

The time complexity of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is influenced by the strategy employed to locate the augmenting paths. The simplest approach involves using depth-first search (DFS), which has a worst-case time complexity of $O(Ef)$, where $E$ denotes the number of edges in the network and $f$ denotes the maximum flow. However, this method may enter an infinite loop if the network contains negative cycles. Alternatively, more advanced methods, such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, employ breadth-first search (BFS) and achieve a worst-case time complexity of $O(VE^2)$, where $V$ represents the number of vertices in the network.
