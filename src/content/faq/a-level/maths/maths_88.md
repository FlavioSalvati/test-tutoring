Relative velocity refers to the velocity of one object as observed from another object or frame of reference. It represents the difference between the velocities of two objects in motion.

To illustrate this concept, consider a scenario where a car is traveling at a speed of $50 \, \text{km/h}$ while a person walks at $5 \, \text{km/h}$ in the same direction as the car. In this case, the relative velocity of the person with respect to the car can be calculated as follows:

- When the person walks in the same direction as the car:
$$ v_{\text{relative}} = v_{\text{car}} - v_{\text{person}} = 50 \, \text{km/h} - 5 \, \text{km/h} = 45 \, \text{km/h}. $$

- Conversely, if the person walks in the opposite direction of the car, the relative velocity becomes:
$$ v_{\text{relative}} = v_{\text{car}} + v_{\text{person}} = 50 \, \text{km/h} + 5 \, \text{km/h} = 55 \, \text{km/h}. $$

Relative velocity can be computed using vector addition. If two objects, A and B, are moving in various directions with velocities denoted as $v_A$ and $v_B$, respectively, the relative velocity of object A with respect to object B is given by the equation:
$$ v_{AB} = v_A - v_B. $$

When both objects are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity is simply the difference of their speeds. However, if they are moving in opposite directions, the relative velocity is the sum of their speeds.

This concept of relative velocity is crucial in physics as it helps describe the motion of objects within different frames of reference. It also plays a significant role in navigation, where understanding the velocity of an object concerning the ground is essential for accurately determining its position and direction.
