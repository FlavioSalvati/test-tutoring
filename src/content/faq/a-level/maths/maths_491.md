A minimum cost flow problem in network theory focuses on determining the most cost-effective method to transport goods from a source to a destination.

In a network, goods are moved between nodes via edges. Each edge has a defined capacity, which indicates the maximum volume of goods that can be transported through it. Additionally, each edge incurs a cost per unit of goods transported. The primary goal of a minimum cost flow problem is to identify the least expensive way to transport a specified amount of goods from a source node to a sink node, while adhering to the capacity constraints of the edges.

To tackle a minimum cost flow problem, one effective approach is to utilize the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. This algorithm iteratively identifies augmenting paths from the source to the sink and increases the flow along these paths until no further augmenting paths can be discovered. The total cost of the flow is calculated as the sum of the costs associated with the edges, multiplied by the flow along each edge.

In cases where additional constraints exist, such as lower and upper limits on the flow through certain edges, we can adopt a linear programming formulation for the minimum cost flow problem. This method involves defining decision variables that represent the flow along each edge. We then establish constraints to ensure that the flow is conserved at each node, while also respecting the capacities and bounds on the edges. The objective function is formulated as the sum of the costs of the edges multiplied by the respective flow along each edge. A linear programming solver can then be employed to determine the optimal solution to the problem.
