To derive the quadratic equation with roots $\frac{1}{3}$ and $3$, we begin by utilizing the fact that a quadratic equation can be expressed in the form:

$$(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0,$$

where $r_1$ and $r_2$ represent the roots of the equation. Substituting the given roots, we have:

$$(x - \frac{1}{3})(x - 3) = 0.$$

Next, we expand the expression:

$$x^2 - \left(\frac{1}{3} + 3\right)x + \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot 3\right) = 0.$$

Simplifying the coefficients yields:

$$x^2 - \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{9}{3}\right)x + 1 = 0,$$

which simplifies to:

$$x^2 - \frac{10}{3}x + 1 = 0.$$

At this point, the coefficients of our quadratic equation are $1$, $-\frac{10}{3}$, and $1$. To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply all coefficients by $3$, resulting in:

$$3x^2 - 10x + 3 = 0.$$

Thus, the coefficients of the quadratic equation with roots $\frac{1}{3}$ and $3$ are $3$, $-10$, and $3$. Alternatively, we can express this in a different form by multiplying the entire equation by $3$, leading us to the equivalent coefficients of $9$, $-30$, and $9$. 

To summarize, the coefficients of the quadratic equation with roots $\frac{1}{3}$ and $3$ are $3$, $-10$, and $3$, or equivalently $9$, $-30$, and $9$.
