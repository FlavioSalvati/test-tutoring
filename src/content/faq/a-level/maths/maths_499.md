To calculate the sum of an infinite harmonic series, we typically use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, given by 

$$ S = \frac{a}{1 - r}, $$ 

where $ a $ represents the first term and $ r $ denotes the common ratio.

An infinite harmonic series takes the form 

$$ \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \ldots + \frac{1}{n} + \ldots, $$ 

where $ n $ approaches infinity. To determine the sum of this series, we must first clarify that while it is called a harmonic series, it does not converge in the same way as a geometric series. 

In this particular series, the first term is 

$$ a = \frac{1}{1} = 1, $$ 

but it is important to note that this series does not have a constant ratio between consecutive terms, as each term is the reciprocal of the integers. Therefore, we cannot directly apply the geometric series formula.

While we can compute the partial sums of the harmonic series, it is essential to recognize that as more terms are added, the sum does not approach a finite limit; instead, it diverges to infinity. 

In summary, the harmonic series 

$$ \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \ldots $$ 

does not converge to a finite value, meaning that as we continue adding terms, the sum increases indefinitely. Thus, while it may be tempting to apply the formula for a geometric series, the harmonic series is a classic example of a divergent series, where the total sum grows without bound as the number of terms increases.
