To determine the maximum independent set in a graph, we can utilize the greedy algorithm.

An independent set is defined as a collection of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices are adjacent. The greedy algorithm begins with an empty set and sequentially adds vertices, ensuring that each newly added vertex is not adjacent to any vertices already included in the set. This process continues until no additional vertices can be added.

To implement the greedy algorithm effectively, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty set, denoted as $S$.
2. While there are still vertices remaining in the graph:
   a. Select a vertex $v$ that has the fewest neighbors.
   b. Add vertex $v$ to the set $S$.
   c. Remove vertex $v$ and all its neighbors from the graph.
3. Return the set $S$.

Now, letâ€™s illustrate this algorithm with a practical example. Consider the following graph:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
A---B---C \\
| \ | \ | \\
D---E---F
\end{array}
$$

We start with an empty set $S$. The vertex $A$ has the fewest neighbors (only one neighbor, $B$), so we add $A$ to $S$. We then remove $A$ and its neighbor $B$ from the graph:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
D---E---F
\end{array}
$$

Next, we choose vertex $D$, which has only one neighbor, $E$. We add $D$ to $S$ and subsequently remove both $D$ and $E$ from the graph:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
F
\end{array}
$$

Finally, we select vertex $F$, which has no neighbors. We add $F$ to $S$ and conclude the process:

$$
S = \{A, D, F\}
$$

Thus, the maximum independent set in this graph is $\{A, D, F\}$.
