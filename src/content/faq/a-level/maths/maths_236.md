To find the solution to the equation \( 10^x = 100 \), we can simplify our work by using logarithms. 

First, we take the logarithm of both sides of the equation:

$$
\log(10^x) = \log(100)
$$

Applying the power rule of logarithms to the left side, we can rewrite this as:

$$
x \log(10) = \log(100)
$$

Since we know that \( \log(10) = 1 \), we can further simplify the equation:

$$
x = \log(100)
$$

Next, we need to evaluate \( \log(100) \). By the definition of logarithms, \( \log(100) \) represents the exponent to which \( 10 \) must be raised to obtain \( 100 \). We can express this as:

$$
\log(100) = 2
$$

This is true because \( 10^2 = 100 \). Consequently, we conclude that the solution to the equation \( 10^x = 100 \) is 

$$
x = 2.
$$

To verify our solution, we can substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation:

$$
10^2 = 100.
$$

Since this statement holds true, we confirm that our solution is indeed correct.
