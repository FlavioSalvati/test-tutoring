An inelastic collision is characterized by the fact that kinetic energy is not conserved during the interaction between colliding objects.

In an inelastic collision, the involved objects tend to stick together post-collision, leading to a reduction in their total kinetic energy. This loss occurs primarily due to the deformation of the objects and the transformation of kinetic energy into other energy forms, such as heat or sound.

The principle of conservation of momentum in the context of an inelastic collision can be expressed with the following equation:

$$
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v'
$$

Here, $m_1$ and $m_2$ represent the masses of the two objects, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are their respective velocities prior to the collision, and $v'$ denotes their common velocity after the collision.

To determine the value of $v'$, we must first know the masses and initial velocities of the objects prior to the collision. For instance, consider a scenario where a $2 \, \text{kg}$ object moving at $4 \, \text{m/s}$ collides with a $3 \, \text{kg}$ object moving at $2 \, \text{m/s}$ in an inelastic manner. The velocity of the combined objects post-collision can be calculated as follows:

$$
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v'
$$

Substituting the known values:

$$
(2 \, \text{kg})(4 \, \text{m/s}) + (3 \, \text{kg})(2 \, \text{m/s}) = (2 \, \text{kg} + 3 \, \text{kg}) v'
$$

Calculating each term gives:

$$
8 \, \text{kg m/s} + 6 \, \text{kg m/s} = 5 \, \text{kg} \, v'
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
14 \, \text{kg m/s} = 5 \, \text{kg} \, v'
$$

To find $v'$, we divide both sides by $5 \, \text{kg}$:

$$
v' = \frac{14 \, \text{kg m/s}}{5 \, \text{kg}} = 2.8 \, \text{m/s}
$$

Thus, the combined objects move at a velocity of $2.8 \, \text{m/s}$ after the collision.
