The derivative of the function \( y = \frac{1}{2x} \) is given by \( -\frac{1}{2x^2} \).

To differentiate \( y = \frac{1}{2x} \), we can apply the power rule of differentiation. This rule states that if \( y = x^n \), then the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} = nx^{n-1} \). We can rewrite \( y \) in a more convenient form: 

$$
y = \frac{1}{2} x^{-1}.
$$

Now, we can apply the power rule:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) x^{-2}.
$$

By simplifying this expression, we find:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{1}{2x^2}.
$$

Thus, the derivative of \( y = \frac{1}{2x} \) is \( -\frac{1}{2x^2} \). This indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \( y \) at any point \( (x, y) \) is given by \( -\frac{1}{2x^2} \). 

We can utilize this derivative to evaluate the slope at a specific point or to analyze the behavior of the function near certain values of \( x \). For instance, as \( x \) approaches \( 0 \), the derivative becomes increasingly large in magnitude, suggesting the presence of a vertical asymptote at \( x = 0 \).
