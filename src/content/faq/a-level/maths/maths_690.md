The standard unit of mass in mechanics is the kilogram, denoted as $kg$.

Mass is a fundamental characteristic of matter that quantifies the amount of substance contained in an object. In the realm of mechanics, mass plays a crucial role in determining how an object reacts to external forces. The International System of Units (SI) defines the kilogram ($kg$) as the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), a platinum-iridium cylinder maintained at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France.

The kilogram is widely utilized in various mechanical applications, ranging from calculating the weight of an object to assessing its acceleration when subjected to a force. For instance, the weight of an object can be calculated using the formula:

$$
W = m \cdot g
$$

where $W$ represents weight, $m$ is mass, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ at the Earth's surface. Therefore, for an object with a mass of $2 \, kg$, its weight can be calculated as follows:

$$
W = 2 \, kg \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 19.62 \, N
$$

In addition to the kilogram, other mass units such as the gram ($g$) and the tonne ($t$) are also employed in mechanics. However, the kilogram remains the most commonly used unit of mass in scientific and engineering contexts due to its international standardization and practical applicability.
