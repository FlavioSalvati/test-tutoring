The conditions for equilibrium occur when both the net force and the net torque acting on an object are equal to zero.

For an object to be in translational equilibrium, it is essential that there is no net force acting on it. This implies that the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object must be zero. Mathematically, this condition is represented as:

$$
\Sigma \mathbf{F} = 0
$$

Here, $\Sigma \mathbf{F}$ denotes the vector sum of all the forces.

Furthermore, for an object to achieve rotational equilibrium, there must be no net torque acting on it. This means that the vector sum of all the torques applied to the object must also be zero. This condition can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\Sigma \tau = 0
$$

In this equation, $\Sigma \tau$ represents the vector sum of all the torques.

These equilibrium conditions are crucial for solving problems related to statics, such as calculating the forces acting on a beam or the tension in a rope. It is important to emphasize that these conditions apply exclusively to objects that are not undergoing acceleration. If an object is accelerating, it must have a net force acting upon it.

In summary, the conditions for equilibrium require that both the net force and net torque acting on an object must be zero. These principles are instrumental in statics problems but are applicable only to objects that are in a state of rest or uniform motion, rather than those experiencing acceleration.
