The inequality \( |8x - 1| \geq 0 \) holds true for all real values of \( x \).

To understand this inequality, we first need to clarify what it signifies. The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line. Therefore, \( |8x - 1| \) indicates the distance between \( 8x \) and \( 1 \) on the number line.

Since distance is inherently non-negative, it follows that \( |8x - 1| \) is always greater than or equal to zero. As a result, the inequality \( |8x - 1| \geq 0 \) is valid for every real number \( x \).

Although this conclusion may seem trivial, it is crucial to recognize that not all inequalities possess a solution set. In this case, since the inequality is universally true, there is no need to identify a specific set of solutions.

In summary, the inequality \( |8x - 1| \geq 0 \) is valid for all real values of \( x \) because the absolute value of any number is always non-negative.
