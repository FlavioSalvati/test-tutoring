An impulse applied to an object results in a change in its momentum.

When an object experiences an impulse, it undergoes a change in momentum. The impulse-momentum theorem articulates that the impulse acting on an object is equal to the change in that object's momentum. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
I = \Delta p
$$

Here, $I$ represents the impulse, and $\Delta p$ signifies the change in momentum. The unit of measurement for impulse is newton-seconds (Ns), while momentum is measured in kilogram meters per second (kg m/s).

The magnitude of the impulse can be calculated using the formula:

$$
I = F \Delta t
$$

In this equation, $F$ denotes the constant force applied to the object, and $\Delta t$ is the time interval during which the force is exerted. It is important to note that this formula assumes the force remains constant throughout the specified time interval. If the force varies, the impulse can be determined by integrating the force over time.

The direction of the impulse aligns with the direction of the applied force. Consequently, if a force is exerted in the opposite direction of the object's motion, the impulse will result in the object slowing down. Conversely, if the force is applied in the same direction as the object's motion, the impulse will cause the object to accelerate.

In conclusion, an impulse applied to an object results in a change in its momentum, which can be calculated using the impulse-momentum theorem. The magnitude and direction of the impulse are determined by the force applied and the duration of time over which it acts.
