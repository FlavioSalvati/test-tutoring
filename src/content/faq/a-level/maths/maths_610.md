To address a network flow problem that involves multiple sources and sinks, we can utilize the max-flow min-cut theorem.

The max-flow min-cut theorem asserts that the maximum flow achievable in a network is equivalent to the minimum capacity of a cut within that network. A cut refers to a division of the nodes into two distinct sets: one set includes the sources, while the other contains the sinks.

To apply the max-flow min-cut theorem, start by constructing a flow network where the sources and sinks are represented as nodes, and the edges denote the flow capacities between these nodes. Subsequently, implement an algorithm such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to determine the maximum flow in the network.

To identify the minimum cut in the network, refer to the residual graph generated by the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. A residual graph illustrates the remaining capacities of the edges after the flow has been transmitted through the network. The minimum cut is defined as the cut that separates the sources from the sinks, possessing the lowest total capacity in the residual graph.

Once the minimum cut is identified, it can be concluded that the maximum flow in the network equals the capacity of this minimum cut. This relationship is crucial for determining the maximum amount of flow that can be transferred from the sources to the sinks within the network.

In summary, solving a network flow problem with multiple sources and sinks involves the following steps: constructing a flow network, calculating the maximum flow using an algorithm such as Ford-Fulkerson, and applying the max-flow min-cut theorem to ascertain the maximum flow capacity within the network.
