To find the $ n $-th term of an arithmetic sequence, you can use the formula:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

An arithmetic sequence is defined as a series of numbers in which each term is derived by adding a constant value, known as the common difference, to the preceding term. For instance, the sequence $ 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 $ exemplifies an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $ 3 $.

To calculate the $ n $-th term of an arithmetic sequence, you need to identify the first term $ a_1 $ and the common difference $ d $. With these values, you can apply the formula:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

Let's consider an example: suppose you want to determine the 10th term of the arithmetic sequence $ 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, \ldots $. In this case, the first term $ a_1 $ is $ 3 $ and the common difference $ d $ is $ 4 $ (as each term is produced by adding $ 4 $ to the previous term).

Now, substituting these values into the formula gives:

$$
a_{10} = a_1 + (10-1)d = 3 + 9 \cdot 4 = 3 + 36 = 39
$$

Thus, the 10th term of this sequence is $ 39 $.

It's essential to remember that this formula is applicable exclusively to arithmetic sequences and does not apply to other types of sequences, such as geometric sequences. If you are uncertain about the type of sequence you are working with, you may need to explore alternative methods to determine the $ n $-th term.
