The singular vectors of a matrix are the eigenvectors derived from the product of the matrix with its transpose.

Singular vectors play a crucial role in linear algebra and have a wide range of applications, particularly in data analysis and image processing. Specifically, for an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, the singular vectors are the eigenvectors of the matrices $A^T A$ or $A A^T$. These singular vectors are orthogonal and form the basis for the left and right singular subspaces of the matrix $A$.

The significance of singular vectors lies in their ability to facilitate the decomposition of a matrix into its fundamental components, a process known as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The SVD of a matrix $A$ is expressed as:

$$
A = U \Sigma V^T
$$

In this expression, $U$ and $V$ represent the left and right singular vectors of $A$, respectively, while $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix that contains the singular values of $A$.

Furthermore, singular vectors are instrumental in solving linear systems of equations and conducting Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on datasets. In PCA, the singular vectors corresponding to the covariance matrix of the dataset are utilized to uncover the most significant features and to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

In summary, singular vectors are the eigenvectors of the product of a matrix and its transpose, and they are vital in various applications within linear algebra, data analysis, and image processing. They enable the decomposition of matrices into their essential elements and are applicable in solving linear equations and performing PCA on datasets.
