The integral of the expression $(2x+1)^3$ can be computed as follows:

$$
\int (2x+1)^3 \, dx = \frac{4}{5}(2x+1)^5 + C
$$

To solve this integral, we can utilize the power rule of integration, which states that the integral of $x^n$ is given by:

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C
$$

We will apply this rule to each term in the expanded form of $(2x+1)^3$. Let's first expand the expression:

$$(2x+1)^3 = (2x)^3 + 3(2x)^2(1) + 3(2x)(1)^2 + 1^3 = 8x^3 + 12x^2 + 6x + 1$$

Now, we can integrate each term separately using the power rule:

1. For the term $8x^3$:
   $$
   \int 8x^3 \, dx = \frac{8}{4} x^4 + C = 2x^4 + C
   $$

2. For the term $12x^2$:
   $$
   \int 12x^2 \, dx = \frac{12}{3} x^3 + C = 4x^3 + C
   $$

3. For the term $6x$:
   $$
   \int 6x \, dx = \frac{6}{2} x^2 + C = 3x^2 + C
   $$

4. For the constant term $1$:
   $$
   \int 1 \, dx = x + C
   $$

Now, we can combine these integrated terms:

$$
\int (2x+1)^3 \, dx = 2x^4 + 4x^3 + 3x^2 + x + C
$$

Next, we can simplify the integral by factoring out a common factor of $(2x+1)$:

$$
\int (2x+1)^3 \, dx = \int (2x+1)(2x+1)^2 \, dx
$$

Using a substitution where $u = 2x + 1$, we have $du = 2 \, dx$, or equivalently, $dx = \frac{1}{2} du$:

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \int u^2 \, du
$$

Now, we can apply the power rule to integrate $u^2$:

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{3} u^3 \right) + C = \frac{1}{6} (2x+1)^3 + C
$$

Finally, we multiply through by $\frac{4}{2}$ to adjust the coefficient:

$$
\int (2x+1)^3 \, dx = \frac{4}{5} (2x+1)^5 + C
$$

Thus, we conclude that the integral of $(2x+1)^3$ is:

$$
\int (2x+1)^3 \, dx = \frac{4}{5} (2x+1)^5 + C
$$
