The $ n $-th term of a harmonic sequence can be determined using the formula:

$$
a_n = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{d} + (n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{a_1}}
$$

where $ d $ represents the common difference and $ a_1 $ is the first term of the corresponding arithmetic sequence.

A harmonic sequence consists of numbers where each term is the reciprocal of the corresponding term in an arithmetic sequence. For instance, if we consider the arithmetic sequence $ 2, 4, 6, 8 $, the related harmonic sequence would be $ \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{8} $.

To calculate the $ n $-th term of a harmonic sequence, it is essential to know both the first term and the common difference. The first term, $ a_1 $, is simply the reciprocal of the first term in the corresponding arithmetic sequence. The common difference $ d $ is defined as the difference between the reciprocals of consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence.

Using the formula 

$$
a_n = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{d} + (n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{a_1}}
$$ 

we can substitute the values of $ d $ and $ a_1 $ to find the $ n $-th term. For example, if the first term of the harmonic sequence is $ \frac{1}{2} $ and the common difference is $ \frac{1}{4} $, we can calculate the 5th term as follows:

$$
a_5 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4} + (5-1) \cdot \frac{1}{2}}
$$

Calculating this step-by-step, we have:

$$
a_5 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{4}{2}} 
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4} + 2} 
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{8}{4}} 
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{\frac{9}{4}} 
$$

$$
= \frac{4}{9} 
$$

Thus, the 5th term of the harmonic sequence is $ \frac{4}{9} $.
