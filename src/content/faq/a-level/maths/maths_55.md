In circular motion, the tension in a string is equivalent to the centripetal force acting on the object.

When an object moves along a circular path, it experiences a force directed toward the center of the circle, known as the centripetal force. If the object is attached to a string and is moving in a horizontal circle, this centripetal force is provided by the tension in the string. Therefore, we can state that the tension in the string is equal to the centripetal force.

The centripetal force can be calculated using the formula:

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$

where:
- $F$ represents the centripetal force,
- $m$ is the mass of the object,
- $v$ is its velocity, and
- $r$ is the radius of the circular path.

If the object is attached to a string, the tension in the string, denoted as $T$, must equal the centripetal force. Thus, we can express this relationship as:

$$
T = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$

Now, letâ€™s consider an example: a ball with a mass of $0.2 \, \text{kg}$ is attached to a string of length $0.5 \, \text{m}$ and is moving in a horizontal circle at a velocity of $2 \, \text{m/s}$. In this case, the radius of the circular path is equal to the length of the string, so we have $r = 0.5 \, \text{m}$.

To calculate the centripetal force, we use the formula:

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{0.2 \times 2^2}{0.5}
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
F = \frac{0.2 \times 4}{0.5} = \frac{0.8}{0.5} = 1.6 \, \text{N}
$$

Consequently, the tension in the string, which is equal to the centripetal force, is also:

$$
T = 1.6 \, \text{N}
$$

In summary, for this scenario, both the tension in the string and the centripetal force acting on the ball are equal to $1.6 \, \text{N}$.
