Subgame perfect equilibrium is a key solution concept in game theory that analyzes all possible subgames within a larger strategic environment.

In game theory, a subgame is defined as a smaller game that emerges from a larger game when a player is faced with a decision. Subgame perfect equilibrium serves as a refinement of the Nash equilibrium concept, which posits that all players make their decisions simultaneously and independently. Conversely, in subgame perfect equilibrium, players make decisions sequentially, and the equilibrium must hold true in every possible subgame of the original game.

To determine a subgame perfect equilibrium, we begin by identifying all the subgames present in the larger game. We then solve each subgame by employing a backward induction approach, starting from the end of the game. We assume that the players in each subgame are rational and will select the best available strategy. After solving all the subgames, we can pinpoint the strategies that are optimal for each player in every subgame. If these strategies are consistent across all subgames, we have successfully identified a subgame perfect equilibrium.

Subgame perfect equilibrium is a more robust solution concept compared to Nash equilibrium because it takes into account the sequential dynamics of the game. This concept is particularly useful in scenarios involving incomplete information, where players lack full knowledge about the strategies or payoffs of their opponents. In such cases, subgame perfect equilibrium can help identify the strategies that are most likely to be employed in practice.
