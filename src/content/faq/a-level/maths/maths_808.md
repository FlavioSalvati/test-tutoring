To address the transportation problem in networks, we can utilize the transportation algorithm.

The transportation problem is a specific type of linear programming issue that seeks to determine the most cost-effective means of transporting goods from multiple sources to various destinations while ensuring that supply meets demand. The transportation algorithm serves as a systematic approach to solving this problem.

The initial step in the transportation algorithm is to construct the transportation matrix. This matrix outlines the supply available at each source and the demand required at each destination. Here, the supply indicates the quantity of goods available at each source, while the demand signifies the quantity of goods needed at each destination.

Following the setup of the transportation matrix, we must identify an initial feasible solution. This can be accomplished using one of several methods, including the northwest corner method, the least cost method, or Vogel's approximation method. These techniques involve allocating the available supply to the various destinations in a manner that satisfies the demand while also minimizing transportation costs.

Once we have established an initial feasible solution, we can enhance it further using either the stepping stone method or the modified distribution method. These methods focus on optimizing the allocation by evaluating the potential to shift goods between different cells in the matrix, all while maintaining the balance between supply and demand.

The final step is to verify the optimality of our solution using an optimality test. If the solution is found to be suboptimal, we must revisit the process—finding a new initial feasible solution and refining it—until we arrive at an optimal solution.

In summary, the transportation algorithm provides an effective framework for solving the transportation problem in networks. The process involves setting up a transportation matrix, identifying an initial feasible solution, refining that solution, and conducting an optimality check to ensure the best possible outcome.
