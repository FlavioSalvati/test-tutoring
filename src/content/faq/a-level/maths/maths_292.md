To solve the equation 

$$ \ln(4x) = 5, $$ 

we need to isolate the variable $x$. We can achieve this by exponentiating both sides of the equation using $e$, which is the base of the natural logarithm. This results in:

$$ e^{\ln(4x)} = e^5. $$

By applying the property of logarithms that states $\ln(a^b) = b \cdot \ln(a)$, we can simplify the left-hand side:

$$ 4x = e^5. $$

Next, to find $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by $4$:

$$ x = \frac{e^5}{4}. $$

Thus, the solution to the equation 

$$ \ln(4x) = 5 $$ 

is 

$$ x = \frac{e^5}{4}. $$
