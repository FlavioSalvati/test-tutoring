The solution to the inequality $ |3x - 2| < 1 $ is $ x \in \left( \frac{1}{3}, 1 \right) $.

To solve this inequality, we need to analyze two distinct cases: when $ 3x - 2 $ is non-negative and when it is negative.

**Case 1: $ 3x - 2 \geq 0 $**  
In this scenario, the inequality can be rewritten as:

$$
3x - 2 < 1.
$$

By adding $ 2 $ to both sides, we obtain:

$$
3x < 3.
$$

Dividing both sides by $ 3 $ gives:

$$
x < 1.
$$

However, since we started with the condition $ 3x - 2 \geq 0 $, we also have:

$$
3x \geq 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x \geq \frac{2}{3}.
$$

Thus, from this case, we find:

$$
x \in \left[ \frac{2}{3}, 1 \right).
$$

**Case 2: $ 3x - 2 < 0 $**  
In this case, the inequality becomes:

$$
-(3x - 2) < 1,
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
-3x + 2 < 1.
$$

Subtracting $ 2 $ from both sides gives:

$$
-3x < -1.
$$

Multiplying both sides by $ -1 $ (and reversing the inequality) results in:

$$
3x > 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x > \frac{1}{3}.
$$

Combining the results from both cases, we have:

1. From Case 1: $ x \in \left[ \frac{2}{3}, 1 \right) $
2. From Case 2: $ x > \frac{1}{3} $

The overall solution can be expressed as the union of these two intervals:

$$
x \in \left( \frac{1}{3}, 1 \right).
$$

Therefore, the complete solution to the inequality $ |3x - 2| < 1 $ is:

$$
x \in \left( \frac{1}{3}, 1 \right).
$$
