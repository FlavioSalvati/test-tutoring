The derivative of the function $y = \tan(3x)$ is given by $3 \sec^2(3x)$.

To differentiate $y = \tan(3x)$, we can apply the chain rule. First, we set $u = 3x$, which allows us to rewrite the function as $y = \tan(u)$. According to the chain rule, the derivative can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

Next, we determine $\frac{dy}{du}$. The derivative of $\tan(u)$ is $\sec^2(u)$, thus:

$$
\frac{dy}{du} = \sec^2(u)
$$

Now, we need to find $\frac{du}{dx}$. The derivative of $u = 3x$ is simply $3$, so we have:

$$
\frac{du}{dx} = 3
$$

Now, we can combine these results to find the overall derivative:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = \sec^2(u) \cdot 3 = 3 \sec^2(3x)
$$

Thus, the derivative of $y = \tan(3x)$ is:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 3 \sec^2(3x)
$$
