The quadratic equation with roots $-4$ and $-1$ can be expressed with coefficients $1$, $5$, and $4$.

To find the coefficients of the quadratic equation with these specific roots, we can utilize the fact that the equation can be represented in the form:

$$(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0$$

where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots of the equation. By substituting $-4$ and $-1$ for $r_1$ and $r_2$, respectively, we get:

$$(x - (-4))(x - (-1)) = 0$$
$$(x + 4)(x + 1) = 0$$

Next, we expand the expression:

$$
(x + 4)(x + 1) = x^2 + 5x + 4
$$

This leads us to the quadratic equation:

$$x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0$$

From this expansion, we can identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation. The coefficient of $x^2$ is always $1$ for equations of this form. The coefficient of $x$ is derived from the sum of the roots, which in this case is $-4 + (-1) = -5$. However, since we are considering the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $b = 5$ because we typically express the coefficient as a positive value when writing the equation. Lastly, the constant term $c$ is the product of the roots, calculated as $(-4) \times (-1) = 4$.

Thus, the coefficients of the quadratic equation with roots $-4$ and $-1$ are indeed $1$, $5$, and $4$.
