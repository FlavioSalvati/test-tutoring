The derivative of the function $ y = x^3 $ is given by $ 3x^2 $.

To differentiate $ y = x^3 $, we apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if $ y = x^n $, then the derivative $ \frac{dy}{dx} $ is expressed as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = n x^{n-1}
$$

Applying this rule to $ y = x^3 $, we can derive:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 3 x^{3-1} = 3 x^2
$$

Thus, the derivative of $ y = x^3 $ is $ 3x^2 $. This indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the curve $ y = x^3 $ at any point $ (x, y) $ is equal to $ 3x^2 $. This information allows us to calculate the equation of the tangent line at a specific point on the graph.

For instance, if we wish to determine the equation of the tangent line to the graph of $ y = x^3 $ at the point $ (2, 8) $, we first compute the slope of the tangent line using the derivative:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2
$$

Now, substituting $ x = 2 $ into the derivative:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} \text{ at } x = 2 = 3(2^2) = 12
$$

This tells us that the slope of the tangent line at $ x = 2 $ is $ 12 $. To find the equation of the tangent line, we utilize the point-slope form of a linear equation:

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$

Substituting in our point $ (2, 8) $ and the slope $ m = 12 $:

$$
y - 8 = 12(x - 2)
$$

Simplifying this equation:

$$
y - 8 = 12x - 24
$$
$$
y = 12x - 16
$$

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of $ y = x^3 $ at the point $ (2, 8) $ is 

$$
y = 12x - 16.
$$
