The column space of a matrix is defined as the span of its column vectors.

For a given matrix \( A \), the column space, denoted as \( \text{Col}(A) \), consists of all possible linear combinations of its column vectors. In other terms, \( \text{Col}(A) \) represents the subspace of the vector space that is spanned by the columns of matrix \( A \).

To determine the column space of a matrix, we can perform row operations to transform it into its reduced row echelon form (RREF). The non-zero rows of the RREF correspond to the linearly independent columns of the original matrix, and thus the column space can be expressed as the span of these columns.

Alternatively, we can identify a basis for the column space by locating the pivot columns in the RREF. Pivot columns are those that contain a leading non-zero entry. Consequently, the column space is the span of these pivot columns.

Understanding the column space is crucial in linear algebra, as it reveals important information about the range of the linear transformation that the matrix represents. Notably, the dimension of the column space is equal to the rank of the matrix, which is a fundamental characteristic of linear transformations.
