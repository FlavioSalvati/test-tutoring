Potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration within a system.

As a form of stored energy, potential energy is a scalar quantity measured in joules (J). The amount of potential energy an object has depends on several factors: its mass, its height above a reference point, and the strength of the gravitational field acting on it. The formula for gravitational potential energy is expressed as:

$$
PE = mgh
$$

In this equation, $PE$ represents the potential energy, $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$), and $h$ is the height of the object above a designated reference point, typically ground level.

Another type of potential energy is elastic potential energy, which refers to the energy stored in an object when it is either stretched or compressed. The formula for calculating elastic potential energy is given by:

$$
PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

Here, $PE$ signifies the potential energy, $k$ is the spring constant of the object, and $x$ indicates the displacement from the object's equilibrium position.

Potential energy can be transformed into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. For instance, when an object falls from a height, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it accelerates. The formula for kinetic energy is expressed as:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

In this equation, $KE$ represents kinetic energy, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $v$ is its velocity.

In summary, potential energy is the energy that an object holds due to its position or configuration. It can be calculated using the formulas for both gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy. Understanding potential energy is crucial in physics, as it helps explain a variety of phenomena observed in the natural world.
