Slack variables play a crucial role in linear programming by transforming inequality constraints into equality constraints.

In linear programming, constraints are often represented as inequalities. However, the simplex algorithm—a widely used method for solving linear programming problems—requires that all constraints be formulated as equalities. To achieve this, slack variables are introduced.

A slack variable is a non-negative variable added to an inequality constraint to convert it into an equality constraint. The value of the slack variable indicates how much the left-hand side of the inequality can be increased while still satisfying the constraint. 

For instance, consider the inequality constraint:

$$
2x + 3y \leq 10
$$

To convert this into an equality constraint, we introduce a slack variable $s$:

$$
2x + 3y + s = 10
$$

Here, the slack variable $s$ represents the amount by which the left-hand side of the inequality can be increased to meet the constraint. If $s = 0$, the inequality becomes an equality, indicating that the constraint is satisfied exactly. Conversely, if $s > 0$, the left-hand side can be increased by up to $s$ without violating the constraint.
