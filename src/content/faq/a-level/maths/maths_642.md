To solve the equation $ e^x = 100 $, we can determine that the solution is given by 

$$ 
x = \ln(100) \approx 4.605. 
$$

To isolate $ x $, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation. This is valid because the natural logarithm, $ \ln $, has the property that $ \ln(e^x) = x $ for any real number $ x $. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as follows:

$$ 
\ln(e^x) = \ln(100). 
$$

This simplifies to:

$$ 
x = \ln(100). 
$$

Using a calculator, we can evaluate $ \ln(100) $, which yields approximately $ 4.605 $. Thus, the solution to the equation $ e^x = 100 $ is 

$$ 
x = \ln(100) \approx 4.605. 
$$

It is important to note that this equation has a unique solution. The exponential function $ e^x $ is a one-to-one function, meaning that for every value of $ y $, there is exactly one corresponding value of $ x $ such that $ e^x = y $. In other words, the graph of $ e^x $ is always increasing and does not intersect any horizontal line more than once.
