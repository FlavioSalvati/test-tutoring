Newton's third law of motion asserts that for every action, there exists an equal and opposite reaction. 

This principle indicates that when one object exerts a force on another, the second object simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force back on the first object. These forces are referred to as action and reaction forces.

For instance, when you push a book across a table, the book applies an equal and opposite force against your hand. This reaction is the reason you can feel the resistance of the book as you apply your push.

Mathematically, this law can be expressed as 

$$
F_1 = -F_2,
$$ 

where $F_1$ represents the force exerted by object 1 on object 2, and $F_2$ denotes the force exerted by object 2 on object 1. The negative sign indicates that while the forces are equal in magnitude, they act in opposite directions.

It is crucial to understand that these forces always act on different objects and do not cancel each other out. This is because the action and reaction forces operate on separate entities and act in opposing directions.

Grasping Newton's third law of motion is essential for comprehending how objects interact within the physical world. It enables us to analyze and predict the motion of objects and serves as the foundation for numerous significant scientific and engineering principles.
