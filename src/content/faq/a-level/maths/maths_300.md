To determine the power of a machine, you need to know two key factors: the amount of work performed and the time it takes to perform that work.

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. It is measured in watts (W), which is equivalent to joules per second (J/s). The formula to calculate power is given by:

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work done}}{\text{Time taken}}
$$

In this equation, the work done is measured in joules (J) and the time taken is measured in seconds (s).

For instance, consider a machine that performs $5000 \, \text{J}$ of work in $10 \, \text{s}$. The power output of the machine can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work done}}{\text{Time taken}} = \frac{5000 \, \text{J}}{10 \, \text{s}} = 500 \, \text{J/s} \, \text{or} \, 500 \, \text{W}
$$

This indicates that the machine is capable of doing $500 \, \text{J}$ of work every second, which corresponds to a power output of $500 \, \text{W}$.

It is crucial to understand that power and energy are distinct concepts. Energy refers to the capacity to perform work, while power represents the rate at which that work is accomplished. Consequently, a machine with a high power output does not necessarily imply that it is more energy-efficient than a machine with a lower power output.
