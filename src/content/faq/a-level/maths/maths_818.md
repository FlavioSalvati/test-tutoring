The hyperbolic cosecant function is defined as the reciprocal of the hyperbolic sine function.

Denoted as $\text{csch}(x)$, the hyperbolic cosecant function is mathematically expressed as:

$$
\text{csch}(x) = \frac{1}{\sinh(x)}
$$

where $\sinh(x)$ represents the hyperbolic sine function.

The hyperbolic sine function itself is defined by the formula:

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
$$

Here, $e$ is the mathematical constant approximately equal to $2.71828$.

Consequently, we can express the hyperbolic cosecant function as:

$$
\text{csch}(x) = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}\right)}
$$

By simplifying this expression, we obtain:

$$
\text{csch}(x) = \frac{2}{e^x - e^{-x}}
$$

It is important to note that the hyperbolic cosecant function is classified as an odd function, which means that for all values of $x$, the following relationship holds:

$$
\text{csch}(-x) = -\text{csch}(x)
$$

The graph of the hyperbolic cosecant function bears resemblance to that of the reciprocal function, but it features a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$, where the function is undefined. As $x$ approaches either positive or negative infinity, the function approaches zero.

The hyperbolic cosecant function finds applications in various branches of mathematics, including complex analysis, number theory, and differential equations. Additionally, it is utilized in physics to describe the behavior of certain physical systems, such as the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a plasma.
