The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a powerful method for determining the shortest path in a weighted graph.

This algorithm is specifically designed to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices within a weighted graph. It operates by repeatedly relaxing each edge in the graph. "Relaxing" an edge involves updating the distance to a vertex based on the distance to its neighboring vertices. Initially, the algorithm sets the distance to the source vertex to $0$ and the distance to all other vertices to infinity. It then relaxes each edge in the graph a total of $V - 1$ times, where $V$ represents the number of vertices in the graph. After each iteration, if a shorter path is found, the algorithm updates the distance to the respective vertex.

One important feature of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is its ability to detect negative weight cycles in the graph. A negative weight cycle is defined as a cycle in which the sum of the weights is negative. If such a cycle exists, the algorithm recognizes it and indicates that no shortest path can be established. This is due to the fact that traversing the cycle multiple times can continuously decrease the distance to a vertex, leading to an indefinite reduction.

The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is $O(VE)$, where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges in the graph. While this time complexity makes it less efficient compared to other algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm (which has a time complexity of $O(E \log V)$), the Bellman-Ford algorithm has the distinct advantage of being able to handle graphs with negative weight edges.
