To find the derivative of the function \( y = \ln(3x) \), we can apply the chain rule. 

First, we let \( u = 3x \), which allows us to express \( y \) as \( y = \ln(u) \). According to the chain rule, the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) can be calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

Next, we need to determine \( \frac{dy}{du} \). The derivative of \( \ln(u) \) is given by:

$$
\frac{dy}{du} = \frac{1}{u}
$$

Now, we find \( \frac{du}{dx} \). Differentiating \( u = 3x \) with respect to \( x \) yields:

$$
\frac{du}{dx} = 3
$$

We can now substitute these results back into our chain rule equation:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{1}{u} \cdot 3
$$

Substituting \( u = 3x \) back into the equation gives us:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3}{3x} = \frac{1}{x}
$$

Thus, the derivative of \( y = \ln(3x) \) is:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}
$$

For a more thorough understanding of this process, I recommend reviewing the fundamentals of differentiation and the chain rule. Additionally, familiarizing yourself with logarithmic functions in calculus can provide valuable insights.
