To calculate the tangent of a complex number, we can use the formula:

$$
\tan(z) = \frac{\sin(2x) + i \sinh(2y)}{\cos(2x) + \cosh(2y)},
$$

where $ z = x + iy $.

To apply this formula, we first need to identify the real part $ x $ and the imaginary part $ y $ of the given complex number.

For instance, letâ€™s consider the complex number $ z = 2 + 3i $. In this case, we have $ x = 2 $ and $ y = 3 $. We can now use the formula to compute the tangent:

$$
\tan(2 + 3i) = \frac{\sin(2 \cdot 2) + i \sinh(2 \cdot 3)}{\cos(2 \cdot 2) + \cosh(2 \cdot 3)}.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\tan(2 + 3i) = \frac{\sin(4) + i \sinh(6)}{\cos(4) + \cosh(6)}.
$$

Next, we can express the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions using their exponential definitions:

$$
\sinh(y) = \frac{e^y - e^{-y}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \cosh(y) = \frac{e^y + e^{-y}}{2}.
$$

Applying these definitions, we have:

$$
\tan(2 + 3i) = \frac{\sin(4) + i \left( \frac{e^6 - e^{-6}}{2} \right)}{\cos(4) + \left( \frac{e^6 + e^{-6}}{2} \right)}.
$$

Now, we can evaluate the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, followed by simplifying the expression. After performing these calculations, the final result for the tangent of the complex number $ z = 2 + 3i $ is approximately:

$$
\tan(2 + 3i) \approx -0.0037 + 1.0039i.
$$
