To calculate the secant of a complex number, we use the formula:

$$
\sec(z) = \frac{1}{\cos(z)}.
$$

The secant of a complex number $z$ is defined as the reciprocal of the cosine of $z$. To find the cosine of a complex number, we apply the formula:

$$
\cos(z) = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}.
$$

Let us express $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary components, where $z = x + yi$, with $x$ and $y$ being real numbers. We can then evaluate the exponential terms:

$$
e^{iz} = e^{i(x + yi)} = e^{-y} e^{ix},
$$

and 

$$
e^{-iz} = e^{-i(x + yi)} = e^{y} e^{-ix}.
$$

Substituting these expressions into the formula for $\cos(z)$, we have:

$$
\cos(z) = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2} = \frac{e^{-y} e^{ix} + e^{y} e^{-ix}}{2}.
$$

Next, we factor out $e^{-y}$:

$$
= \frac{e^{-y}}{2} \left( e^{ix} + e^{-ix} \right).
$$

Using Euler's formula, we know that:

$$
e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)
$$

and 

$$
e^{-ix} = \cos(x) - i \sin(x).
$$

Thus, we can simplify:

$$
\cos(z) = \frac{e^{-y}}{2} \left( \cos(x) + i \sin(x) + \cos(x) - i \sin(x) \right) = \frac{e^{-y}}{2} \left( 2\cos(x) \right) = e^{-y} \cos(x).
$$

Consequently, the secant of $z$ is given by:

$$
\sec(z) = \frac{1}{\cos(z)} = \frac{1}{e^{-y} \cos(x)} = \frac{e^y}{\cos(x)}.
$$

In summary, the secant of a complex number $z = x + yi$ can be expressed as:

$$
\sec(z) = \frac{e^y}{\cos(x)}.
$$
