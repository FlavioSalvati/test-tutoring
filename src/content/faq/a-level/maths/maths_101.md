Purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling technique utilized to select participants based on predetermined criteria.

Also referred to as judgmental or selective sampling, purposive sampling is often employed in research studies where the researcher deliberately chooses participants according to specific characteristics. This method is particularly advantageous when the target population is small or challenging to reach.

In this approach, the researcher defines the essential traits or characteristics relevant to the study and selects participants who exhibit those traits. For instance, if a researcher aims to investigate the effects of exercise on individuals diagnosed with diabetes, they may purposively select individuals who have been diagnosed with diabetes and are physically capable of engaging in exercise.

Purposive sampling can be particularly beneficial when the researcher seeks to ensure that the sample accurately represents a specific population or when they aim to focus on a particular subgroup within a broader population. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that purposive sampling is not a random sampling technique; consequently, the findings may not be generalizable to the larger population.

In summary, purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling technique that allows researchers to select participants based on specific criteria. While it can be advantageous in certain research contexts, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations inherent in this method.
