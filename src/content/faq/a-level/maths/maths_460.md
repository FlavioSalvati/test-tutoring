To find the derivative of the function $ y = e^{2x} $, we can apply the chain rule. 

First, we define a new variable $ u $ such that $ u = 2x $. Consequently, we can express $ y $ in terms of $ u $ as follows:

$$
y = e^u
$$

Next, we determine the derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ using the chain rule, which states:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

In this context, $ e^u $ serves as the outer function, while $ u = 2x $ is the inner function. We can calculate the derivatives as follows:

1. The derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ u $ is:

$$
\frac{dy}{du} = e^u
$$

2. The derivative of $ u $ with respect to $ x $ is:

$$
\frac{du}{dx} = 2
$$

Now, substituting these derivatives back into our chain rule equation gives:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = e^u \cdot 2
$$

Substituting back for $ u $, we have:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2e^{2x}
$$

Thus, the derivative of the function $ y = e^{2x} $ is 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2e^{2x}.
$$
