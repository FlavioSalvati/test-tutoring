Completing the square is a technique used to transform a quadratic expression into its standard form. This method is particularly valuable for solving quadratic equations and for applications in various areas of mathematics, such as calculus and differential equations.

To complete the square, we start with a quadratic expression of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. The process involves taking half of the coefficient of $x$, squaring it, and then adding this squared value to both sides of the equation. This manipulation results in a perfect square trinomial on the left-hand side.

Let's consider the quadratic expression $x^2 + 6x + 5$ as an example. First, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $6$, giving us $3$. Next, we square this value to obtain $9$. We then add $9$ to both sides of the equation:

$$
x^2 + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9
$$

Now, the left-hand side has become a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(x + 3)^2$. On the right-hand side, we simplify the expression:

$$
(x + 3)^2 = 4
$$

Next, we take the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both the positive and negative square roots:

$$
x + 3 = \pm 2
$$

To solve for $x$, we subtract $3$ from both sides:

$$
x = -3 \pm 2
$$

From this equation, we derive two solutions for the original quadratic expression:

$$
x = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -5
$$

Completing the square is an effective method for solving quadratic equations, as it allows us to express the equation in a standard form that is conducive to factoring or applying the quadratic formula. This technique is also widely applicable in other mathematical fields, making it a fundamental skill to master.
