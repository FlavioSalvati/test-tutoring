Stratified random sampling is a sampling technique that involves dividing a population into distinct subgroups, known as strata, and then taking a random sample from each of these strata.

This method is particularly effective when the population is heterogeneous, meaning it consists of subgroups that differ significantly from one another. By categorizing the population based on specific characteristics—such as age, gender, income, or other relevant factors—stratified random sampling aims to ensure that the sample accurately represents the entire population.

The process of conducting stratified random sampling begins with the identification of the relevant strata. After the strata have been defined, a random sample is then drawn from each subgroup. The size of each sample is determined proportionally according to the size of the stratum, ensuring that larger strata are represented by larger samples.

One significant advantage of stratified random sampling is its ability to enhance the precision of the sample by minimizing sampling error. Since samples are drawn from each stratum, this technique guarantees representation from all subgroups, which is especially beneficial when the subgroups have varying characteristics or when there is considerable variability within the population.

In summary, stratified random sampling is an effective technique for obtaining a representative sample of a population. By systematically dividing the population into subgroups and sampling from each stratum, this method increases the precision of the sample and reduces the likelihood of sampling error.
