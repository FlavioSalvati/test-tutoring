The derivative of the function $y = x^5$ is given by $5x^4$.

To differentiate $y = x^5$, we apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if $y = x^n$, then the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx} = nx^{n-1}$. By applying this rule to our function, we have:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 5x^{5-1}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 5x^4
$$

Thus, the derivative of $y = x^5$ is $5x^4$. This indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $y = x^5$ at any point $(x, y)$ is equal to $5x^4$. We can utilize this derivative to determine the equation of the tangent line at a specific point.

For instance, if we wish to find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of $y = x^5$ at $x = 2$, we first need to calculate the derivative at this point:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 5x^4
$$

Substituting $x = 2$, we get:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 5(2)^4 = 5 \cdot 16 = 80
$$

This result shows that the slope of the tangent line at $x = 2$ is $80$. To formulate the equation of the tangent line, we also require a point that lies on the line. The point $(2, 32)$ is on the graph of $y = x^5$ at $x = 2$. Using the point-slope form of a line, we can express the equation as follows:

$$
y - 32 = 80(x - 2)
$$

Expanding this equation, we have:

$$
y - 32 = 80x - 160
$$

Rearranging gives us:

$$
y = 80x - 128
$$

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of $y = x^5$ at $x = 2$ is given by:

$$
y = 80x - 128
$$
