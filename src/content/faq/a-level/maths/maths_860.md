In one-dimensional collisions, there are two primary types: elastic collisions and inelastic collisions.

### Elastic Collisions

In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This means that the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision, and the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total kinetic energy after the collision. Mathematically, these principles can be expressed as follows:

1. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   $$
   m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f}
   $$

2. **Conservation of Kinetic Energy**:
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2f}^2
   $$

In these equations, $m_1$ and $m_2$ represent the masses of the two objects, while $v_{1i}$ and $v_{2i}$ are their initial velocities, and $v_{1f}$ and $v_{2f}$ are their final velocities after the collision.

### Inelastic Collisions

In contrast, an inelastic collision conserves only momentum, while kinetic energy is not conserved. This means that while the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision, the total kinetic energy before the collision does not equal the total kinetic energy after the collision. This can be mathematically represented as:

$$
m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = (m_1 + m_2)v_f
$$

Here, $v_f$ denotes the final velocity of the combined mass of the two objects after the collision.

### Coefficient of Restitution

For both types of collisions, the coefficient of restitution ($e$) can be used to analyze the relative velocities of the objects before and after the collision. The coefficient of restitution is defined as the ratio of the relative velocity of separation to the relative velocity of approach. It is given by the formula:

$$
e = \frac{v_{2f} - v_{1f}}{v_{1i} - v_{2i}}
$$

This coefficient provides insight into the elasticity of the collision, with $e = 1$ indicating a perfectly elastic collision, and $e = 0$ indicating a perfectly inelastic collision.
