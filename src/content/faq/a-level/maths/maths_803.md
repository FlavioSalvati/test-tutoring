To determine the integral of $\tan^2(x) \, dx$, we can utilize the trigonometric identity:

$$
1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x).
$$

By rearranging this identity, we find that:

$$
\tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x) - 1.
$$

Substituting this expression into the integral, we have:

$$
\int \tan^2(x) \, dx = \int (\sec^2(x) - 1) \, dx.
$$

Next, we can separate the integral into two parts:

$$
\int \tan^2(x) \, dx = \int \sec^2(x) \, dx - \int 1 \, dx.
$$

We know that the integral of $\sec^2(x)$ is $\tan(x)$, and the integral of $1$ is $x$. Therefore, we can evaluate the integral as follows:

$$
\int \tan^2(x) \, dx = \tan(x) - x + C,
$$

where $C$ represents the constant of integration.

In conclusion, the integral of $\tan^2(x) \, dx$ is given by:

$$
\int \tan^2(x) \, dx = \tan(x) - x + C,
$$

with $C$ being the constant of integration.
