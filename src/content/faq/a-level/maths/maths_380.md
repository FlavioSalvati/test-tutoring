Convenience random sampling is a non-probability sampling technique in which participants are selected based on their availability and willingness to participate in the study. This method is often employed in research studies where time and resources are limited. For instance, a researcher might choose to survey students in a specific class due to their easy accessibility.

The primary advantage of convenience random sampling is its speed and ease of implementation. However, since participants are not selected randomly, this approach does not yield a representative sample of the overall population. Consequently, the results obtained may not be generalizable to a broader context.

To enhance the representativeness of the sample, researchers can employ a quota sampling technique. This approach involves selecting participants based on specific characteristics, such as age, gender, or ethnicity, ensuring that the sample reflects the diversity of the population.

In summary, while convenience random sampling is a practical method for quickly and efficiently gathering data, it should be utilized with caution. Researchers must consider its limitations when interpreting the findings.
