The work-energy theorem is a fundamental principle in physics that establishes a direct relationship between the work done on an object and its change in kinetic energy. Specifically, it asserts that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
W = \Delta K
$$

In this equation, $W$ represents the work done on the object, while $\Delta K$ denotes the change in its kinetic energy.

Work is defined as the product of the force applied to an object and the distance over which that force acts. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
W = F d
$$

Here, $F$ stands for the force applied to the object and $d$ is the distance over which the force is exerted.

The change in kinetic energy of an object is defined as the difference between its final kinetic energy and its initial kinetic energy, which can be formulated as:

$$
\Delta K = K_f - K_i
$$

In this equation, $K_f$ represents the final kinetic energy of the object, while $K_i$ denotes its initial kinetic energy.

The work-energy theorem serves as a powerful analytical tool for examining the motion of objects. It enables us to connect the work done on an object with its change in kinetic energy, allowing for the determination of various physical quantities such as the work done, the change in kinetic energy, and the object's final velocity. By leveraging this principle, we can gain deeper insights into the dynamics of moving objects.
