The derivative of the exponential function with base 10 can be expressed as the product of the natural logarithm of 10 and the function itself.

The exponential function with base 10 is defined as:

$$
f(x) = 10^x.
$$

To find its derivative, we apply the general formula for the derivative of an exponential function:

$$
f'(x) = \ln(a) \cdot a^x,
$$

where $\ln(a)$ denotes the natural logarithm of the base $a$. In our case, with $a = 10$, we have:

$$
f'(x) = \ln(10) \cdot 10^x.
$$

Thus, the derivative of the exponential function with base 10 is given by $\ln(10)$ multiplied by the function itself. This implies that the rate of change of the function at any point $x$ is directly proportional to the value of the function, with the constant of proportionality being $\ln(10)$.

Furthermore, we can express this result using the common logarithm (base 10) by utilizing the change of base formula:

$$
\ln(10) = \frac{\log(10)}{\ln(e)},
$$

noting that $\ln(e)$ equals $1$. This gives us:

$$
f'(x) = \frac{\log(10) \cdot 10^x}{\ln(e)}.
$$

Upon simplifying this expression, we arrive at:

$$
f'(x) = \log(10) \cdot 10^x \cdot 2.3026,
$$

where $2.3026$ is the approximate value of $\ln(10)$. Therefore, the derivative of the exponential function with base 10 can also be expressed as the product of $\log(10)$, approximately $2.3026$, and the function itself.
