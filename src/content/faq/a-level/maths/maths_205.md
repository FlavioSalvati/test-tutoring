Energy and power are fundamental concepts in physics that relate to the work performed in a system. 

**Energy** is defined as the capacity to perform work and is quantified as a scalar quantity. It is measured in joules ($J$) and depends on various factors such as the system's mass, velocity, and height. For instance, consider a ball positioned at the top of a hill; it possesses potential energy due to its elevation. As the ball rolls down the hill, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

In contrast, **power** refers to the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred. It is measured in watts ($W$) and can be expressed as a function of the work done over a specific time interval. For example, a light bulb rated at 100 W converts electrical energy into light and heat at a rate of 100 joules per second.

The mathematical relationship between energy and power can be articulated using the following equations:

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Energy}}{\text{Time}}
$$

or equivalently,

$$
\text{Energy} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time}
$$

To illustrate this relationship with a practical example, consider a 60 W light bulb that remains lit for 5 hours. The energy consumed can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Energy} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time} 
$$

Converting time into seconds, we have:

$$
\text{Energy} = 60 \, W \times 5 \, \text{hours} \times 3600 \, \text{seconds/hour} 
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
\text{Energy} = 1,080,000 \, J
$$

In conclusion, energy represents the total amount of work that can be performed, while power indicates the rate at which that work occurs. Both concepts are essential in physics and engineering, and a clear understanding of their relationship is crucial for addressing problems related to energy and power.
