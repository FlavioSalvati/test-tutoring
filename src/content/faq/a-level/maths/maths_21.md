Momentum is conserved during a collision, meaning that the total momentum of a system remains constant both before and after the collision occurs.

In a collision, two or more objects interact and exchange momentum. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the system does not change. This implies that the sum of the momenta of all objects involved in the collision is the same before and after the event.

We can mathematically express the conservation of momentum with the following equation:

$$
\text{Total momentum before collision} = \text{Total momentum after collision}
$$

This can be written as:

$$
m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} + \ldots = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f} + \ldots
$$

In this equation, $m_1, m_2, \ldots$ represent the masses of the objects involved in the collision, $v_{1i}, v_{2i}, \ldots$ are their initial velocities, and $v_{1f}, v_{2f}, \ldots$ are their final velocities.

This relationship allows us to calculate the final velocities of the objects after the collision, given their initial velocities and masses. It is also important to recognize that momentum is a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude and direction. Consequently, the conservation of momentum must be applied separately to each component of the momentum vector.

In summary, the conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that is essential for understanding the dynamics of collisions and interactions between objects.
