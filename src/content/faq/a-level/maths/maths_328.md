The solution to the inequality $ |3x - 2| \leq 5 $ is given by the interval $ -1 \leq x \leq \frac{7}{3} $.

To solve this inequality, we must consider two distinct cases: one where $ 3x - 2 $ is non-negative and another where it is negative.

**Case 1: $ 3x - 2 \geq 0 $**  
In this scenario, the inequality simplifies to:
$$
3x - 2 \leq 5.
$$
Adding $ 2 $ to both sides yields:
$$
3x \leq 7.
$$
Dividing both sides by $ 3 $ results in:
$$
x \leq \frac{7}{3}.
$$

**Case 2: $ 3x - 2 < 0 $**  
Here, we transform the inequality as follows:
$$
-(3x - 2) \leq 5,
$$
which simplifies to:
$$
-3x + 2 \leq 5.
$$
Subtracting $ 2 $ from both sides gives us:
$$
-3x \leq 3.
$$
Dividing both sides by $ -3 $ requires us to flip the inequality:
$$
x \geq -1.
$$

Combining the results from both cases, we find the solution to the inequality is:
$$
-1 \leq x \leq \frac{7}{3}.
$$

To verify this solution, we can test values within the established range. For instance, when $ x = 0 $:
$$
|3(0) - 2| = | -2 | = 2,
$$
which satisfies the condition $ 2 \leq 5 $. Similarly, when $ x = 2 $:
$$
|3(2) - 2| = |6 - 2| = 4,
$$
which also meets the requirement $ 4 \leq 5 $. 

Thus, the solution $ -1 \leq x \leq \frac{7}{3} $ is confirmed to be correct.
