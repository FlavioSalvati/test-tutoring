To determine whether a sequence is harmonic, we need to verify if the reciprocals of its terms form an arithmetic sequence.

A sequence is defined as harmonic if the reciprocals of its terms create an arithmetic progression. Specifically, for a sequence denoted as $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$, it is considered harmonic if the sequence of reciprocals $\left\{\frac{1}{a_1}, \frac{1}{a_2}, \frac{1}{a_3}, \ldots\right\}$ forms an arithmetic sequence.

To check if a sequence is harmonic, we can compute the differences between consecutive reciprocals and see if these differences remain constant. If they do, then the sequence is harmonic. 

For instance, let us consider the sequence $\{2, 4, 8, 16\}$. The reciprocals of these terms are $\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}\right\}$. The differences between consecutive reciprocals are calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{16}
$$

Since the differences are not constant, the sequence $\{2, 4, 8, 16\}$ is not harmonic.

Another method to determine if a sequence is harmonic is to compute the sum of the reciprocals. If the sum is finite, then the sequence is harmonic. For example, consider the sequence $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. The reciprocals of these terms are $\left\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}\right\}$. The sum of these reciprocals is:

$$
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = 2.0833\ldots
$$

Since this sum is finite, the sequence $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ can be considered harmonic.

In summary, to determine if a sequence is harmonic, we can either check if the reciprocals of the terms form an arithmetic sequence by calculating the differences between consecutive reciprocals, or by evaluating the sum of the reciprocals. If either criterion is satisfied, the sequence is classified as harmonic.
