The probability of rolling an odd number with a single die throw is $\frac{1}{2}$, which is equivalent to $50\%$.

A standard die has six faces, each numbered from $1$ to $6$. Among these numbers, three are odd (specifically, $1$, $3$, and $5$), while the other three are even ($2$, $4$, and $6$). We can calculate the probability of rolling an odd number as follows:

$$
P(\text{Odd number}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
P(\text{Odd number}) = \frac{3}{6}
$$

Simplifying this gives:

$$
P(\text{Odd number}) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Thus, the probability of rolling an odd number in a single dice throw is $\frac{1}{2}$, or $50\%$.

It's also noteworthy that the probability of rolling an odd number is equal to the probability of rolling an even number. Since both outcomes have three favorable outcomes out of six possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an even number is likewise $\frac{1}{2}$, or $50\%$.
