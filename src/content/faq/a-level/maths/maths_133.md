To calculate the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic series, you can utilize the formula:

$$ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) $$

In this context, an arithmetic series is defined as a sequence of numbers in which each term is derived from the previous term by adding a constant value known as the common difference. For instance, the sequence $2, 5, 8, 11, 14$ exemplifies an arithmetic series with a common difference of $3$.

To apply the sum formula for the first $n$ terms, we denote:

- $S_n$: the sum of the first $n$ terms,
- $a$: the first term of the series,
- $d$: the common difference,
- $n$: the number of terms.

For example, let's determine the sum of the first $10$ terms of the arithmetic series $2, 5, 8, 11, 14$. Here, we identify $a = 2$ and $d = 3$. Using the formula, we can compute:

$$ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \left(2(2) + (10-1)3\right) $$

Calculating step-by-step:

1. First, calculate the inner expression: 
   $$ 2(2) + (10-1)3 = 4 + 27 = 31 $$

2. Now substitute back into the formula:
   $$ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} (31) = 5 \times 31 = 155 $$

Thus, the sum of the first $10$ terms of the arithmetic series $2, 5, 8, 11, 14$ is $155$.
