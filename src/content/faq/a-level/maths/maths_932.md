Power is defined as the rate at which energy is transferred or utilized.

In physics, power and energy are interconnected concepts. Energy represents the capacity to perform work, while power indicates how quickly work is accomplished or energy is transferred. Mathematically, power can be expressed as the amount of energy transferred or used per unit time.

The standard unit of power in the International System of Units (SI) is the watt (W), which is defined as one joule (J) of energy transferred in one second (s). Thus, power can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P = \frac{E}{t}
$$

where:
- $ P $ is power,
- $ E $ is energy transferred, and
- $ t $ is the time taken.

For instance, if a light bulb rated at $100 \, \text{W}$ is operated for $10 \, \text{s}$, the energy consumed can be calculated as follows:

$$
E = P \times t
$$

Substituting the values, we have:

$$
E = 100 \, \text{W} \times 10 \, \text{s} = 1000 \, \text{J}
$$

In another example, consider a car engine that produces $200 \, \text{hp}$ of power. To convert this power to watts, we use the conversion factor:

$$
1 \, \text{hp} = 746 \, \text{W}
$$

Thus, the power output of the car engine in watts can be calculated as follows:

$$
P = 200 \, \text{hp} \times 746 \, \text{W/hp} = 149,200 \, \text{W}
$$

In summary, power and energy are fundamental concepts in physics, where power signifies the rate of energy transfer or usage. The SI unit for power is the watt, and it can be calculated using the formula $ P = \frac{E}{t} $.
