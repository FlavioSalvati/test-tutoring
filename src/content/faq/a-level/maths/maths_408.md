The solution to the equation $\log(x) = 2$ is $x = 100$.

To solve the equation $\log(x) = 2$, we first need to understand the concept of logarithms. A logarithm represents the exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a specific number. In this case, since no base is explicitly mentioned, we assume the base is $10$, which is the most commonly used base in mathematics.

Using the definition of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation $\log(x) = 2$ in exponential form as follows:

$$
10^2 = x.
$$

This expression indicates that $x$ is the result of raising $10$ to the power of $2$.

When we calculate $10^2$, we find that:

$$
10^2 = 100.
$$

Thus, we conclude that the solution to the equation $\log(x) = 2$ is $x = 100$.

It is also crucial to remember that logarithms are defined only for positive numbers. Therefore, for the equation $\log(x) = 2$ to have a valid solution, $x$ must be a positive number.
