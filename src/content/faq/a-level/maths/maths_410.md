The principle of conservation of angular momentum asserts that the total angular momentum of a system remains unchanged over time, provided that no external torque is applied.

Angular momentum is a quantification of the rotational motion of an object or system. It is mathematically defined as the product of the moment of inertia and the angular velocity. The moment of inertia, denoted as $I$, measures an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion and is influenced by the mass distribution and shape of the object. Angular velocity, represented as $\omega$, indicates the rate at which the object rotates.

According to the principle of conservation of angular momentum, if a system experiences no external torque, its total angular momentum will remain constant. This implies that if one part of the system gains angular momentum, another part must compensate by losing an equivalent amount of angular momentum. This principle parallels the law of conservation of linear momentum, which states that the total linear momentum of a system remains constant in the absence of external forces.

The conservation of angular momentum has numerous applications in both physics and engineering. For instance, it helps explain the motion of planets and satellites in orbit around a central body, the dynamics of spinning tops and gyroscopes, as well as the behavior of subatomic particles. Additionally, this principle is crucial in the design of spacecraft and satellites, where maintaining stability and controlling orientation relies heavily on the conservation of angular momentum.
