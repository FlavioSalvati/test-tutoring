The double angle formulas in trigonometry can be derived using the sum and difference formulas.

To prove the double angle formulas, we begin with the sum formulas for sine and cosine:

$$
\sin(A + B) = \sin(A)\cos(B) + \cos(A)\sin(B)
$$

$$
\cos(A + B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A)\sin(B)
$$

Using these formulas, we can derive the double angle formulas for sine and cosine:

1. For sine, we have:

$$
\sin(2A) = \sin(A + A) = \sin(A)\cos(A) + \cos(A)\sin(A) = 2\sin(A)\cos(A)
$$

2. For cosine, we obtain:

$$
\cos(2A) = \cos(A + A) = \cos(A)\cos(A) - \sin(A)\sin(A) = \cos^2(A) - \sin^2(A)
$$

Next, to derive the double angle formula for tangent, we start with the tangent sum formula:

$$
\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan(A) + \tan(B)}{1 - \tan(A)\tan(B)}
$$

By substituting $A = B$ into this formula, we find:

$$
\tan(2A) = \frac{\tan(A) + \tan(A)}{1 - \tan(A)\tan(A)} = \frac{2\tan(A)}{1 - \tan^2(A)}
$$

Thus, the double angle formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent are as follows:

$$
\sin(2A) = 2\sin(A)\cos(A)
$$

$$
\cos(2A) = \cos^2(A) - \sin^2(A)
$$

$$
\tan(2A) = \frac{2\tan(A)}{1 - \tan^2(A)}
$$

These formulas are invaluable for simplifying trigonometric expressions and solving trigonometric equations.
