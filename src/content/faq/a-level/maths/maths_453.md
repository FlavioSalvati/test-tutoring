In simple harmonic motion, energy transfer occurs between kinetic energy and potential energy.

Simple harmonic motion is characterized as a type of periodic motion in which the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position. This results in oscillatory motion that can be described by a sinusoidal function. Within this framework, energy continually shifts between kinetic energy and potential energy.

At the equilibrium position, the displacement is zero, and the velocity reaches its maximum. Consequently, all energy in the system is manifested as kinetic energy. As the object moves away from this equilibrium position, potential energy increases while kinetic energy decreases. When the object reaches its maximum displacement, its velocity drops to zero, and all the energy is then stored as potential energy.

The total energy of the system remains constant throughout the motion, in accordance with the principle of conservation of energy. This total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy ($K$) and potential energy ($U$):

$$E = K + U$$

Here, $E$ represents the total energy, $K$ is the kinetic energy, and $U$ is the potential energy.

The kinetic energy can be expressed mathematically as:

$$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity.

The potential energy is given by:

$$U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

In summary, energy transfer in simple harmonic motion oscillates between kinetic and potential energy, while the total energy of the system remains constant throughout the oscillation.
