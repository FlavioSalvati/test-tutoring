The integral of the function $\frac{e^x \ln(x)}{x}$ cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

This means that solving the integral $$\int \frac{e^x \ln(x)}{x} \, dx$$ using standard integration techniques—such as substitution or integration by parts—is not possible.

To approximate this integral, one could employ numerical integration methods, such as Simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule. These techniques involve partitioning the interval of integration into smaller subintervals and using polynomial functions to estimate the area under the curve.

Another approach to approximate the integral involves using series expansions. For instance, by utilizing the Taylor series expansion of $e^x$ and $\ln(x)$, we can express the integrand as a power series. However, this method can be quite cumbersome and may not yield accurate approximations for all values of $x$.

In certain situations, it might be feasible to simplify the integrand through integration by parts or other techniques. Nevertheless, the success of this approach largely hinges on the specific form of the integrand and may not always be applicable.

In summary, the integral of $\frac{e^x \ln(x)}{x}$ presents a complex challenge that necessitates advanced mathematical techniques for its resolution.
