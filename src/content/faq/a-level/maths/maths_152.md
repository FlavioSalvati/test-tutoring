To determine the resultant moment about a specific point, we must first calculate the vector sum of all individual moments acting on the object.

### Step 1: Identify Forces and Distances
Begin by identifying all forces acting on the object along with their corresponding distances from the point in question. For illustration, consider a uniform rod of length $L$. Suppose a force $F$ is applied at a distance $d$ from one end, and another force $F'$ is applied at a distance $d'$ from the opposite end.

### Step 2: Calculate Individual Moments
The moment generated by the force $F$ can be expressed as:

$$
M = F \cdot d
$$

Similarly, the moment due to the force $F'$ is:

$$
M' = F' \cdot d'
$$

### Step 3: Compute the Resultant Moment
To find the resultant moment about point $O$, which is situated at a distance $x$ from the end where force $F$ is applied, we can calculate:

$$
M_{\text{res}} = M - M' = F \cdot d - F' \cdot d'
$$

### Step 4: Account for Angled Forces
If any of the forces are applied at an angle to the rod, it is necessary to resolve these forces into their horizontal and vertical components. Each component will then contribute to the moments individually. The moments calculated for each component can be summed vectorially to derive the resultant moment.

### Step 5: Determine Moment Direction
Keep in mind that the direction of the moment vector is always perpendicular to the plane formed by the force and the point about which the moment is being calculated. To ascertain the direction of the moment vector, you can apply the right-hand rule.

### Summary
In conclusion, to compute the resultant moment about a specified point, follow these steps:
1. Identify all forces and their distances from the point of interest.
2. Calculate the moments for each force.
3. Sum the moments vectorially to obtain the resultant moment.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can accurately determine the resultant moment acting on an object.
