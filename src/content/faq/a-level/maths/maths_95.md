Assumptions in a mathematical model are the conditions that must be satisfied for the model to be considered valid.

Mathematical models are designed to represent real-world scenarios and facilitate predictions. However, these models rely on specific assumptions that may not always reflect reality. For instance, a model predicting population growth assumes that the birth rate and death rate remain constant over time. If these rates fluctuate, the accuracy of the model could be compromised.

Assumptions can be categorized as either explicit or implicit. Explicit assumptions are clearly stated within the model, while implicit assumptions are not directly mentioned but are essential for the model's validity. For example, a model that forecasts the trajectory of a projectile typically assumes the absence of air resistance. Although this assumption is not articulated, it is crucial for ensuring the model's accuracy.
