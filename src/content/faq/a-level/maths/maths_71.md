To find the derivative of the function \( y = \sqrt{2x} \), we can apply the power rule of differentiation. The power rule states that if \( y = x^n \), then the derivative \( y' \) is given by:

$$
y' = n \cdot x^{n-1}
$$

In our specific case, we can rewrite \( y \) as:

$$
y = (2x)^{1/2}
$$

Now, we differentiate using the power rule:

$$
y' = \frac{1}{2} (2x)^{-1/2} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(2x)
$$

Since the derivative of \( 2x \) with respect to \( x \) is \( 2 \), we can substitute this into our expression:

$$
y' = \frac{1}{2} (2x)^{-1/2} \cdot 2
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
y' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2x}}
$$

Thus, the derivative of \( y = \sqrt{2x} \) is 

$$
y' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2x}}.
$$

This result indicates the rate of change of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) at any point on the curve. For instance, if we take \( x = 4 \), we find:

$$
y = \sqrt{2 \cdot 4} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}.
$$

Next, we can calculate the derivative at this point:

$$
y' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \cdot 4}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}.
$$

This means that for every unit increase in \( x \), \( y \) increases by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} \) units.

It's important to note that the domain of the function \( y = \sqrt{2x} \) is restricted to \( x \geq 0 \) because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the set of real numbers. Consequently, the derivative \( y' \) is only defined for \( x > 0 \).
