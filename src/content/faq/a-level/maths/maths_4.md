Scalar quantities possess only magnitude, while vector quantities encompass both magnitude and direction.

**Scalar Quantities**  
Scalar quantities are physical measurements characterized solely by their magnitude. Examples include mass, temperature, and time. These quantities can be manipulated using standard arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For instance, if a car travels a distance of $100 \, \text{km}$ in $2 \, \text{hours}$, we can calculate its average speed as follows:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{100 \, \text{km}}{2 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{km/h}.
$$

**Vector Quantities**  
In contrast, vector quantities are defined by both magnitude and direction. Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, and force. Unlike scalar quantities, vector operations require specific rules for addition, subtraction, and multiplication. For example, if a car travels $100 \, \text{km}$ to the north and subsequently $50 \, \text{km}$ to the east, we can determine its overall displacement by calculating the vector sum of these two movements. This results in a displacement of approximately $111 \, \text{km}$ at an angle of $26.6^\circ$ east of north.

**Mathematical Representation of Vectors**  
In mathematical contexts, vectors are frequently represented using column matrices or boldface letters. For instance, a vector $\mathbf{a}$ in three-dimensional space can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix},
$$

where $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ are the respective components of the vector. The magnitude of a vector $\mathbf{a}$ is denoted by $|\mathbf{a}|$, and it is calculated using the formula:

$$
|\mathbf{a}| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}.
$$

To specify the direction of a vector, we can use angles or unit vectors. Unit vectors are vectors with a magnitude of $1$ that point in the same direction as the original vector, providing a way to express direction without regard to magnitude.
