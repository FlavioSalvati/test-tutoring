The hyperbolic tangent function is a mathematical function that maps real numbers to values in the interval $(-1, 1)$.

The hyperbolic tangent function, denoted as $\tanh(x)$, is defined by the formula:

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

Here, $e$ represents the mathematical constant approximately equal to $2.71828$.

The graph of the hyperbolic tangent function resembles that of the standard tangent function. However, it exhibits symmetry about the y-axis and has horizontal asymptotes at $y = -1$ and $y = 1$ as $x$ approaches negative and positive infinity, respectively.

The hyperbolic tangent function finds applications across various fields of mathematics and science, including calculus, differential equations, and physics. It is particularly valuable in modeling systems that display saturation or limiting behavior, such as the response of a neuron in the brain to a stimulus.

Key properties of the hyperbolic tangent function include:

- $\tanh(x)$ is an odd function, which means that $\tanh(-x) = -\tanh(x)$.
- $\tanh(x)$ is continuous and differentiable for all real numbers $x$.
- $\tanh(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $(-\infty, 0)$ and strictly decreasing on the interval $(0, \infty)$.
- $\tanh(x)$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y = -1$ as $x$ approaches negative infinity and at $y = 1$ as $x$ approaches positive infinity.
