Purposive random sampling is a sampling technique that effectively combines elements of random sampling with a specific research objective.

This method is particularly useful when a researcher aims to ensure that the sample accurately represents a particular subgroup within a larger population. For instance, if a researcher is interested in exploring the opinions of women regarding a specific issue, they might employ purposive random sampling to guarantee that the sample includes a proportionate number of women.

The process of employing purposive random sampling begins with the researcher identifying the specific subgroup they wish to study. Following this identification, a random sampling method is utilized to select individuals from that subgroup. For example, if the goal is to gather insights from women, the researcher could randomly select women from a pre-compiled list of names.

One significant advantage of purposive random sampling is that it enhances the likelihood of obtaining a representative sample from the designated subgroup. This approach can lead to increased validity in the study's findings and make the results more applicable to the broader population.

Nevertheless, there are some drawbacks associated with purposive random sampling. One major disadvantage is that identifying the subgroup and selecting individuals can be both time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, there is an inherent risk of bias in the selection process, as researchers might inadvertently choose individuals who are more inclined to hold particular opinions or exhibit certain characteristics.

In summary, purposive random sampling serves as a valuable technique for researchers aiming to ensure that their sample reflects a specific subgroup within the overall population. However, it is crucial to recognize the potential limitations and biases that may arise with this sampling method.
