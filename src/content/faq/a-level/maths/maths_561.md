The principle of moments states that for a body in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about any designated point is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same point.

In simpler terms, if a body is neither moving nor rotating, the total clockwise moments acting on it must be perfectly balanced by the total anticlockwise moments. This principle is grounded in the understanding that moments measure the turning effect of a force. A body in equilibrium experiences a net turning effect of zero from all forces acting upon it.

To apply the principle of moments, we must first select a point around which to calculate the moments. This point is referred to as the pivot or fulcrum. Next, we identify all the forces acting on the body along with their respective distances from the pivot. The moment of a force can be calculated by multiplying the force's magnitude by its perpendicular distance from the pivot.

For instance, let us consider a uniform beam with a length of $4 \, \text{m}$ and a weight of $100 \, \text{N}$, supported horizontally at its midpoint by a pivot. If a person weighing $600 \, \text{N}$ stands $1 \, \text{m}$ from one end of the beam, we can determine the weight of the beam acting at the pivot.

We will use the midpoint of the beam as the pivot and apply the principle of moments:

The clockwise moments can be calculated as follows:
$$
\text{Clockwise moments} = 600 \times 3 = 1800 \, \text{Nm}
$$

The anticlockwise moments consist of the weight of the beam and the weight acting at the pivot:
$$
\text{Anticlockwise moments} = 100 \times 2 + W \times 2 = 200 + 2W \, \text{Nm}
$$

Setting these moments equal gives us the equation:
$$
1800 = 200 + 2W
$$

To solve for $W$, we rearrange the equation:
$$
2W = 1800 - 200
$$
$$
2W = 1600
$$
$$
W = 800 \, \text{N}
$$

Thus, the weight of the beam acting at the pivot is $800 \, \text{N}$.
