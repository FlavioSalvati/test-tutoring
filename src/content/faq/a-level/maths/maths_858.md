To calculate the work done by a force field, we must integrate the dot product of the force and displacement vectors.

Work is defined as the product of force and the displacement in the direction of the force. In the case of a force field, the force varies with position, which necessitates the integration of the dot product of the force and displacement vectors along the object's path.

Let $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)$ represent the force field, and let $\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$ denote the path of the object. The work done by the force field along this path can be expressed as:

$$
W = \int \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) \, dt
$$

Here, the symbol $\cdot$ denotes the dot product, and $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ is the derivative of $\mathbf{r}(t)$ with respect to the parameter $t$.

If the force field is conservative, it can be expressed as the negative gradient of a scalar potential function, that is, $\mathbf{F} = -\nabla \phi$. In such cases, the work done by the force field along any closed path is zero. Moreover, the work done along any path depends solely on the endpoints of that path.

In summary, to evaluate the work done by a force field, we integrate the dot product of the force and displacement vectors over the object's path. When the force field is conservative, it can be represented as the gradient of a scalar potential function, leading to the conclusion that the work done along any closed path is zero.
