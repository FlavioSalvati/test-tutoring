**Mutually Exclusive Events**

Mutually exclusive events are defined as events that cannot occur simultaneously. In other words, when two events are mutually exclusive, the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the other.

For instance, consider the scenario of tossing a coin. The event of landing on heads and the event of landing on tails are mutually exclusive; it is impossible to achieve both outcomes at the same time. Similarly, if we roll a die, the event of rolling a $1$ and the event of rolling a $2$ are also mutually exclusive events.

Mathematically, we can express mutually exclusive events using the following formula:

$$
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

In this equation, $P(A \text{ or } B)$ represents the probability of either event $A$ or event $B$ occurring, $P(A)$ denotes the probability of event $A$ occurring, and $P(B)$ signifies the probability of event $B$ occurring.

To illustrate this with an example, consider rolling a die. The probability of rolling a $1$ or a $2$ can be calculated as follows:

$$
P(1 \text{ or } 2) = P(1) + P(2) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

It is important to note that this formula is applicable only to mutually exclusive events. If the events in question are not mutually exclusive, a different formula must be employed to accurately calculate their probabilities.
