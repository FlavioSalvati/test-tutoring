The Laplace distribution, also referred to as the double exponential distribution, is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its symmetry around the mean. It is particularly useful for modeling the difference between two independent exponential random variables.

The probability density function (PDF) of the Laplace distribution is defined as follows:

$$
f(x; \mu, b) = \frac{1}{2b} \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{b}\right)
$$

In this expression, $\mu$ represents the location parameter, while $b$ denotes the scale parameter. Notably, both the mean and variance of the Laplace distribution equal $\mu$. One of the distinctive features of this distribution is its heavy tails, which indicates a higher likelihood of extreme values compared to a normal distribution.

The Laplace distribution finds applications in various fields. In image processing and computer vision, it is employed to model noise in images. Additionally, in finance, it is utilized to describe the distribution of stock returns, effectively capturing the fat tails and skewness commonly observed in financial data.

In summary, the Laplace distribution is a versatile probability distribution used to model the difference between two independent exponential random variables. Its symmetry around the mean, heavy tails, and applicability across diverse fields such as statistics, image processing, and finance make it an important tool for researchers and practitioners alike.
