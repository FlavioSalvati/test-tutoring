To conduct a t-test, you should first establish the null and alternative hypotheses. Next, calculate the t-value and compare it to the critical value.

A t-test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. Before conducting a t-test, it is crucial to formulate the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis posits that there is no significant difference between the means of the two groups, while the alternative hypothesis asserts that a significant difference does exist.

To calculate the t-value, begin by determining the difference between the means of the two groups. Next, compute the standard error of this difference using the following formula:

$$
SE = \sqrt{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}\right) + \left(\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)}
$$

Here, $s_1$ and $s_2$ represent the standard deviations of the two groups, while $n_1$ and $n_2$ denote the sample sizes of the respective groups.

Once you have calculated the standard error, you can find the t-value using the following formula:

$$
t = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{SE}
$$

In this equation, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the means of the two groups.

Finally, compare the calculated t-value to the critical value. The critical value can be obtained from a t-distribution table, with the degrees of freedom calculated as the sum of the sample sizes minus two ($n_1 + n_2 - 2$). If the t-value exceeds the critical value, you can reject the null hypothesis, leading to the conclusion that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.
