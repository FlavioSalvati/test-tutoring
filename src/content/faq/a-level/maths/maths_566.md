Power is defined as the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred over a specified duration. It quantifies how quickly work is accomplished or energy is conveyed, and is mathematically expressed as:

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work done}}{\text{Time taken}}
$$

or 

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Energy transferred}}{\text{Time taken}}
$$

The standard unit of power is the watt (W), which is defined as one joule per second (J/s). This indicates that a power level of one watt corresponds to performing one joule of work in one second.

The relationship between power, work, and time can be derived from the work formula:

$$
\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}
$$

If a force $F$ is exerted over a distance $d$, the work done can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Work} = F \times d
$$

When this work is accomplished in a time period $t$, power can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{F \times d}{t}
$$

This equation illustrates that power is directly proportional to both the force applied and the distance over which it is applied, while being inversely proportional to the time taken to perform the work.

In summary, power represents the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred per unit of time. It is directly related to the force exerted and the distance covered, and inversely related to the duration of the work done.
