To determine the maximum flow in a bipartite network, we can utilize the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is an iterative procedure that identifies the maximum flow in a network by continuously locating augmenting paths and increasing the flow along these paths. In the specific case of a bipartite network, the process can be simplified due to the fact that flow is directed exclusively from one partition to the other.

To implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in a bipartite network, we must first represent the network as a flow network. This is achieved by introducing a source node that connects to all nodes within one partition, and a sink node that connects to all nodes in the opposite partition. Each edge in this network is assigned a capacity of $1$, indicating that only one unit of flow can traverse each edge.

Following this setup, we apply the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to ascertain the maximum flow in the network. We initiate the process with an initial flow of $0$ and then repeatedly search for an augmenting path from the source to the sink. This search can be performed using either a depth-first search or a breadth-first search. Upon locating an augmenting path, we increase the flow along that path by $1$ and subsequently update the residual capacities of the edges involved.

This iterative process continues until we can no longer identify any augmenting paths. At this point, we have successfully determined the maximum flow within the network. The time complexity of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is $O(Ef)$, where $E$ represents the number of edges in the network and $f$ denotes the maximum flow.

In summary, to find the maximum flow in a bipartite network, we implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm by representing the network as a flow network and identifying augmenting paths from the source to the sink.
