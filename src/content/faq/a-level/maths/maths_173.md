To determine the angle in polar coordinates, we use the formula 

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right).
$$

In polar coordinates, a point is described by its distance from the origin, denoted as $r$, and the angle $\theta$ that it forms with the positive $x$-axis. To calculate the angle $\theta$, we utilize the formula 

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right),
$$ 

where $y$ represents the vertical distance from the origin and $x$ signifies the horizontal distance from the origin.

For instance, consider the point $(3, 4)$ in Cartesian coordinates. To find the angle $\theta$, we first identify the values of $x$ and $y$. Here, we have $x = 3$ and $y = 4$. We can then apply the formula to compute the angle:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 0.93 \text{ radians}.
$$

Thus, for the point $(3, 4)$ in polar coordinates, the angle $\theta$ is approximately $0.93$ radians.

It is also noteworthy that the angle $\theta$ can be converted from radians to degrees using the formula 

$$
\theta \text{ (in degrees)} = \theta \text{ (in radians)} \times \frac{180}{\pi}.
$$ 

For the example above, the angle $\theta$ in degrees would be approximately 

$$
53.13^\circ.
