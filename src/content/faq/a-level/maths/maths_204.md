The inequality 

$$
|10x - 2| > 0
$$ 

holds true for all real values of $x$.

To solve this inequality, we must first understand the implications of an absolute value being greater than zero. The absolute value of a number is always non-negative. Specifically, it equals the number itself when the number is positive and equals the negative of the number when it is negative. Consequently, the expression 

$$
|10x - 2| > 0
$$ 

indicates that the absolute value of $10x - 2$ is strictly greater than zero, which is valid for any real value of $x$.

To clarify this, let us examine two scenarios: when $10x - 2$ is positive and when it is negative. 

1. If $10x - 2$ is positive, then its absolute value equals itself, meaning 

$$
|10x - 2| = 10x - 2 > 0.
$$ 

2. If $10x - 2$ is negative, then its absolute value equals the negative of itself, which can be expressed as 

$$
|10x - 2| = -(10x - 2) = 2 - 10x > 0.
$$ 

In both cases, the absolute value is indeed greater than zero for any real number $x$. 

In conclusion, the solution to the inequality 

$$
|10x - 2| > 0
$$ 

is the set of all real numbers. This indicates that the inequality is universally valid, irrespective of the specific value of $x$.
