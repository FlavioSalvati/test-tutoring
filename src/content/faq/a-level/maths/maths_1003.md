Regression within a mathematical framework is a technique employed to identify the relationship between two or more variables.

Regression analysis is a statistical method that aims to ascertain the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. This technique is frequently utilized in fields such as finance, economics, and social sciences to forecast future outcomes based on historical data. The fundamental concept of regression analysis is to determine a line or curve that best fits the given data points; this is referred to as the regression line or curve.

There are two primary types of regression analysis: simple regression and multiple regression. 

- **Simple Regression**: This type involves a single independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation representing a simple regression line is given by:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

In this equation, $y$ represents the dependent variable, $x$ denotes the independent variable, $m$ is the slope of the line, and $b$ is the y-intercept.

- **Multiple Regression**: This type encompasses two or more independent variables and one dependent variable. The equation for a multiple regression line can be expressed as:

$$
y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n
$$

Here, $y$ is the dependent variable, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the independent variables, and $b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ are the coefficients associated with each independent variable.

Regression analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to predict future outcomes based on past data. For instance, if we have data illustrating the relationship between a person's age and their income, we can apply regression analysis to estimate an individual's earnings at a specific age. However, it is essential to recognize that regression analysis is not infallible and should be applied with caution, as predictions can sometimes be inaccurate.
