The principle of virtual work is a key concept in mechanics that helps in analyzing the equilibrium conditions of a system. It asserts that the work done by internal forces within a system is zero. Consequently, for a system to be in equilibrium, the net work done by external forces must also equal zero. This principle is grounded in the understanding that if a system is in equilibrium, any small virtual displacement will not disrupt its state of balance.

The principle of virtual work is applicable in both statics and dynamics. In statics, it aids in determining the forces acting on a structure that is in equilibrium. In dynamics, it helps in analyzing the motion of a system influenced by external forces.

To apply the principle of virtual work, we consider a small virtual displacement of the system and compute the work done by the external forces during this displacement. We then equate this work to zero, reflecting the equilibrium condition of the system. This approach enables us to solve for unknown forces or the motion of the system.

In summary, the principle of virtual work is a powerful analytical tool in mechanics, enabling us to ascertain the equilibrium conditions of a system and effectively tackle problems in both statics and dynamics.
