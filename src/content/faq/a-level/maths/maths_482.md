The double angle formula for hyperbolic functions is expressed as follows:

$$
\cosh(2x) = \cosh^2(x) + \sinh^2(x)
$$

This formula establishes a relationship between the hyperbolic cosine of double an angle and the squares of the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine of the original angle.

To derive this formula, we begin with the fundamental identity:

$$
\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = 1
$$

From this identity, we can rearrange it to obtain:

$$
\cosh^2(x) = 1 + \sinh^2(x)
$$

Next, we examine the hyperbolic cosine of double an angle, which is given by:

$$
\cosh(2x) = \cosh(x + x)
$$

Applying the sum identity for hyperbolic functions, we find:

$$
\cosh(2x) = \cosh(x) \cosh(x) + \sinh(x) \sinh(x)
$$

By substituting $\cosh^2(x)$ for $1 + \sinh^2(x)$ in our equation, we arrive at the double angle formula:

$$
\cosh(2x) = \cosh^2(x) + \sinh^2(x)
$$

This formula is particularly useful for simplifying expressions that involve hyperbolic functions or for solving hyperbolic equations. For instance, if we encounter an equation that includes $\cosh(2x)$, we can apply the double angle formula to express it in terms of $\cosh(x)$ and $\sinh(x)$, which may facilitate a more straightforward solution.
