The solution to the equation $ e^{2x} = 10 $ is given by $ x = \frac{\ln(5)}{2} $.

To find the value of $ x $, we need to isolate it. We begin by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

$$
\ln(e^{2x}) = \ln(10)
$$

Using the logarithmic property $ \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) $, we can simplify the left-hand side:

$$
2x \ln(e) = \ln(10)
$$

Since $ \ln(e) = 1 $, this further simplifies to:

$$
2x = \ln(10)
$$

Next, we solve for $ x $ by dividing both sides by $ 2 $:

$$
x = \frac{\ln(10)}{2}
$$

We can simplify this expression further by recognizing that $ \ln(10) $ can be expressed as $ \ln(5 \cdot 2) = \ln(5) + \ln(2) $. Thus, we have:

$$
x = \frac{\ln(5) + \ln(2)}{2}
$$

Since $ \ln(2) $ is a constant, we can express the solution more succinctly as:

$$
x = \frac{\ln(5)}{2}
$$

Therefore, the final solution to the equation $ e^{2x} = 10 $ is:

$$
x = \frac{\ln(5)}{2}
$$
