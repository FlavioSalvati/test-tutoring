The identity for hyperbolic functions is given by 

$$
\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = 1.
$$

Hyperbolic functions serve as an analogy to trigonometric functions and are defined using the exponential function $e^x$ and its inverse, $\ln(x)$. The two primary hyperbolic functions are the hyperbolic sine, denoted as $\sinh(x)$, and the hyperbolic cosine, denoted as $\cosh(x)$.

The identity 

$$
\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = 1
$$ 

is reminiscent of the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions, which states 

$$
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1.
$$ 

To prove the hyperbolic identity, we start with the definitions of $\cosh(x)$ and $\sinh(x)$:

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
$$

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}.
$$

Substituting these definitions into the left-hand side of our identity yields:

$$
\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = \left(\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}\right)^2.
$$

Next, we expand the squares and simplify:

$$
\begin{align*}
\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) & = \frac{(e^x + e^{-x})^2}{4} - \frac{(e^x - e^{-x})^2}{4} \\
& = \frac{e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x}}{4} - \frac{e^{2x} - 2 + e^{-2x}}{4} \\
& = \frac{4}{4} \\
& = 1.
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, we conclude that the identity 

$$
\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = 1 
$$ 

holds true for all values of $x$. This identity is valuable for simplifying expressions that involve hyperbolic functions and has practical applications in fields such as physics and engineering.
