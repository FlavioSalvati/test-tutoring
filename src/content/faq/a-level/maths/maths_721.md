Newton's third law of motion describes a fundamental principle regarding forces: for every action, there exists an equal and opposite reaction. This means that when one object applies a force on another, the second object simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction back on the first object. These forces are referred to as the action and reaction forces.

Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$
F_{\text{action}} = -F_{\text{reaction}}
$$

Here, $F$ denotes the force exerted by each object. For instance, if object A applies a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ on object B, then object B will respond with a force of $-10 \, \text{N}$ directed back towards object A.

It is crucial to understand that the action and reaction forces act on different objects. In our previous example, the force exerted by object A on object B is the action force, while the force exerted by object B on object A is the reaction force. Because these forces act on separate objects, they do not cancel each other out.

Grasping the implications of Newton's third law is essential across various fields of physics, including mechanics and electromagnetism. This principle enables us to analyze the forces at play in different scenarios and to accurately predict the motion of objects.
