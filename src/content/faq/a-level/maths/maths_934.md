A box plot, also referred to as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation that illustrates the distribution of a dataset. It effectively summarizes key statistical measures such as the median, quartiles, and outliers.

In a box plot:
- The central box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data. 
- The bottom of the box corresponds to the first quartile, denoted as $Q_1$, while the top of the box corresponds to the third quartile, denoted as $Q_3$.
- A line within the box indicates the median of the dataset.

The "whiskers" extend from the edges of the box to the minimum and maximum values that are not classified as outliers. Outliers are represented as individual points that lie beyond the whiskers.

To interpret a box plot, start by examining the median to understand the central tendency of the data. Next, assess the length of the box; a longer box signifies a greater spread in the middle 50% of the data. The whiskers illustrate the overall range of the data, though the presence of outliers can influence this interpretation. Outliers are identified as points that fall outside the whiskers.

For instance, consider the box plot displayed below:

In this example, the median is approximately $7.5$, indicating that half of the data values lie below $7.5$ and the other half above. The box spans from approximately $5$ to $10$, indicating that the middle 50% of the data falls within this range. The whiskers extend to about $2$ and $15$, although there are outliers at approximately $1$ and $20$. This suggests that the dataset is skewed towards the lower end, with a few extreme values affecting the overall distribution.
