A rational function is defined as a function that can be represented as the ratio of two polynomial functions.

Specifically, a rational function takes the form 

$$
f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
$$

where \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomial functions, and it is essential that \( q(x) \neq 0 \). The domain of a rational function encompasses all real numbers except for the values of \( x \) that make the denominator \( q(x) \) equal to zero. These values correspond to the vertical asymptotes of the function. The range of a rational function is influenced by the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials, as well as the leading coefficients of these polynomials.

To simplify a rational function, we can factor both the numerator and the denominator, allowing us to cancel any common factors. Additionally, long division can be employed to divide the numerator by the denominator, enabling us to express the function as a polynomial plus a proper fraction. This method is particularly useful for identifying horizontal asymptotes and understanding the end behavior of the function.

Rational functions can exhibit various types of asymptotes, including vertical, horizontal, and slant asymptotes. Vertical asymptotes arise when the denominator equals zero, causing the function to approach positive or negative infinity as \( x \) approaches the value that nullifies the denominator. Horizontal asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator, leading the function to approach a constant value as \( x \) moves toward positive or negative infinity. Slant (or oblique) asymptotes appear when the degree of the numerator is one greater than that of the denominator, resulting in the function approaching a linear function as \( x \) approaches positive or negative infinity.

Rational functions have a wide range of applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics. They can effectively model scenarios including population growth, chemical reactions, and financial investments.
