To find the quadratic equation with roots $\frac{1}{2}$ and $-1$, we can utilize the property that a quadratic equation with roots $r$ and $s$ can be expressed in the form:

$$(x - r)(x - s) = 0.$$

For the given roots $\frac{1}{2}$ and $-1$, we can write the equation as:

$$(x - \frac{1}{2})(x + 1) = 0.$$

Next, we will expand this expression. 

Starting with the multiplication:

$$
(x - \frac{1}{2})(x + 1) = x^2 + x - \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Now, combining like terms results in:

$$
x^2 + \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)x - \frac{1}{2} = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{2} = 0.
$$

Thus, the quadratic equation can be simplified to:

$$
x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{2} = 0.
$$

To express this equation in standard form with integer coefficients, we can multiply the entire equation by $2$ to eliminate the fractions:

$$
2x^2 - x - 1 = 0.
$$

Therefore, the coefficients of the quadratic equation with roots $\frac{1}{2}$ and $-1$ are $2$, $-1$, and $-1$.
