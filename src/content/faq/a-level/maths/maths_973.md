Here is the enhanced content for clarity and readability:

The integral of the function $(1+x)^3$ is given by:

$$
\int (1+x)^3 \, dx = \frac{1}{4}(1+x)^4 + C,
$$

where $C$ represents the constant of integration.

To compute the integral of $(1+x)^3$, we can apply the power rule for integration. This rule states that the integral of $x^n$ is:

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C,
$$

where $C$ is again the constant of integration. By applying this rule to $(1+x)^3$, we obtain:

$$
\int (1+x)^3 \, dx = \frac{1}{4}(1+x)^4 + C.
$$

To verify our result, we can differentiate our answer using the power rule for differentiation, which states that the derivative of $x^n$ is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}.
$$

Applying this differentiation rule to the expression $\frac{1}{4}(1+x)^4$, we find:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left[\frac{1}{4}(1+x)^4\right] = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 4(1+x)^3 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(1+x) = (1+x)^3.
$$

Since the derivative matches the original integrand, we can confidently conclude that our integration result is correct.

In general, when integrating polynomial functions, we utilize the power rule for integration to determine the antiderivative. This process involves increasing the exponent of $x$ by $1$, dividing by the new exponent, and adding the constant of integration. For instance:

- The integral of $x^2$ is 

$$
\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C.
$$

- The integral of the polynomial $2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 3$ is 

$$
\int (2x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 3) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} x^4 - \frac{5}{3} x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + C.
$$

This method allows us to systematically find the antiderivatives of polynomial expressions.
