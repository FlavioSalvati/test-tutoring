The Ford-Bellman algorithm, commonly referred to as the Bellman-Ford algorithm, is utilized to determine the shortest path between two nodes within a network.

The algorithm begins by initializing the distance from the starting node to all other nodes as infinity, with the exception of the starting node itself, which is assigned a distance of $0$. Next, for each node, the algorithm evaluates all of its neighboring nodes, updating their distances if a shorter path is discovered. This process continues iteratively until no further updates can be made.

The implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Initialize the distance from the starting node to all other nodes as infinity, while setting the distance for the starting node itself to $0$.
2. For each node, examine all neighboring nodes and update their distances if a shorter path is found. This can be expressed using the following formula:

$$
\text{distance to neighbor} = \text{distance to current node} + \text{weight of edge between current node and neighbor}
$$

3. Repeat step 2 for all nodes in the network until no additional updates are possible.
4. To find the shortest path from the starting node to any other node, trace back from the destination node to the starting node using the previously stored information about predecessor nodes.

The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is $O(|V||E|)$, where $|V|$ denotes the number of nodes and $|E|$ represents the number of edges in the network. While this makes the Bellman-Ford algorithm less efficient compared to other algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, it possesses the advantage of being able to handle graphs with negative edge weights.
