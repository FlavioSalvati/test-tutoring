To solve the equation $ 2^x = 16 $, we find that $ x = 4 $.

To arrive at this solution, we will utilize logarithms. Specifically, we will take the logarithm of both sides of the equation with base $ 2 $, since $ 2 $ is the base of the exponent on the left side. This gives us the equation:

$$
\log_2(2^x) = \log_2(16).
$$

By applying the logarithmic property that states $ \log_a(b^c) = c \cdot \log_a(b) $, we can simplify the left side of the equation:

$$
x \cdot \log_2(2) = \log_2(16).
$$

Since $ \log_2(2) = 1 $, we can further simplify this to:

$$
x = \log_2(16).
$$

Next, we need to evaluate $ \log_2(16) $. This involves determining the exponent to which we must raise $ 2 $ in order to obtain $ 16 $. We can find this by successively dividing $ 16 $ by $ 2 $ until we reach $ 1 $:

$$
16 \div 2 = 8 \\
8 \div 2 = 4 \\
4 \div 2 = 2 \\
2 \div 2 = 1.
$$

We divided $ 4 $ times, indicating that the required exponent is $ 4 $. Thus, we conclude that the solution to the equation $ 2^x = 16 $ is $ x = 4 $.
