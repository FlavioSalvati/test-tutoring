To effectively represent data using a line graph, begin by selecting the appropriate axes and scale. Afterward, plot the data points and connect them with straight lines.

Line graphs are particularly useful for displaying data that changes over time or under varying conditions. To create a line graph, follow these steps:

1. **Select the Axes and Scale**: Typically, the horizontal axis (the x-axis) represents time or another independent variable, while the vertical axis (the y-axis) represents the dependent variable being measured. Choose a scale that allows the data to be presented clearly without overcrowding the graph.

2. **Plot the Data Points**: Place each data point on the graph to represent a specific value of the dependent variable at a given time or under particular conditions. Use a distinct symbol, such as a dot or a cross, to mark each data point.

3. **Connect the Data Points**: Draw straight lines to connect the plotted data points. Aim for smooth lines to illustrate the trend within the data. If there are gaps due to missing values, break the lines to indicate these discontinuities.

Line graphs serve as valuable tools for analyzing trends in data, such as increases or decreases over time, and for comparing different datasets. They are also effective in identifying outliers or anomalies. When interpreting a line graph, it is crucial to consider the axes and scale used, as well as any discernible patterns or trends in the data.
