To solve the equation $\ln(x) = 2$, we first need to clarify the concept of the natural logarithm. The natural logarithm, denoted as $\ln(x)$, is the inverse function of the exponential function $e^x$. This means that when we take the natural logarithm of a number $x$, we obtain the exponent to which the base $e$ must be raised to yield $x$.

Thus, the equation $\ln(x) = 2$ implies that $x$ can be expressed as:

$$
x = e^2.
$$

To verify our solution, we can exponentiate both sides of the original equation:

$$
e^{\ln(x)} = e^2.
$$

Since the expression $e^{\ln(x)}$ simplifies to $x$, we confirm that:

$$
x = e^2
$$

is indeed our solution.

It is essential to remember that the natural logarithm is defined only for positive values of $x$. Therefore, our solution $x = e^2$ is valid as long as $x > 0$.

In summary, to solve the equation $\ln(x) = 2$, we exponentiate both sides to arrive at the solution:

$$
x = e^2,
$$

which is valid for $x > 0$.
