Tarjan's algorithm is an efficient method for identifying strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph.

This algorithm employs a depth-first search (DFS) strategy, assigning a unique identifier to each node in the graph. It utilizes these identifiers to detect strongly connected components. A strongly connected component is defined as a subset of nodes in which every node can be reached from every other node within that subset.

The algorithm functions by maintaining a stack of nodes that have been visited but are not yet categorized into a strongly connected component. As it explores each node, it assigns it a unique number and adds it to the stack. Additionally, the algorithm keeps track of the lowest numbered node that can be accessed from the current node, known as the "low-link" value.

Once the algorithm has finished exploring all the nodes within a strongly connected component, it removes them from the stack and assigns them a common component identifier. This process involves labeling each node in that component with the same identifier.

The algorithm continues this process until all nodes in the graph have been assigned to a strongly connected component. The final output is a list of strongly connected components, with each component represented as a collection of its constituent nodes.

In summary, Tarjan's algorithm provides an efficient means of finding strongly connected components in directed graphs, operating with a time complexity of $O(V + E)$, where $V$ represents the number of nodes and $E$ the number of edges in the graph.
