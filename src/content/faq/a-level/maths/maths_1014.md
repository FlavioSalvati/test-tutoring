The amplitude of oscillation refers to the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position of an object in motion.

In the context of simple harmonic motion, an object oscillates back and forth around its equilibrium position. The amplitude, denoted by the symbol $A$, represents the furthest distance the object moves from this equilibrium point and is measured in meters (m) or any other unit of length.

The amplitude of oscillation is directly related to the energy of the system. A larger amplitude indicates a greater amount of energy, as the potential energy of the system is proportional to the square of the amplitude. This relationship underscores the importance of amplitude in determining the energy dynamics of oscillatory systems.

To calculate the amplitude of oscillation, you can use the formula:

$$
A = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{eq}}
$$

where $x_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position and $x_{\text{eq}}$ is the position of equilibrium. For instance, if a mass attached to a spring oscillates between $-5 \, \text{cm}$ and $5 \, \text{cm}$ around its equilibrium position, the amplitude can be calculated as follows:

$$
A = 5 \, \text{cm} - (-5 \, \text{cm}) = 10 \, \text{cm}.
$$

In summary, the amplitude of oscillation is the maximum distance from the equilibrium position and is crucially linked to the energy of the system. It can be determined using the equation $A = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{eq}}$.
