The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that effectively models the time intervals between events occurring in a Poisson process.

This distribution is particularly useful for representing scenarios where events happen randomly and independently at a constant average rate. Common applications include modeling the time between customer arrivals at a store or the intervals between radioactive decay events.

The probability density function (PDF) of the exponential distribution is expressed as:

$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}
$$

In this expression, $\lambda$ is the rate parameter, which indicates the average number of events occurring per unit time, and $x$ represents the time between consecutive events.

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}
$$

This function provides the probability that the time between events is less than or equal to $x$.

The mean and variance of the exponential distribution are calculated as follows:

$$
E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda}
$$

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}
$$

One of the notable characteristics of the exponential distribution is its memoryless property. This means that the probability of an event occurring in the next time interval is independent of the amount of time that has already passed. This unique property makes the exponential distribution particularly valuable in fields like reliability analysis and queueing theory.
