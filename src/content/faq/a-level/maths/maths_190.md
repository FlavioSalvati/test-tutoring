Newton's first law of motion asserts that an object will remain at rest or continue to move in a straight line at a constant velocity unless it is acted upon by an external force. 

This principle is commonly referred to as the law of inertia. Inertia is the inherent property of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. Specifically, an object that is at rest will remain stationary, while an object that is in motion will maintain its velocity and direction unless influenced by an external force.

Mathematically, Newton's first law can be encapsulated by the equation:

$$
F = ma
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the net force acting on an object, $m$ denotes the mass of the object, and $a$ indicates the acceleration. If the net force $F$ is equal to zero, the acceleration $a$ will also be zero, implying that the object will either remain at rest or continue in uniform motion along a straight path.

The implications of this law are significant in various real-world applications. For instance, it plays a crucial role in the design of safety features such as seat belts and airbags in vehicles. During a car crash, passengers tend to continue moving forward at the same speed as the vehicle prior to the impact. The seat belt and airbag serve as external forces that decelerate the passengers, thereby minimizing the risk of injury.

In summary, Newton's first law of motion is a fundamental principle in physics that elucidates the behavior of objects, whether they are stationary or in motion. Understanding this law is essential for comprehending how objects interact in our everyday environment.
