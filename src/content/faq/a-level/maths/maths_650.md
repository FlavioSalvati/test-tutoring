Incomplete information games are a type of game where players lack complete knowledge about the game's structure and elements.

In the realm of game theory, incomplete information games occur when players do not have full visibility into aspects such as strategies, payoffs, or even the total number of participants in the game. These games are particularly useful for modeling scenarios where players possess private information that influences their decision-making processes. A common example is a poker game, where each player holds private information about their own cards, which significantly impacts their strategic choices.

One effective way to model incomplete information games is through Bayesian games. In a Bayesian game, each player is assigned a "type" that encapsulates their private information. This type not only determines the player's potential payoffs but also establishes a probability distribution over the types of other players. As a result, players select their strategies based on their beliefs regarding the types held by their opponents.

The complexity of solving incomplete information games often exceeds that of complete information games, as players must consider the possibility that others may possess private information. A common method for addressing Bayesian games is the concept of a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. This equilibrium represents a set of strategies wherein no player can enhance their payoff by unilaterally altering their strategy, provided they maintain their beliefs about the types of the other players.

In conclusion, incomplete information games are a vital aspect of game theory, enabling the representation of scenarios where players have private information. Tools such as Bayesian games and Bayesian Nash equilibria are instrumental in analyzing and understanding these types of games.
