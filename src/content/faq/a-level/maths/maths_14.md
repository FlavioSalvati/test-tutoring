The Factor Theorem states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ has a factor of the form $(x - a)$, then it follows that $f(a) = 0$. This result means that $a$ is a root of the polynomial.

The Factor Theorem is a valuable tool in the algebraic manipulation of polynomials. It helps us ascertain whether a specific value is a root of the polynomial, and it also facilitates the factorization of polynomials.

To apply the Factor Theorem, we first need to identify a potential factor of the polynomial. For instance, consider the polynomial 

$$f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6.$$

We might suspect that $(x - 1)$ is a factor. To verify this, we evaluate $f(1)$:

$$f(1) = 1^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 0.$$

Since $f(1) = 0$, we conclude that $(x - 1)$ is indeed a factor of $f(x)$. We can then use polynomial division or synthetic division to find the remaining factors of $f(x)$. In this instance, we find that:

$$f(x) = (x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3).$$

Consequently, the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ are $x = 1$, $x = 2$, and $x = 3$.

In summary, the Factor Theorem is a powerful method for factorizing polynomials and determining their roots. By identifying potential factors and evaluating the polynomial at those values, we can efficiently establish whether a specific value is a root and proceed to factor the polynomial accordingly.
