The Nash bargaining solution is a fundamental concept in cooperative game theory, designed to identify a fair distribution of total payoffs among players.

In cooperative games, players collaborate to achieve a common objective and subsequently share the resultant payoff. The Nash bargaining solution provides a framework for determining how this payoff should be allocated in a manner that is perceived as equitable. The underlying principle is that each player should receive a portion of the payoff that corresponds to their bargaining power.

To compute the Nash bargaining solution, we must first establish the bargaining power of each player. This is typically achieved by assigning weights to each player, which reflect their outside optionsâ€”the payoffs they could secure if they chose to negotiate independently. These weights are generally represented as a vector $\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of players.

Once we have defined the weights, the Nash bargaining solution can be calculated by identifying the point within the feasible set that maximizes the product of the players' deviations from their respective outside options. This can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\max (x_1 - w_1)(x_2 - w_2) \cdots (x_n - w_n)
$$

subject to 

$$
x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n = v
$$

In this formulation, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ represent the payoffs allocated to each player, and $v$ signifies the total payoff available for distribution.

The outcome of this optimization problem is known as the Nash bargaining solution, which embodies a fair allocation of the total payoff among the players involved. The concept is named after John Nash, who introduced it in his groundbreaking paper on bargaining theory.
