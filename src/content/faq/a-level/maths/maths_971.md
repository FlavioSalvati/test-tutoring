To conduct an F-test, you need to calculate the ratio of two variances and compare it to a critical value.

An F-test is a statistical method used to compare the variances of two populations. It is frequently employed in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two or more groups. The F-test is founded on the ratio of two variances, which is determined by dividing the larger variance by the smaller variance.

To perform an F-test, you must first calculate the sample variances of the two populations you wish to compare. Suppose you have two samples, $ A $ and $ B $, with sizes $ n_A $ and $ n_B $, and their respective sample variances $ s_A^2 $ and $ s_B^2 $. The F-statistic is then calculated using the formula:

$$
F = \frac{s_A^2}{s_B^2}
$$

If the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the variances are equal), the F-statistic will follow an F-distribution with degrees of freedom (df) corresponding to $ (n_A - 1) $ and $ (n_B - 1) $. You can refer to an F-distribution table or use a calculator to find the critical value of $ F $ for a specified significance level and the calculated degrees of freedom.

If the computed F-statistic exceeds the critical value, you can reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the variances are significantly different. Conversely, if the computed F-statistic is less than or equal to the critical value, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating insufficient evidence to suggest a significant difference in variances.

It is essential to remember that the F-test assumes that the populations are normally distributed and have equal variances. If these assumptions are violated, alternative tests, such as Welch's t-test or the Brown-Forsythe test, may be more suitable.
