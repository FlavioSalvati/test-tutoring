To calculate the cosecant of a complex number, we start by finding the sine of that complex number. The cosecant of a complex number is defined as the reciprocal of its sine. Thus, to determine the cosecant, we must first compute the sine.

Let $ z = x + yi $, where $ x $ and $ y $ are real numbers. The sine of $ z $ is expressed as:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}
$$

In this formula, $ e $ represents the base of the natural logarithm, and $ i $ denotes the imaginary unit.

Once we have calculated $ \sin(z) $, we can find the cosecant of $ z $ using the formula:

$$
\csc(z) = \frac{1}{\sin(z)}
$$

Therefore, to compute the cosecant of a complex number, we need to substitute the value of $ z $ into the sine formula, simplify the resulting expression, and finally take the reciprocal.

For instance, consider the complex number $ z = 2 + 3i $. We first calculate $ \sin(z) $:

$$
\sin(z) = \frac{e^{i(2 + 3i)} - e^{-i(2 + 3i)}}{2i}
$$

This can be simplified as follows:

$$
= \frac{e^{-3 + 2i} - e^{3 - 2i}}{2i}
$$

Calculating $ e^{-3 + 2i} $ and $ e^{3 - 2i} $:

$$
e^{-3 + 2i} = e^{-3}(\cos(2) + i\sin(2)) \quad \text{and} \quad e^{3 - 2i} = e^{3}(\cos(-2) + i\sin(-2))
$$

After evaluating these expressions, we find:

$$
\sin(z) \approx -2.317 - 9.154i
$$

Consequently, the cosecant of $ z $ is computed as follows:

$$
\csc(z) = \frac{1}{\sin(z)} \approx -0.105 + 0.041i
$$

In summary, to find the cosecant of a complex number, we first determine its sine and then take the reciprocal of that result.
