Polynomial division refers to the method of dividing one polynomial by another polynomial. This process is akin to long division, but instead of working with numbers, we work with polynomials. The primary objective is to determine both the quotient and the remainder of the division.

To perform polynomial division, we begin by arranging the dividend (the polynomial being divided) and the divisor (the polynomial we are dividing by) in descending order based on the degree of their terms. Next, we divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor to obtain the first term of the quotient. We then multiply the entire divisor by this term and subtract the resulting polynomial from the dividend. This subtraction produces a new polynomial, and we repeat the division process with this new polynomial until there are no terms left to divide.

As an illustrative example, letâ€™s divide the polynomial $x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 4$ by the polynomial $x - 2$. We start by writing the dividend and divisor in descending order of degree:

$$
\frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 4}{x - 2}
$$

We then divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x} = x
$$

This calculation gives us the first term of the quotient. We then multiply the entire divisor by this term:

$$(x - 2) \cdot x = x^2 - 2x$$

Next, we subtract this result from the original dividend:

$$
(x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 4) - (x^2 - 2x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 4 - x^2 + 2x = x^3 + x^2 - x - 4
$$

Now, we repeat the process with the new polynomial $x^3 + x^2 - x - 4$:

$$
\frac{x^3 + x^2 - x - 4}{x - 2}
$$

Again, we divide the leading term of the new dividend by the leading term of the divisor:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x} = x
$$

We multiply the entire divisor by this new term:

$$(x - 2) \cdot x = x^2 - 2x$$

Now we subtract this from our new dividend:

$$
(x^3 + x^2 - x - 4) - (x^2 - 2x) = x^3 + x^2 - x - 4 - x^2 + 2x = x^3 + x - 4
$$

We continue this process until there are no more terms left to divide, ensuring we systematically find both the quotient and the remainder for the division of polynomials.
