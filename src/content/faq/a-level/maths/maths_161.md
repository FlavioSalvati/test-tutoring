To find the integral of $\cot(x)$ with respect to $x$, we start with the expression:

$$\int \cot(x) \, dx = \ln|\sin(x)| + C,$$

where $C$ is the constant of integration.

To evaluate this integral, we can use the substitution $u = \sin(x)$. Consequently, the derivative of $u$ gives us $du = \cos(x) \, dx$. This allows us to express $\cot(x)$ in terms of $u$:

$$\cot(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)} = \frac{du}{u}.$$

Now substituting these into the integral, we get:

$$\int \cot(x) \, dx = \int \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)} \, dx = \int \frac{du}{u}.$$

The integral of $\frac{1}{u}$ is:

$$\int \frac{du}{u} = \ln|u| + C.$$

Substituting back for $u$, we have:

$$\ln|u| + C = \ln|\sin(x)| + C.$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$\int \cot(x) \, dx = \ln|\sin(x)| + C.$$

It is important to note that this integral is undefined at points where $x = k\pi$, with $k$ being any integer, since $\cot(x)$ is undefined at these values.
