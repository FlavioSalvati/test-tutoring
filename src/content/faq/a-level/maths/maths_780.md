Repeated games in game theory describe scenarios in which the same game is played multiple times.

In a one-shot game, players make their decisions without considering any future consequences. In contrast, repeated games allow players to draw on their past experiences to inform their current choices, which can lead to different outcomes and strategies.

One key approach to analyzing repeated games is through the concept of a Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium is defined as a set of strategies in which no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. Specifically, in a repeated game, a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) refers to a strategy profile that constitutes a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the repeated game.

Another crucial concept in repeated games is the idea of cooperation and punishment. In a one-shot game, cooperation may not be rational since there is little incentive to trust the other player. However, in a repeated game, players can utilize the threat of punishment to foster cooperation. This dynamic can give rise to cooperative strategies such as tit-for-tat, where a player begins by cooperating and subsequently mimics the other player's previous move.

In summary, repeated games offer a more comprehensive framework for analyzing strategic interactions among players. They facilitate the development of new strategies and the potential for cooperation and punishment.
