To compute the cotangent of a complex number, you can use the formula:

$$
\cot(z) = \frac{\cos(z)}{\sin(z)}.
$$

To apply this formula, you first need to determine the cosine and sine of the complex number. Let's take the example of finding the cotangent for \( z = 2 + 3i \).

First, we calculate the cosine:

$$
\cos(z) = \cos(2 + 3i) = \cos(2) \cosh(3) - \sin(2) \sinh(3) \approx -3.724.
$$

Next, we calculate the sine:

$$
\sin(z) = \sin(2 + 3i) = \sin(2) \cosh(3) + \cos(2) \sinh(3) \approx 1.249.
$$

Now that we have both values, we can substitute them into the cotangent formula:

$$
\cot(z) = \frac{\cos(z)}{\sin(z)} \approx \frac{-3.724}{1.249} \approx -2.981.
$$

Thus, the cotangent of \( z = 2 + 3i \) is approximately \( -2.981 \).

It's important to note that the cotangent of a complex number is itself a complex number, comprising both a real part and an imaginary part. In this instance, the real part is negative, and the imaginary part is zero.
