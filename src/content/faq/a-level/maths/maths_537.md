To calculate the square root of a complex number, we can utilize the formula:

$$
\sqrt{a + bi} = \pm \left( \sqrt{\frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}} + i \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} - a}{2}} \right).
$$

To fully grasp how to calculate the square root of a complex number, it is essential to first understand the definition of a complex number. A complex number is expressed in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ represents the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of $-1$.

To find the square root of a complex number, we apply the aforementioned formula. This involves calculating the square root of the sum of the real part of the complex number and the square root of its magnitude, divided by $2$. Subsequently, we add to this the square root of the difference between the magnitude of the complex number and its real part, divided by $2$, multiplied by $i$.

Letâ€™s illustrate this process with an example. Suppose we want to find the square root of the complex number $3 + 4i$. Using the formula, we proceed as follows:

$$
\sqrt{3 + 4i} = \pm \left( \sqrt{\frac{3 + \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}}{2}} + i \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} - 3}{2}} \right).
$$

Calculating the magnitude:

$$
\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
$$

Now substituting this back into our formula gives us:

$$
= \pm \left( \sqrt{\frac{3 + 5}{2}} + i \sqrt{\frac{5 - 3}{2}} \right)
= \pm \left( \sqrt{\frac{8}{2}} + i \sqrt{\frac{2}{2}} \right)
= \pm \left( \sqrt{4} + i \sqrt{1} \right)
= \pm (2 + i).
$$

Thus, the square roots of the complex number $3 + 4i$ are $2 + i$ and $-2 - i$.
