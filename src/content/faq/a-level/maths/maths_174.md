Fermat's theorem regarding polynomials asserts that every polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ distinct roots.

When a polynomial is factored, each factor corresponds directly to a root of that polynomial. Therefore, Fermat's theorem indicates that the number of distinct roots cannot exceed the degree of the polynomial. In simpler terms, a polynomial of degree $n$ can possess at most $n$ distinct roots.

To establish the validity of Fermat's theorem, we can employ mathematical induction. First, we can observe that the theorem holds true for polynomials of degree $1$, since a linear polynomial has at most one root. Next, we assume that the theorem is valid for all polynomials of degree less than or equal to $n-1$. Now, we will consider a polynomial of degree $n$. 

If this polynomial has no roots, the theorem is trivially satisfied. However, if the polynomial does have a root, we can factor out the corresponding linear factor, thereby reducing the degree of the polynomial to $n-1$. By our induction hypothesis, the remaining polynomial can then have at most $n-1$ distinct roots. Consequently, this implies that the original polynomial can have at most $n$ distinct roots.

Fermat's theorem holds significant implications in both algebra and calculus. It enables us to ascertain the maximum number of roots that a polynomial can possess, which is invaluable for solving polynomial equations and comprehending the behavior of functions. For instance, if a polynomial has exactly $n$ distinct roots, it can be expressed as a product of $n$ linear factors. This factorization is particularly useful when finding the roots of a polynomial and in the process of polynomial factorization itself.
