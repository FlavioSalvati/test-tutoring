Displacement is defined as the distance and direction of an object's change in position from its initial point to its final point.

In the field of mechanics, displacement specifically refers to the change in position of an object from its starting point to its endpoint. It is a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude (the total distance traveled) and direction (the orientation of the change in position). Displacement is typically denoted by the symbol $\Delta x$, where $\Delta$ indicates a change and $x$ represents the position.

The displacement can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\Delta x = x_f - x_i
$$

In this equation, $x_f$ is the final position and $x_i$ is the initial position. For instance, if an object begins at a position of $2 \, \text{m}$ and moves to a position of $6 \, \text{m}$, the displacement would be calculated as follows:

$$
\Delta x = 6 \, \text{m} - 2 \, \text{m} = 4 \, \text{m}
$$

In cases where the object has moved in both the $x$ and $y$ directions, displacement can also be computed using the Pythagorean theorem. In this scenario, the displacement is determined by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the changes in position along each axis:

$$
\Delta x = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2}
$$

Here, $\Delta x$ represents the change in position along the $x$ direction, and $\Delta y$ denotes the change in position along the $y$ direction.

Displacement is a fundamental concept in mechanics, as it serves as a basis for calculating other important quantities such as velocity and acceleration.
