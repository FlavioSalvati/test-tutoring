The uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes have an equal probability of occurring.

In the realms of probability theory and statistics, a uniform distribution signifies that every possible outcome is equally likely. Consequently, the probability of any specific outcome is identical to that of any other outcome. This distribution is commonly utilized to model scenarios where all outcomes are equally probable, such as rolling a fair die or drawing a card from a well-shuffled deck.

### Continuous Uniform Distribution

For a continuous uniform distribution, the probability density function (PDF) is defined as:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a} \quad \text{for } a \leq x \leq b
$$

where $a$ and $b$ represent the lower and upper bounds of the distribution, respectively. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for this distribution is given by:

$$
F(x) = \frac{x-a}{b-a} \quad \text{for } a \leq x \leq b
$$

The mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^2$) of a continuous uniform distribution are calculated as follows:

$$
\mu = \frac{a+b}{2}
$$

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}
$$

### Discrete Uniform Distribution

In the case of a discrete uniform distribution, each outcome also has an equal probability. For instance, when rolling a fair six-sided die, the probability of landing on any particular number is $\frac{1}{6}$. The probability mass function (PMF) for a discrete uniform distribution is expressed as:

$$
P(X=x) = \frac{1}{n} \quad \text{for } x = 1, 2, \ldots, n
$$

where $n$ denotes the total number of possible outcomes. The mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^2$) for a discrete uniform distribution are given by:

$$
\mu = \frac{n+1}{2}
$$

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{n^2-1}{12}
$$

### Conclusion

In summary, the uniform distribution is a fundamental and versatile probability distribution frequently employed to model situations where all outcomes are equally likely. Its simplicity and equal likelihood make it a valuable tool in both theoretical and applied statistics.
