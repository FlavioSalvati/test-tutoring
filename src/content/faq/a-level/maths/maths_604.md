To calculate the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence, you can use the formula:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right)
$$

An arithmetic sequence is characterized by a pattern where each term is derived by adding a constant value, known as the common difference $d$, to the preceding term. The first term of the sequence is represented by the symbol $a$. 

To illustrate how this formula works, letâ€™s consider the arithmetic sequence: $3, 7, 11, 15, 19, \ldots$ Here, the first term ($a$) is $3$, and the common difference ($d$) is $4$. If we want to find the sum of the first $5$ terms ($n = 5$), we can substitute the values into the formula as follows:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right) 
= \frac{5}{2} \left(2(3) + (5-1)4\right) 
= \frac{5}{2} \left(6 + 16\right) 
= \frac{5}{2} \left(22\right) 
= 55
$$

Thus, the sum of the first $5$ terms of the arithmetic sequence $3, 7, 11, 15, 19, \ldots$ is $55$.

It's important to note that this formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is applicable only to finite sequences. If the sequence is infinite, the sum cannot be calculated using this formula.
