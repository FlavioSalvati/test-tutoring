To clarify and enhance the content regarding the cubic equation with specified roots, we can present it as follows:

The cubic equation with roots $-2$, $-1$, and $1$ has the coefficients $1$, $2$, $-3$, and $-2$.

To derive the coefficients of a cubic equation given its roots $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$, we can start by expressing the equation in the factored form:

$$(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3) = 0.$$

Expanding this expression yields:

$$x^3 - (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)x^2 + (r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3)x - r_1 r_2 r_3 = 0.$$

From the expansion, we can identify the coefficients of the cubic equation:

- The coefficient of $x^3$ is $1$.
- The coefficient of $x^2$ is given by $-(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)$. Substituting the values of the roots, we find:
  $$-(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) = -(-2 - 1 + 1) = 2.$$
- The coefficient of $x$ is calculated as $r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3$. Evaluating this expression gives:
  $$(-2)(-1) + (-2)(1) + (-1)(1) = 2 - 2 - 1 = -3.$$
- The constant term is $-r_1 r_2 r_3$, which results in:
  $$-(-2)(-1)(1) = -2.$$

Thus, combining all these coefficients, we can write the cubic equation with roots $-2$, $-1$, and $1$ as:

$$x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0.$$
