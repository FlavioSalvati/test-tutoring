To analyze momentum before and after a collision, we utilize the formula for momentum given by the equation:

$$
p = mv
$$

where $ p $ represents momentum, $ m $ denotes mass, and $ v $ signifies velocity.

**Calculating Momentum Before Collision:**

To determine the total momentum before the collision, calculate the momentum of each object individually using their respective masses and velocities. Sum the momenta of both objects to obtain the total momentum before the collision.

**Calculating Momentum After Collision:**

Similarly, after the collision, compute the momentum for each object again using their updated masses and velocities. Add these momenta together to find the total momentum after the collision.

**Types of Collisions:**

- In an **elastic collision**, the total momentum before and after the collision remains constant.
- In an **inelastic collision**, the total momentum before and after the collision will not be equal.

**Example:**

Consider two objects with masses of $2 \, \text{kg}$ and $3 \, \text{kg}$ moving towards each other with velocities of $4 \, \text{m/s}$ and $-2 \, \text{m/s}$, respectively. Let's calculate the momentum before and after the collision.

1. **Momentum of Object 1 Before Collision:**
   $$
   p_1 = m_1 v_1 = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 4 \, \text{m/s} = 8 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
   $$

2. **Momentum of Object 2 Before Collision:**
   $$
   p_2 = m_2 v_2 = 3 \, \text{kg} \times (-2 \, \text{m/s}) = -6 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
   $$

3. **Total Momentum Before Collision:**
   $$
   p_{\text{total, before}} = p_1 + p_2 = 8 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} - 6 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} = 2 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
   $$

Assuming the collision is elastic, the total momentum after the collision will also equal $2 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}$. If we assume that the two objects stick together after the collision and move with a common velocity $ v $, we can express the total momentum after the collision as:

$$
p_{\text{total, after}} = (m_1 + m_2)v = 5 \, \text{kg} \cdot v
$$

Setting this equal to the total momentum before the collision, we have:

$$
5 \, \text{kg} \cdot v = 2 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}
$$

To find $ v $, we can solve for it as follows:

$$
v = \frac{2 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}}{5 \, \text{kg}} = 0.4 \, \text{m/s}
$$

In summary, to analyze momentum before and after a collision, use the formula $ p = mv $. First, calculate the momentum of each object before the collision and sum them for the total. Repeat the process after the collision. If the collision is elastic, the total momentum will remain constant, as illustrated in our example where the total momentum before and after the collision is $2 \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}$.
