The cubic equation with roots -1, 1, and 2 has coefficients -4, 0, 3, and -2.

To find the coefficients of a cubic equation with given roots, we start by using the fact that if r is a root of a polynomial, then x-r is a factor of the polynomial. Therefore, the cubic equation with roots -1, 1, and 2 can be written as:

(x+1)(x-1)(x-2) = 0

Expanding the brackets, we get:

x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2 = 0

This is the cubic equation with the given roots. To find its coefficients, we simply read off the coefficients of each power of x. Therefore, the coefficients of the cubic equation are:

a = 1 (coefficient of x^3)
b = -2 (coefficient of x^2)
c = -1 (coefficient of x)
d = 2 (constant term)

Therefore, the cubic equation with roots -1, 1, and 2 has coefficients -4, 0, 3, and -2, which can be written as:

x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2 = (x+1)(x-1)(x-2)
