The formula for the hyperbolic secant function is derived from the definitions of hyperbolic functions, which themselves are based on exponential functions.

The hyperbolic sine function, denoted as $\sinh(x)$, is defined by the following expression:

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
$$

In a similar manner, the hyperbolic cosine function, denoted as $\cosh(x)$, is defined as:

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
$$

The hyperbolic secant function, $\sech(x)$, is defined as the reciprocal of the hyperbolic cosine function:

$$
\sech(x) = \frac{1}{\cosh(x)}
$$

By substituting the definition of $\cosh(x)$ into the formula for $\sech(x)$, we obtain:

$$
\sech(x) = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}\right)}
$$

To simplify this expression, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $2$, yielding:

$$
\sech(x) = \frac{2}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

Thus, the final formula for the hyperbolic secant function is:

$$
\sech(x) = \frac{2}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

This completes the derivation of the formula for the hyperbolic secant.
