To solve the equation $$e^{5x} = 11$$, we need to isolate the variable $x$. We can achieve this by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

$$\ln(e^{5x}) = \ln(11)$$

Utilizing the logarithmic property that states $\ln(a^b) = b \cdot \ln(a)$, we can simplify the left-hand side:

$$5x \cdot \ln(e) = \ln(11)$$

Since $\ln(e) = 1$, this further simplifies to:

$$5x = \ln(11)$$

To find $x$, we divide both sides by $5$:

$$x = \frac{\ln(11)}{5}$$

Thus, the solution to the equation $$e^{5x} = 11$$ is 

$$x = \frac{\ln(11)}{5}.$$
