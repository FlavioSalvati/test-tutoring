The law of addition in probability states that the probability of either of two mutually exclusive events occurring is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.

In probability theory, mutually exclusive events are defined as events that cannot occur simultaneously. For instance, when flipping a coin, the outcomes of landing on heads and tails are mutually exclusive. According to the law of addition, if we have two mutually exclusive events, $A$ and $B$, the probability of either event $A$ or event $B$ occurring can be expressed as:

$$
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

This principle can be extended to encompass more than two events. For example, if $A$, $B$, and $C$ are mutually exclusive events, the probability of either $A$, $B$, or $C$ occurring is given by:

$$
P(A \text{ or } B \text{ or } C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)
$$

It is crucial to emphasize that the law of addition is applicable only to mutually exclusive events. When events are not mutually exclusive, the overlap between them must be considered, necessitating the use of the law of multiplication. In such cases, the probability of both events occurring is calculated as follows:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)
$$

Here, $P(B|A)$ represents the probability of event $B$ occurring given that event $A$ has already occurred.

In summary, the law of addition in probability provides a straightforward formula for determining the probability of either one of two or more mutually exclusive events occurring.
