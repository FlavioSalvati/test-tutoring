Gravitational potential energy is the energy that an object possesses due to its position within a gravitational field.

This form of potential energy is specifically linked to the location of an object in a gravitational field. It can be defined as the work required to move an object from a reference point to its current position while acting against the force of gravity. Typically, the reference point is considered to be at infinity, where the gravitational potential energy is defined as zero. The formula for gravitational potential energy can be expressed as:

$$
PE = mgh
$$

In this equation, $PE$ represents the gravitational potential energy, $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the object above the reference point.

The unit of gravitational potential energy is the joule (J). It is important to note that gravitational potential energy is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no directional component. The gravitational potential energy of an object increases with an increase in its height above the reference point, as well as with an increase in the object's mass.

Gravitational potential energy plays a crucial role in various fields of physics, including mechanics, astrophysics, and cosmology. It is essential for analyzing the motion of objects within a gravitational field, such as planets in orbit around stars or satellites orbiting Earth. Furthermore, this concept is vital for understanding the structure and evolution of the universe, encompassing phenomena such as galaxy formation and the expansion of the cosmos.
