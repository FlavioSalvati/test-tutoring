To conduct a Z-test, the first step is to articulate both the null and alternative hypotheses, followed by determining the significance level.

A Z-test is a statistical procedure that assesses whether the mean of a sample significantly differs from a known population mean. This test is applicable when the sample size is large (specifically, $n > 30$) and the population standard deviation is known. 

### Step 1: State the Hypotheses

1. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: This hypothesis posits that there is no significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean.
2. **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: In contrast, this hypothesis asserts that there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean.

### Step 2: Determine the Significance Level

Next, establish the significance level ($\alpha$), which represents the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The most commonly used significance level is $0.05$, indicating a $5\%$ risk of making a Type I error.

### Step 3: Calculate the Z-score

To compute the Z-score, utilize the following formula:

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

In this equation:
- $\bar{x}$ denotes the sample mean,
- $\mu$ represents the population mean,
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation,
- $n$ is the sample size.

The Z-score quantifies how many standard deviations the sample mean is from the population mean.

### Step 4: Compare the Z-score to the Critical Value

Finally, compare the calculated Z-score to the critical value obtained from the Z-table corresponding to the predetermined significance level. 

- If the calculated Z-score exceeds the critical value, you reject the null hypothesis, concluding that there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean.
- Conversely, if the calculated Z-score is less than the critical value, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is no significant difference. 

By following these steps, you can effectively perform a Z-test to analyze your data.
