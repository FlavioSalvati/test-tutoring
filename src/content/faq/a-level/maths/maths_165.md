To calculate the power of a complex number, we utilize its polar form. A complex number can be expressed as 

$$ z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) $$ 

where $r$ represents the modulus (or absolute value) and $\theta$ denotes the argument (or angle). To determine the power of the complex number $z$, we raise the modulus to the power $n$ and multiply the argument by $n$. This can be succinctly written as:

$$ z^n = r^n \left( \cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta) \right). $$

### Example Calculation

Consider the complex number 

$$ z = 2 \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \right). $$ 

To compute $z^3$, we raise the modulus $2$ to the power $3$ and multiply the argument $\frac{\pi}{4}$ by $3$. Thus, we have:

$$ z^3 = 2^3 \left( \cos\left(3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(3 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right) = 8 \left( \cos \frac{3\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{3\pi}{4} \right). $$ 

Calculating the cosine and sine values gives us:

$$ z^3 = 8 \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = -4\sqrt{2} + 4\sqrt{2} i. $$

### Conversion from Rectangular to Polar Form

If the complex number is initially given in rectangular form, we can convert it to polar form using the following formulas:

$$ r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $$ 

and 

$$ \theta = \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right). $$ 

### Another Example

Letâ€™s take the complex number 

$$ z = 1 + i. $$ 

To convert this to polar form, we calculate the modulus:

$$ r = |z| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2} $$ 

and the argument:

$$ \theta = \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}. $$ 

Thus, we can express $z$ in polar form as:

$$ z = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} \right). $$ 

To find $z^4$, we raise the modulus $\sqrt{2}$ to the power of $4$ and multiply the argument $\frac{\pi}{4}$ by $4$:

$$ z^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 \left( \cos\left(4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right) = 4 \left( \cos \pi + i \sin \pi \right). $$ 

This simplifies to:

$$ z^4 = 4(-1 + 0i) = -4. $$ 

By following these steps, you can effectively calculate the power of complex numbers in both polar and rectangular forms.
