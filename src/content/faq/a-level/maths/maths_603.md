The sine addition formula is expressed as follows:

$$
\sin(a + b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cos(a)\sin(b).
$$

To derive this formula, we begin by examining the accompanying diagram:

In this diagram, we depict a unit circle with angles $a$ and $b$. From the origin, we draw a line to the point $(\cos(a), \sin(a))$, representing the terminal point of angle $a$. We also draw another line from the origin to the point $(\cos(b), \sin(b))$, which represents the terminal point of angle $b$. Additionally, we draw a line from the point $(\cos(a), \sin(a))$ to the point $(\cos(a + b), \sin(a + b))$, which represents the terminal point of the angle $a + b$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we confirm that the distance from the origin to the point $(\cos(a), \sin(a))$ is $1$, which establishes that the coordinates of this point are indeed $(\cos(a), \sin(a))$.

Similarly, the distance from the origin to the point $(\cos(b), \sin(b))$ is also $1$, indicating that the coordinates of this point are $(\cos(b), \sin(b))$.

Applying the angle addition formulas, we find that the coordinates of the point corresponding to the angle $a + b$ are given by:

$$
\cos(a + b) = \cos(a)\cos(b) - \sin(a)\sin(b),
$$

$$
\sin(a + b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cos(a)\sin(b).
$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$
\sin(a + b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cos(a)\sin(b),
$$

which confirms the sine addition formula.
