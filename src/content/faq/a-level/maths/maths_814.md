Angular momentum is defined as the product of the moment of inertia and the angular velocity of an object.

In the context of a collision, the principle of conservation of angular momentum states that the total angular momentum before the collision is equal to the total angular momentum after the collision, provided that no external torques are acting on the system.

The moment of inertia, denoted as $I$, quantifies an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion. It is calculated by summing the products of each particle's mass and the square of its distance from the axis of rotation. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
I = \sum mr^2
$$

where $m$ represents the mass of each particle and $r$ denotes its distance from the axis of rotation.

The angular velocity, represented by $\omega$, measures the rate at which an object rotates about an axis and is expressed in radians per second. It can be defined mathematically as:

$$
\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

where $\Delta \theta$ is the change in angle and $\Delta t$ is the change in time.

Consequently, the angular momentum, denoted as $L$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L = I \omega
$$

In a collision scenario, if both the moment of inertia and angular velocity of the system remain unchanged, the angular momentum before the collision will equal the angular momentum after the collision. This relationship can be mathematically represented as:

$$
L_1 = L_2
$$

where $L_1$ is the angular momentum prior to the collision, and $L_2$ is the angular momentum following the collision.
