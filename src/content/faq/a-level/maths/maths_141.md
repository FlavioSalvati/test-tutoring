The Gumbel distribution is a probability distribution that is specifically designed to model extreme values.

Also referred to as the Type I extreme value distribution, the Gumbel distribution is particularly useful for analyzing the distribution of the maximum or minimum values among a large set of independent and identically distributed random variables. This distribution finds applications in various fields such as hydrology, meteorology, and engineering, where it is often employed to model extreme events like floods, storms, and earthquakes.

The probability density function (PDF) of the Gumbel distribution is expressed as follows:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\beta} \exp\left(-\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\beta} + \exp\left(-\frac{x - \mu}{\beta}\right)\right)\right)
$$

In this equation, $\mu$ represents the location parameter, while $\beta$ signifies the scale parameter. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Gumbel distribution is given by:

$$
F(x) = \exp\left(-\exp\left(-\frac{x - \mu}{\beta}\right)\right)
$$

The Gumbel distribution exhibits several important properties. Notably, as the number of independent and identically distributed random variables increases to infinity, the distribution of their maximum approaches a Gumbel distribution. This principle is known as the extreme value theorem.

In conclusion, the Gumbel distribution serves as a powerful tool for modeling extreme events. Its widespread usage across various domains—such as hydrology, meteorology, and engineering—highlights its importance. The distribution is characterized by its location and scale parameters and possesses numerous properties that make it invaluable for statistical analysis.
