To calculate the inverse trigonometric functions of a complex number, we start by converting the complex number into its polar form using the formula:

$$ z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) $$

Here, $r$ represents the modulus of the complex number, and $\theta$ denotes the argument of the complex number. Understanding this conversion is crucial as it lays the groundwork for finding the inverse trigonometric functions.

Once the complex number is expressed in polar form, we can apply the inverse trigonometric functions to determine the value of $\theta$. For instance, to find the inverse sine of a complex number $z$, we use the formula:

$$ \sin^{-1}(z) = \theta $$ 

where $\theta$ is the angle such that $\sin \theta = z$.

Similarly, to compute the inverse cosine of the complex number $z$, we employ the equation:

$$ \cos^{-1}(z) = \theta $$ 

where $\theta$ is the angle satisfying $\cos \theta = z$. 

For the inverse tangent of the complex number $z$, the formula is:

$$ \tan^{-1}(z) = \theta $$ 

where $\theta$ is the angle for which $\tan \theta = z$. Familiarity with these formulas will greatly enhance your ability to perform these calculations effectively.

It is essential to recognize that the inverse trigonometric functions of a complex number can yield multiple values due to the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions. Consequently, it is important to specify the range of values for these functions, often by restricting them to their principal value ranges.

### Summary for A-Level Maths Students:
To find the inverse trigonometric functions of a complex number, begin by converting the number into polar form using:

$$ z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta). $$

Subsequently, apply the inverse trigonometric formulas:

- For inverse sine: $$ \sin^{-1}(z) = \theta $$
- For inverse cosine: $$ \cos^{-1}(z) = \theta $$
- For inverse tangent: $$ \tan^{-1}(z) = \theta $$

Keep in mind that these functions can yield multiple results due to the periodicity of trigonometric functions, so be sure to consider the principal value range when determining your final answers.
