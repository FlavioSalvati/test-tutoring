To find the solution to the equation $ e^x = 5 $, we can express $ x $ in terms of natural logarithms. The solution is given by:

$$
x = \ln(5).
$$

To derive this solution, we need to isolate $ x $. We accomplish this by applying the natural logarithm to both sides of the equation:

$$
\ln(e^x) = \ln(5).
$$

Utilizing the logarithmic property that states $ \ln(e^x) = x $, we simplify the left-hand side:

$$
x = \ln(5).
$$

Thus, we conclude that the solution to the equation $ e^x = 5 $ is:

$$
x = \ln(5).
$$

It's important to understand that the natural logarithm function, denoted as $ \ln(x) $, is the inverse of the exponential function $ e^x $. This means that taking the natural logarithm of $ e^x $ yields $ x $, and conversely, applying the exponential function to $ \ln(x) $ returns $ x $. This fundamental relationship is crucial when solving equations that involve exponential and logarithmic functions.
