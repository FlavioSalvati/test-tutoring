The transpose of a matrix is formed by interchanging its rows and columns.

In linear algebra, a matrix is defined as a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Specifically, if we have a matrix $A$ with $m$ rows and $n$ columns, the transpose of $A$, denoted as $A^T$, will have $n$ rows and $m$ columns. The element located in the $i^\text{th}$ row and $j^\text{th}$ column of $A^T$ corresponds to the element in the $j^\text{th}$ row and $i^\text{th}$ column of $A$.

The transpose of a matrix possesses several significant properties:

1. **Double Transpose**: The property $(A^T)^T = A$ indicates that taking the transpose of a matrix twice results in the original matrix.
  
2. **Transpose of a Product**: The property $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$ reveals that the transpose of a product of two matrices is equal to the product of their transposes, taken in reverse order.

3. **Transpose of a Sum**: The property $(A + B)^T = A^T + B^T$ states that the transpose of the sum of two matrices is equal to the sum of their transposes.

The transpose of a matrix is an important concept with a wide range of applications across various fields of mathematics and science, including linear algebra, calculus, and physics. It plays a vital role in solving systems of linear equations, determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and representing linear transformations.
