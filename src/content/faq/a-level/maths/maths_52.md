To conduct a chi-square test, the first steps are to clearly state the null and alternative hypotheses and to select a significance level.

A chi-square test is utilized to assess whether there is a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies in a categorical dataset. The initial step involves formulating the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis (denoted as $H_0$) posits that there is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies, whereas the alternative hypothesis (denoted as $H_a$) asserts that a significant difference exists.

Next, you should choose a significance level, commonly set at $0.05$ or $0.01$. This significance level signifies the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.

Following this, calculate the expected frequencies for each category using the total sample size and the anticipated proportions. The chi-square statistic is then computed by summing the squared differences between the observed and expected frequencies for each category, divided by the expected frequency:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

where $O_i$ represents the observed frequency and $E_i$ represents the expected frequency for category $i$.

To determine the degrees of freedom, subtract $1$ from the total number of categories:

$$
df = k - 1
$$

where $k$ is the number of categories. Next, utilize a chi-square distribution table or an appropriate calculator to find the critical value corresponding to the chosen significance level and degrees of freedom.

Now, compare the calculated chi-square statistic to the critical value. If the computed chi-square statistic exceeds the critical value, you reject the null hypothesis, concluding that there is a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies. Conversely, if the calculated statistic is less than the critical value, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no significant difference.

Lastly, interpret the results in the context of the dataset to draw meaningful conclusions.
