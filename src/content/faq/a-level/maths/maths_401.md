Correlated equilibrium is a solution concept in game theory that enables players to coordinate their actions through the involvement of a third party.

In many games, players may not possess a dominant strategy, meaning there is no single best response to their opponents' actions. In such scenarios, players can benefit from aligning their strategies with one another. However, circumstances may arise where players cannot communicate effectively or cannot rely on each other to adhere to a previously agreed-upon strategy.

Correlated equilibrium addresses this challenge by introducing a third party—such as a randomizing device—that recommends a strategy profile for the players to follow. This strategy profile is termed "correlated" because it provides a probability distribution over the players' potential actions, rather than prescribing a specific action for each player.

For instance, consider the well-known game of rock-paper-scissors. In a correlated equilibrium, a third party could suggest that players choose rock, paper, or scissors at random, each with a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$. This recommended strategy profile is correlated, as it indicates a probability distribution over the players' choices instead of dictating a specific choice for each player.

The concept of correlated equilibrium is particularly valuable because it facilitates coordination among players without necessitating direct communication or mutual trust. Nonetheless, it is important to note that this approach may not always yield the most efficient or realistic outcomes in practical situations.
