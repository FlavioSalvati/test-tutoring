To factor a trinomial, our goal is to find two binomials that multiply together to yield the original trinomial.

First, we must ensure that the trinomial is expressed in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$. If it is, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the factors of $a$ and $c$.
2. Search for two factors that sum up to $b$.
3. Rewrite the trinomial as the sum of two binomials based on the factors identified in steps 1 and 2.
4. Factor out any common factors from the resulting binomials.

For instance, letâ€™s factor the trinomial $2x^2 + 7x + 3$.

1. The factors of $2$ are $1$ and $2$, while the factors of $3$ are $1$ and $3$.
2. We need to find two factors that add up to $7$. The suitable pair is $2$ and $5$.
3. Rewrite the trinomial as $(2x^2 + 2x) + (5x + 3)$.
4. Factor out $2x$ from the first binomial and $1$ from the second binomial to obtain $2x(x + 1) + 1(5x + 3)$.
5. The final factored form is $(2x + 1)(x + 3)$.

If the trinomial does not conform to the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$, alternative methods such as grouping or applying the quadratic formula may be necessary to factor it effectively.
