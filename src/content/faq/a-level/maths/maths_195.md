The period of the function $\sin(x)$ is $2\pi$.

The period of a function is defined as the smallest positive value $T$ for which the equation $f(x + T) = f(x)$ holds true for all values of $x$. For the function $\sin(x)$, this is expressed as:

$$
\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x) \quad \text{for all } x.
$$

This relationship can be demonstrated using the angle addition formula for sine:

$$
\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x)\cos(2\pi) + \cos(x)\sin(2\pi).
$$

Substituting the values of the trigonometric functions at $2\pi$, we have:

$$
\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x)(1) + \cos(x)(0) = \sin(x).
$$

Thus, we can conclude that the period of $\sin(x)$ is indeed $2\pi$.

Alternatively, we can assert that $\sin(x)$ is inherently a periodic function with a period of $2\pi$ by definition. This implies that the equation $\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x)$ holds for all values of $x$, and any integer multiple of $2\pi$ will also fulfill this property. Consequently, the period of $\sin(x)$ is confirmed to be $2\pi$.

It is also noteworthy that the period of $\sin(x)$ is identical to that of $\cos(x)$, as these functions are related by a phase shift of $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $\cos(x)$ also has a period of $2\pi$.
