Tangential acceleration in circular motion can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a = r \alpha
$$

where $r$ represents the radius of the circular path, and $\alpha$ denotes the angular acceleration.

Circular motion refers to the movement of an object along a circular trajectory. Tangential acceleration specifically describes the acceleration of an object along the tangent to this circular path, resulting from changes in the object's speed or direction. The magnitude of tangential acceleration is determined by the formula mentioned earlier:

$$
a = r \alpha
$$

where $r$ is the radius and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

Angular acceleration, on the other hand, is the rate at which angular velocity changes over time. It can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}
$$

where $\Delta \omega$ is the change in angular velocity, and $\Delta t$ is the time interval over which this change occurs. 

Angular velocity itself is the rate of change of angle with respect to time, defined by the formula:

$$
\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

where $\Delta \theta$ is the change in angle, and $\Delta t$ is the time taken for that change.

To compute tangential acceleration, one needs to know both the radius of the circular path and the angular acceleration. Once these values are obtained, they can be substituted into the formula $a = r \alpha$ to determine the tangential acceleration. 

For instance, if the radius of the circular path is $2$ metres and the angular acceleration is $3$ radians per second squared, the calculation for tangential acceleration would proceed as follows:

$$
a = r \alpha
$$
$$
a = 2 \times 3
$$
$$
a = 6 \, \text{metres per second squared}
$$

Thus, the tangential acceleration in this scenario is $6$ metres per second squared.
