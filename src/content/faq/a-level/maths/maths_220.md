Velocity in oscillatory motion can be determined by taking the derivative of displacement with respect to time.

In oscillatory motion, an object moves back and forth around a central point, with its displacement varying periodically. The velocity of the object at any given moment is defined as the rate of change of its displacement over time. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
v = \frac{d}{dt} (x)
$$

where $v$ represents the velocity, $x$ denotes the displacement, and $\frac{d}{dt}$ indicates the derivative with respect to time.

For simple harmonic motion, in which the object's displacement follows a sinusoidal pattern, the velocity can be described by the equation:

$$
v = -A\omega \sin(\omega t + \phi)
$$

In this equation, $A$ is the amplitude of the motion, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $t$ is the time, and $\phi$ is the phase angle. The negative sign signifies that the velocity is directed opposite to the displacement.

The maximum velocity occurs when the object is at the equilibrium position, where the displacement is zero. At this point, the maximum velocity can be expressed as:

$$
v_{\text{max}} = A\omega
$$

Conversely, the velocity reaches zero at the turning points, where the displacement reaches its maximum value.

In summary, the velocity in oscillatory motion is determined by the derivative of displacement with respect to time. For simple harmonic motion, this velocity can be represented as a sinusoidal function of time.
