To conduct a Cochran's Q test, the first step is to collect a dataset that includes multiple binary outcomes.

Cochran's Q test is a non-parametric statistical method used to assess whether there are significant differences in the proportions of multiple binary outcomes. This test is often employed in medical research to compare the effectiveness of various treatments. For instance, consider a study that evaluates the success rates of three different treatments for a specific medical condition. The data can be organized into a contingency table, where the treatments are displayed in the rows and the binary outcomes (success or failure) are presented in the columns.

The next step is to compute the Q statistic using the following formula:

$$
Q = (k - 1) \cdot \frac{\sum R^2 - n}{n \cdot (k - 1)}
$$

In this equation, $k$ represents the number of treatments, $R$ denotes the number of successes for each treatment, and $n$ is the total number of observations. The computed Q statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with $k - 1$ degrees of freedom.

Finally, you will need to determine the p-value by referencing a chi-squared distribution table or utilizing statistical software. If the p-value is less than the predetermined significance level (commonly set at $0.05$), this indicates that there is significant evidence to suggest that the proportions of binary outcomes differ among the treatments.

In summary, Cochran's Q test serves as a valuable tool for comparing the proportions of binary outcomes across multiple treatments. By adhering to the outlined steps, A-Level Maths students can effectively perform this test and derive meaningful insights from their data.
