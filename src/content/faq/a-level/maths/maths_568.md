To find the solution to the equation $ 3^x = 27 $, we can utilize logarithms. 

First, we take the logarithm of both sides of the equation using base $ 3 $:

$$ 
\log_3(3^x) = \log_3(27) 
$$

Applying the power rule of logarithms allows us to simplify the left-hand side:

$$ 
x \cdot \log_3(3) = \log_3(27) 
$$

Since we know that $ \log_3(3) = 1 $, we can further simplify the equation:

$$ 
x = \log_3(27) 
$$

Next, we can convert $ \log_3(27) $ into a more familiar logarithmic form using the change of base formula:

$$ 
x = \log_3(27) = \frac{\log(27)}{\log(3)} 
$$

By calculating $ \log(27) $ and $ \log(3) $ using a calculator, we find that:

$$ 
x = 3 
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation $ 3^x = 27 $ is 

$$ 
x = 3. 
$$
