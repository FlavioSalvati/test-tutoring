The double angle formula for cosine is given by:

$$
\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta).
$$

To prove this formula, we start with the addition formula for cosine, which states:

$$
\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta).
$$

By setting both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ equal to $\theta$, we can express $\cos(2\theta)$ as follows:

$$
\cos(2\theta) = \cos(\theta + \theta) = \cos(\theta)\cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta)\sin(\theta).
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta).
$$

Next, we utilize the Pythagorean identity, which states that:

$$
\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1.
$$

From this identity, we can substitute for $\cos^2(\theta)$:

$$
\cos^2(\theta) = 1 - \sin^2(\theta).
$$

Substituting this expression into our equation for $\cos(2\theta)$, we have:

$$
\cos(2\theta) = (1 - \sin^2(\theta)) - \sin^2(\theta).
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2(\theta).
$$

Thus, we have shown that:

$$
\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta).
$$

This completes our proof of the double angle formula for cosine.
