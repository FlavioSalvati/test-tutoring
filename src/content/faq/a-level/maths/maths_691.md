To find the solution to the equation $ e^x = 10 $, we determine that $ x = \ln(10) $.

To solve for $ x $, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation. Recall that the natural logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function $ e^x $, which means that:

$$
\ln(e^x) = x
$$

Applying this property to our equation, we have:

$$
\ln(e^x) = \ln(10)
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = \ln(10)
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation $ e^x = 10 $ is $ x = \ln(10) $. This solution is exact, and if needed, we can use a calculator to approximate it to any desired level of accuracy.
