The work done in a variable force field is calculated by integrating the force with respect to displacement.

When the force is constant, the work can be determined by multiplying the force by the displacement and the cosine of the angle between them. However, in a variable force field, the force changes as the object moves, making this straightforward method inapplicable. Instead, we utilize calculus to integrate the force with respect to displacement.

The formula for calculating work in a variable force field is given by:

$$
W = \int F(x) \, dx
$$

In this expression, $W$ represents the work done, $F(x)$ is the force at a specific position $x$, and $dx$ denotes the infinitesimal displacement. This integral effectively represents the area under the force-displacement curve.

To compute the work done by a variable force, we first need to determine the force function $F(x)$. This can be achieved using physical laws or through experimental measurements. Once we have established the force function, we can perform the integration with respect to displacement to find the total work done.

For example, consider a force function defined as $F(x) = 2x + 3$. If the object moves from $x = 1$ to $x = 5$, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$
W = \int_{1}^{5} F(x) \, dx = \int_{1}^{5} (2x + 3) \, dx
$$

We evaluate the integral:

$$
W = \left[ x^2 + 3x \right]_{1}^{5}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
W = \left( 5^2 + 3 \times 5 \right) - \left( 1^2 + 3 \times 1 \right)
$$

Calculating each term gives:

$$
W = (25 + 15) - (1 + 3) = 40 - 4 = 36
$$

Thus, the work done by the variable force in this example is $36$ units.
