The polar form of a complex number offers an alternative representation based on its magnitude and angle.

In the rectangular form, a complex number is expressed as a sum of its real and imaginary components. For instance, if we consider the complex number $z = 3 + 4i$, it is represented in rectangular form simply as $z = 3 + 4i$.

In contrast, the polar form expresses a complex number in terms of its magnitude and angle. The magnitude, denoted as $|z|$, is the distance from the origin to the complex number in the complex plane. The angle, denoted as $\theta$, represents the angle that the line connecting the origin to the complex number makes with the positive real axis. For the complex number $z = 3 + 4i$, we can express it in polar form as:

$$
z = 5 \left( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \right)
$$

where $5$ is the magnitude and $\theta$ is the angle formed with the positive real axis.

To convert a complex number from rectangular form to polar form, we can use the following formulas:

- **Magnitude**: 
$$
|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$
where $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part of the complex number.

- **Angle**: 
$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
$$
where $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part of the complex number.

Conversely, to convert a complex number from polar form back to rectangular form, we use these formulas:

- **Real part**: 
$$
\text{Re}(z) = |z| \cos \theta
$$

- **Imaginary part**: 
$$
\text{Im}(z) = |z| \sin \theta
$$

In summary, the polar form of a complex number provides a valuable method for representing complex numbers, particularly when performing operations such as multiplication and division.
