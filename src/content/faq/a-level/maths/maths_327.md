The conversion from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates involves the following formulas:

$$
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

To convert a point from Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$, we apply these formulas. 

1. The first formula, $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, calculates the distance from the origin to the point $(x, y)$ using the Pythagorean theorem.
2. The second formula, $\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$, determines the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point $(x, y)$, using the inverse tangent function.

For example, letâ€™s convert the point $(3, 4)$ from Cartesian to polar coordinates. 

First, we compute the distance from the origin:

$$
r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Next, we find the angle $\theta$:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 0.93 \text{ radians} \approx 53.13 \text{ degrees}
$$

Thus, the polar coordinates of the point $(3, 4)$ are $(5, 0.93)$.

It is essential to remember that the angle $\theta$ is typically measured in radians. To convert from radians to degrees, you can multiply by $\frac{180}{\pi}$. Conversely, to convert from degrees to radians, you multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180}$.
