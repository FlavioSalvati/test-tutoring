The formulas for the tangent of the sum and difference of two angles can be derived using trigonometric identities.

### Proving the Tangent of the Sum of Two Angles

To begin with the formula for the tangent of the sum of two angles, we start with the identity:

$$
\tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin(A + B)}{\cos(A + B)}.
$$

By applying the sum identities for sine and cosine, we can express this as:

$$
\tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B}.
$$

Next, we simplify both the numerator and denominator by factoring out $\sin A$ and $\cos A$, respectively:

$$
\tan(A + B) = \frac{\sin A (\cos B + \tan A \sin B)}{\cos A (\cos B - \tan A \sin B)}.
$$

Finally, we substitute the identity $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$ to further simplify the expression:

$$
\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.
$$

This yields the formula for the tangent of the sum of two angles.

### Proving the Tangent of the Difference of Two Angles

Now, let's prove the formula for the tangent of the difference of two angles. We start with the identity:

$$
\tan(A - B) = \frac{\sin(A - B)}{\cos(A - B)}.
$$

Using the difference identities for sine and cosine, we can rewrite this as:

$$
\tan(A - B) = \frac{\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B}.
$$

Next, we simplify the numerator and denominator by factoring out $\sin A$ and $\cos A$, respectively:

$$
\tan(A - B) = \frac{\sin A (\cos B - \tan A \sin B)}{\cos A (\cos B + \tan A \sin B)}.
$$

Lastly, we apply the identity $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$ once again to simplify the expression:

$$
\tan(A - B) = \frac{\tan A - \tan B}{1 + \tan A \tan B}.
$$

This gives us the formula for the tangent of the difference of two angles.
