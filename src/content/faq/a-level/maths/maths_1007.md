To integrate the function $\cot(x)$, we can utilize the substitution $u = \sin(x)$. This substitution leads to the derivative relationship $\frac{du}{dx} = \cos(x)$, which implies that $dx = \frac{du}{\cos(x)}$. 

Substituting these expressions into the integral, we arrive at:

$$
\int \cot(x) \, dx = \int \cot(x) \left(\frac{du}{\cos(x)}\right).
$$

Recall that $\cot(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}$, so we can rewrite the integral as follows:

$$
\int \cot(x) \, dx = \int \left(\frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}\right) \left(\frac{du}{\cos(x)}\right) = \int \frac{1}{u} \, du,
$$

where we have made the substitution $u = \sin(x)$.

Now, we can compute the integral:

$$
\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| + C = \ln|\sin(x)| + C.
$$

Thus, the final result for the integral of $\cot(x)$ is:

$$
\int \cot(x) \, dx = \ln|\sin(x)| + C,
$$

where $C$ is the constant of integration.

It is crucial to note that this integral is undefined at points where $x = n\pi$, where $n$ is any integer, since the function $\cot(x)$ is undefined at these values.
