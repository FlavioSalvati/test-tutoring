The double angle formula for the tangent function is given by:

$$
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan\theta}{1 - \tan^2\theta}.
$$

To demonstrate the derivation of this formula, we begin with the identity for the tangent of the sum of two angles:

$$
\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tan\alpha + \tan\beta}{1 - \tan\alpha \tan\beta}.
$$

For our proof, we set both angles, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, equal to $\theta$. This gives us:

$$
\tan(2\theta) = \tan(\theta + \theta) = \frac{\tan\theta + \tan\theta}{1 - \tan\theta \tan\theta}.
$$

Simplifying this expression, we find:

$$
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan\theta}{1 - \tan^2\theta}.
$$

Thus, we have successfully proven the double angle formula for tangent.
