Cluster random sampling is a technique used to gather samples from a population by first dividing the population into distinct groups, known as clusters, and then randomly selecting a sample of these clusters for further analysis.

This method is particularly effective in large-scale studies. In cluster random sampling, the population is segmented into clusters, which consist of individuals who share certain common characteristics. For instance, a cluster could represent people residing in the same neighborhood, attending the same school, or working at the same company.

Once the clusters have been established, a random selection of these clusters is made. Each cluster has an equal probability of being chosen for the study. Following the selection process, all individuals within the chosen clusters are included in the analysis.

Cluster random sampling is especially useful when it is impractical or unfeasible to sample individuals from the entire population. For example, if a researcher aims to investigate the health outcomes of residents in a specific city, a more practical approach might involve dividing the city into neighborhoods and sampling individuals from each neighborhood, rather than attempting to sample from the entire city.

One of the primary advantages of cluster random sampling is its cost-effectiveness. This technique can significantly reduce the time and resources needed to sample individuals from an entire population. However, it is crucial to ensure that the selected clusters accurately represent the population as a whole; otherwise, the study's findings may be skewed or biased.
