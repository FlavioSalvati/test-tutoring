Average velocity is defined as the total displacement of an object divided by the time taken for that displacement.

Average velocity represents how fast an object is moving in a specific direction over a certain period. It is calculated by dividing the total displacement by the time taken. Displacement refers to the straight-line distance from the initial to the final position of an object, and it is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction.

To determine average velocity, we use the following formula:

$$
\text{Average Velocity} = \frac{\text{Displacement}}{\text{Time Taken}}
$$

For instance, consider a car that travels $100 \text{ km}$ north over $2$ hours, followed by a $50 \text{ km}$ journey south in $1$ hour. We can calculate its average velocity for the entire trip as follows:

1. **Total Displacement**:
   $$ 
   \text{Total Displacement} = 100 \text{ km north} - 50 \text{ km south} = 50 \text{ km north} 
   $$

2. **Total Time Taken**:
   $$ 
   \text{Total Time Taken} = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} 
   $$

3. **Average Velocity**:
   $$
   \text{Average Velocity} = \frac{\text{Total Displacement}}{\text{Total Time Taken}} = \frac{50 \text{ km north}}{3 \text{ hours}} \approx 16.67 \text{ km/h north}
   $$

Thus, the average velocity of the car over the entire journey is approximately $16.67 \text{ km/h}$ north.

It is crucial to understand that average velocity differs from instantaneous velocity. While average velocity considers the entire journey, instantaneous velocity refers to the speed of an object at a specific moment in time.
