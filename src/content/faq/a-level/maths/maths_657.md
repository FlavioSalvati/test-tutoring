Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or configuration, whereas kinetic energy is the energy it possesses due to its motion.

**Potential Energy**  
Potential energy refers to the stored energy in an object, which is available to be released under certain conditions. The amount of potential energy an object possesses is contingent upon its position relative to a reference point, its mass, and the strength of the force acting upon it. The formula for calculating potential energy is given by:

$$
PE = mgh
$$

where:
- $PE$ represents potential energy,
- $m$ is the mass of the object,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and
- $h$ is the height of the object above the reference point.

**Kinetic Energy**  
Kinetic energy, on the other hand, is the energy an object has due to its motion. This energy is a result of the object's velocity. The amount of kinetic energy depends on both the object's mass and its velocity. The formula for kinetic energy is expressed as:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

where:
- $KE$ denotes kinetic energy,
- $m$ is the mass of the object, and
- $v$ is its velocity.

**Key Differences**  
The primary distinction between potential energy and kinetic energy lies in their nature: potential energy is stored energy that an object possesses, while kinetic energy is the energy currently in use by an object that is in motion. In other words, potential energy can be viewed as the energy that an object has the capacity to utilize, whereas kinetic energy is the energy that is presently being exerted by the object.
