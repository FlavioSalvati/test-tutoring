The moment of inertia is a fundamental concept that quantifies an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion.

When an object rotates around a specific axis, it tends to oppose any alterations to its rotational state. This inherent resistance is referred to as the moment of inertia. This property varies with both the mass distribution of the object and the chosen axis of rotation. The moment of inertia is represented by the symbol $I$ and is measured in units of kg mÂ².

For a point mass, the moment of inertia can be expressed using the formula:

$$
I = mr^2
$$

where $m$ denotes the mass of the object and $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation. In the case of multiple point masses, the total moment of inertia is simply the sum of the individual moments of inertia.

For continuous bodies, such as rods or disks, the moment of inertia is determined through calculus. For instance, the moment of inertia of a uniform rod with length $L$ and mass $M$, rotating about an axis that passes through its center of mass, is given by:

$$
I = \frac{1}{12} ML^2
$$

Similarly, for a uniform disk of radius $R$ and mass $M$ rotating about an axis through its center of mass, the moment of inertia is calculated as:

$$
I = \frac{1}{2} MR^2
$$

The moment of inertia is crucial in the study of rotational dynamics, as it is essential for determining the angular acceleration of an object when a torque is applied. The relationship that connects torque, moment of inertia, and angular acceleration is described by the formula:

$$
\tau = I\alpha
$$

Here, $\tau$ represents the torque, $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration, and $I$ is the moment of inertia. This equation illustrates how the moment of inertia influences the rotational response of an object to applied forces.
