The natural logarithm of a complex number can be computed using the formula:

$$
\ln(z) = \ln|z| + i \arg(z)
$$

where $z$ represents a complex number.

To calculate the natural logarithm of a complex number, we first need to determine its modulus and argument. Let $z = a + bi$ be a complex number, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. The modulus of $z$ is defined as:

$$
|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

The argument of $z$ is given by:

$$
\arg(z) = \begin{cases} 
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) & \text{if } a > 0 \\
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) + \pi & \text{if } a < 0 
\end{cases}
$$

For further details on the types and properties of numbers, please refer to additional resources.

Once we have calculated both the modulus and the argument of $z$, we can utilize the formula:

$$
\ln(z) = \ln|z| + i \arg(z)
$$

to find its natural logarithm. For instance, consider the complex number $z = 2 + 3i$. 

First, we compute the modulus:

$$
|z| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{13}
$$

Next, we find the argument:

$$
\arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 1.249 \text{ radians (since } a > 0\text{)}
$$

With these values, we can compute the natural logarithm:

$$
\ln(z) = \ln|z| + i \arg(z) = \ln(\sqrt{13}) + i(1.249) \approx 1.322 + 1.249i
$$

Understanding the trigonometric form of complex numbers can further aid in this calculation; additional details can be found in relevant literature.

It is crucial to note that the natural logarithm of a complex number is not unique, as the argument of a complex number is defined only up to an integer multiple of $2\pi$. Therefore, we can express the natural logarithm as:

$$
\ln(z) = \ln|z| + i\left(\arg(z) + 2\pi n\right)
$$

where $n$ is any integer. For more insights into argument calculations, please consult further resources.
