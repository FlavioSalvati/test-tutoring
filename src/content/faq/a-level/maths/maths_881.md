The second derivative of a function is defined as the rate of change of the first derivative with respect to the independent variable.

In calculus, the second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative of a function. It quantifies how the slope of the function is changing as the independent variable changes. The second derivative is commonly denoted as $f''(x)$ or $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$, where $y$ is a function of $x$.

Geometrically, the second derivative provides insight into the curvature of the function's graph. When the second derivative is positive ($f''(x) > 0$), the graph is said to be concave up, indicating that the slope of the function is increasing. Conversely, when the second derivative is negative ($f''(x) < 0$), the graph is concave down, suggesting that the slope is decreasing. If the second derivative equals zero ($f''(x) = 0$), this may indicate the presence of an inflection point, where the curvature changes.

The second derivative test is a technique used to ascertain the nature of critical points of a function. If the second derivative is positive at a critical point, then the function exhibits a local minimum at that point. If the second derivative is negative, the function has a local maximum. However, if the second derivative is zero, the test does not provide conclusive information about the nature of the critical point.

To calculate the second derivative of a function, one must differentiate the first derivative with respect to the independent variable. For instance, consider the function $f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x$. The first derivative is computed as $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5$, and the second derivative is then determined to be $f''(x) = 6x + 4$.
