Independent probability refers to the likelihood of two or more events occurring simultaneously, where the occurrence of one event does not influence the probability of the other event(s). 

In probability theory, two events are considered independent if the occurrence of one does not alter the probability of the other. For instance, when tossing a coin twice, the probability of landing heads on the first toss is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of landing heads on the second toss remains $\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of obtaining heads on both tosses is calculated as the product of the individual probabilities: 

$$
P(\text{Heads on both tosses}) = P(\text{Heads on first toss}) \times P(\text{Heads on second toss}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
$$ 

This illustrates the concept of independent probability.

To assess whether two events are independent, we can apply the formula:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B),
$$ 

where $P(A \text{ and } B)$ denotes the probability of both events occurring together, $P(A)$ represents the probability of event A occurring, and $P(B)$ signifies the probability of event B occurring. If this equation holds true, the events are deemed independent.

Understanding independent probability is crucial across various domains of mathematics and statistics, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and machine learning. It enables us to make predictions and draw conclusions based on data without the assumption that one event influences the probability of another.
