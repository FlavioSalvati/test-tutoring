Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that enables the calculation of conditional probabilities.

Named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian, Bayes' theorem is a cornerstone of probability theory. It specifically addresses how to determine the likelihood of an event occurring, given that another related event has already taken place. This concept of conditional probability is vital in numerous fields, as it allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is expressed as follows:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

In this formula:
- $P(A|B)$ represents the probability of event $A$ occurring given that event $B$ has occurred.
- $P(B|A)$ denotes the probability of event $B$ occurring given that event $A$ has occurred.
- $P(A)$ is the prior probability of event $A$ occurring before observing event $B$.
- $P(B)$ is the prior probability of event $B$ occurring.

Bayes' theorem finds applications across a variety of fields, including medical diagnosis, spam filtering, and machine learning. Its ability to update probabilities in light of new information makes it a powerful tool for enhancing prediction accuracy and improving decision-making processes.
