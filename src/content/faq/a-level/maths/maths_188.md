Impulse represents the change in momentum of an object resulting from a collision.

When two objects collide, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other for a brief duration. This interaction leads to a change in momentum for both objects involved. The product of the force applied and the time duration for which it acts is referred to as impulse. Mathematically, impulse can be represented as:

$$
\text{Impulse} = \text{Force} \times \text{Time}
$$

During a collision, the impulse experienced by an object is equivalent to the change in momentum of that object. This relationship can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Impulse} = \Delta \text{Momentum}
$$

If we assume that the mass of an object remains constant, the change in momentum can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta \text{Momentum} = \text{Mass} \times \Delta \text{Velocity}
$$

Thus, the impulse experienced by an object can also be expressed as:

$$
\text{Impulse} = \text{Mass} \times \Delta \text{Velocity}
$$

It is important to note that impulse is a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude and direction. The direction of the impulse aligns with the direction of the force that produces it. In the context of a collision, the impulse experienced by one object is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the impulse experienced by the other object. This principle is a reflection of the law of conservation of momentum.
