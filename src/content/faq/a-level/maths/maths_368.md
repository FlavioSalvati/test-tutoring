The conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates involves the use of trigonometric functions, specifically cosine and sine. In polar coordinates, a point is defined by an angle, $\theta$, and a distance, $r$, from the origin. Conversely, in Cartesian coordinates, a point is represented by its $x$ and $y$ coordinates.

To determine the $x$ coordinate in Cartesian coordinates, we utilize the formula:

$$
x = r \cos(\theta)
$$

This expression indicates that the $x$ coordinate is the product of the radius $r$ and the cosine of the angle $\theta$. Similarly, to find the $y$ coordinate, we employ the formula:

$$
y = r \sin(\theta)
$$

This formula signifies that the $y$ coordinate is the product of the radius $r$ and the sine of the angle $\theta$.

For instance, consider a point in polar coordinates with an angle of $45$ degrees and a radius of $2$. To convert this point into Cartesian coordinates, we first calculate the $x$ coordinate using the formula:

$$
x = r \cos(\theta) = 2 \cos(45^\circ) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}.
$$

Next, we determine the $y$ coordinate using the formula:

$$
y = r \sin(\theta) = 2 \sin(45^\circ) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}.
$$

Thus, the corresponding point in Cartesian coordinates is $\left(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}\right)$.
