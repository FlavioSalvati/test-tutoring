The Newton-Raphson method is a widely used iterative technique for finding the roots of a function.

To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we begin with an initial approximation of the root, denoted as $x_0$. We then utilize the following formula to calculate a new estimate:

$$
x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}
$$

In this expression, $f(x)$ represents the function for which we are seeking the root, while $f'(x)$ signifies its derivative. The result, $x_1$, serves as our updated estimate for the root. This process can be repeated, using $x_1$ as the new initial guess to refine our estimate further.

We continue this iterative process until we achieve a specified level of accuracy or until we reach a predetermined maximum number of iterations. The formula for the $n$th estimate, $x_n$, can be expressed as:

$$
x_n = x_{n-1} - \frac{f(x_{n-1})}{f'(x_{n-1})}
$$

While the Newton-Raphson method can be highly effective for locating roots, it is important to be aware of its limitations. The method may fail to converge to a root if the initial guess is significantly distant from the actual root, or if the function exhibits a flat region or a vertical tangent at the root. Additionally, there is a possibility that the method may converge to a different root or even to a point of inflection.

In summary, the Newton-Raphson method is a powerful tool for finding the roots of functions. However, it is essential to apply this method judiciously and to understand its potential limitations.
