The assignment problem in networks can be effectively solved using the Hungarian algorithm.

This problem involves determining the optimal allocation of tasks to workers, where each worker is limited to performing only one task, and each task can be assigned to only one worker. The Hungarian algorithm serves as a systematic method for addressing this challenge.

To begin utilizing the Hungarian algorithm, the first step is to construct a cost matrix. In this matrix, each row corresponds to a worker, while each column corresponds to a task. The entries in the matrix represent the cost associated with assigning a specific worker to a particular task. For instances where a worker is unable to perform a task, the cost is designated as infinity.

Next, we proceed by identifying the minimum cost within each row and subtracting this value from all the entries in that row. Following this, we find the minimum cost in each column and similarly subtract it from all the entries in that column. This process results in a new matrix that contains at least one zero in every row and column.

The subsequent step involves determining the optimal assignment by selecting zeros in the matrix, ensuring that no row or column has more than one selected zero. In cases where the number of zeros is less than the number of rows or columns, we can introduce additional zeros by drawing a minimum number of lines to cover all the zeros present in the matrix.

Ultimately, the optimal assignment can be derived by selecting the zeros that are covered by the minimum number of lines. The total cost of this optimal assignment is calculated as the sum of the entries in the original cost matrix that correspond to the selected zeros.

In summary, the Hungarian algorithm is a robust and efficient approach for solving the assignment problem in networks.
