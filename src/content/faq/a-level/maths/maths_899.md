Terminal velocity is defined as the maximum speed attained by an object in free fall when the resistance exerted by the medium it is moving through balances the force of gravity acting on it.

When an object descends through a fluid, such as air or water, it encounters two opposing forces: the downward gravitational force and the upward resistance force of the fluid. Initially, the gravitational force dominates, causing the object to accelerate downwards. However, as the object's speed increases, the resistance from the fluid simultaneously increases until it equals the gravitational force. At this equilibrium point, the object ceases to accelerate and falls at a constant speed known as terminal velocity.

The terminal velocity of an object is influenced by several factors, including its mass, size, shape, and the characteristics of the fluid through which it is falling. The terminal velocity can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}}
$$

In this equation:
- $v$ represents the terminal velocity,
- $m$ denotes the mass of the object,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $\rho$ is the density of the fluid,
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object, and
- $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, which varies based on the shape of the object.

For instance, consider a spherical object with a mass of $0.1 \, \text{kg}$ and a diameter of $0.05 \, \text{m}$ falling through air with a density of $1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3$. The drag coefficient for a sphere is approximately $0.47$. We can calculate the terminal velocity using the formula provided:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 0.1 \times 9.81}{1.2 \times \pi \times \left(0.025\right)^2 \times 0.47}} \approx 7.8 \, \text{m/s}
$$

Thus, the terminal velocity of the object is approximately $7.8 \, \text{m/s}$ when falling through air.
