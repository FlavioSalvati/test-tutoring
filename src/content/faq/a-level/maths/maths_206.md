The Cartesian form of a complex number provides a clear representation in terms of its real and imaginary components.

In the Cartesian form, a complex number is expressed as $a + bi$, where $a$ denotes the real part and $b$ signifies the imaginary part. In this representation, the real part corresponds to the horizontal axis, while the imaginary part aligns with the vertical axis on the complex plane.

To convert a complex number from polar form to Cartesian form, we utilize the following equation:

$$
a + bi = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
$$

In this equation, $r$ represents the modulus (or absolute value) of the complex number, and $\theta$ denotes the argument (or angle) of the complex number. For further insights into the relationship between Cartesian and trigonometric forms of complex numbers, please refer to our additional resources.

Conversely, to convert a complex number from Cartesian form to polar form, we apply the following formulas:

$$
r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
$$

Here, $r$ again denotes the modulus of the complex number, while $\theta$ indicates the argument.

The Cartesian form of a complex number is particularly advantageous for executing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When adding or subtracting complex numbers in Cartesian form, we simply combine the real parts and the imaginary parts separately. For multiplication and division, we employ the distributive property and the FOIL method. For a deeper exploration of these operations, please visit our dedicated page on the topic.
