To find the derivative of the function \( y = 3^x \), we apply the chain rule. We start by letting \( u = 3^x \) and thus \( y = f(u) = u \). The chain rule states that:

$$
y' = f'(u) \cdot u'
$$

Next, we need to determine \( f'(u) \). Since \( f(u) = u \), the derivative is straightforward:

$$
f'(u) = \frac{d}{du}(u) = 1
$$

Now, we compute \( u' \), which is the derivative of \( u = 3^x \). Using the formula for the derivative of an exponential function, we have:

$$
u' = \frac{d}{dx}(3^x) = \ln(3) \cdot 3^x
$$

Substituting \( f'(u) \) and \( u' \) back into the chain rule expression gives us:

$$
y' = f'(u) \cdot u' = 1 \cdot (\ln(3) \cdot 3^x) = \ln(3) \cdot 3^x
$$

Thus, we conclude that the derivative of \( y = 3^x \) is:

$$
y' = 3^x \ln(3)
$$

This result indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \( y = 3^x \) at any point \( (x, y) \) is given by \( 3^x \ln(3) \). The function \( y = 3^x \) is a prime example of an exponential function, which increases rapidly as \( x \) becomes larger. The derivative \( y' \) informs us about the rate of growth of the function at any specific point, while the term \( \ln(3) \) represents the growth rate relative to the base of the exponential function.
