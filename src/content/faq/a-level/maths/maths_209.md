To conduct a Student's t-test, the first step is to establish the null and alternative hypotheses. Following this, you will calculate the t-statistic and compare it to the critical value.

The Student's t-test is a statistical method used to assess whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. The null hypothesis posits that there is no significant difference between the group means, while the alternative hypothesis asserts that a significant difference does exist.

To carry out the t-test, begin by calculating the sample means and standard deviations for each group. Next, compute the pooled standard deviation using the following formula:

$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}
$$

In this formula, $n_1$ and $n_2$ represent the sample sizes, $s_1$ and $s_2$ denote the sample standard deviations, and $s_p$ is the pooled standard deviation.

After determining the pooled standard deviation, you can calculate the t-statistic using the formula:

$$
t = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
$$

In this equation, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the sample means.

Finally, compare the calculated t-statistic to the critical value obtained from the t-distribution table. The degrees of freedom for this comparison is given by $n_1 + n_2 - 2$, and you should also consider the desired level of significance. If the t-statistic exceeds the critical value, you should reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant difference between the means. Conversely, if the t-statistic does not exceed the critical value, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

It is crucial to remember that the t-test assumes that the populations being analyzed are normally distributed and have equal variances. If these assumptions are violated, it may be more appropriate to use alternative statistical tests, such as Welch's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test.
