In mathematical modeling, a variable is a symbol that denotes a quantity capable of changing.

Variables serve as essential components in mathematical models, representing quantities that can vary, such as time, distance, temperature, or population size. These variables can be classified into two categories: independent and dependent. Independent variables are those that remain unaffected by other variables within the model, whereas dependent variables are influenced by the values of other variables.

For instance, in the simple linear equation given by 

$$ y = mx + c, $$ 

the variable $y$ is the dependent variable, while $x$ serves as the independent variable. The value of $y$ is determined by the value of $x$, which can be altered. In this equation, $m$ and $c$ are constants, indicating that their values remain unchanged.

Furthermore, variables can be categorized as discrete or continuous. Discrete variables can only assume specific values, such as the number of students in a class or the number of cars parked in a lot. In contrast, continuous variables can take on any value within a defined range, such as temperature or time.

In the context of mathematical modeling, it is crucial to precisely define the variables utilized in the model and to clarify their interrelationships. This clarity is essential for making accurate predictions and conducting thorough analyses of the system being modeled.
