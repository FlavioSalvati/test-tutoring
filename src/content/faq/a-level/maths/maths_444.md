Here is the enhanced content for clarity and readability:

The integral of $ 10^x \, dx $ is given by 

$$ 
\frac{1}{\ln 10} 10^x + C 
$$ 

where $ C $ represents the constant of integration.

To derive this integral, we can apply the formula for integrating a constant raised to the power of $ x $. Specifically, the general formula is 

$$ 
\frac{1}{\ln a} a^x + C 
$$ 

where $ a $ is the constant. In our case, we set $ a = 10 $. Thus, the integral becomes 

$$ 
\frac{1}{\ln 10} 10^x + C. 
$$ 

To confirm the validity of this result, we can take the derivative of 

$$ 
\frac{1}{\ln 10} 10^x + C 
$$ 

using the power rule and the chain rule. The derivative of $ \frac{1}{\ln 10} 10^x $ is 

$$ 
\frac{1}{\ln 10} 10^x \ln 10. 
$$ 

Since the derivative of the constant $ C $ is zero, the overall derivative simplifies to 

$$ 
\frac{1}{\ln 10} 10^x \ln 10 = 10^x. 
$$ 

This matches the original integrand, confirming that our result is indeed correct.

In summary, the integral of $ 10^x \, dx $ can be expressed as 

$$ 
\frac{1}{\ln 10} 10^x + C 
$$ 

where $ C $ is the constant of integration. This conclusion is validated by differentiating the antiderivative and ensuring it returns to the original function.
