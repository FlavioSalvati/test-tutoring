The resultant force acting on an object is defined as the net force that affects its motion. 

When multiple forces are applied to an object, the resultant force is equivalent to a single force that produces the same effect as the combination of all those forces. It represents the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object.

To calculate the resultant force, we need to determine the vector sum of all the individual forces. This can be accomplished by separately adding the x-components and y-components of each force. For instance, consider two forces $F_1$ and $F_2$ acting on an object at angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ with respect to the x-axis. The x-component of force $F_1$ can be expressed as $F_1 \cos \theta_1$, while the x-component of force $F_2$ is $F_2 \cos \theta_2$. Similarly, the y-components are given by $F_1 \sin \theta_1$ for $F_1$ and $F_2 \sin \theta_2$ for $F_2$.

The resultant force $R$ can then be calculated using the following formula:

$$
R = \sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}
$$

where $R_x$ is the total sum of the x-components of all forces, and $R_y$ is the total sum of the y-components of all forces. To find the direction of the resultant force, you can use the formula:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{R_y}{R_x}\right)
$$

Here, $\theta$ represents the angle that the resultant force makes with the x-axis.

It is crucial to note that the concept of the resultant force is only applicable if the object is in equilibrium. If the object is accelerating, the resultant force is not zero and can be expressed using Newton's second law of motion, which states that the resultant force is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:

$$
F = ma
$$
