The formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by 

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d,
$$ 

where $a_n$ represents the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms.

An arithmetic sequence is characterized by the property that each term is derived by adding a fixed number, denoted as $d$, to the preceding term. The sequence can be expressed as follows: the first term is $a_1$, the second term is $a_2$, and this pattern continues with the $n$th term represented as $a_n$.

To derive the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Pattern:** Start by writing out the first few terms of the arithmetic sequence to observe the pattern. For example, consider the sequence: 

$$
2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \ldots
$$ 

2. **General Formula:** Write the general formula for the $n$th term of the sequence. We can express this as 

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d,
$$ 

where $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms.

3. **Substitute Known Values:** Next, substitute the known values of $a_1$ and $d$ into the formula. In our example, we have $a_1 = 2$ and $d = 3$. Therefore, we can write:

$$
a_n = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 3.
$$ 

4. **Simplify the Formula:** Finally, simplify the expression by expanding the brackets:

$$
a_n = 2 + 3(n-1) = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1.
$$ 

Thus, the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as 

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d,
$$ 

where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference. This formula allows you to determine any term in the sequence based on its position $n$.
