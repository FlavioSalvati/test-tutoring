To integrate the function $\sec^2(x)$, we can use the established formula:

$$
\int \sec^2(x) \, dx = \tan(x) + C
$$

where $C$ represents the constant of integration.

To understand this formula, we start with the derivative of $\tan(x)$:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \tan(x) = \sec^2(x)
$$

By integrating both sides with respect to $x$, we arrive at:

$$
\int \sec^2(x) \, dx = \tan(x) + C
$$

Thus, to find the integral of $\sec^2(x)$, simply apply the formula and include the constant of integration:

$$
\int \sec^2(x) \, dx = \tan(x) + C
$$

For instance, if we want to compute the integral of $\sec^2(3x)$, we can use the formula as follows:

$$
\int \sec^2(3x) \, dx = \tan(3x) + C
$$

It's important to note that this formula specifically applies to $\sec^2(x)$ and does not extend to other powers of $\sec(x)$. For integrating different powers of $\sec(x)$, alternative techniques must be employed.
