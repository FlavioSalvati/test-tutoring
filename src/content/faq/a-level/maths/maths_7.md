The identity for the hyperbolic secant function is derived from the definitions of hyperbolic functions.

Hyperbolic functions are expressed in terms of exponential functions. Specifically, the hyperbolic secant function is defined as:

$$
\text{sech}(x) = \frac{1}{\cosh(x)}
$$

where $\cosh(x)$ denotes the hyperbolic cosine function.

To derive the identity for $\text{sech}(x)$, we begin with the definition of $\cosh(x)$:

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
$$

By substituting this expression into the definition of $\text{sech}(x)$, we obtain:

$$
\text{sech}(x) = \frac{1}{\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}}
$$

Next, we simplify this expression by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by $2$:

$$
\text{sech}(x) = \frac{2}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

To further manipulate this expression, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by $e^x$:

$$
\text{sech}(x) = \frac{2e^x}{e^{2x} + 1}
$$

This gives us one form of the identity for the hyperbolic secant function. Additionally, we can express $\text{sech}(x)$ in other equivalent forms:

$$
\text{sech}(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{e^{2x} + 1}
$$

or

$$
\text{sech}(x) = \frac{1 - e^{-2x}}{e^{2x} + 1}
$$

These expressions provide different perspectives on the hyperbolic secant function, highlighting its relationship with exponential functions.
