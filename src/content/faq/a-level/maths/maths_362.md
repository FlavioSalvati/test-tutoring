A maximum cardinality matching in a network refers to the largest possible set of edges that do not share any vertices.

In graph theory, a matching is defined as a collection of edges in which no two edges share a common vertex. The cardinality of a matching is determined by the number of edges it contains. Therefore, a maximum cardinality matching represents the largest set of edges that can be selected without any shared vertices.

To identify a maximum cardinality matching within a network, one effective method is to employ the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. This algorithm is an adaptation of the Ford-Fulkerson method and utilizes breadth-first search (BFS) to discover an augmenting path. An augmenting path is defined as a route from a source vertex to a sink vertex that includes unused edges. The algorithm enhances the current matching by incorporating this augmenting path. This iterative process continues until no additional augmenting paths can be found.

Alternatively, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm can be used to determine a maximum cardinality matching. This algorithm is generally more efficient than the Edmonds-Karp algorithm and specifically operates on bipartite graphs. A bipartite graph consists of vertices that can be divided into two distinct sets, with edges only connecting vertices from one set to vertices from the other. The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm begins with an empty matching and identifies an augmenting path using depth-first search (DFS). The matching is then updated by alternating the edges present in the augmenting path.

In summary, a maximum cardinality matching in a network is characterized by the largest set of edges that do not share any vertices. Several algorithms, including the Edmonds-Karp and Hopcroft-Karp algorithms, can be employed to efficiently find such matchings.
