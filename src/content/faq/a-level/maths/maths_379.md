Let's clarify and enhance the content for better readability and understanding:

The inequality 

$$
|6x - 3| > 0 
$$ 

is true for any value of $ x $.

To understand this inequality, we first need to grasp the concept of absolute value. The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line. Therefore, $ |6x - 3| $ signifies the distance between $ 6x - 3 $ and zero.

Since the distance between any number and zero is always non-negative, and is strictly positive unless the number itself is zero, the inequality 

$$
|6x - 3| > 0 
$$ 

holds true for all values of $ x $ except when $ 6x - 3 = 0 $. 

To find when $ |6x - 3| = 0 $, we solve the equation:

$$
6x - 3 = 0 
$$

Solving for $ x $, we find:

$$
6x = 3 \implies x = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Thus, the only value for which the inequality 

$$
|6x - 3| > 0 
$$ 

is not true is $ x = \frac{1}{2} $. 

In conclusion, the inequality 

$$
|6x - 3| > 0 
$$ 

is satisfied for all values of $ x $ except $ x = \frac{1}{2} $. Therefore, the solution set for this inequality is all real numbers $ x $ except $ \frac{1}{2} $.
