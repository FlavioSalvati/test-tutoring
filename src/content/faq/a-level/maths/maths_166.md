An object subjected to a centripetal force moves along a circular path at a constant speed.

When a centripetal force acts on an object, it compels the object to follow a circular trajectory while maintaining a constant speed. This force is directed towards the center of the circle and is essential for keeping the object in its circular motion. The magnitude of the centripetal force is expressed by the formula:

$$
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$

where \( F_c \) represents the centripetal force, \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( v \) is its speed, and \( r \) is the radius of the circular path.

The direction of the centripetal force is always inward, toward the center of the circle. As a result, while the object continuously changes its direction, its speed remains unchanged. The velocity of the object is tangent to the circular path at any point, and its acceleration, directed towards the center, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

The period of the circular motion, defined as the time required for the object to complete one full revolution around the circle, is given by the equation:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}
$$

where \( T \) is the period, \( r \) is the radius of the circle, and \( v \) is the speed of the object.

In summary, an object under the influence of a centripetal force travels in a circular path at a constant speed. The centripetal force acts towards the circle's center, with a magnitude described by \( F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} \). The object's velocity is tangent to the circle, and its acceleration points toward the center, with a magnitude of \( a = \frac{v^2}{r} \). Additionally, the period of circular motion is given by \( T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} \).
