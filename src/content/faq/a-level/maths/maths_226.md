The quadratic equation with roots $\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\frac{1}{2}$ has coefficients $4$, $0$, and $-1$.

To derive the quadratic equation with these specific roots, we can express it in factored form as follows:

$$(x - \frac{1}{2})(x + \frac{1}{2}) = 0$$

Next, we will expand this expression:

$$
(x - \frac{1}{2})(x + \frac{1}{2}) = x^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)x + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)x - \frac{1}{4} = 0
$$

Upon simplifying this, we obtain:

$$
x^2 - \frac{1}{4} = 0
$$

To express this equation in standard form, we will multiply both sides by $4$:

$$
4x^2 - 1 = 0
$$

In this quadratic equation, the coefficients are as follows: the coefficient of $x^2$ is $4$, the coefficient of $x$ is $0$ (since there is no $x$ term), and the constant term is $-1$. Therefore, the quadratic equation with roots $\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\frac{1}{2}$ can be expressed as:

$$
4x^2 - 1 = 0
$$
