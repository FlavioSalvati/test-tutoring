### How to Use Borůvka's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree

Borůvka's algorithm is a greedy algorithm designed to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph. The algorithm operates by repeatedly adding the least expensive edge that connects two components of the graph until all vertices are united in a single component.

#### Steps to Implement Borůvka's Algorithm

To utilize Borůvka's algorithm, we begin by initializing each vertex as an individual component. The following steps are repeated until all vertices are connected:

1. For each component, identify the cheapest edge that connects it to another component.
2. Add these edges to the minimum spanning tree.
3. Merge the components that are linked by the newly added edges.

This process continues until all vertices are connected, resulting in a minimum spanning tree.

#### Example Illustration

Let's demonstrate this algorithm with a specific example. Consider the following graph:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
2 \\
A-----B \\
|\ \ \ /| \\
| \ / \ | \\
3 | X | 1 \\
| / \ | \\
|/ \ | \\
C-----D \\
4 \\
\end{array}
$$

1. **Initialization**: We begin by treating each vertex as a separate component:

   ```
   Components: A B C D
   ```

2. **First Iteration**:
   - For each component, find the cheapest edge connecting it to another component:
     - Component A connects to B with weight $2$.
     - Component C connects to D with weight $4$.
   - Add these edges to the minimum spanning tree:
     - Include edge AB with weight $2$.
     - Include edge CD with weight $4$.
   - Merge the components linked by these edges:
     - Merge components A and B.
     - Merge components C and D.

   Now the remaining components are:

   ```
   Components: AB C D
   ```

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - Again, for each component, find the cheapest edge linking to another component:
     - Component AB connects to CD with weight $1$.
   - Add this edge to the minimum spanning tree:
     - Include edge AB-CD with weight $1$.
   - Merge the components connected by this edge:
     - Merge components AB and CD.

Now, all vertices are connected, and we have constructed the minimum spanning tree:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
2 \\
A-----B \\
\ \backslash \ \\
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\
C-----D \\
4 \\
\end{array}
$$

In conclusion, Borůvka's algorithm efficiently constructs a minimum spanning tree by progressively merging components based on the minimum edge weights.
