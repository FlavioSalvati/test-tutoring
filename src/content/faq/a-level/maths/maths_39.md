Self-weighted random sampling is a technique for selecting a sample from a population in which every individual has an equal opportunity to be chosen. However, the likelihood of selection is proportional to each individual's weight or size.

In this method, each individual in the population is assigned a weight or size that reflects their significance or contribution to the overall group. As a result, individuals with greater weights or sizes have a higher probability of being selected for the sample.

To carry out self-weighted random sampling, we begin by assigning weights or sizes to each individual in the population. Next, we calculate the total weight or size of the entire population. Each individual's weight or size is then divided by this total to determine their selection probability. We can then utilize a random number generator to select individuals for the sample, using these calculated probabilities as selection weights.

This method is particularly valuable when it is essential for the sample to accurately represent the population concerning a characteristic linked to weight or size. For instance, in a study examining the impact of income on health outcomes, we might assign weights to individuals based on their income levels. This would allow us to employ self-weighted random sampling to ensure that our sample reflects the income distribution of the population.

In summary, self-weighted random sampling is a robust technique for obtaining representative samples from various populations. It can be effectively applied in a multitude of contexts within statistics and data analysis.
