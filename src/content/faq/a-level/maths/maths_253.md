The momentum change in a collision is equal to the impulse applied during the collision.

When two objects collide, they exert forces on each other for a certain amount of time. This force causes a change in momentum of both objects. The momentum change of an object is equal to the impulse applied to it during the collision.

The impulse is defined as the product of the force and the time for which it acts. Mathematically, impulse (J) = force (F) x time (t). Therefore, the momentum change (Δp) of an object can be calculated using the formula Δp = J = Ft.

In a collision, the impulse is equal and opposite for both objects, according to Newton's third law of motion. Therefore, the momentum change of one object is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the momentum change of the other object.

The momentum change can also be expressed in terms of the initial and final velocities of the objects. If the initial velocity of an object is u and the final velocity is v, then the momentum change is given by Δp = m(v-u), where m is the mass of the object.

In summary, the momentum change in a collision is equal to the impulse applied during the collision, which can be calculated using the force and time of the collision. The momentum change can also be expressed in terms of the initial and final velocities of the objects.
