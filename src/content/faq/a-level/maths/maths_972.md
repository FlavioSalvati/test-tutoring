The formulas for the cosine of the sum and difference of two angles can be established through the application of trigonometric identities.

To prove the formula for the cosine of the sum of two angles, we begin with the following identity:

$$
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.
$$

We can demonstrate this identity using the angle addition formula for cosine:

$$
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B + \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
$$

Rearranging the terms, we get:

$$
\cos(A + B) = \cos A (\cos B + \sin B) - \sin A (\sin B - \cos B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.
$$

Next, we will prove the formula for the cosine of the difference of two angles. The relevant identity is:

$$
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B.
$$

To establish this identity, we substitute $-B$ for $B$ in the cosine sum formula:

$$
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos(-B) - \sin A \sin(-B).
$$

Utilizing the even and odd properties of the cosine and sine functions, we find:

$$
\cos(-B) = \cos B \quad \text{and} \quad \sin(-B) = -\sin B.
$$

Thus, the expression becomes:

$$
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B.
$$

In conclusion, we have successfully proven the formulas for the cosine of the sum and difference of two angles using trigonometric identities.
