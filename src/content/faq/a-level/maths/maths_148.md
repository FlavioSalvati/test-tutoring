The complement of an event refers to the probability of that event not occurring. It is denoted as $P(A')$.

To calculate the probability of the complement of an event, we subtract the probability of the event itself from 1. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
$$

For instance, if the probability of event $A$ occurring is $0.3$, the probability of its complement, $A'$, not occurring is $0.7$. This can be computed as follows:

$$
P(A') = 1 - P(A) \\
P(A') = 1 - 0.3 \\
P(A') = 0.7
$$

The complement rule is particularly useful for indirectly determining the probability of an event. For example, if we want to find the probability of event $A$, but it is easier to calculate the probability of its complement, $A'$, we can utilize the complement rule to find $P(A)$.

As an illustration, if the probability of $A'$ occurring is $0.6$, then the probability of $A$ occurring can be calculated as follows:

$$
P(A) = 1 - P(A') \\
P(A) = 1 - 0.6 \\
P(A) = 0.4
$$

In summary, the probability of the complement of an event is derived by subtracting the probability of the event from 1. The complement rule can also be employed to determine the probability of an event indirectly.
