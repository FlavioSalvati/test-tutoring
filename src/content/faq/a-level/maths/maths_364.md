The cubic equation with roots $1$, $-2$, and $3$ can be expressed with the coefficients $-6$, $2$, $-7$, and $1$.

To derive the coefficients of a cubic equation from given roots, we utilize the factored form of the equation:

$$(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3) = 0$$

where $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ represent the roots. Expanding this expression yields:

$$x^3 - (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)x^2 + (r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3)x - r_1r_2r_3 = 0$$

Consequently, the coefficients of the cubic equation can be defined as follows:

- $a = 1$ (the leading coefficient),
- $b = -(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)$,
- $c = r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3$,
- $d = -r_1r_2r_3$.

Substituting the specified roots into these equations, we calculate:

- $a = 1$,
- $b = -(1 + (-2) + 3) = -2$,
- $c = (1)(-2) + (1)(3) + (-2)(3) = -2 + 3 - 6 = -5$,
- $d = -(1)(-2)(3) = 6$.

Thus, the cubic equation with roots $1$, $-2$, and $3$ is represented as:

$$x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$$
