Free fall refers to the motion of an object that is solely influenced by the force of gravity.

When an object is in free fall, it accelerates towards the ground at a constant rate of $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$. This acceleration, represented by the symbol $g$, is a constant value on the surface of the Earth, resulting from the gravitational force acting on the object.

The motion of an object in free fall can be analyzed using the equations of motion. For instance, the distance an object falls can be determined by the following equation:

$$
d = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$

In this equation, $d$ represents the distance fallen, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $t$ is the time the object has been falling.

Additionally, the velocity of an object in free fall can be calculated using the equation:

$$
v = g t
$$

Here, $v$ denotes the velocity of the object after a time $t$ of free fall.

It's crucial to recognize that air resistance can influence the motion of an object in free fall. In the absence of air resistance, all objects, regardless of their mass or size, experience the same acceleration due to gravity. This phenomenon is known as the equivalence principle, which was famously demonstrated by Galileo in the 16th century.
