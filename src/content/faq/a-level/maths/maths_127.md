The principle of moments for a couple states that the sum of the moments created by the forces in a couple is equal to zero.

When two equal and opposite forces act on a body, they form what is known as a couple. The distance separating these two forces is referred to as the arm of the couple. The moment of a force about a specific point is defined as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from that point to the line of action of the force. For a couple, the moment is determined by taking one of the forces and multiplying it by the arm of the couple.

Let's consider a couple consisting of forces $F$ and $-F$ acting at a distance $d$ apart. The moment of the force $F$ about point $O$ is given by $Fd$, while the moment of the force $-F$ about point $O$ is $-Fd$. Therefore, the sum of the moments of the forces in the couple can be expressed as:

$$
Fd + (-Fd) = 0
$$

This equation indicates that the couple has no net effect on the overall motion of the body it acts upon. However, it is important to note that the couple generates a torque, which quantifies the tendency of the couple to induce rotation in the body about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the couple. The torque produced by a couple is equal to the moment of the couple divided by the moment of inertia of the body about the designated axis of rotation.

The principle of moments for a couple is a fundamental concept in mechanics, used extensively to analyze the motion of rigid bodies under the influence of forces and torques. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in various engineering applications, including the design of machinery and structural components.
