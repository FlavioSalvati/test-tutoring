Speed refers to the rate at which an object moves, while velocity describes the rate of movement in a specified direction.

Speed is a scalar quantity, which means it possesses only magnitude and lacks a directional component. It can be calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the time taken. The formula for speed is given by:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
$$

For instance, if a car covers a distance of $100 \, \text{km}$ in $2 \, \text{hours}$, its speed can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{100 \, \text{km}}{2 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{km/hour}
$$

In contrast, velocity is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. It is determined by dividing the displacement (the change in position) by the time taken. The formula for velocity is:

$$
\text{Velocity} = \frac{\text{Displacement}}{\text{Time}}
$$

For example, if a car travels $100 \, \text{km}$ to the north in $2 \, \text{hours}$, its velocity can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Velocity} = \frac{100 \, \text{km north}}{2 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{km/hour north}
$$

It's crucial to understand that velocity incorporates the direction of motion, whereas speed does not. Consequently, two objects can have the same speed but different velocities if they are moving in different directions.
