The hyperbolic cotangent function, denoted as $\text{coth}(x)$, is defined as the ratio of the hyperbolic cosine function to the hyperbolic sine function. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\text{coth}(x) = \frac{\cosh(x)}{\sinh(x)}
$$

Here, the hyperbolic cosine function $\cosh(x)$ is defined by the formula:

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
$$

and the hyperbolic sine function $\sinh(x)$ is defined as:

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
$$

Using these definitions, the hyperbolic cotangent function can be rewritten as:

$$
\text{coth}(x) = \frac{\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}}{\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}} = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{e^x - e^{-x}}
$$

The hyperbolic cotangent function possesses several important properties. It is an odd function, which implies that:

$$
\text{coth}(-x) = -\text{coth}(x)
$$

Additionally, it is continuous for all real values of $x$, except at $x = 0$, where it has a vertical asymptote.

The graph of the hyperbolic cotangent function bears resemblance to that of the tangent function; however, it is symmetric with respect to the y-axis and features horizontal asymptotes at $y = 1$ and $y = -1$.

The hyperbolic cotangent function finds applications in various fields of mathematics, including complex analysis, differential equations, and probability theory. Moreover, it is utilized in physics to model the behavior of certain physical systems, such as the relaxation of a magnetic moment in the presence of a magnetic field.
