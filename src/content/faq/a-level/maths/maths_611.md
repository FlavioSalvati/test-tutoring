To find the derivative of the function $ y = \sqrt{x} $, we can apply the power rule of differentiation. We start by rewriting the square root function in terms of exponents:

$$
y = x^{1/2}.
$$

Using the power rule, which states that the derivative of $ x^n $ is $ n \cdot x^{n-1} $, we differentiate $ y $:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2}.
$$

Next, we can simplify this expression. Recall that $ x^{-1/2} $ can be rewritten as $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} $. Hence, we have:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
$$

Thus, the derivative of $ y = \sqrt{x} $ is 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
$$

This result indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the curve $ y = \sqrt{x} $ at any point $ (x, \sqrt{x}) $ is given by $ \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} $.
