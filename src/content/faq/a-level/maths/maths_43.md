In probability theory, an event is defined as a set of outcomes derived from an experiment. 

More specifically, an event is a subset of the sample space, which encompasses all possible outcomes of that experiment. For instance, when tossing a coin, the sample space is represented as $\{ \text{heads}, \text{tails} \}$. An example of an event could be the subset $\{ \text{heads} \}$, which indicates the outcome of obtaining heads on the coin toss. Alternatively, the event $\{ \text{heads}, \text{tails} \}$ represents the scenario of getting either heads or tails.

Events can be categorized into two main types: simple and compound. A simple event consists of a single outcome, while a compound event encompasses multiple outcomes. In the coin toss example, the event $\{ \text{heads} \}$ qualifies as a simple event, whereas the event $\{ \text{heads}, \text{tails} \}$ is considered a compound event.

Furthermore, events can also be classified as mutually exclusive or independent. Mutually exclusive events are those that cannot occur simultaneously, while independent events are those whose probabilities do not influence each other. For example, when rolling a die, the events $\{ \text{rolling a 1} \}$ and $\{ \text{rolling a 2} \}$ are mutually exclusive, as both outcomes cannot happen at the same time. Conversely, the events $\{ \text{rolling an odd number} \}$ and $\{ \text{rolling a number greater than 3} \}$ are independent, as the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.

In summary, an event in probability represents a collection of outcomes from an experiment. These events can be classified as simple or compound, and they can also be mutually exclusive or independent.
