Network random sampling is a technique employed to select a random sample from a network, making it particularly valuable in the field of social network analysis. Researchers utilize this method to examine the relationships among individuals within a network. The primary objective of network random sampling is to ensure that the selected sample is both representative of the entire network and devoid of bias.

To begin the process of network random sampling, researchers first identify the nodes, which represent the individuals within the network. They then randomly select a subset of these nodes to form the sample. To enhance the representativeness of the sample, researchers may employ various sampling techniques, such as stratified sampling or cluster sampling.

After the sample is established, researchers analyze the relationships among the individuals within it. This analysis may involve calculating various centrality measures, such as degree centrality, which quantifies the number of connections each individual has within the network, or betweenness centrality, which assesses how often an individual lies on the shortest path between other individuals in the network.

In summary, network random sampling serves as an effective technique for investigating the relationships among individuals in a network. By ensuring that the sample is both random and representative, researchers can uncover valuable insights into the overall structure and dynamics of the network.
