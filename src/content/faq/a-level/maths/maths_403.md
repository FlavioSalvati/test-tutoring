To calculate the moment of force, also known as torque, you need to multiply the force applied by the perpendicular distance from the pivot point.

The moment of force is a measure of the rotational effect that a force exerts around a pivot. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Moment of Force} = \text{Force} \times \text{Perpendicular Distance from Pivot}
$$

The unit of measurement for moment of force is newton-meters (Nm).

For instance, consider a scenario where a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ is applied at a distance of $0.5 \, \text{m}$ from a pivot. In this case, the moment of force can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Moment of Force} = 10 \, \text{N} \times 0.5 \, \text{m} = 5 \, \text{Nm}
$$

This indicates that the force creates a turning effect of $5 \, \text{Nm}$ around the pivot.

It is crucial to understand that the perpendicular distance from the pivot is defined as the shortest distance between the pivot and the line of action of the force. If the force is not applied perpendicularly to the pivot, you will need to use the perpendicular component of the force to accurately calculate the moment of force.

In summary, to determine the moment of force, simply multiply the force by the perpendicular distance from the pivot. This formula has practical applications in various contexts, such as calculating the torque required to turn a bolt or the force necessary to lift a lever.
