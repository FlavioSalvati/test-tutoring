To determine the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence, you can use the formula:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

where:
- $a_1$ is the first term of the sequence,
- $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms, and
- $n$ is the position of the term you want to find.

An arithmetic sequence is defined as a sequence of numbers in which each term is derived by adding a fixed value, known as the common difference, to the preceding term. For instance, the sequence $2, 5, 8, 11, 14$ is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $3$.

To find the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence, you need to know three key values: the first term ($a_1$), the common difference ($d$), and the term number ($n$). With these values, you can apply the formula:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

For example, letâ€™s calculate the $10$th term of the arithmetic sequence $2, 5, 8, 11, 14$. In this case, we have:

- $a_1 = 2$
- $d = 3$
- $n = 10$

Substituting these values into the formula gives us:

$$
a_{10} = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$
$$
a_{10} = 2 + (10-1) \cdot 3
$$
$$
a_{10} = 2 + 27
$$
$$
a_{10} = 29
$$

Thus, the $10$th term of the arithmetic sequence $2, 5, 8, 11, 14$ is $29$.

It's important to remember that the formula 

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$ 

is specific to arithmetic sequences. If you encounter a different type of sequence, you will need to utilize a different formula or method to find the $n$th term.
