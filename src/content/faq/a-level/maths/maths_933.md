A relative frequency histogram illustrates the proportion of data belonging to each category.

To interpret a relative frequency histogram, begin by identifying the categories represented on the x-axis and the relative frequencies displayed on the y-axis. The height of each bar indicates the proportion of data that falls within its corresponding category. Importantly, the total area of all the bars combined should equal $1$.

For instance, consider a relative frequency histogram that depicts the heights of a group of individuals. The x-axis might be labeled with intervals of $5 \, \text{cm}$, while the y-axis could be marked in intervals of $0.1$. Here, the height of each bar reflects the proportion of people whose heights fall within each specified interval.

When analyzing the data, look for patterns within the histogram. Are there any noticeable peaks or clusters? Is the data skewed toward one side? Are there any outliers present? These observations can reveal significant insights into the underlying distribution of the data.

Additionally, it is crucial to take into account the sample size and any potential biases in the data collection process. A small sample size may not accurately represent the entire population, and biased data could lead to flawed conclusions.

In conclusion, a relative frequency histogram serves as a valuable tool for visualizing and interpreting data. By recognizing patterns and considering factors such as sample size and biases, we can deepen our understanding of the underlying distribution of the data.
