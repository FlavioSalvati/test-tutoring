To utilize the Union-Find algorithm for cycle detection in a graph, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Disjoint Sets**: Create a disjoint set for each vertex in the graph. Each set initially contains only one element, which is the vertex itself.
   
2. **Process Each Edge**: For every edge $(u, v)$ in the graph, perform the following:
   - Use the *find* operation to determine the roots of the sets containing vertices $u$ and $v$.
   
3. **Detect Cycles**: 
   - If the roots of $u$ and $v$ are the same, it indicates that both vertices belong to the same set, signifying the presence of a cycle in the graph.
   - If the roots are different, proceed to the next step.
   
4. **Union of Sets**: Merge the sets containing $u$ and $v$ by applying the *union* operation, which makes the root of one set the parent of the other.

The Union-Find algorithm, also known as the Disjoint Set Union (DSU), is an efficient data structure that manages a collection of elements partitioned into distinct subsets. It supports two primary operations: 

- The *find* operation, which returns the root of the set that contains a specified element.
- The *union* operation, which combines two sets into a single set by assigning the root of one set as the parent of the root of the other.

By implementing the Union-Find algorithm for cycle detection in a graph, we systematically check for cycles while efficiently managing the connectivity of the vertices involved.
