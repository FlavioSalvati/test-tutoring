Systematic sampling is a method for selecting a sample from a population in a structured and consistent manner.

This technique involves choosing every $k$th element from the population, where $k$ is a constant value. Initially, a random element is selected from the first $k$ elements, and then every $k$th element is chosen sequentially until the desired sample size is achieved. Systematic sampling is particularly advantageous when the population is too large to sample every individual, yet a representative sample is still necessary.

For instance, if a company wishes to survey its customers but faces a substantial customer base, it could employ systematic sampling to obtain a representative sample. The company might randomly select the first customer from the initial 10 customers and then proceed to select every 10th customer thereafter until the target sample size is met.

The formula for determining the sampling interval, denoted as $k$, is given by:

$$
k = \frac{\text{population size}}{\text{sample size}}
$$

For example, if a population consists of 1000 elements and the desired sample size is 100, the sampling interval would be calculated as follows:

$$
k = \frac{1000}{100} = 10
$$

Thus, every 10th element would be included in the sample.

It is important to note that systematic sampling can introduce bias if there is a pattern in the population that aligns with the sampling interval. To mitigate this potential bias, one can use a random starting point or vary the sampling interval.
