The double angle formula for sine is expressed as:

$$
\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta).
$$

To establish the validity of the double angle formula for sine, we begin with the sine addition formula:

$$
\sin(A + B) = \sin(A)\cos(B) + \cos(A)\sin(B).
$$

By setting $ A = \theta $ and $ B = \theta $, we can rewrite this as:

$$
\sin(2\theta) = \sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) + \cos(\theta)\sin(\theta).
$$

Applying the commutative property of multiplication allows us to combine the two terms:

$$
\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta).
$$

Thus, we have successfully proven the double angle formula for sine.
