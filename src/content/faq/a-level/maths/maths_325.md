To determine the maximum matching in a network, we can utilize the augmenting path algorithm.

The augmenting path algorithm is a systematic approach for finding the maximum matching in a bipartite graph. This method involves identifying a path that begins and ends with unmatched vertices, while alternating between matched and unmatched edges. By leveraging this path, we can enhance the current matching by toggling the status of the edges that lie along the path.

The algorithm initiates with an empty matching and iteratively searches for augmenting paths until no further paths can be found. To conduct this search for augmenting paths, one can employ either a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS). Upon discovering an augmenting path, we can change the status of the edges along the path, resulting in a new matching. This process continues until all possible augmenting paths have been exhausted.

To illustrate this algorithm, consider the following network:

$$
\text{A} \quad -- \quad \text{B} \\
| \quad \quad \quad | \\
\text{C} \quad -- \quad \text{D}
$$

Suppose we aim to find the maximum matching. We begin with an empty matching and search for augmenting paths. One possible augmenting path is $A \to C \to D \to B$, which alternates between matched and unmatched edges. By flipping the status of the edges along this path, we derive a new matching:

$$
\text{A} \quad -- \quad \text{B} \\
| \quad \quad \quad | \\
\text{C} \quad \text{D}
$$

Next, we continue to search for additional augmenting paths and repeat the process until no further augmenting paths can be identified. In this scenario, there are no additional augmenting paths available, leading us to conclude that the maximum matching is represented as:

$$
\text{A} \quad \text{B} \\
| \quad | \\
\text{C} \quad \text{D}
$$

In summary, the augmenting path algorithm serves as a robust technique for identifying the maximum matching in a network. It involves the systematic search for augmenting paths and the subsequent toggling of edge statuses to achieve a new matching. This algorithm can be effectively implemented using either depth-first search or breadth-first search methods.
