The standard normal distribution is a specific type of normal distribution characterized by a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$. 

As a widely used probability distribution in statistics and probability theory, the standard normal distribution has a probability density function (PDF) defined by the following equation:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}
$$

In this expression, $x$ represents a random variable, $e$ signifies the base of the natural logarithm, and $\pi$ denotes the mathematical constant pi.

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution is represented by $\Phi(x)$ and is defined as:

$$
\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{x} e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}} \, dt
$$

Here, the integral $\int_{-\infty}^{x}$ indicates the area under the curve from negative infinity up to the value of $x$.

The significance of the standard normal distribution lies in its ability to standardize any normal distribution. This standardization process allows any normal distribution to be transformed into a standard normal distribution by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The formula for standardization is given by:

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

In this formula, $z$ represents the standardized variable, $x$ is the original variable, $\mu$ is the mean of the original variable, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the original variable.

In summary, the standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$. Its ability to standardize any normal distribution makes it an essential tool in statistical analysis.
