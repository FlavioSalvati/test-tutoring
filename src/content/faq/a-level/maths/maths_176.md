The quadratic formula provides a systematic method for determining the roots of a quadratic equation.

To derive the quadratic formula, we begin with the standard form of a quadratic equation, which is given by 

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0,
$$ 

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. We can isolate $x$ by completing the square:

1. Start with the equation:
   $$
   ax^2 + bx + c = 0
   $$
   
2. Rearrange it to isolate the constant term:
   $$
   ax^2 + bx = -c
   $$
   
3. Factor out the coefficient $a$ from the left side:
   $$
   a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x\right) = -c
   $$

4. To complete the square, add and subtract $\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$ inside the parentheses:
   $$
   a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\right) = -c + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2
   $$

5. This simplifies to:
   $$
   a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}
   $$

6. Taking the square root of both sides results in:
   $$
   x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}
   $$

7. Finally, solving for $x$ gives us the quadratic formula:
   $$
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
   $$

This formula yields the two roots of the quadratic equation, which can be either real or complex, depending on the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$. 

- If the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex conjugates.
- If the discriminant is zero, the roots are equal (or a double root).
- If the discriminant is positive, the roots are real and distinct.

The quadratic formula is an essential tool for solving quadratic equations and is widely used in mathematics, science, and engineering. It allows for a quick and efficient determination of the roots of any quadratic equation without the need for completing the square or applying other methods. Understanding the derivation and application of the quadratic formula is fundamental for students studying algebra.
