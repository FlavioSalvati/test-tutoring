Bottleneck paths are critical paths within a network that restrict the flow of data or traffic.

In a network, data or traffic transfers between nodes through various routes. However, certain paths may possess limited capacity or bandwidth, which can hinder the overall flow of data or traffic. These restrictive paths are referred to as bottleneck paths.

Bottleneck paths can be found in a variety of network types, including computer networks, transportation networks, and communication networks. For instance, in a computer network, a bottleneck path might be a link connecting two switches that has a lower bandwidth compared to other links in the network. This disparity can lead to congestion and a slowdown in data transmission.

To identify bottleneck paths within a network, several techniques can be employed, such as network analysis and simulation. Network analysis involves examining the topology and characteristics of the network to pinpoint potential bottlenecks. Conversely, simulation entails modeling the flow of data or traffic within the network to uncover actual bottlenecks.

Once bottleneck paths are identified, they can be mitigated by increasing the capacity or bandwidth of the path or by rerouting traffic through alternative routes. These strategies can significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of the network.
