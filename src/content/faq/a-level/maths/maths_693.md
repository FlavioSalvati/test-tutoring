Conditional probability refers to the likelihood of an event occurring, contingent upon the occurrence of another event. It is mathematically expressed as $P(A|B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are two events. The vertical bar '$|$' signifies "given that." For instance, $P(A|B)$ represents the probability of event $A$ occurring, given that event $B$ has already taken place.

The formula for calculating conditional probability is given by:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}
$$

In this equation, $P(A \text{ and } B)$ denotes the probability that both events $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously, while $P(B)$ represents the probability of event $B$ occurring.

Conditional probability has numerous practical applications in various fields, including medical diagnoses, weather forecasting, and financial analysis. For example, in the context of medical diagnoses, the probability that a patient has a particular disease may depend on factors such as their age, gender, and existing health conditions. By applying conditional probability, healthcare professionals can arrive at more precise diagnoses and tailor effective treatment plans.

It's crucial to understand that conditional probability differs from unconditional probability. For example, the probability of rolling a $6$ on a fair die is $\frac{1}{6}$. However, if it is known that the die has already landed on an odd number, the probability of subsequently rolling a $6$ becomes $0$, as it is impossible to roll a $6$ when the only possible outcomes are odd numbers.
