The energy transformations in a simple harmonic oscillator involve a continuous exchange between potential energy and kinetic energy.

In a typical simple harmonic oscillator, such as a mass-spring system, energy oscillates between potential energy and kinetic energy. When the mass reaches its maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, it possesses maximum potential energy. As the mass moves toward equilibrium, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At the equilibrium point, the mass achieves its maximum kinetic energy while the potential energy drops to zero. As the mass then moves away from equilibrium, kinetic energy is transformed back into potential energy.

According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy of the system remains constant throughout this process. This principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2
$$

where $E$ represents the total energy of the system, $k$ is the spring constant, and $A$ is the amplitude of the oscillation.

The maximum potential energy and maximum kinetic energy can also be defined mathematically as follows:

$$
E_p = \frac{1}{2} k A^2
$$

$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

In these equations, $E_p$ denotes the potential energy, $E_k$ denotes the kinetic energy, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $v$ is its velocity.

In summary, the energy transformations in a simple harmonic oscillator involve a cyclical conversion between potential energy and kinetic energy, with the total energy of the system remaining constant throughout the oscillation.
