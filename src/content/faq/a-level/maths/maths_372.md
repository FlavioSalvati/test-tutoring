To maximize the objective function $3x + 4y$, we need to consider the following constraints:

$$
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad x + y \leq 5, \\
2. & \quad x \leq 3, \\
3. & \quad y \leq 4, \\
4. & \quad x \geq 0, \\
5. & \quad y \geq 0.
\end{align*}
$$

We will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. The first step is to graph the feasible region defined by the constraints.

1. **Graphing the Constraints**:
   - The constraint $x + y \leq 5$ can be represented by the line $x + y = 5$, which intersects the axes at the points $(0, 5)$ and $(5, 0)$.
   - The constraint $x \leq 3$ is depicted by a vertical line passing through the point $(3, 0)$.
   - The constraint $y \leq 4$ is shown by a horizontal line passing through the point $(0, 4)$.

2. **Identifying the Feasible Region**:
   After plotting these lines, we shade the feasible region that satisfies all the constraints. In this case, the feasible region forms a triangle bounded by the lines $x + y = 5$, $x = 3$, and $y = 4$.

3. **Graphing the Objective Function**:
   Next, we consider the objective function $3x + 4y = k$, where $k$ is a constant. We can graph this by selecting various values for $k$ and drawing the corresponding line. As we adjust $k$, we will move the line parallel to itself until it touches the feasible region at a corner point.

4. **Finding the Maximum Value**:
   We repeat this process for different values of $k$ until we identify the maximum value of the objective function $3x + 4y$. In this problem, the maximum occurs at the corner point $(3, 2)$. We can calculate the maximum value as follows:

   $$
   3(3) + 4(2) = 9 + 8 = 17.
   $$

In conclusion, the solution to the linear programming problem is:

$$
\begin{align*}
x & = 3, \\
y & = 2,
\end{align*}
$$

and the maximum value of the objective function is $17$.
