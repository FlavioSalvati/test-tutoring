The integral of $\frac{1}{x} \, dx$ is given by the expression $\ln|x| + C$, where $C$ represents the constant of integration.

To evaluate the integral $\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx$, we can utilize the formula for the natural logarithm: 

$$\ln(x) = \int \frac{1}{x} \, dx.$$

This allows us to rewrite the integral as:

$$\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C,$$

with $C$ being the constant of integration.

To understand why this result holds true, we can differentiate $\ln|x| + C$ with respect to $x$. Applying the chain rule, we find that:

$$\frac{d}{dx} \ln|x| = \frac{1}{x}.$$

Consequently, the derivative of $\ln|x| + C$ is indeed $\frac{1}{x}$.

Thus, we confirm that the integral of $\frac{1}{x} \, dx$ is:

$$\ln|x| + C,$$

where $C$ is the constant of integration. It is important to note that the absolute value notation is necessary, as the natural logarithm $\ln(x)$ is undefined for $x \leq 0$.
