The radial force in circular motion can be determined using the formula 

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$ 

where \( m \) represents the mass of the object, \( v \) denotes its velocity, and \( r \) signifies the radius of the circular path.

Circular motion refers to the movement of an object along a circular trajectory. While the object's speed remains constant, its velocity changes continuously due to the alteration in direction. This necessitates the presence of a force to maintain the object's circular path; this force is known as the radial force.

The radial force acts toward the center of the circle and is perpendicular to the object's velocity vector. It can be calculated using the formula 

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$ 

Again, \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( v \) is its velocity, and \( r \) is the radius of the circular path.

To grasp the application of this formula, consider a car navigating around a circular track. As the car maneuvers through the turn, it experiences a force that pulls it towards the center of the track. This centripetal force arises from the friction between the car's tires and the track surface. The relationship is clear: the faster the car travels, the greater the radial force needed to keep it moving in a circle. Likewise, if the radius of the track decreases, the required force to prevent the car from veering off the track increases correspondingly.
