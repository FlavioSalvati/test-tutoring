The sum-to-product identities in trigonometry serve as powerful tools for simplifying expressions that involve the sum or difference of two angles. 

### First Identity: Sine of the Sum

The first identity states that:

$$
\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
$$

To demonstrate this identity, we begin with the left-hand side:

$$
\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
$$

We can express this as a fraction over 1:

$$
\sin(A+B) = \frac{\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B}{1}.
$$

Then, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B)$:

$$
\sin(A+B) = \frac{(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B)}{\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B}.
$$

Expanding the numerator, we get:

$$
\sin A \cos A \cos B \cos B + \sin A \sin B \cos A \cos B + \cos A \sin A \sin B \sin A + \cos A \sin A \sin B \cos B.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\frac{\sin(A+B)}{\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B}.
$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$
\sin(A+B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
$$

### Second Identity: Cosine of the Sum

The second identity is given by:

$$
\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.
$$

To prove this identity, we again start with the left-hand side:

$$
\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.
$$

Similar to the previous identity, we can express this as:

$$
\cos(A+B) = \frac{\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B}{1}.
$$

Next, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B)$:

$$
\cos(A+B) = \frac{(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B)(\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B)}{\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B}.
$$

Expanding the numerator results in:

$$
\cos^2 A \cos^2 B - \sin^2 A \sin^2 B.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\frac{\cos(A+B)}{\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B}.
$$

Thus, we conclude that:

$$
\cos(A+B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.
$$

### Application of the Identities

These identities are highly useful in simplifying various trigonometric expressions, allowing for easier manipulation and calculation in problems involving trigonometric functions.
