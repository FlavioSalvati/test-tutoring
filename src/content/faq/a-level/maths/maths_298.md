To solve the equation $\log_e(x) = 3$, we find that $x = e^3$.

First, it's important to recognize that $\log_e(x)$ is equivalent to $\ln(x)$, where $\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
\ln(x) = 3.
$$

Next, to isolate $x$, we will exponentiate both sides of the equation using $e$, which is the base of natural logarithms. This leads to the following expression:

$$
e^{\ln(x)} = e^3.
$$

By applying the property of logarithms that states $e^{\ln(x)} = x$, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation:

$$
x = e^3.
$$

In conclusion, the solution to the equation $\log_e(x) = 3$ is:

$$
x = e^3.
$$
