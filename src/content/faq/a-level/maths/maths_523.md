The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental principle in probability theory. It asserts that as the number of trials in an experiment increases, the experimental probability of an event converges to its theoretical probability. In simpler terms, the more times an experiment is conducted, the closer the results will align with the expected outcome.

For instance, consider the scenario of flipping a fair coin. The theoretical probability of landing heads in a single flip is $0.5$. If we flip the coin $10$ times, the experimental probability may deviate from this value due to random chance. However, as we increase the number of flips to $100$, the experimental probability is likely to be closer to $0.5$. If we further increase the number of flips to $1000$, the experimental probability will tend to get even closer to this theoretical value.

The Law of Large Numbers is significant because it enables us to make predictions regarding the likelihood of events based on established theoretical probabilities. Additionally, it enhances our understanding of randomness and its impact on the outcomes of experiments.

In summary, the Law of Large Numbers in probability states that as the number of trials increases, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical probability. This concept is crucial for comprehending probability and for making informed predictions about the likelihood of various events.
