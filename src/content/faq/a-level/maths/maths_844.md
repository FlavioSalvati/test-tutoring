To effectively represent data using a pie chart, you must first identify the categories along with their corresponding values.

A pie chart is a circular graph segmented into sectors, where each sector denotes a specific category and its associated value. For instance, if you wish to illustrate the percentage of students in a school who favor various sports, you would begin by defining the categories (e.g., football, basketball, tennis, etc.) and their respective values (e.g., $30\%$, $20\%$, $15\%$, etc.).

After establishing the categories and their corresponding values, you can proceed to create the pie chart. The first step in this process is to calculate the total value of all categories. In the aforementioned example, the total value would equal $100\%$. Next, you will need to determine the angle of each sector using the following formula:

$$
\text{Angle of sector} = \left( \frac{\text{Value of category}}{\text{Total value}} \right) \times 360^\circ
$$

By applying this formula, you can compute the angle for each sector and then draw the corresponding segment on the pie chart. Finally, be sure to label each sector with its associated category.

Pie charts are particularly useful for illustrating data that is grouped into categories, especially when you wish to convey the relative sizes of each category. However, they can be misleading if the categories are not clearly defined or if the values are inaccurate. Therefore, it is crucial to meticulously analyze the data and select an appropriate chart type before visually representing the information.
