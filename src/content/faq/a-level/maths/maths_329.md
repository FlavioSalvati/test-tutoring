To solve the shortest path problem in a network, Dijkstra's algorithm is an effective and widely-used approach.

Dijkstra's algorithm is designed to find the shortest path between two nodes within a network. The process begins at the source node, from which the algorithm iteratively explores adjacent nodes, updating the distance to each node as it progresses. It maintains two distinct sets: one for visited nodes and another for unvisited nodes. At each step, the algorithm selects the unvisited node with the smallest known distance and adds it to the visited set.

To implement Dijkstra's algorithm, we must initialize the distance to the source node as $0$ and set the distance to all other nodes to infinity. Additionally, we need to keep track of the previous node along the shortest path for each node. A priority queue is utilized to efficiently select the unvisited node with the smallest distance during each iteration.

Once the destination node has been reached, we can backtrack through the recorded previous nodes to reconstruct the shortest path. The total distance of this shortest path corresponds to the final distance recorded for the destination node.

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is $O(E \log V)$, where $E$ represents the number of edges and $V$ denotes the number of vertices in the network. This efficiency makes Dijkstra's algorithm a suitable method for tackling the shortest path problem in large and complex networks.
