The principle of conservation of mechanical energy asserts that the total mechanical energy within a closed system remains constant over time, provided that no external forces are acting on the system.

Mechanical energy is defined as the sum of kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE). Therefore, the conservation principle can be articulated as follows: the total mechanical energy at any given moment is equal to the total mechanical energy at any other moment.

Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

$$
KE + PE = \text{constant}
$$

where the kinetic energy is given by the formula:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

and the potential energy is described by:

$$
PE = mgh
$$

In these equations, $m$ represents the mass of the object, $v$ denotes its velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ indicates the height of the object above a designated reference point.

To illustrate this principle, consider a ball being thrown vertically upwards. At the moment of release, the ball possesses only kinetic energy. As it ascends, its kinetic energy decreases while its potential energy increases, until it reaches its maximum height, where all the energy is converted to potential energy. During the downward motion, the potential energy decreases and is converted back into kinetic energy until the ball returns to the original release point, where it once again has only kinetic energy. Throughout this entire process, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies remains constant.

The principle of conservation of mechanical energy is an invaluable tool for solving problems related to motion and energy. It enables us to simplify complex scenarios by focusing solely on the initial and final states of a system, eliminating the need to analyze the intermediate steps involved in the process.
