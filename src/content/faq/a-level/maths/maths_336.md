Evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) are strategies that, once adopted by a population, cannot be successfully invaded by any alternative strategy.

In the context of evolutionary game theory, a strategy is deemed evolutionarily stable if it can withstand the introduction of any mutant strategy. This implies that if a population predominantly employs a particular strategy, the emergence of a slightly different mutant strategy will not enable it to invade and dominate the population.

To assess whether a strategy is evolutionarily stable, we utilize a fitness payoff matrix. This matrix outlines the payoffs associated with each strategy when it competes against itself and against other strategies within the population. If a strategy consistently yields a higher payoff than any other competing strategy, it is classified as a dominant strategy.

However, it is crucial to note that a dominant strategy is not inherently evolutionarily stable. A strategy is considered evolutionarily stable only if it is impossible for any mutant strategy to invade and supplant the existing population. This can be evaluated by calculating the average fitness of the population both before and after the introduction of the mutant strategy. If the average fitness of the population declines following the introduction of the mutant strategy, the original strategy is confirmed to be evolutionarily stable.

Understanding evolutionarily stable strategies is essential for comprehending the evolution of behavior in both animals and humans. Additionally, these concepts have applications in various fields, including economics, politics, and other domains where strategic decision-making plays a critical role.
