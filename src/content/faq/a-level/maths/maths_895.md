The solution to the equation $\log_2(x) = 5$ is $x = 32$.

To solve this equation, it is essential to grasp the concept of logarithms. A logarithm represents the exponent to which a specified base must be raised in order to yield a given number. In this scenario, the equation $\log_2(x) = 5$ indicates that $2$ raised to the power of $5$ equals $x$. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

$$
2^5 = x
$$

By simplifying this expression, we find that:

$$
x = 32
$$

Thus, we conclude that the solution to the equation $\log_2(x) = 5$ is $x = 32$. We can verify this solution by substituting $x = 32$ back into the original equation:

$$
\log_2(32) = 5
$$

This statement is indeed correct, as $2$ raised to the power of $5$ equals $32$. Therefore, our solution is validated.

It's worth noting that logarithms play a crucial role in various fields of mathematics and science, including finance, physics, and engineering. They are especially valuable for managing extremely large or small numbers, as logarithms allow us to express these quantities in a more convenient and comprehensible form.
