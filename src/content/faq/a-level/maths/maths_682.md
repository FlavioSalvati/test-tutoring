The polar representation of a complex number provides a way to express it in terms of its magnitude and argument.

In rectangular form, a complex number is represented as a sum of its real and imaginary parts, typically written as $a + bi$. In contrast, the polar form represents the complex number as $r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$, where $r$ denotes the magnitude of the complex number and $\theta$ signifies its argument.

To calculate the magnitude of a complex number, we apply the formula:

$$
|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

Here, $a$ and $b$ represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively. For instance, if we have the complex number $z = 3 + 4i$, we can find its magnitude as follows:

$$
|z| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
$$

To determine the argument of a complex number, we utilize the formula:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
$$

Again, $a$ and $b$ correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. It is important to consider the quadrant in which the complex number resides when calculating the argument. For example, for the complex number $z = -3 + 4i$, we find:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{-3}\right) + \pi \approx 2.2143 \text{ radians}
$$

Once we have determined both the magnitude and the argument of a complex number, we can express it in polar form as:

$$
z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta).
$$

For instance, with $z = 3 + 4i$, we found $r = 5$ and $\theta \approx 0.93$ radians. Thus, the polar form of this complex number can be expressed as:

$$
z = 5\left(\cos(0.93) + i \sin(0.93)\right).
$$
