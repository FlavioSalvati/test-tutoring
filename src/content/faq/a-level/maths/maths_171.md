The derivative of the cotangent function, $\cot(x)$, is given by $-\csc^2(x)$.

To derive this result, we can apply the quotient rule. Recall that $\cot(x)$ can be expressed as the ratio of cosine and sine:

$$
\cot(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}.
$$

Using the quotient rule, the derivative of $\cot(x)$ can be calculated as follows:

$$
\cot'(x) = \frac{\cos'(x) \sin(x) - \cos(x) \sin'(x)}{\sin^2(x)}.
$$

Now, we substitute the derivatives of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$:

- The derivative of $\sin(x)$ is $\cos(x)$.
- The derivative of $\cos(x)$ is $-\sin(x)$.

Substituting these into our expression, we have:

$$
\cot'(x) = \frac{(-\sin(x)) \sin(x) - \cos(x) \cos(x)}{\sin^2(x)}.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\cot'(x) = \frac{-\sin^2(x) - \cos^2(x)}{\sin^2(x)}.
$$

Next, we can simplify the numerator. Recall the Pythagorean identity:

$$
\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1.
$$

Using this identity, we can rewrite the expression for the derivative:

$$
\cot'(x) = \frac{-1}{\sin^2(x)}.
$$

Recognizing that $\csc^2(x)$ is defined as $\frac{1}{\sin^2(x)}$, we can express our result as:

$$
\cot'(x) = -\csc^2(x).
$$

Thus, we conclude that the derivative of $\cot(x)$ is indeed given by 

$$
\cot'(x) = -\csc^2(x).
$$
