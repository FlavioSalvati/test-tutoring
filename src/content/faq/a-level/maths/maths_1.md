Let's enhance the clarity and readability of your content while ensuring proper mathematical formatting. Hereâ€™s the revised version:

The equation \( 3^x = 81 \) can be solved to find that \( x = 4 \).

To solve this equation, we will utilize logarithms. Specifically, we will take the logarithm of both sides of the equation with respect to base \( 3 \). This results in the following equation:

$$
\log_3(3^x) = \log_3(81)
$$

Applying the power rule of logarithms allows us to simplify the left-hand side:

$$
x \log_3(3) = \log_3(81)
$$

Since \( \log_3(3) = 1 \), we can simplify it further:

$$
x = \log_3(81)
$$

Next, we need to evaluate the logarithm on the right-hand side. We can express \( 81 \) as \( 3^4 \), which transforms our equation into:

$$
x = \log_3(3^4)
$$

Using the power rule of logarithms once more, we have:

$$
x = 4 \log_3(3)
$$

Again, since \( \log_3(3) = 1 \), we can simplify this to:

$$
x = 4
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation \( 3^x = 81 \) is \( x = 4 \).
