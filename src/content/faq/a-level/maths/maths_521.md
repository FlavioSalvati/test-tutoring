Hereâ€™s the enhanced version of your content for clarity and readability:

The integral of $\sin(x) \, dx$ is given by:

$$
\int \sin(x) \, dx = -\cos(x) + C
$$

where $C$ represents the constant of integration.

To evaluate the integral of $\sin(x) \, dx$, we can apply the method of integration by substitution. We start by letting:

$$
u = \cos(x)
$$

Then, we find the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$:

$$
\frac{du}{dx} = -\sin(x)
$$

From this, we can express $dx$ in terms of $du$:

$$
dx = \frac{du}{-\sin(x)}
$$

Substituting these expressions into the integral, we have:

$$
\int \sin(x) \, dx = \int \sin(x) \left(\frac{-\sin(x)}{-\sin(x)}\right) dx
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
= -\int \tan(x) \, d(\cos(x))
$$

Using the formula for the integral of $\tan(x)$, we find:

$$
= -\ln|\cos(x)| + C
$$

Since we originally defined $u = \cos(x)$, we can substitute back to obtain the final expression:

$$
= -\ln|u| + C
$$

Thus, substituting $u$ back yields:

$$
= -\ln|\cos(x)| + C
$$

Consequently, we confirm that the integral of $\sin(x) \, dx$ is indeed:

$$
\int \sin(x) \, dx = -\cos(x) + C
$$
