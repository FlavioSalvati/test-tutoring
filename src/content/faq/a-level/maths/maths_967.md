To factor a cubic expression, the primary goal is to identify its roots and express the polynomial as a product of linear factors.

The first step in this process is to check for any common factors that can be factored out. For instance, consider the expression $2x^3 + 4x^2$. We can factor out the common term $2x^2$, resulting in the expression $2x^2(x + 2)$.

If no common factors are present, we need to determine the roots of the cubic expression. This can be achieved through various methods, including the Rational Root Theorem, synthetic division, or the quadratic formula. Once the roots are identified, we can rewrite the cubic expression as a product of its linear factors.

For example, letâ€™s take the cubic expression $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$. By applying the Rational Root Theorem, we find that the possible rational roots are $\pm 1$, $\pm 2$, $\pm 3$, and $\pm 6$. Testing these candidates, we discover that $x = 1$, $x = 2$, and $x = 3$ are indeed roots of the expression. Utilizing synthetic division, we can express the original polynomial as:

$$
(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3).
$$

In cases where the roots are not rational, we can resort to the quadratic formula to find them. For example, consider the cubic expression $x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x - 12$. By applying the quadratic formula, we find the roots to be $x = -4$, $x = 1 + \sqrt{5}$, and $x = 1 - \sqrt{5}$. Consequently, we can express the cubic expression as:

$$
(x + 4)(x - (1 + \sqrt{5}))(x - (1 - \sqrt{5})).
$$

In summary, factoring a cubic expression involves identifying its roots and representing the polynomial as a product of linear factors. This method can be effectively carried out using techniques such as the Rational Root Theorem, synthetic division, or the quadratic formula.
