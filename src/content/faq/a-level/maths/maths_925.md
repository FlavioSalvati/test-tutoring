The radial acceleration in circular motion is influenced by both the speed of the object and the radius of the circular path. 

Radial acceleration, denoted as $a_r$, is the component of acceleration that points toward the center of the circle. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a_r = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

where $v$ represents the speed of the object and $r$ is the radius of the circle. This equation illustrates that radial acceleration is directly proportional to the square of the speed, while being inversely proportional to the radius.

As a result, if the speed of the object increases, the radial acceleration also increases. This means that the object experiences a greater force directed towards the center of the circle, leading to a faster motion. Conversely, an increase in the radius of the circle results in a decrease in radial acceleration. In this case, the object will feel a weaker force towards the center, causing it to move more slowly.

It is essential to recognize that radial acceleration is not the only component of acceleration in circular motion. There is also tangential acceleration, which acts in a direction tangent to the circular path. The total acceleration of an object in circular motion is the vector sum of both radial and tangential accelerations.

In summary, the radial acceleration in circular motion is determined by the object's speed and the radius of the circular path. Given by the formula:

$$
a_r = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

this relationship highlights that radial acceleration is directly proportional to the square of the speed and inversely proportional to the radius of the circle.
