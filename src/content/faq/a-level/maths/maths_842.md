The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is an efficient method for finding the maximum matching in a bipartite graph.

To implement the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, we first need to represent the bipartite graph using an adjacency list. Next, we initialize an empty matching and a distance array. The distance array will track the distance from each vertex in the left partition to the nearest unmatched vertex in the right partition.

The algorithm proceeds through the following steps, which are repeated until no augmenting path can be found:

1. Set all values in the distance array to infinity.
2. For each unmatched vertex in the left partition, perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest augmenting path to an unmatched vertex in the right partition. If such a path is discovered, update both the matching and distance arrays accordingly.
3. Finally, return the size of the matching.

The time complexity of the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is $O(E \sqrt{V})$, where $E$ represents the number of edges and $V$ denotes the number of vertices in the bipartite graph. This efficiency makes it superior to the naive approach of examining all possible matchings, which has a time complexity of $O(2^V)$.

In summary, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm serves as a valuable tool for determining the maximum matching in a bipartite graph.
