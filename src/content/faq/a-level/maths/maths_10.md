A perfectly inelastic collision occurs when two objects collide and subsequently stick together, moving as a single entity after the impact.

In a perfectly inelastic collision, the two colliding objects merge and move as one following the collision. This implies that the final velocity of the combined mass is the same for both objects, and it is different from their individual initial velocities just before the collision. Importantly, kinetic energy is not conserved during a perfectly inelastic collision; some of the kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat and sound.

We can mathematically describe a perfectly inelastic collision using the principle of conservation of momentum, expressed by the equation:

$$
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_f
$$

In this equation, $m_1$ and $m_2$ represent the masses of the two objects, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are their initial velocities, and $v_f$ is the final velocity of the combined mass. Since the two objects stick together, they share the same final velocity, allowing us to simplify the equation to:

$$
(m_1 + m_2) v_f = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2
$$

To isolate $v_f$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $(m_1 + m_2)$:

$$
v_f = \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$

This equation illustrates that the final velocity of the combined object is a weighted average of the initial velocities of the two colliding objects, where the weights are determined by their respective masses.
