In probability theory, the sample space is defined as the collection of all possible outcomes of a given experiment.

An experiment is any procedure that produces a set of possible results. The sample space encompasses every possible outcome that can arise from that experiment. For instance, when flipping a coin, the sample space is represented as $\{ \text{heads}, \text{tails} \}$. When rolling a die, the sample space consists of $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Similarly, if we draw a card from a standard deck of 52 cards, the sample space can be expressed as:

$$
\{ \text{Ace of hearts}, 2 \text{ of hearts}, 3 \text{ of hearts}, \ldots, \text{King of spades} \}
$$

The sample space is typically denoted by the symbol $S$. It is crucial to understand that the sample space must fulfill two key criteria: it must be exhaustive and mutually exclusive. "Exhaustive" means that every conceivable outcome of the experiment is included in the sample space, while "mutually exclusive" indicates that no two outcomes can occur simultaneously.

The sample space can be classified as either finite or infinite. When the sample space is finite, we can determine the number of possible outcomes using the formula:

$$
n(S) = \text{number of elements in the sample space}
$$

For example, when flipping a coin, we find that $n(S) = 2$. In the case of rolling a die, $n(S) = 6$.

Conversely, if the sample space is infinite, we cannot enumerate the possible outcomes. In such situations, we employ alternative methods to describe the sample space, such as utilizing intervals or functions.
