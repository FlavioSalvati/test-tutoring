### Derivation of the Identity for Hyperbolic Cosecant

To derive the identity for hyperbolic cosecant, we begin with the definitions of hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine.

Starting with the definition of hyperbolic sine:

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
$$

We can rearrange this equation to express $e^x$ in terms of $\sinh(x)$:

$$
e^x = 2\sinh(x) + e^{-x}
$$

Next, we introduce the definition of hyperbolic cosine:

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
$$

We substitute the expression we derived for $e^x$ into the equation for $\cosh(x)$:

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{(2\sinh(x) + e^{-x}) + e^{-x}}{2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{2\sinh(x) + 2e^{-x}}{2}
$$

Simplifying further, we have:

$$
\cosh(x) = \sinh(x) + e^{-x}
$$

Now, multiplying both sides of the equation by $\sinh(x)$ gives us:

$$
\sinh(x) \cosh(x) = \sinh^2(x) + \sinh(x) e^{-x}
$$

Next, we divide both sides by $\sinh(x)$ (assuming $\sinh(x) \neq 0$):

$$
\coth(x) = 1 + \csch(x)
$$

Finally, we can rearrange this equation to isolate $\csch(x)$:

$$
\csch(x) = \coth(x) - 1
$$

Thus, we arrive at the identity for hyperbolic cosecant:

$$
\csch(x) = \frac{1}{\coth(x)} - 1
$$

This concludes the derivation of the identity for hyperbolic cosecant.
