The motion of a pendulum undergoing circular motion can be classified as simple harmonic motion (SHM).

A pendulum consists of a weight suspended from a fixed point, which swings back and forth under the influence of gravity. When disturbed from its equilibrium position, the pendulum oscillates in a regular pattern characteristic of simple harmonic motion.

In circular motion, the pendulum follows a circular path. The weight of the pendulum generates the necessary centripetal force to maintain this circular trajectory, while the force of gravity acts as the restoring force, bringing the pendulum back towards its equilibrium position after it has been displaced.

To calculate the period of a pendulum in circular motion, we can use the formula:

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
$$

In this equation, $T$ represents the period, $L$ is the length of the pendulum, and $g$ denotes the acceleration due to gravity. This relationship indicates that the period of the pendulum is influenced by both its length and the gravitational acceleration.

The frequency of a pendulum in circular motion can be determined using the formula:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

Here, $f$ denotes the frequency. This equation illustrates that the frequency is inversely related to the period; as the period increases, the frequency decreases, and vice versa.

In summary, the motion of a pendulum in circular motion exemplifies simple harmonic motion. Its period and frequency can be computed using the formulas $$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$ and $$f = \frac{1}{T}$$, respectively.
