To calculate the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric series, you can use the formula:

$$
S_n = \frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}
$$

In this formula, $a$ represents the first term of the series, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ denotes the number of terms.

A geometric series is characterized by a sequence of numbers where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. To determine the sum of the first $n$ terms, follow these steps:

1. Identify the values of $a$, $r$, and $n$.
2. Substitute these values into the formula and simplify.

For example, consider the geometric series: $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots$

In this case, the first term is $a = 2$, and the common ratio can be calculated as $r = \frac{4}{2} = 2$. To find the sum of the first $5$ terms, we set $n = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula, we have:

$$
S_n = \frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r} = \frac{2(1 - 2^5)}{1 - 2}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
= \frac{2(1 - 32)}{-1} = \frac{2 \cdot (-31)}{-1} = 62
$$

Thus, the sum of the first $5$ terms of the geometric series $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots$ is $62$.

It's important to note that this formula for the sum of a geometric series is valid only when the common ratio $r$ is not equal to $1$. If $r = 1$, the series consists of repeated instances of the same number, and the sum of the first $n$ terms would simply be $n$ multiplied by that number.
