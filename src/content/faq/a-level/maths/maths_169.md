A mathematical model comprises several essential components: variables, equations, assumptions, and parameters.

**Variables** represent the quantities under investigation and can vary in value. They are typically denoted by symbols such as $x$, $y$, and $z$. In the context of a mathematical model, variables can be classified as either dependent or independent. Dependent variables are those whose values are influenced by changes in independent variables.

**Equations** serve as the mathematical representations that articulate the relationships between the variables. These equations can be linear or nonlinear and may involve one or multiple variables. They are instrumental in predicting the behavior of the system being modeled.

**Assumptions** refer to the simplifications made within the model to enhance its manageability. These assumptions are grounded in the understanding of the system and can be adjusted as new information emerges. The accuracy of a model can be significantly impacted by the assumptions made; therefore, careful selection is crucial.

**Parameters** are the constants incorporated into the equations that encapsulate the physical properties of the system being modeled. These parameters can be determined through experimental methods or estimated based on other data sources. Just like assumptions, the choice of parameters can influence the model's accuracy, making it essential to select them judiciously.

In conclusion, a mathematical model is constructed from variables, equations, assumptions, and parameters. These components work together to describe the behavior of a system and facilitate predictions regarding its future behavior. Careful selection of each component is vital to ensure the model's accuracy.
