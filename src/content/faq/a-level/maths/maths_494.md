In oscillatory motion, energy is conserved due to its periodic nature.

Oscillatory motion is characterized by the back-and-forth movement of an object around a fixed point. Common examples of this type of motion include the swinging of a pendulum, the oscillation of a mass attached to a spring, and the vibrations of a guitar string. Each of these examples exhibits periodic behavior, meaning they repeat their motion over time.

The periodicity of oscillatory motion leads to the conservation of total energy within the system. This principle states that the sum of kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE) remains constant throughout the oscillation. We can express this mathematically as:

$$
\text{KE} + \text{PE} = \text{constant}
$$

As the object oscillates, both its kinetic and potential energies will change; however, their total will always equal the same constant value. For instance, in the case of a mass connected to a spring, the kinetic energy reaches its maximum when the mass is at the equilibrium positionâ€”where the spring is neither stretched nor compressed. In contrast, the potential energy is maximized when the spring is either fully compressed or fully extended. Despite the variations in individual energy types, their sum remains unchanged.

This principle of energy conservation has significant implications for the dynamics of the oscillating object. Specifically, it indicates that the amplitude (the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position) of the motion will remain constant in the absence of external forces acting on the system. Furthermore, the frequency of the oscillation (the number of complete cycles per unit time) is determined solely by the inherent properties of the system, such as the mass and spring constant in the case of a mass-spring system. This frequency is independent of the initial conditions of the motion.
