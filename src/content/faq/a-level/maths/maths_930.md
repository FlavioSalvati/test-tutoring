To solve the equation $ \ln(x) = 3 $, we find that $ x = e^3 $.

First, let's clarify what the natural logarithm is. The natural logarithm, denoted as $ \ln(x) $, is the inverse function of the exponential function $ e^x $. This relationship implies that when we take the natural logarithm of a number $ x $, we obtain the exponent to which the base $ e $ must be raised to yield $ x $.

Thus, the equation $ \ln(x) = 3 $ can be interpreted as stating that $ e^3 = x $. We can verify this by applying the natural logarithm to both sides of the equation:

$$
\ln(e^3) = \ln(x)
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
3 = \ln(x)
$$

From this, we can conclude that:

$$
x = e^3.
$$

It is crucial to remember that the natural logarithm is only defined for positive values of $ x $. This restriction exists because $ e^x $ is always positive, meaning we can only take the natural logarithm of positive numbers.

In summary, to solve the equation $ \ln(x) = 3 $, we exponentiate both sides, leading us to the solution $ x = e^3 $.
