To find the derivative of the function \( y = \sec(4x) \), we can apply the chain rule. 

First, we introduce a substitution: let \( u = 4x \). Then, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( u \) as follows:

$$
y = \sec(u).
$$

By applying the chain rule, we can differentiate \( y \) with respect to \( x \):

$$
y' = \sec(u) \tan(u) \cdot u',
$$

where \( u' \) represents the derivative of \( u \) with respect to \( x \). In our case, we have:

$$
u' = \frac{du}{dx} = 4.
$$

Substituting \( u = 4x \) back into our expression, we find:

$$
y' = \sec(4x) \tan(4x) \cdot 4.
$$

This can be simplified to:

$$
y' = 4 \sec(4x) \tan(4x).
$$

Thus, the derivative of \( y = \sec(4x) \) is:

$$
y' = 4 \sec(4x) \tan(4x).
$$
