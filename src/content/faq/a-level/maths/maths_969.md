Nash equilibrium is a fundamental solution concept in game theory, where each player's strategy is considered optimal in light of the strategies chosen by other players.

In game theory, a Nash equilibrium is established when each player's strategy is optimal, given the strategies employed by their opponents. In simpler terms, no player can enhance their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy while the strategies of the other players remain unchanged. This concept is named after John Nash, who introduced it in his landmark 1950 paper titled "Non-Cooperative Games."

To identify a Nash equilibrium, we must first enumerate all potential strategies available to each player, along with their corresponding payoffs. Next, we assess whether a combination of strategies exists where no player has an incentive to deviate from their selected strategy. If such a combination is found, it qualifies as a Nash equilibrium.

For instance, consider the classic scenario known as the "Prisoner's Dilemma." In this game, two suspects are arrested and placed in separate cells. Each suspect has the option to either confess or remain silent. The outcomes of their choices lead to the following consequences:

- If both confess, each receives a 5-year prison sentence.
- If one confesses while the other remains silent, the confessor receives a 1-year sentence, while the silent one faces a 10-year sentence.
- If both choose to remain silent, they each receive a 2-year sentence.

The payoffs for each player can be visualized in a matrix format:

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
 & \text{Confess} & \text{Remain Silent} \\
\hline
\text{Confess} & (-5, -5) & (-1, -10) \\
\hline
\text{Remain Silent} & (-10, -1) & (-2, -2) \\
\end{array}
$$

In this scenario, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium where both players choose to confess. If one player were to switch to remaining silent, the other player would have a strong incentive to confess in order to receive a shorter sentence. Consequently, both players opt to confess, resulting in them each serving a 5-year sentence.

Overall, the concept of Nash equilibrium serves as a valuable tool in game theory, aiding in the prediction of outcomes in strategic interactions among rational players.
