To identify dominant strategies within a game matrix, we must analyze the payoffs for each player.

A dominant strategy is defined as a strategy that consistently yields the highest payoff for a player, regardless of the strategy chosen by the other player. To determine a dominant strategy, we will compare the payoffs of each player for all potential strategy combinations.

Consider the following game matrix as an example:

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
 & L & R \\
\hline
T & 2, 1 & 0, 0 \\
\hline
B & 1, 2 & 3, 0 \\
\end{array}
$$

To ascertain the dominant strategy for Player 1, we will evaluate the payoffs across each row. If Player 2 selects strategy $L$, Player 1 earns a payoff of $2$ by choosing $T$ and $1$ by selecting $B$. Conversely, if Player 2 opts for strategy $R$, Player 1 receives $0$ with $T$ and $3$ with $B$. Thus, Player 1's dominant strategy is to choose $B$, as this option provides a higher payoff regardless of Player 2's choice.

Next, we will identify the dominant strategy for Player 2 by examining the payoffs in each column. If Player 1 selects $T$, Player 2 receives a payoff of $2$ by choosing $L$ and $1$ by choosing $R$. If Player 1 chooses $B$, Player 2's payoff is $0$ with $L$ and $3$ with $R$. Consequently, Player 2's dominant strategy is to select $R$, as this strategy yields a higher payoff irrespective of Player 1's decision.

It is important to note that there may be scenarios where neither player has a dominant strategy. In such instances, players might need to explore alternative strategies, such as mixed strategies, to optimize their payoffs.
