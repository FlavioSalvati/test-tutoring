The Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm is a fundamental graph traversal technique that explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking.

DFS is a graph traversal method that begins at a specified vertex and proceeds to explore each branch of the graph as far as possible before returning to the previous vertex. To manage this exploration, the algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of the vertices that have been visited but not yet fully explored.

This algorithm can be implemented in two main ways: recursion and iteration. In the recursive approach, the algorithm visits a vertex and then recursively proceeds to visit all of its adjacent vertices. Conversely, in the iterative approach, the algorithm employs a stack data structure to record the vertices that still need to be visited.

DFS is applicable to a wide range of problems, including finding connected components, detecting cycles, and identifying paths between two specific vertices. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in various graph algorithms, such as topological sorting, determining strongly connected components, and constructing a minimum spanning tree.

The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is $O(V + E)$, where $V$ represents the number of vertices and $E$ denotes the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is $O(V)$, which corresponds to the maximum number of vertices that may be stored in the stack during the traversal.

In summary, DFS is a robust graph traversal algorithm that is capable of addressing a diverse array of problems. Its ease of implementation and efficiency, characterized by a time complexity of $O(V + E)$, make it a valuable tool in computer science and graph theory.
