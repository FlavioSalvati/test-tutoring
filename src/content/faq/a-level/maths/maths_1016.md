The Binomial theorem for polynomials is a formula for expanding expressions of the form (a+b)^n.

The Binomial theorem states that for any positive integer n, the expansion of (a+b)^n is given by:

(a+b)^n = C(n,0)a^n + C(n,1)a^(n-1)b + C(n,2)a^(n-2)b^2 + ... + C(n,n-1)ab^(n-1) + C(n,n)b^n

where C(n,r) is the binomial coefficient, given by:

C(n,r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

The binomial coefficient represents the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects. For example, C(4,2) = 6, because there are 6 ways to choose 2 objects from a set of 4: {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, and {3,4}.

To use the Binomial theorem, we simply substitute the values of a and b, and the value of n, into the formula and simplify. For example, to expand (x+2)^3, we have:

(x+2)^3 = C(3,0)x^3 + C(3,1)x^2(2) + C(3,2)x(2)^2 + C(3,3)(2)^3
= x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8

The Binomial theorem can also be used to find specific terms in the expansion, such as the term containing x^2 in the above example. This term is given by the coefficient of x^2, which is C(3,1)2 = 6. Therefore, the term containing x^2 is 6x^2.

In summary, the Binomial theorem is a powerful tool for expanding expressions of the form (a+b)^n, and can be used to find specific terms in the expansion.
