To calculate the sum of a finite geometric series, you can use the formula:

$$
S_n = \frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}
$$

where:
- $ a $ is the first term of the series,
- $ r $ is the common ratio, and
- $ n $ is the total number of terms.

To apply this formula, start by identifying the values of $ a $, $ r $, and $ n $ from the given series. Once you have these values, substitute them into the formula and simplify the expression.

For instance, consider the geometric series: $ 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 $. In this case:
- $ a = 2 $ (the first term),
- $ r = 2 $ (each term is double the previous term), and
- $ n = 5 $ (the series contains 5 terms).

Now, using the formula, we can calculate the sum:

$$
S_n = \frac{2(1 - 2^5)}{1 - 2} = \frac{2(1 - 32)}{-1} = \frac{2(-31)}{-1} = 62.
$$

Thus, the sum of the series $ 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 $ is $ 62 $.

It is crucial to remember that this formula is applicable only when the common ratio $ r $ is not equal to $ 1 $. If $ r = 1 $, the series consists of the same number repeated $ n $ times, and the sum would simply be $ n $ times that number.
