To determine the quadratic equation that has roots $-1$ and $2$, we can follow a systematic approach. A quadratic equation can generally be expressed in the form 

$$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$ 

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. Given that the roots of the equation are $-1$ and $2$, we can write the equation in its factored form as 

$$ (x + 1)(x - 2) = 0. $$ 

Next, we expand this expression:

$$ (x + 1)(x - 2) = x^2 - 2x + x - 2 = x^2 - x - 2. $$ 

Thus, the quadratic equation we are looking for is 

$$ x^2 - x - 2 = 0. $$ 

By comparing this equation to the general form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we can identify the coefficients: $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = -2$. Therefore, the coefficients of the quadratic equation with roots $-1$ and $2$ are $1$, $-1$, and $-2$, respectively.

To further validate our result, we can apply the quadratic formula, which is given by:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. $$ 

Substituting the identified values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula, we have:

$$ x = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2}. $$ 

This simplifies to:

$$ x = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}. $$ 

Calculating the two possible values, we find:

1. $$ x = \frac{4}{2} = 2, $$
2. $$ x = \frac{-2}{2} = -1. $$ 

Thus, we confirm that the roots of the equation are indeed $-1$ and $2$, validating our earlier findings.
