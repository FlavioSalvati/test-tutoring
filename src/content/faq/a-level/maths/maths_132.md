In linear programming, constraints refer to the limitations or restrictions imposed on decision variables. 

These constraints serve to define the feasible region of the problem, effectively narrowing down the possible values that the decision variables can assume. For instance, if a company operates under a limited advertising budget, this constraint would dictate the maximum amount of money available for advertising expenditures. Constraints can be expressed in the form of inequalities or equalities.

**Inequalities** are employed to articulate constraints where the decision variable must be less than or greater than a specified value. For example, if $x$ denotes the number of units of product A produced, and the company has a limited supply of raw materials, the constraint may be represented as:

$$
2x + 3y \leq 500
$$

This indicates that the combined quantity of raw materials used in the production of products A and B must not exceed $500$ units.

**Equalities**, on the other hand, express constraints that require the decision variable to take on a specific value. For instance, if $x$ represents the number of units of product A produced and the company has a fixed demand for this product, the constraint could be formulated as:

$$
x = 100
$$

This signifies that the production of product A must be exactly $100$ units.

Constraints play a pivotal role in linear programming by shaping the feasible region of the problem and ensuring that the solutions derived are both realistic and practical. A solid understanding of constraints is essential for effectively navigating various linear programming scenarios. Furthermore, constraints can encompass a wide range of numerical types, including integers, fractions, and real numbers, depending on the specific context of the problem. They are also a critical component in optimization processes, where the goal is to identify the best possible outcome under given conditions.
