Descartes' Rule of Signs is a valuable technique for determining the potential number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.

To apply Descartes' Rule of Signs, we begin by analyzing the polynomial in its standard form and counting the number of sign changes among its coefficients. For instance, consider the polynomial 

$$
f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1.
$$ 

In this polynomial, we can identify three sign changes: 
1. From positive to negative in the coefficient of $x^2$,
2. From negative to positive in the coefficient of $x$,
3. From positive to negative in the constant term.

According to the rule, the number of positive roots of the polynomial can either be equal to the number of sign changes or less than it by an even integer. In our example, the number of positive roots could be either $3$ or $1$. 

Similarly, to find the number of negative roots, we evaluate $f(-x)$ and count the sign changes in that polynomial. The number of negative roots is also either equal to the number of sign changes or less than it by an even integer. In our case, the number of negative roots could be either $1$ or $3$.

If the total number of positive and negative roots does not equal the degree of the polynomial, then there must be complex or repeated roots involved. For example, in a cubic polynomial with $2$ positive roots and $1$ negative root, the third root must either be complex or repeated.

Overall, Descartes' Rule of Signs serves as an effective tool for estimating the possible number of roots of a polynomial without the need to calculate their exact values or multiplicities. However, it is important to note that the rule does not provide the specific values or multiplicities of the roots.
