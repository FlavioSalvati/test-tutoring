The inequality $$|5x + 2| < 0$$ has no solution.

To understand why, we must first clarify the concept of absolute value. The absolute value of a number is defined as its distance from zero on the number line. Consequently, the absolute value of any real number is always non-negative.

In the case of the inequality $$|5x + 2| < 0$$, we see that it is impossible for the absolute value to be less than zero, since absolute values cannot be negative. Thus, we conclude that there are no values of $x$ that satisfy this inequality.

To further illustrate this point algebraically, let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a solution $x$. This leads us to the following expressions:

$$|5x + 2| < 0$$

This absolute value can be interpreted in two ways:

1. $$5x + 2 < 0$$
2. $$-(5x + 2) < 0$$, which simplifies to $$5x + 2 > 0$$.

From the first inequality, we can deduce:

$$5x < -2 \Rightarrow x < -\frac{2}{5}.$$

From the second inequality, we can deduce:

$$5x > -2 \Rightarrow x > -\frac{2}{5}.$$

Now, we have two conflicting conditions:

1. $$x < -\frac{2}{5}$$
2. $$x > -\frac{2}{5}$$

These two inequalities cannot be satisfied simultaneously, confirming that there is no solution to the inequality $$|5x + 2| < 0$$.
