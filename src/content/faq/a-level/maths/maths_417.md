Depth-first search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

The algorithm begins at a specified vertex and systematically visits all reachable vertices in the graph, marking each one as visited. Once it has explored all paths from a vertex, it backtracks to the previous vertex and continues the process until every vertex has been visited.

DFS can be implemented in two primary ways: through recursion or by using an explicit stack. The recursive approach is often simpler and more elegant; however, it may encounter stack overflow issues when dealing with large graphs. In contrast, the stack-based implementation, while more complex, is capable of handling larger graphs without the risk of running out of stack space.

This traversal method is versatile and can be applied to solve various graph problems, including finding connected components, detecting cycles, and determining topological order. Additionally, DFS is useful for solving maze problems and generating random mazes.

The time complexity of DFS is $O(V + E)$, where $V$ represents the number of vertices and $E$ denotes the number of edges in the graph. This efficiency arises from the fact that each vertex and edge is visited exactly once during the traversal. However, the actual execution time may vary based on the data structure used to represent the graph and the specific implementation of the algorithm.

In summary, DFS is a robust graph traversal algorithm that effectively addresses a range of graph-related problems. It is relatively straightforward to implement and boasts a reasonable time complexity. A-Level Mathematics students should become well-acquainted with DFS and its applications in graph theory.
