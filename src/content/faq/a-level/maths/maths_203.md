To create a dot plot for visualizing data, start by constructing a number line that encompasses the range of your data points.

Next, for each data point in the set, place a dot above the corresponding value on the number line. If multiple data points share the same value, stack the dots vertically to represent their frequency.

For instance, consider the following data set: $2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8$.

We would first create a number line ranging from $2$ to $8$, marking each integer with tick marks. Then, for each data point, we would position a dot above the number line, stacking dots for any repeated values.

The resulting dot plot would appear as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
2 & \cdots \\
3 & \cdots \\
4 & \cdots \; \bullet \; \bullet \\
5 & \cdots \; \bullet \\
6 & \cdots \; \bullet \; \bullet \; \bullet \\
7 & \cdots \; \bullet \\
8 & \cdots \\
\end{array}
$$

Dot plots are an effective tool for quickly assessing the distribution of a data set, particularly when the data set is small. They also help in identifying outliers and gaps within the data.
