To calculate the conjugate of a complex number, you simply need to change the sign of its imaginary part.

A complex number can be expressed in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ represents the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of $-1$. The conjugate of a complex number is derived by altering the sign of the imaginary component. Specifically, if we have a complex number $z = a + bi$, then its conjugate, denoted as $z^*$, is given by 

$$
z^* = a - bi.
$$

For instance, if we take the complex number $z = 3 + 2i$, its conjugate would be 

$$
z^* = 3 - 2i.
$$

Similarly, for another complex number $w = -4i$, the conjugate is 

$$
w^* = 4i.
$$

The conjugate of a complex number possesses several important properties. First, the product of a complex number and its conjugate yields a real number. Specifically, if $z = a + bi$, then the product is calculated as follows:

$$
z \cdot z^* = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2,
$$

which is indeed a real number. 

Second, the sum and difference of two complex numbers can be expressed in terms of their conjugates. For example, if we have two complex numbers $z_1 = a + bi$ and $z_2 = c + di$, then their sum and difference can be written as:

$$
z_1 + z_2 = (a + c) + (b + d)i
$$ 

and 

$$
z_1 - z_2 = (a - c) + (b - d)i.
$$

In summary, the conjugate of a complex number is obtained by changing the sign of its imaginary part. This operation has significant implications and useful properties in the realm of complex number arithmetic.
