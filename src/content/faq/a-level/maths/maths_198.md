To determine the general term of a geometric sequence, we utilize the formula 

$$
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)},
$$ 

where:
- $a_n$ represents the $n$-th term of the sequence,
- $a_1$ is the first term, and
- $r$ is the common ratio.

A geometric sequence is characterized by each term being obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio known as the common ratio ($r$). The first term is labeled as $a_1$, the second term as $a_2$, and this pattern continues indefinitely.

To find the general term of a geometric sequence, you need two essential values: the first term ($a_1$) and the common ratio ($r$). With these values, you can apply the formula 

$$
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)}
$$ 

to calculate any term within the sequence.

For instance, consider the geometric sequence: $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots$ In this sequence, we have $a_1 = 2$ and $r = 2$. To find the 6th term ($a_6$), we can use the formula as follows:

$$
a_6 = a_1 \cdot r^{(6-1)} 
$$
$$
= 2 \cdot 2^{(6-1)} 
$$
$$
= 2 \cdot 2^5 
$$
$$
= 2 \cdot 32 
$$
$$
= 64.
$$

Thus, the 6th term of this sequence is $64$.

It is crucial to understand that the formula for the general term of a geometric sequence is valid only when the ratio between consecutive terms remains constant. If the ratio varies, the sequence cannot be classified as geometric, and the aforementioned formula will not apply.
