The binomial theorem is a fundamental formula in algebra that enables the expansion of expressions in the form $(a + b)^n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. The theorem states that:

$$(a + b)^n = C(n,0)a^n b^0 + C(n,1)a^{n-1} b^1 + C(n,2)a^{n-2} b^2 + \ldots + C(n,n)a^0 b^n$$

In this expression, $C(n,k)$ denotes the binomial coefficient, which is defined as:

$$C(n,k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

The binomial coefficient $C(n,k)$ represents the number of ways to select $k$ objects from a set of $n$ objects. For instance, $C(4,2) = 6$, indicating that there are six different ways to choose 2 objects from a set of 4.

To apply the binomial theorem, you simply substitute the values of $a$, $b$, and $n$ into the formula and simplify the resulting expression. For example, to expand $(x + y)^3$, we can write:

$$(x + y)^3 = C(3,0)x^3 y^0 + C(3,1)x^2 y^1 + C(3,2)x^1 y^2 + C(3,3)x^0 y^3$$

This simplifies to:

$$x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3xy^2 + y^3$$

Additionally, the binomial theorem can be utilized to find specific terms within the expansion of $(a + b)^n$. For example, to determine the coefficient of $x^2 y^3$ in the expansion of $(x + 2y)^5$, we would calculate:

$$C(5,2)(x^2)(2y)^3 = 10x^2 y^3$$

In summary, the binomial theorem is an invaluable tool for simplifying and expanding algebraic expressions. It is particularly important for students studying A-Level Mathematics to grasp this concept.
