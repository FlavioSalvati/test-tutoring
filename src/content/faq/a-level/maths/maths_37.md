The formula for the hyperbolic cotangent is derived from the definitions of hyperbolic functions.

The hyperbolic cotangent, denoted as $\text{coth}(x)$, is defined as the ratio of the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine functions:

$$
\text{coth}(x) = \frac{\cosh(x)}{\sinh(x)}
$$

The hyperbolic cosine and sine functions are defined as follows:

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
$$

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
$$

By substituting these definitions into the formula for $\text{coth}(x)$, we get:

$$
\text{coth}(x) = \frac{\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}}{\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}} = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{e^x - e^{-x}}
$$

To simplify this expression, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $e^x$:

$$
\text{coth}(x) = \frac{e^{2x} + 1}{e^{2x} - 1}
$$

This provides us with the formula for the hyperbolic cotangent. Additionally, it can also be expressed in terms of exponential functions as follows:

$$
\text{coth}(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{e^x - e^{-x}} = \frac{e^{2x} + 1}{e^{2x} - 1} = \frac{1 + e^{-2x}}{e^{-2x} - 1}
$$

These various forms highlight the relationships between the hyperbolic cotangent and exponential functions.
