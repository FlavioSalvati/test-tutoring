To find the derivative of the function \( y = \cot(3x) \), we will apply the chain rule. 

First, let's set \( u = 3x \). This allows us to express \( y \) in terms of \( u \): 

$$
y = \cot(u).
$$

According to the chain rule, the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}.
$$

Next, we need to determine \( \frac{dy}{du} \). The derivative of \( \cot(u) \) is given by:

$$
\frac{dy}{du} = -\csc^2(u).
$$

Now, substituting back for \( u \), we get:

$$
\frac{dy}{du} = -\csc^2(3x).
$$

Next, we calculate \( \frac{du}{dx} \). Since \( u = 3x \), the derivative is:

$$
\frac{du}{dx} = 3.
$$

Now we can substitute both derivatives back into the chain rule equation:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\csc^2(3x) \cdot 3.
$$

Simplifying this expression, we find:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -3\csc^2(3x).
$$

Thus, we conclude that the derivative of \( y = \cot(3x) \) is:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -3\csc^2(3x).
$$
