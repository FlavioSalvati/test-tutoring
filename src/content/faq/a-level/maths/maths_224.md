The moment of a couple is determined by multiplying the magnitude of one of the forces by the perpendicular distance between the forces.

A couple consists of two forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and non-collinear. The moment of a couple can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
M = Fd
$$

In this equation, $M$ represents the moment of the couple, $F$ denotes the magnitude of one of the forces, and $d$ is the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces.

To calculate the moment of a couple, you need to identify the two forces and measure the distance between them. This distance must be taken perpendicular to the line of action of the forces. Once you have determined these values, you can easily find the moment by multiplying the force by the distance.

For instance, consider a couple consisting of two forces of $10 \, \text{N}$ each, with a distance of $5 \, \text{cm}$ between them. To calculate the moment of the couple, you would perform the following steps:

$$
M = Fd
$$
$$
M = 10 \, \text{N} \times 0.05 \, \text{m}
$$
$$
M = 0.5 \, \text{Nm}
$$

It is important to note that the moment of a couple is a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude and direction. The direction of the moment is perpendicular to the plane that contains the forces and can be determined using the right-hand rule.
