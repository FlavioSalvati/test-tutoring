Non-zero-sum games are characterized by a situation where the combined gains and losses of all players do not result in a net zero. 

In game theory, a zero-sum game is defined as a scenario where the profit of one player is exactly counterbalanced by the losses of the other player(s). In contrast, non-zero-sum games allow for a more dynamic interplay, where the total gains and losses of all players can diverge from zero. This implies that it is feasible for all players to either benefit or suffer losses simultaneously in a non-zero-sum game.

One prominent example of a non-zero-sum game is the prisoner's dilemma. In this scenario, two suspects are apprehended and placed in separate confinement. Each suspect faces the choice to either confess or remain silent. If both suspects choose to remain silent, they each receive a minimal sentence. If one suspect confesses while the other remains silent, the confessor is released, while the silent suspect faces a severe penalty. Conversely, if both suspects confess, they each receive a moderate sentence. This game exemplifies a non-zero-sum situation, as the total gains and losses of the two players do not sum to zero.

Another illustrative example of a non-zero-sum game is the game of chicken. In this scenario, two drivers are heading towards one another and must decide whether to swerve or to continue driving straight. If both drivers choose to swerve, they avoid a collision, resulting in a mutual benefit. If one driver swerves while the other continues straight, the driver who continues straight is deemed the "winner," while the one who swerved is the "loser." However, if both drivers opt to continue straight, they both "lose" due to the ensuing collision. This situation is also classified as non-zero-sum because the total gains and losses for the two drivers do not equate to zero.

In non-zero-sum games, players are required to contemplate the possible outcomes for all participants involved, rather than focusing solely on their individual gains or losses. This necessity can lead to more intricate strategies and outcomes compared to those found in zero-sum games.
