The derivative of the natural logarithm function is expressed as $\frac{1}{x}$.

The natural logarithm function, denoted as $\ln(x)$, serves as the inverse of the exponential function $e^x$. To find its derivative, we can utilize the chain rule, along with the fact that the derivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$ itself.

Let us define $y = \ln(x)$. By taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $x$, we obtain:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(\ln(x)).
$$

Applying the chain rule, this can be rewritten as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dy}(e^y) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\ln(x)).
$$

Since $e^y = x$, we can simplify this expression:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\ln(x)).
$$

Next, we need to find the derivative of $\ln(x)$. We can utilize the fact that $\ln(x)$ is the inverse of $e^x$. Specifically, $\ln(x) = y$ if and only if $x = e^y$. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $x$, we have:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(e^y).
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
1 = e^y \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}.
$$

Rearranging gives us:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{e^y}.
$$

Substituting back $e^y = x$ into the equation yields:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}.
$$

Thus, we conclude that the derivative of $\ln(x)$ is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(\ln(x)) = \frac{1}{x}.
$$
