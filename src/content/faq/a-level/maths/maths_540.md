Forced oscillation refers to the motion of a system that is influenced by an external force. Resonance occurs when the frequency of this external force aligns with the system's natural frequency, resulting in a significant increase in amplitude.

In forced oscillation, a system is subjected to an external force that may be either periodic or non-periodic. This force can be applied to any system that possesses a natural frequency of oscillation. The behavior of the system can be described by the following differential equation:

$$
m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F(t)
$$

In this equation, $m$ represents the mass of the system, $c$ signifies the damping coefficient, $k$ is the spring constant, $x$ denotes the displacement of the system from its equilibrium position, and $F(t)$ is the external force acting on the system.

Resonance happens when the frequency of the external force matches the system's natural frequency. This alignment allows the system to absorb energy from the external force, leading to a pronounced increase in amplitude. The natural frequency of a system can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
$$

Here, $\omega$ symbolizes the angular frequency of the system.

The effects of resonance can be either advantageous or harmful, depending on the context. In certain scenarios, resonance can be exploited to amplify signals or enhance the efficiency of a system. Conversely, it can also lead to structural damage or instability in other situations.

In summary, forced oscillation and resonance are fundamental concepts in the study of oscillatory motion. A thorough understanding of these principles is essential for designing and analyzing systems that exhibit oscillatory behavior.
