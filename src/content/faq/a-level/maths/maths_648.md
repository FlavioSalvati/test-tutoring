The gamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution that effectively models the waiting time required for a specific number of events to occur.

Commonly, the gamma distribution is applied in various fields such as reliability analysis, queuing theory, and finance. It is characterized by two parameters: the shape parameter, denoted as $\alpha$, and the rate parameter, denoted as $\beta$. The probability density function (PDF) of the gamma distribution can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
f(x) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\beta x}
$$

where $x \geq 0$, $\beta > 0$, and $\Gamma(\alpha)$ represents the gamma function.

The mean and variance of the gamma distribution are calculated as follows:

$$
\mu = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}
$$

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{\alpha}{\beta^2}
$$

The gamma distribution is particularly useful for modeling the waiting time until a specific number of events occur. For instance, if we are interested in determining the waiting time until a certain number of customers arrive at a store, the gamma distribution provides an effective framework for this analysis.

Additionally, it is important to note the relationship between the gamma distribution and the exponential distribution. Specifically, when the shape parameter $\alpha = 1$, the gamma distribution simplifies to the exponential distribution. The exponential distribution is used to model the waiting time for a single event to occur, whereas the gamma distribution is suitable for modeling the waiting time for multiple events to take place.
