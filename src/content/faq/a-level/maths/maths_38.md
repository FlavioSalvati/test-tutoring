The integral of $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

The integral of $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ serves as a classic example of a function whose antiderivative cannot be represented using elementary functions. This indicates that there is no formula involving only basic arithmetic operations, powers, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions that can yield the antiderivative of $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$.

Nonetheless, there are various methods available for approximating the value of this integral. One popular approach involves numerical integration techniques, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, which can be employed to estimate the area under the curve of $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ within specified limits. Another effective method is to utilize series expansions, such as the Taylor series or the Fourier series, to approximate the function itself, allowing for term-by-term integration of the resulting series.
