To determine the polar angle from Cartesian coordinates, you can use the formula:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right).
$$

Given a point in Cartesian coordinates, represented as $(x, y)$, the polar angle $\theta$ is calculated using this formula. This expression computes the angle between the positive x-axis and the line that connects the origin to the point $(x, y)$. Understanding the basis of this calculation is essential.

It is important to remember that the $\arctan$ function yields an angle in radians. If you need the angle in degrees, you can convert it by multiplying the result by $\frac{180}{\pi}$. For those interested in trigonometric identities, additional resources are available on their applications.

For instance, let's consider the point $(3, 4)$. The polar angle can be calculated as follows:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 0.93 \text{ radians},
$$

which is approximately

$$
\theta \approx 53.13 \text{ degrees}.
$$

To summarize, to find the polar angle $\theta$ from Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$, use the formula:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right).
$$

This will give you the angle in radians. If a degree measurement is preferred, simply multiply the result by $\frac{180}{\pi}$. For example, for the point $(3, 4)$, the polar angle is approximately $0.93$ radians or $53.13$ degrees. This method provides a clearer understanding of the angle's orientation within the plane.
