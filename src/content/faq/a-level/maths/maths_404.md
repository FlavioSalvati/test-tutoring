The inequality $ |9x + 2| < 0 $ has no solution.

To understand why, we must first clarify the concept of absolute value. The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line, and this distance is always non-negative. Consequently, the absolute value of any expression can never be less than zero.

In our case, we are examining the inequality $ |9x + 2| < 0 $. Since the absolute value of any number is non-negative, it is impossible for it to be less than zero. Thus, we conclude that there are no solutions to this inequality.

We can also approach this problem algebraically. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that a solution exists. If that were true, we would have:

$$
|9x + 2| < 0
$$

This implies two scenarios based on the definition of absolute value:

1. $ 9x + 2 < 0 $
2. $ -(9x + 2) < 0 $

From the first scenario, we get:

$$
9x < -2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x < -\frac{2}{9}
$$

From the second scenario, we simplify:

$$
-9x - 2 < 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -9x < 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x > -\frac{2}{9}
$$

Now we have two inequalities:

1. $ x < -\frac{2}{9} $
2. $ x > -\frac{2}{9} $

These two inequalities cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, we confirm that there is no solution to the inequality $ |9x + 2| < 0 $.
