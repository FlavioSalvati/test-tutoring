The conditions for achieving maximum efficiency in a machine occur when the output work is equal to the input work.

Efficiency is defined as the ratio of useful work performed by a machine to the energy input it receives. This ratio is expressed as a percentage and can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Output Work}}{\text{Input Work}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

For a machine to attain maximum efficiency, it is essential that the output work equals the input work. This condition implies that all the energy supplied to the machine is utilized effectively to perform useful work, with none of it wasted as heat or sound energy.

In real-world applications, achieving 100% efficiency is challenging due to various factors, such as friction and air resistance. However, engineers can design machines with features that minimize these energy losses, thereby enhancing overall efficiency.

One effective method for improving efficiency is the use of lubricants, which help reduce friction between moving components. Additionally, optimizing the machine's design to streamline its shape can significantly decrease air resistance.

It's important to understand that increasing a machine's efficiency does not inherently lead to an increase in output work. Rather, it indicates that the machine is utilizing energy more effectively. In certain scenarios, enhancing efficiency may even lead to a reduction in output work, as additional energy might be required to mitigate losses.

In summary, the conditions for maximum efficiency in a machine are met when the output work is equal to the input work. To reach this ideal state, machines must be designed to minimize losses caused by factors such as friction and air resistance.
