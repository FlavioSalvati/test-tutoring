The energy stored in a spring is described by the formula:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

where $k$ represents the spring constant and $x$ denotes the displacement from the spring's equilibrium position.

When a spring is either compressed or stretched from its equilibrium position, it accumulates potential energy, specifically referred to as elastic potential energy. This energy can be calculated using the same formula:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

In this equation, $k$ is the spring constant, which quantifies the stiffness of the spring. It indicates the amount of force needed to stretch or compress the spring by a unit length. The spring constant is measured in units of force per unit length, such as Newtons per meter (N/m) or kilograms per second squared (kg/sÂ²).

The variable $x$ represents the displacement, which is the distance the spring is moved from its equilibrium position. This displacement is typically measured in units of length, such as meters (m) or centimeters (cm).

To determine the energy stored in a spring, we must first know the values for the spring constant and the displacement from equilibrium. Once we have these values, we can substitute them into the formula:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

For instance, consider a spring with a spring constant of $10 \, \text{N/m}$ that is compressed by $0.2 \, \text{m}$ from its equilibrium position. The energy stored in the spring can be calculated as follows:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} (10 \, \text{N/m}) (0.2 \, \text{m})^2 = 0.2 \, \text{J}
$$

Thus, the energy stored in the spring is $0.2 \, \text{J}$.
