To find the integral of \( x^7 \), we apply the power rule of integration. This rule states that the integral of \( x^n \) is given by 

$$ 
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C, 
$$ 

where \( C \) represents the constant of integration. 

For the case of \( x^7 \), we can apply the power rule as follows:

$$ 
\int x^7 \, dx = \frac{1}{7+1} x^{7+1} + C = \frac{1}{8} x^8 + C. 
$$

To verify our result, we differentiate the expression \( \frac{1}{8} x^8 + C \) with respect to \( x \):

$$ 
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{8} x^8 + C \right) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 8 x^{7} = x^{7}. 
$$

This confirms that our integration is correct.

It is important to note that the constant of integration \( C \) can take any real value, as the derivative of a constant is zero. Consequently, there are infinitely many antiderivatives of \( x^7 \), each differing by a constant.
