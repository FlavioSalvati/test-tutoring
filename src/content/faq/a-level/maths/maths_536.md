To solve the equation $ e^{2x} = 7 $, we can isolate $ x $ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

$$
\ln(e^{2x}) = \ln(7)
$$

Using the logarithmic identity $ \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) $, we can simplify the left-hand side:

$$
2x \ln(e) = \ln(7)
$$

Since $ \ln(e) = 1 $, this further simplifies to:

$$
2x = \ln(7)
$$

Now, to find $ x $, we divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = \frac{\ln(7)}{2}
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation $ e^{2x} = 7 $ is 

$$
x = \frac{\ln(7)}{2}.
$$
