The hyperbolic functions are closely related to the exponential function $e^x$.

To understand how these hyperbolic functions are derived, we begin with the exponential function $e^x$ and its inverse, the natural logarithm $\ln(x)$. The hyperbolic functions are defined as follows:

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
$$

$$
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
$$

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}
$$

$$
\sech(x) = \frac{1}{\cosh(x)}
$$

$$
\csch(x) = \frac{1}{\sinh(x)}
$$

$$
\coth(x) = \frac{\cosh(x)}{\sinh(x)}
$$

To derive these formulas, we utilize the definitions of the exponential function along with properties of logarithms. For instance, to derive the formula for $\sinh(x)$, we start with:

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
$$

This can be rewritten based on the definition of the exponential function as follows:

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left(e^x - \frac{1}{e^x}\right)
$$

Utilizing the identity $e^x + \frac{1}{e^x} = 2\cosh(x)$, we can express $\sinh(x)$ in relation to $\cosh(x)$:

$$
\sinh(x) = \frac{1}{2}(e^x - e^{-x}) = \frac{1}{2}(e^x - \frac{1}{e^x})
$$

Similar derivation techniques can be employed to obtain the formulas for $\cosh(x)$, $\tanh(x)$, $\sech(x)$, $\csch(x)$, and $\coth(x)$.

In summary, the hyperbolic functions are formulated from the exponential function $e^x$ and its inverse, the natural logarithm $\ln(x)$. These functions play a crucial role in various fields of mathematics and physics, particularly in the analysis of curves and surfaces.
