Uniform acceleration occurs when an object's velocity changes by a constant amount in each unit of time, while non-uniform acceleration is characterized by changes in velocity that vary in magnitude over time.

Uniform acceleration is typically observed when an object is subjected to a constant force, such as the force of gravity. The acceleration can be calculated using the formula:

$$
a = \frac{v - u}{t}
$$

where:
- $a$ represents acceleration,
- $v$ is the final velocity,
- $u$ is the initial velocity, and
- $t$ is the time duration over which the change occurs.

For instance, consider a car that starts from rest (initial velocity $u = 0$) and reaches a velocity of $30 \, \text{m/s}$ in $5 \, \text{s}$. The acceleration can be calculated as follows:

$$
a = \frac{30 - 0}{5} = 6 \, \text{m/s}^2
$$

In contrast, non-uniform acceleration arises when an object is subjected to a varying force, such as air resistance. Although the same formula can be applied to calculate acceleration, the values of $v$, $u$, and $t$ will change over time. For example, when a ball is thrown upward, its acceleration is non-uniform because the force of air resistance alters as the ball moves through the air. To determine the acceleration at any specific moment during its flight, one can calculate the slope of the tangent line to the velocity-time graph at that point.

In summary, uniform acceleration is defined as a consistent change in velocity over equal time intervals, while non-uniform acceleration refers to varying changes in velocity caused by a changing force.
