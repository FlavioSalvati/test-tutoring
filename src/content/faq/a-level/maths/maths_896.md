Here is an enhanced version of your content for clarity and readability:

The solution to the equation $$\ln(2x) = 4$$ is given by $$x = \frac{e^4}{2}$$.

To solve the equation $$\ln(2x) = 4$$, we first need to isolate the variable $$x$$. We accomplish this by exponentiating both sides of the equation with the base $$e$$, which is the base of the natural logarithm. This results in the following equation:

$$e^{\ln(2x)} = e^4$$

Utilizing the property of logarithms that states $$\ln(e^a) = a$$, we can simplify the left-hand side:

$$2x = e^4$$

Next, we isolate $$x$$ by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

$$x = \frac{e^4}{2}$$

This expression can also be rewritten as:

$$x = e^{2} \cdot e^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}$$

However, it is more straightforward to present it as:

$$x = \frac{e^4}{2}$$

Thus, the final solution to the equation $$\ln(2x) = 4$$ is:

$$x = \frac{e^4}{2}$$.
