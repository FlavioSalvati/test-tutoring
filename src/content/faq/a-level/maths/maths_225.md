The period of a simple pendulum is influenced by its length, the gravitational acceleration, and the angle of displacement.

The period of a simple pendulum, denoted as $T$, refers to the time required for the pendulum to complete one full oscillation. The relationship between the period and the length of the pendulum can be expressed by the following equation:

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
$$

In this equation, $L$ represents the length of the pendulum, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. This formula illustrates that the period is directly proportional to the square root of the pendulum's length. Consequently, increasing the length of the pendulum will result in an increase in its period.

Additionally, the period of a simple pendulum is affected by gravitational acceleration. Since gravity is the force responsible for the pendulum's motion, we can rearrange the equation to highlight this relationship:

$$
g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}
$$

This expression indicates that the gravitational acceleration is directly proportional to the square of the period and inversely proportional to the length of the pendulum. Therefore, when gravitational acceleration increases, the period of the pendulum decreases.

Lastly, the angle of displacement also plays a role in determining the period of a simple pendulum. The restoring force that returns the pendulum to its equilibrium position is proportional to the sine of the angle of displacement. As a result, the period becomes longer for larger angles of displacement.

In summary, the period of a simple pendulum is influenced by its length, gravitational acceleration, and angle of displacement. These relationships can be effectively modeled using the equations presented above.
