The unit of speed in mechanics is expressed as metres per second, abbreviated as $m/s$.

Speed quantifies how quickly an object is moving. In the field of mechanics, speed is specifically defined as the distance an object travels per unit of time. The International System of Units (SI) designates metres ($m$) as the unit of distance and seconds ($s$) as the unit of time, leading to the conclusion that the SI unit of speed is metres per second ($m/s$).

To determine the speed of an object, we need two key pieces of information: the distance it has traveled and the time it took to cover that distance. The formula to compute speed is given by:

$$
\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}
$$

For instance, if a car covers a distance of $100$ metres in $10$ seconds, we can calculate its speed as follows:

$$
\text{speed} = \frac{100 \, m}{10 \, s} = 10 \, m/s
$$

It's essential to recognize that speed is a scalar quantity, which means it is characterized solely by its magnitude and does not include any directional component. In contrast, velocity is a vector quantity that has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit of velocity is also expressed in metres per second ($m/s$), but it incorporates a directional aspect, such as northward or eastward.

In summary, the unit of speed in mechanics is metres per second ($m/s$), calculated by dividing the distance traveled by an object by the time taken to travel that distance.
