Let's enhance the clarity and readability of the content while also formatting the mathematical expressions properly. Hereâ€™s the revised version:

To find the derivative of the function \( y = \tan(2x) \), we will apply the chain rule. 

First, we can introduce a substitution:
Let \( u = 2x \). Consequently, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( u \):
$$
y = \tan(u).
$$

Next, we differentiate \( y \) with respect to \( u \):
$$
\frac{dy}{du} = \sec^2(u).
$$

We also need to find the derivative of \( u \) with respect to \( x \):
$$
\frac{du}{dx} = 2.
$$

Now, we can apply the chain rule, which states that:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}.
$$

Substituting our expressions into the chain rule gives us:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \sec^2(u) \cdot 2 = 2\sec^2(u).
$$

Finally, substituting back \( u = 2x \) into our expression, we arrive at the derivative:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2\sec^2(2x).
$$

Thus, the derivative of \( y = \tan(2x) \) is \( 2\sec^2(2x) \).
