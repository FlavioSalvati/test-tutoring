To find the derivative of the function $ y = \ln(2x) $, we can apply the chain rule. 

First, we introduce a substitution: let $ u = 2x $. Consequently, we can rewrite our function as $ y = \ln(u) $. 

Using the chain rule, the derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

Now we calculate each component:

1. The derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ u $ is given by:
   $$
   \frac{dy}{du} = \frac{1}{u}
   $$

2. The derivative of $ u $ with respect to $ x $ is:
   $$
   \frac{du}{dx} = 2
   $$

Substituting these results back into our chain rule equation, we find:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{u} \cdot 2
$$

Next, we substitute back $ u = 2x $:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2x} \cdot 2
$$

Now, simplifying this expression yields:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}
$$

Thus, we conclude that the derivative of $ y = \ln(2x) $ is 

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}.
$$
