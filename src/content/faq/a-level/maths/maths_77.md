To evaluate the integral of $\sin(x) \cos^4(x)$, we find that it can be expressed as:

$$
\int \sin(x) \cos^4(x) \, dx = -\frac{1}{5} \cos^5(x) + C
$$

To solve this integral, we can use the substitution \( u = \cos(x) \). Consequently, the differential \( du \) can be expressed as \( du = -\sin(x) \, dx \). Using this substitution, we can rewrite the integral as follows:

$$
\int \sin(x) \cos^4(x) \, dx = -\int u^4 \, du
$$

Next, we integrate the expression:

$$
-\int u^4 \, du = -\frac{1}{5} u^5 + C
$$

Finally, substituting back \( u = \cos(x) \) gives us:

$$
-\frac{1}{5} \cos^5(x) + C
$$

Thus, the integral of $\sin(x) \cos^4(x)$ is:

$$
-\frac{1}{5} \cos^5(x) + C
$$
