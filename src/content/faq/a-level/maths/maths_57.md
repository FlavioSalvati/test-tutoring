title: "How is a complex number represented in polar form?"
summary: A complex number in polar form is expressed as $r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$, where $r$ is the magnitude and $\theta$ is the angle, combining both trigonometric functions and the imaginary unit.

A complex number can be represented in polar form using the expression:

$$
r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
$$

In this representation, the magnitude $r$ indicates the distance from the origin to the point that corresponds to the complex number in the complex plane, while the argument $\theta$ denotes the angle formed between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to that point.

To convert a complex number from rectangular form, expressed as $a + bi$, to polar form, we can utilize the following formulas:

$$
r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
$$

Conversely, to convert a complex number from polar form back to rectangular form, we use these formulas:

$$
a = r \cos \theta
$$

$$
b = r \sin \theta
$$

As an example, let's convert the complex number $3 + 4i$ into polar form. We start by calculating the magnitude $r$:

$$
r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5
$$

Next, we determine the argument $\theta$:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 0.93 \text{ radians}
$$

Thus, the complex number $3 + 4i$ can be represented in polar form as:

$$
5\left(\cos(0.93) + i \sin(0.93)\right)
$$
