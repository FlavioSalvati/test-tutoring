To effectively represent data using a waterfall chart, begin with a baseline value and adjust it by adding or subtracting values to illustrate changes.

A waterfall chart provides a visual representation of how an initial value is influenced by various positive and negative factors. This type of chart is particularly beneficial for analyzing financial data, such as profit and loss statements. To create a waterfall chart, start with a baseline value and proceed to add or subtract subsequent values to demonstrate the changes over time.

For instance, consider a scenario where a company reports a revenue of £100,000 in the first quarter of the year. In the second quarter, the company experiences an increase in sales amounting to £20,000 but also incurs expenses of £10,000. To construct the waterfall chart, you would begin with the baseline value of £100,000. Next, add the positive value of £20,000 to represent the increase in sales, followed by subtracting the negative value of £10,000 for the expenses. The resulting value, shown on the chart, would indicate the company's revenue for the second quarter as £110,000.

Waterfall charts can also illustrate cumulative changes over time. For example, if a company has revenues of £100,000 in the first quarter, £120,000 in the second quarter, and £150,000 in the third quarter, the waterfall chart would commence with the baseline value of £100,000. Then, you would add the positive value of £20,000 for the second quarter and £30,000 for the third quarter. Consequently, the chart would depict the company's total revenue for the year as £250,000.

In summary, waterfall charts are an effective tool for visualizing changes in data over time. By starting with a baseline value and systematically adding or subtracting values, you can easily track how the data evolves, enabling the identification of trends and patterns.
