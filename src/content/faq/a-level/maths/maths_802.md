To determine the argument of a complex number, you can use the formula: 

$$
\text{arg}(z) = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\text{Im}(z)}{\text{Re}(z)} \right).
$$

The argument of a complex number represents the angle formed between the positive real axis and the line that connects the origin to the complex number in the complex plane. This angle is measured in radians. In the formula, $\text{Im}(z)$ denotes the imaginary part of the complex number, while $\text{Re}(z)$ signifies the real part.

For instance, consider the complex number $z = 3 + 4i$. Here, the real part $\text{Re}(z)$ is $3$, and the imaginary part $\text{Im}(z)$ is $4$. Thus, the argument can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{arg}(z) = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{4}{3} \right) \approx 0.93 \text{ radians} \quad (\text{to two decimal places}).
$$

It is crucial to understand that the argument of a complex number is not unique; it can take on multiple values that differ by integer multiples of $2\pi$. To find all possible arguments of a complex number, you can add or subtract multiples of $2\pi$ from the computed argument.

For example, if we have $\text{arg}(z) = 0.93$ radians, then another valid argument would be:

$$
\text{arg}(z) + 2\pi \approx 3.07 \text{ radians}.
$$

In summary, the argument of a complex number can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{arg}(z) = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\text{Im}(z)}{\text{Re}(z)} \right).
$$

This argument is expressed in radians and can have multiple valid values that differ by $2\pi$.
