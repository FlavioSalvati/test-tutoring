The solution to the equation $\log_{10}(x) = 2$ is $x = 100$.

To solve the equation $\log_{10}(x) = 2$, it's essential to understand the concept of logarithms. A logarithm represents the exponent to which a base must be raised to yield a specific number. In this equation, the base is $10$, and the logarithm is $2$. Thus, we need to identify the value of $x$ such that $10$ raised to the power of $2$ equals $x$.

We can express this relationship in an alternative form: 

$$
x = 10^2.
$$

This transformation utilizes the fundamental property of logarithms, which states that if $\log_{b}(a) = c$, then $b^c = a$. Therefore, by raising the base $10$ to the power of the logarithm $2$, we can determine the value of $x$.

Upon simplifying $10^2$, we find:

$$
x = 100.
$$

Consequently, the solution to the equation $\log_{10}(x) = 2$ is $x = 100$.

It's worth noting that logarithms play a crucial role in various fields of mathematics and science, including finance, physics, and engineering. They are particularly effective for managing extremely large or small numbers, as they provide a more convenient way to express such values.
