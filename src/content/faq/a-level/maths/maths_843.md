The moment of a force about a specific point is determined by multiplying the magnitude of the force by the perpendicular distance from that point to the line of action of the force.

To calculate the moment of a force about a point, we consider both the force's magnitude and its distance from the point. The moment of a force is mathematically defined as:

$$
\text{Moment} = \text{Force} \times \text{Perpendicular distance}
$$

Here, the force is measured in newtons (N), while the distance is measured in meters (m).

To determine the perpendicular distance, we need to draw a line from the point to the line of action of the force. The perpendicular distance is the shortest distance between this line and the point, and it must be perpendicular to the line of action of the force.

For instance, let's consider a scenario where a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ is acting at a distance of $2 \, \text{m}$ from point $P$. If the force acts directly perpendicular to the line connecting point $P$ and the force, the moment of the force about point $P$ can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Moment} = \text{Force} \times \text{Perpendicular distance} = 10 \, \text{N} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 20 \, \text{Nm}
$$

However, if the force is applied at an angle to the line connecting point $P$ and the force, we must calculate the perpendicular distance using trigonometric methods. Depending on the available information, we can apply the sine or cosine rule to determine this distance accurately.
