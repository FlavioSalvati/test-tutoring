To derive the coefficients of a quadratic equation with specified roots, we can utilize the relationship between the roots and the equation's standard form. If the roots are denoted as $r_1$ and $r_2$, the equation can be expressed in the form:

$$(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0$$

In this case, the roots are $r_1 = 2$ and $r_2 = -3$. Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

$$(x - 2)(x + 3) = 0$$

Next, we expand this expression:

\[
(x - 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x - 2x - 6 = x^2 + x - 6
\]

Thus, the quadratic equation with the given roots is:

$$x^2 + x - 6 = 0$$

Now, comparing this expanded equation to the standard form of a quadratic equation, which is given by:

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

we can identify the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$. Here, we find:

- The coefficient $a$ is $1$, 
- The coefficient $b$ is obtained from the term $-(-2 + (-3))$, which simplifies to $1$, and 
- The coefficient $c$ is derived from the product of the roots $2 \cdot (-3)$, yielding $-6$.

Therefore, the coefficients of the quadratic equation corresponding to the roots $2$ and $-3$ are:

$$a = 1, \quad b = 1, \quad c = -6$$

In summary, the quadratic equation with roots $2$ and $-3$ has coefficients of $1$, $1$, and $-6$.
