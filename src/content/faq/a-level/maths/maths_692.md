To find the sum of an infinite geometric series, you can use the formula:

$$ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} $$

In this formula, $a$ represents the first term of the series, and $r$ denotes the common ratio.

An infinite geometric series is characterized by each term being multiplied by a constant ratio to obtain the subsequent term, and this process continues indefinitely. The sum of such a series can be calculated using the aforementioned formula, where $a$ is the initial term and $r$ is the common ratio.

To apply this formula, start by identifying the values of $a$ and $r$. Next, substitute these values into the formula and simplify as needed. For example, consider the series:

$$ 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \ldots $$

In this series, we have $a = 2$ (the first term) and $r = 2$ (the common ratio). Substituting these values into the formula, we find:

$$ S = \frac{2}{1 - 2} $$
$$ S = \frac{2}{-1} $$
$$ S = -2 $$

Thus, the sum of the infinite geometric series $2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \ldots$ is $-2$.

However, it is crucial to remember that the formula $$ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} $$ is only valid if the absolute value of the common ratio $r$ is less than $1$, i.e., $|r| < 1$. If the absolute value of $r$ is greater than or equal to $1$, the series does not converge to a finite sum, and it is classified as diverging.
