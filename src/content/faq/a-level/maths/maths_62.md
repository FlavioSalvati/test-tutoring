The probability of the union of two events is calculated as the sum of their individual probabilities, subtracting the probability of their intersection.

When considering two events, denoted as $A$ and $B$, the union of these events is represented by $A \cup B$. This union signifies that either event $A$, event $B$, or both events occur. The probability of the union can be determined using the following formula:

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

In this formula, $P(A)$ denotes the probability of event $A$ occurring, $P(B)$ is the probability of event $B$ occurring, and $P(A \cap B)$ represents the probability that both events $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously.

To illustrate the necessity of subtracting the probability of the intersection, let's consider an example involving a fair six-sided die. If we want to determine the probability of rolling either a $1$ or a $2$, we find that:

- The probability of rolling a $1$ is $\frac{1}{6}$.
- The probability of rolling a $2$ is also $\frac{1}{6}$.
- The probability of rolling both a $1$ and a $2$ at the same time is $0$, since only one face of the die can show at a time.

Thus, we can calculate the probability of rolling either a $1$ or a $2$ as follows:

$$
P(1 \cup 2) = P(1) + P(2) - P(1 \cap 2) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}
$$

In general, the probability of the union of two events is always greater than or equal to the probability of either event occurring alone. This is because the intersection of the two events can only reduce the overall probability of their union.
