The principle of conservation of power asserts that the total power within a closed system remains constant over time.

In the context of physics, power is defined as the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred. The conservation of power principle indicates that within a closed system, the total power input must equal the total power output. This implies that the power entering the system is balanced by the power leaving the system.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
P_{\text{in}} = P_{\text{out}}
$$

Here, $P_{\text{in}}$ denotes the power entering the system, while $P_{\text{out}}$ signifies the power exiting the system. This principle is particularly relevant in electrical circuits, where the power supplied by the source must equal the power consumed by the circuit's components.

To illustrate this concept, consider a simple circuit that comprises a battery, a resistor, and a switch. When the switch is closed, the battery provides power to the resistor, which converts electrical energy into heat. According to the conservation of power principle, the power supplied by the battery must equal the power consumed by the resistor.

Let $V$ represent the voltage of the battery, $R$ the resistance of the resistor, and $I$ the current flowing through the circuit. The power supplied by the battery can be expressed as:

$$
P_{\text{in}} = VI
$$

Meanwhile, the power consumed by the resistor is given by:

$$
P_{\text{out}} = I^2R
$$

By applying the conservation of power, we equate these two expressions:

$$
VI = I^2R
$$

This equation can be simplified to:

$$
V = IR
$$

This relationship is known as Ohm's Law, which connects voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit.

In summary, the principle of conservation of power is a fundamental concept in both physics and electrical engineering. It confirms that the total power in a closed system remains unchanged and serves as a crucial tool for analyzing and designing electrical circuits.
