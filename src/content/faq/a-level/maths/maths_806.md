The cosine rule, also referred to as the law of cosines, establishes a relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle.

In any triangle $ ABC $, the cosine rule states that the square of the length of side $ a $ is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of sides $ b $ and $ c $, minus twice the product of the lengths of sides $ b $ and $ c $ multiplied by the cosine of the angle $ A $ between them. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos(A)
$$

Similarly, the rule can be formulated in terms of the other sides and their corresponding angles:

$$
b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cos(B)
$$

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)
$$

Here, $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ are the angles opposite to sides $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, respectively.

To derive the cosine rule, we can start with the formula for the cosine of angle $ A $:

$$
\cos(A) = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}
$$

By multiplying both sides of this equation by $ 2bc $, we obtain:

$$
2bc \cos(A) = b^2 + c^2 - a^2
$$

Next, by adding $ a^2 $ to both sides, we arrive at:

$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos(A)
$$

This equation confirms the cosine rule for angle $ A $. The derivations for the other two forms of the cosine rule can be conducted in a similar manner.

The cosine rule is particularly valuable for determining the length of a side or the measure of an angle in a triangle when the other sides and angles are known. It plays a crucial role in trigonometry and is widely applied in solving problems in physics and engineering.
