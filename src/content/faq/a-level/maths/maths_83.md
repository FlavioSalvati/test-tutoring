The null hypothesis is a foundational concept in statistical hypothesis testing, representing the assumption that there is no significant difference between the groups or variables being compared.

In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis, denoted as $H_0$, serves as the default assumption. It posits that any observed differences between the two groups are due to random chance rather than a true effect. In contrast, the alternative hypothesis, represented as $H_a$, asserts that there is a significant difference between the groups.

For instance, when evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug for treating a specific disease, the null hypothesis would state that the drug has no effect on the disease. Conversely, the alternative hypothesis would suggest that the drug does have a measurable effect.

To assess the validity of the null hypothesis, researchers employ various statistical methods, such as a t-test or a chi-squared test. These tests calculate the probability of observing the results if the null hypothesis were true. If this probability is found to be very low—typically below $0.05$—researchers may reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

It's crucial to understand that failing to reject the null hypothesis does not imply that $H_0$ is true. Rather, it indicates that there is insufficient evidence to dismiss it. Therefore, when interpreting the results of a study, it is essential to take into account the context and limitations of the research.
