The integral of the expression 

$$
\frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2}
$$ 

is given by 

$$
x + C,
$$ 

where $C$ represents the constant of integration.

When performing integration, it is crucial to simplify the expression as much as possible before proceeding. In this case, we can simplify the integrand by canceling the $(x^2 + 1)^2$ terms in both the numerator and the denominator. This simplification leads us to:

$$
\int \frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} \, dx = \int 1 \, dx.
$$ 

Integrating the constant $1$ with respect to $x$ yields:

$$
\int 1 \, dx = x.
$$ 

Thus, the final result of the integral is:

$$
\int \frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} \, dx = x + C,
$$ 

where $C$ is the constant of integration.
