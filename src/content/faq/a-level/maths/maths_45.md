The row space of a matrix is a crucial concept in linear algebra, defined as the subspace spanned by its row vectors. More specifically, it comprises all possible linear combinations of the row vectors of a given matrix $A$. Understanding the row space provides valuable insights into the properties of the matrix.

To determine the row space of a matrix, one effective method is to perform row reduction to convert the matrix into its row echelon form. The nonzero rows of this transformed matrix then serve as a basis for the row space. Alternatively, one can consider the transpose of the matrix and analyze its column space, which is equivalent to the row space of the original matrix.

The dimension of the row space is known as the rank of the matrix, denoted as $\text{rank}(A)$, and it corresponds to the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) within the matrix. It is important to note that the row space is orthogonal to the null space of the matrix. The null space is defined as the subspace consisting of all solutions to the homogeneous equation $Ax = 0$.

The row space has numerous applications both in linear algebra and in various fields beyond. For instance, it can help determine whether a system of linear equations has a unique solution or can be utilized to find the projection of a vector onto a specific subspace.
