To find the roots of a cubic polynomial, we can utilize either the cubic formula or the factor theorem.

The cubic formula is a comprehensive method that can be applied to determine the roots of any cubic polynomial. However, it is known for its complexity and can be time-consuming to compute. The formula is given by:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac - 3b^3}}{2a}
$$

In this expression, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the cubic polynomial in the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$.

Alternatively, we can employ the factor theorem to find the roots of a cubic polynomial. This method involves factoring the polynomial into linear and quadratic components, followed by solving for the roots of each factor. According to the factor theorem, if a polynomial $f(x)$ has a factor $(x - r)$, then it follows that $f(r) = 0$.

For instance, consider the cubic polynomial $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$. We can factor this polynomial as:

$$
(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)
$$

This can be accomplished using either long division or synthetic division. Consequently, the roots of the polynomial are $x = 1$, $x = 2$, and $x = 3$.

In certain cases, the polynomial may not factor easily. In such instances, the cubic formula might be the most suitable approach. However, if the polynomial does possess rational roots, the factor theorem often provides a quicker and more straightforward method for finding those roots.
