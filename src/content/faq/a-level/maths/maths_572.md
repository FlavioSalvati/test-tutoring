To find the derivative of the function $ y = \cot(4x) $, we will use the chain rule. 

First, we can introduce a substitution to simplify our calculations. Let $ u = 4x $. Consequently, we can rewrite our function as $ y = \cot(u) $.

According to the chain rule, the derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ x $ can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

Next, we need to compute $ \frac{dy}{du} $. The derivative of $ \cot(u) $ is given by:

$$
\frac{dy}{du} = -\csc^2(u)
$$

Substituting back for $ u $, we have:

$$
\frac{dy}{du} = -\csc^2(4x)
$$

Now, we determine $ \frac{du}{dx} $. The derivative of $ u $ with respect to $ x $ is:

$$
\frac{du}{dx} = 4
$$

We can now substitute both derivatives back into our chain rule expression:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\csc^2(4x) \cdot 4
$$

Simplifying this expression, we obtain:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -4 \csc^2(4x)
$$

Thus, we conclude that the derivative of $ y = \cot(4x) $ is:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -4 \csc^2(4x)
$$
