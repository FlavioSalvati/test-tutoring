To evaluate the integral of the expression $\frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{(x^2 + 1)}$, we can simplify it by canceling the common factor of $(x^2 + 1)$ present in both the numerator and the denominator. This simplification leads to:

$$
\int \frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{(x^2 + 1)} \, dx = \int (x^2 + 1) \, dx.
$$

Next, we can expand the integrand:

$$
\int (x^2 + 1) \, dx = \int x^2 \, dx + \int 1 \, dx.
$$

Now, we will integrate each term separately. The integral of $x^2$ is:

$$
\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C_1,
$$

and the integral of $1$ is:

$$
\int 1 \, dx = x + C_2.
$$

Combining these results, we obtain:

$$
\int (x^2 + 1) \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + x + C,
$$

where $C$ is the constant of integration, incorporating both $C_1$ and $C_2$.

Thus, the final result for the integral is:

$$
\int \frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{(x^2 + 1)} \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + x + C.
$$
