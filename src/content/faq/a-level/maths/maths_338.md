The inequality 

$$ |7x + 1| \leq 0 $$ 

has a single solution: 

$$ x = -\frac{1}{7}. $$ 

To solve the inequality, we start by recognizing that the absolute value of any real number is always non-negative. Consequently, the left-hand side of the inequality, $|7x + 1|$, is also non-negative. The only scenario in which this inequality holds true is when the expression equals zero:

$$ |7x + 1| = 0. $$ 

The only real number whose absolute value is zero is zero itself. Therefore, we set the expression inside the absolute value to zero:

$$ 7x + 1 = 0. $$ 

Now, solving for $x$, we find:

$$ 7x = -1 $$

which simplifies to 

$$ x = -\frac{1}{7}. $$ 

This is the sole solution to the inequality. We can verify that it satisfies the original inequality:

$$ |7(-\frac{1}{7}) + 1| = |-1 + 1| = |0| = 0 \leq 0. $$ 

Thus, the solution to the inequality 

$$ |7x + 1| \leq 0 $$ 

is 

$$ x = -\frac{1}{7}. $$
