Marginal probability refers to the likelihood of a particular event occurring in one variable while disregarding the influence of other variables. 

In the realm of probability theory, a joint probability distribution characterizes the probabilities associated with two or more random variables simultaneously. The marginal probability of a variable can be derived by summing or integrating the joint probability distribution across the values of the other variables.

For instance, consider two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, represented by the following joint probability distribution table:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
X/Y & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
0 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\
1 & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\
2 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

To calculate the marginal probability distribution of $X$, we sum the joint probabilities across the different values of $Y$:

- For $X = 0$: 
$$ P(X=0) = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.4 $$
- For $X = 1$: 
$$ P(X=1) = 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.1 = 0.6 $$
- For $X = 2$: 
$$ P(X=2) = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.3 $$

Similarly, we can determine the marginal probability distribution of $Y$ by summing the joint probabilities across the different values of $X$:

- For $Y = 0$: 
$$ P(Y=0) = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.4 $$
- For $Y = 1$: 
$$ P(Y=1) = 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.1 = 0.6 $$
- For $Y = 2$: 
$$ P(Y=2) = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.3 $$

Marginal probabilities play a crucial role in various fields within probability theory and statistics, including hypothesis testing, Bayesian inference, and machine learning.
