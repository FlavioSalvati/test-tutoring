The derivative of the function $ y = \frac{1}{x} $ is given by $ -\frac{1}{x^2} $.

To find the derivative of $ y = \frac{1}{x} $, we can apply the power rule of differentiation. We start by rewriting the function in terms of a power of $ x $. Let $ u = x $, then we can express $ y $ as:

$$
y = u^{-1}
$$

Now, applying the power rule, we differentiate $ y $ with respect to $ u $:

$$
\frac{dy}{du} = -u^{-2}
$$

Next, we substitute back $ x $ for $ u $ to find the derivative with respect to $ x $:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -x^{-2}
$$

This can be simplified to:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{1}{x^2}
$$

Thus, the derivative of $ y = \frac{1}{x} $ is $ -\frac{1}{x^2} $. This indicates that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $ y = \frac{1}{x} $ at any point $ (x, y) $ is equal to $ -\frac{1}{x^2} $.

Furthermore, we observe that the derivative is negative for all $ x $ (except at $ x = 0 $, where the function is undefined), which implies that the function is decreasing throughout its domain. Additionally, as $ x $ approaches either positive or negative infinity, the derivative approaches zero. This behavior suggests that the function approaches zero but never actually reaches it.
