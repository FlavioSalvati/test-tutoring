A mathematical model is validated by comparing its predictions against real-world data.

To effectively verify a mathematical model, one must analyze its predictions in relation to actual data collected from the real world. This process involves gathering relevant data and utilizing it to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions. If the model's forecasts align closely with the observed data, it is deemed verified. Conversely, if there is a discrepancy between the predictions and the data, the model requires revision.

One common approach for verifying a mathematical model is through statistical analysis. This method includes comparing the model's predictions with actual data using various statistical tests, such as the chi-squared test or the t-test. If these statistical analyses indicate that the model's predictions significantly differ from the observed data, it suggests that the model needs to be refined.

Another effective technique for model verification is sensitivity analysis. This approach entails varying the model's parameters and observing the resultant changes in predictions. If the predictions show considerable sensitivity to adjustments in the parameters, the model is considered validated. However, if the predictions remain largely unchanged despite parameter variations, the model must be revised.

In summary, a mathematical model is verified through the comparison of its predictions with real-world data, utilizing both statistical analysis and sensitivity analysis. A model is considered validated if its predictions align with the data and exhibit responsiveness to parameter changes.
