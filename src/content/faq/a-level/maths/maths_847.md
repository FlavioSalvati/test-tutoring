To solve the equation 

$$
\ln(3x) = 7,
$$ 

we start by isolating the variable $x$. We can achieve this by exponentiating both sides of the equation using the base of the natural logarithm, $e$. Doing so yields:

$$
e^{\ln(3x)} = e^7.
$$

Next, we apply the logarithmic property that states 

$$
\ln(a^b) = b \cdot \ln(a). 
$$ 

This allows us to simplify the left-hand side:

$$
e^{\ln(3) + \ln(x)} = e^7.
$$

Utilizing the property of exponents that states 

$$
e^{\ln(a)} = a, 
$$ 

we can further simplify the left-hand side:

$$
3x = e^7.
$$

To isolate $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by $3$:

$$
x = \frac{e^7}{3}.
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation 

$$
\ln(3x) = 7 
$$ 

is 

$$
x = \frac{e^7}{3}.
$$ 

In conclusion, we find that 

$$
x = e^{\frac{7}{3}} 
$$ 

is indeed the correct solution.
