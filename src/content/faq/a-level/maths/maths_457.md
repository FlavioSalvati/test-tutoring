To solve the equation 

$$
\ln(5x) = 6,
$$ 

we need to isolate the variable $x$. We can achieve this by exponentiating both sides of the equation using $e$, the base of the natural logarithm. This results in:

$$
e^{\ln(5x)} = e^6.
$$

Applying the property of logarithms, which states that $\ln(e^y) = y$, allows us to simplify the left-hand side of the equation to:

$$
5x = e^6.
$$

Next, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $5$:

$$
x = \frac{e^6}{5}.
$$

Thus, the solution to the equation $\ln(5x) = 6$ is 

$$
x = \frac{e^6}{5}.
$$
