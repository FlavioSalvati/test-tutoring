The inequality $ |11x + 3| \leq 0 $ has no solutions.

To understand why, we first recognize that the absolute value of any real number is always non-negative. Specifically, for any real number $ a $, it holds that $ |a| \geq 0 $. Consequently, this implies that $ |11x + 3| \geq 0 $ for all $ x $ in $ \mathbb{R} $.

Now, let's consider the possibility of there being some $ x $ in $ \mathbb{R} $ such that $ |11x + 3| \leq 0 $. According to the definition of absolute value, this condition can only be satisfied if $ 11x + 3 = 0 $. Solving this equation for $ x $, we find:

$$
11x + 3 = 0 \implies 11x = -3 \implies x = -\frac{3}{11}.
$$

However, we need to check whether this value of $ x $ satisfies the original inequality. Substituting $ x = -\frac{3}{11} $ into the expression, we get:

$$
|11(-\frac{3}{11}) + 3| = |-3 + 3| = |0| = 0.
$$

While this shows that $ |11x + 3| $ equals $ 0 $, it does not satisfy the condition $ |11x + 3| < 0 $ because $ 0 $ is not less than $ 0 $.

Thus, we conclude that there are no solutions to the inequality $ |11x + 3| \leq 0 $. In summary, since the absolute value of any real number cannot be negative, the inequality $ |11x + 3| \leq 0 $ has no solutions.
