Electronegativity is defined as the ability of an atom to attract electrons toward itself when participating in a chemical bond.

This property is pivotal in determining the nature of the chemical bond formed between two atoms. When two atoms with similar electronegativities bond, they tend to share electrons equally, resulting in a nonpolar covalent bond. Conversely, when two atoms exhibit a significant difference in electronegativity, the more electronegative atom draws the shared electrons closer to itself, leading to the formation of a polar covalent bond.

In the case of ionic bonding, the disparity in electronegativity between two atoms is substantial enough that one atom completely transfers its valence electrons to the other. This transfer results in the formation of ions with opposite charges, which are then attracted to each other.

The concept of electronegativity also elucidates why certain elements preferentially form specific types of bonds. For instance, elements within the same group of the periodic table typically exhibit similar electronegativities, which leads them to form analogous types of bonds. Moreover, electronegativity tends to increase across a period in the periodic table. As a result, atoms located on the right side of the table are generally more electronegative and are more likely to form polar bonds.

In summary, electronegativity is a fundamental concept for understanding chemical bonding and the characteristics of molecules.
