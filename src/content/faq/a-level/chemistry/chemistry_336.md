The solubility product, denoted as $K_{sp}$, quantifies the maximum concentration of a substance that can dissolve in a solvent. Specifically, it is defined as the product of the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution of a compound.

When a complex ion forms, it can precipitate out of the solution if the concentration of the constituent ions exceeds the solubility product. This occurs because the excess ions aggregate to form solid particles that are no longer soluble in the solvent.

For instance, when a solution of silver nitrate is combined with a solution of sodium chloride, a white precipitate of silver chloride ($AgCl$) forms. This precipitation happens because the concentrations of silver ions ($Ag^+$) and chloride ions ($Cl^-$) surpass the solubility product of silver chloride, leading to its crystallization out of the solution.

The solubility product can also be instrumental in predicting the formation of complexes. By knowing the $K_{sp}$ of a compound, one can determine the concentration of ions in a saturated solution. If the concentration of one ion is known, it allows for the calculation of the maximum allowable concentration of the other ion that can exist in the solution without resulting in precipitation.

In summary, the solubility product serves as an indicator of the maximum concentration of a substance that can dissolve in a solvent. It is a crucial tool for predicting the precipitation of complexes by comparing the concentrations of ions in solution with the solubility product of the compound.
