Halogenoalkanes, also referred to as haloalkanes or alkyl halides, are a category of organic compounds characterized by the presence of at least one halogen atom—specifically fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine—bonded to a carbon atom. These compounds are widely utilized in various applications, including as solvents, refrigerants, and intermediates in the synthesis of other organic materials.

The physical and chemical properties of halogenoalkanes are influenced by both the size and nature of the halogen atom, as well as the structure of the carbon chain. Generally, the boiling points of halogenoalkanes tend to increase with the increasing size of the halogen atom, which is attributed to stronger intermolecular forces. Additionally, halogenoalkanes are typically less reactive than alkanes. This reduced reactivity is primarily due to the electronegativity of the halogen atom, which draws electrons away from the carbon atom, rendering it less reactive.

An illustrative example of a halogenoalkane is chloroethane, with the chemical formula $C_2H_5Cl$. Chloroethane is commonly used as a solvent and serves as a precursor in the production of vinyl chloride, which is essential for manufacturing polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This compound is a colorless, flammable gas that emits a sweet odor, with a boiling point of $12.3^\circ C$. In addition to its uses in industrial applications, chloroethane has been employed as an anesthetic and as a refrigerant in specific contexts. However, it is important to note that chloroethane is toxic and can lead to significant health issues, including damage to the nervous system and liver, if ingested or inhaled in substantial amounts.
