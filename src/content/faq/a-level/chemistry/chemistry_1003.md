The electron transfer properties of various metals differ significantly due to their distinct electron configurations.

Metals possess a range of electron configurations, which directly influences their capacity to transfer electrons. Transition metals, characterized by partially filled $d$-orbitals, can readily lose or gain electrons. This property makes them effective catalysts in redox reactions. On the other hand, alkali metals contain a single valence electron, rendering them highly reactive as they easily lose this electron to form a positive ion. Alkaline earth metals, which have two valence electrons, exhibit lower reactivity compared to alkali metals; however, they can still form positive ions.

In contrast, noble metals such as gold and platinum possess fully filled $d$-orbitals, making them relatively inert. These metals do not readily lose or gain electrons, which contributes to their widespread use in jewelry and electronics due to their resistance to corrosion. Other metals, such as copper and iron, also have partially filled $d$-orbitals but are generally less reactive than transition metals. Their strength and conductivity make them popular choices for applications in electrical wiring and construction.

In summary, the ability of different types of metals to transfer electrons is fundamentally linked to their electron configurations. This characteristic influences their reactivity and their capacity to lose or gain electrons, which in turn makes them valuable for a variety of industrial and technological applications.
