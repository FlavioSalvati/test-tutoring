The equilibrium constant is a numerical value that quantifies the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium.

Chemical equilibrium is achieved when the rate of the forward reaction matches the rate of the reverse reaction. At this stage, the concentrations of both reactants and products remain constant over time. The equilibrium constant, denoted as $K_c$, indicates the extent to which a reaction has reached equilibrium. It is calculated using the following formula:

$$
K_c = \frac{[\text{products}]^{\text{stoichiometric coefficients of products}}}{[\text{reactants}]^{\text{stoichiometric coefficients of reactants}}}
$$

The value of $K_c$ remains constant for a given temperature and pressure, and it is unaffected by the initial concentrations of the reactants and products. If $K_c$ is greater than $1$, it suggests that the equilibrium favors the formation of products. Conversely, if $K_c$ is less than $1$, the equilibrium favors the reactants. When $K_c$ equals $1$, it indicates that the reaction is at equilibrium.

The equilibrium constant serves as a crucial tool for understanding chemical reactions and predicting their outcomes. It can be used to determine the direction in which a reaction is expected to proceed, as well as to calculate the concentrations of reactants and products once equilibrium is established.
