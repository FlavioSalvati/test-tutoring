Halogenoalkanes can be classified into three categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary, based on the number of carbon atoms that are directly bonded to the carbon atom containing the halogen.

- **Primary halogenoalkanes** have the halogen atom attached to a carbon that is bonded to only one other carbon atom.
- **Secondary halogenoalkanes** feature a halogen bonded to a carbon atom that is connected to two other carbon atoms.
- **Tertiary halogenoalkanes** possess a halogen attached to a carbon that is bonded to three other carbon atoms.

The reactivity of halogenoalkanes is inversely related to the number of carbon atoms bonded to the carbon atom with the halogen. Specifically, as the number of carbon substituents increases, the strength of the carbon-halogen bond decreases. This weakening of the bond makes it easier for the halogen to dissociate and for nucleophiles to attack.

- **Primary halogenoalkanes** are the least reactive, necessitating the use of strong nucleophiles and elevated temperatures for substitution reactions to occur.
- **Secondary halogenoalkanes** exhibit greater reactivity and can participate in substitution reactions with weaker nucleophiles and at lower temperatures.
- **Tertiary halogenoalkanes** are the most reactive and can undergo substitution reactions with very weak nucleophiles even at room temperature.

In addition to reactivity, the boiling points of halogenoalkanes also show a trend: they increase as the number of carbon atoms bonded to the halogen-bearing carbon atom increases. This rise in boiling point can be attributed to the larger molecular size, which provides a greater surface area for London dispersion forces to act upon, consequently making these molecules more challenging to separate.
