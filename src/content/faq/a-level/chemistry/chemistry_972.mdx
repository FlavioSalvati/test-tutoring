A telluride is defined as a compound that contains tellurium, while a selenide is a compound that contains selenium.

Both tellurides and selenides are classified as binary compounds, which means they consist of two distinct elements. Specifically, tellurides contain tellurium alongside another element, whereas selenides comprise selenium and another element. Notably, both tellurium and selenium belong to the same group on the periodic table, known as the chalcogens, which are recognized for their ability to form compounds with metals.

For instance, cadmium telluride (CdTe) exemplifies a telluride. This compound serves as a semiconductor, commonly utilized in solar cells and various electronic devices. It is synthesized by combining cadmium and tellurium in a $1:1$ ratio. Another notable telluride is bismuth telluride ($\text{Bi}_2\text{Te}_3$), which is a thermoelectric material used for cooling applications and power generation.

Turning to selenides, zinc selenide (ZnSe) is a prime example. Like cadmium telluride, it is also a semiconductor, employed in a variety of electronic applications, and is formed by mixing zinc and selenium in a $1:1$ ratio. Additionally, copper selenide ($\text{Cu}_2\text{Se}$) is another significant selenide, often used in photovoltaic cells and other electronic devices.

In summary, both tellurides and selenides play a crucial role in numerous industries, particularly in electronics and energy production. Their unique properties render them valuable for a wide array of applications, and ongoing research continues to investigate innovative uses for these compounds in the future.
