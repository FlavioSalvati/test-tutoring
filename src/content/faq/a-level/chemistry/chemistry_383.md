An example of an acyl chloride is ethanoyl chloride, while acetamide serves as an example of an amide.

Ethanoyl chloride, commonly referred to as acetyl chloride, is a colorless liquid characterized by a pungent odor. It is primarily utilized in the production of acetic anhydride, which is in turn used to manufacture cellulose acetateâ€”a type of plastic widely employed in photographic film and textiles. Additionally, ethanoyl chloride plays a significant role in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

On the other hand, acetamide is a white crystalline solid that is soluble in water. It is employed as a solvent and serves as a precursor to various chemicals, including acetanilide, which is used in dye and pharmaceutical production. Moreover, acetamide is involved in the synthesis of polyacrylamide, a polymer utilized in water treatment and oil recovery processes.

Both ethanoyl chloride and acetamide contain the functional group $-CO-NH-$. This group is referred to as the amide group and is formed through the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an amine. In the case of ethanoyl chloride, the carboxylic acid involved is acetic acid, while acetamide also derives from acetic acid. The amine in both reactions is ammonia, which neutralizes the hydrogen chloride produced during the reaction.
