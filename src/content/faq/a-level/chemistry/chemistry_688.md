Changes in concentration, pressure, and temperature influence the equilibrium constant in distinct ways.

**Effects of Concentration:**  
Alterations in concentration shift the position of the equilibrium rather than changing the equilibrium constant itself. When the concentration of a reactant is increased, the equilibrium shifts toward the products in an effort to counteract this change. This shift leads to a higher concentration of products, thus resisting the initial increase in reactant concentration. Conversely, if the concentration of a product is increased, the equilibrium shifts toward the reactants, resulting in a decrease in the concentration of products.

**Effects of Pressure:**  
Changes in pressure only affect the equilibrium constant for reactions involving gaseous substances. An increase in pressure typically causes the equilibrium to shift toward the side of the reaction that has fewer moles of gas, which can lead to a decrease in the equilibrium constant. On the other hand, a decrease in pressure causes the equilibrium to shift toward the side with more moles of gas, resulting in an increase in the equilibrium constant.

**Effects of Temperature:**  
Temperature changes directly alter the value of the equilibrium constant itself. For endothermic reactions, an increase in temperature results in an increase in the equilibrium constant, while for exothermic reactions, the equilibrium constant decreases with rising temperature. Conversely, a decrease in temperature will cause the equilibrium constant to decrease for endothermic reactions and increase for exothermic reactions.

In summary, changes in concentration and pressure affect the position of the equilibrium, whereas changes in temperature influence the value of the equilibrium constant itself.
