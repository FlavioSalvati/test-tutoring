An imine is a chemical compound characterized by a carbon-nitrogen double bond, whereas an amine is defined as a compound that contains a nitrogen atom bonded to one or more carbon atoms.

Imines are generated through the reaction of a carbonyl compound, such as an aldehyde or a ketone, with a primary amine. The product of this reaction features a carbon-nitrogen double bond, which imparts distinct properties to imines. Notably, imines can function as electron acceptors and are capable of participating in various chemical reactions, including hydrolysis and reduction.

In contrast, amines are compounds that consist of a nitrogen atom bonded to one or more carbon atoms. They can be categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, depending on the number of carbon atoms attached to the nitrogen atom. Amines play a vital role in biological systems, as they are integral components of many amino acids, neurotransmitters, and other essential compounds.

For instance, benzaldehyde imine serves as a notable example of an imine. It is produced by the reaction of benzaldehyde with ammonia, resulting in a compound that contains a carbon-nitrogen double bond and is utilized in organic synthesis. On the other hand, dopamine exemplifies an amine; it is a neurotransmitter that is crucial for the brain's reward and pleasure centers. Dopamine features a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms, classifying it as a primary amine.
