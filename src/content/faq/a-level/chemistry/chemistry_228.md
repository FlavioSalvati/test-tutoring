The nucleophilic addition of aldehydes and ketones is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, characterized by the addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl group.

One illustrative example of nucleophilic addition is the reaction between formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide. In this reaction, the cyanide ion acts as the nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group. This interaction leads to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate, which subsequently collapses to yield a new carbon-nitrogen bond and a hydroxyl group. This process is referred to as the cyanohydrin reaction, which is significant in the synthesis of Î±-hydroxy acids and amino acids.

Another notable example is the reaction between acetone and sodium bisulfite. Here, the bisulfite ion serves as the nucleophile, targeting the carbonyl group to form a sulfonic acid intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes a dehydration reaction, resulting in the formation of a sulfonic acid ester. This reaction is particularly useful for the purification of aldehydes and ketones.

A third example involves the reaction between benzaldehyde and phenylhydrazine. In this case, phenylhydrazine acts as the nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl group to create a hydrazone intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes dehydration to form a stable hydrazone product. This reaction is commonly employed in the identification of aldehydes and ketones.

In summary, nucleophilic addition plays a crucial role in the chemistry of aldehydes and ketones. This reaction facilitates the formation of new carbon-nitrogen and carbon-oxygen bonds, enabling the synthesis of a diverse array of organic compounds.
