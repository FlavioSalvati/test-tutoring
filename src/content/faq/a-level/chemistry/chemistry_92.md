An example of an amide is acetamide, while ethylamine serves as an example of an amine.

Amides are organic compounds characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group ($\text{C}= \text{O}$) that is bonded to a nitrogen atom ($\text{N}$). These compounds are typically formed through the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an amine. For instance, acetamide is synthesized by reacting acetic acid with ammonia. Amides play a crucial role in biochemistry as they are integral components of proteins and nucleic acids.

On the other hand, amines are organic compounds that consist of a nitrogen atom ($\text{N}$) bonded to one or more alkyl or aryl groups. They can be classified into three categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, based on the number of alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. Ethylamine, for example, is classified as a primary amine because it contains an ethyl group ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$) bonded to the nitrogen atom. Amines are significant in biochemistry, as they are found in amino acids, neurotransmitters, and various other biomolecules.

In summary, acetamide exemplifies an amide, while ethylamine represents an amine. Both classes of compounds are vital in biochemistry and have a wide array of applications in industry and medicine.
