The nucleophilic substitution of amides is influenced by both the type of amide and the specific reaction conditions employed.

Primary amides, characterized by an $NH_2$ group attached to the carbonyl carbon, exhibit a higher reactivity in nucleophilic substitution reactions compared to secondary and tertiary amides. This increased reactivity is primarily due to the availability of the nitrogen lone pair in primary amides, which is more accessible for attack by a nucleophile.

In contrast, secondary and tertiary amides—where the nitrogen is bonded to one or two alkyl or aryl groups—show reduced reactivity in nucleophilic substitution. The presence of these bulky substituents introduces steric hindrance, making it more challenging for a nucleophile to approach and interact with the carbonyl carbon.

Reaction conditions also significantly impact the nucleophilic substitution of amides. For instance, employing a strong nucleophile in combination with a polar aprotic solvent can enhance the rate of substitution for all types of amides. Moreover, the application of acidic conditions can facilitate the hydrolysis of the amide bond, resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid and an amine.

In conclusion, the reactivity of amides towards nucleophilic substitution is contingent upon both the type of amide and the reaction conditions. Primary amides demonstrate greater reactivity than secondary and tertiary amides. Furthermore, the use of strong nucleophiles and polar aprotic solvents can accelerate the substitution process, while acidic conditions can lead to hydrolysis of the amide bond.
