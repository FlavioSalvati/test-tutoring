An illustrative example of the kinetic stability of metal complexes with varying types of ligands is the reaction between iron (III) ions ($\text{Fe}^{3+}$) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

Iron (III) ions can form complexes with a range of ligands, including EDTA, which is a hexadentate ligand. This means that EDTA can establish six coordination bonds with the iron ion. The process of forming this complex occurs in several steps, with the initial step involving the binding of EDTA to the iron ion. This initial binding is relatively rapid and reversible, with the formation of the complex being influenced by the concentrations of the reactants.

After the complex is formed, the subsequent step involves the dissociation of the ligand from the metal ion. This dissociation step is slower and less reversible than the initial binding, which contributes to the kinetic stability of the complex. The enhanced stability arises from the chelating effect of the EDTA ligand, which creates multiple coordination bonds with the iron ion, thereby making it more challenging for the ligand to dissociate.

In contrast, complexes formed with monodentate ligands, such as water or ammonia, exhibit lower kinetic stability. This is due to the fact that these ligands can only form a single coordination bond with the metal ion, which facilitates their dissociation from the complex.

In summary, the kinetic stability of metal complexes with different types of ligands is influenced by the number and strength of the coordination bonds formed between the ligand and the metal ion.
