Specific heat refers to the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one unit of mass by one degree Celsius. 

Molar heat capacity, on the other hand, is defined as the amount of heat energy required to increase the temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree Celsius. This value is obtained by dividing the total heat energy absorbed by the substance by the number of moles present.

For instance, the specific heat of water is $4.18 \, \text{J/g°C}$. This indicates that it takes $4.18$ joules of energy to increase the temperature of $1$ gram of water by $1$ degree Celsius. Similarly, the molar heat capacity of water is $75.3 \, \text{J/mol°C}$, meaning that $75.3$ joules of energy are required to raise the temperature of $1$ mole of water by $1$ degree Celsius.

Understanding the specific heat and molar heat capacity of a substance is crucial for comprehending its thermal properties. Substances with high specific heat and molar heat capacity, such as water, can absorb and release significant amounts of heat energy with minimal temperature fluctuations. This characteristic makes water an excellent coolant, commonly utilized in industrial processes and in the human body for temperature regulation.

In summary, specific heat and molar heat capacity are essential measures of a substance's capacity to absorb and release heat energy. They play a vital role in understanding the thermal properties of various materials and their practical applications across different fields.
