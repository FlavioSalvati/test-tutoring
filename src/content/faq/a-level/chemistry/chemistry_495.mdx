### Example of a Carboxylic Acid and an Ester

A carboxylic acid is a type of organic compound that features a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to a carbon atom. One well-known example of a carboxylic acid is acetic acid, which is commonly found in vinegar and has the chemical formula $ \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} $.

On the other hand, an ester is formed through a chemical reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Esters are characterized by their pleasant, sweet, and fruity aromas, making them popular in perfumes and flavorings. A notable example of an ester is ethyl acetate, used as a solvent, which has the chemical formula $ \text{CH}_3\text{COOCH}_2\text{CH}_3 $.

Both carboxylic acids and esters play crucial roles in biological systems. Carboxylic acids are essential in the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates and are integral to the synthesis of proteins and other biomolecules. Meanwhile, esters are present in many natural products, including fats and oils, and are also involved in the synthesis of hormones and various signaling molecules.

In summary, acetic acid serves as a representative example of a carboxylic acid, while ethyl acetate exemplifies an ester. Both compounds are significant in biological processes and have diverse applications in industry and everyday life.
