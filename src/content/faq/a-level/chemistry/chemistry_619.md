The common ion effect refers to the phenomenon where the addition of a common ion to a solution decreases the solubility of a salt.

When a salt dissolves in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. For instance, when sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$) is dissolved in water, it breaks down into sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$). If the solution already contains one of these ions, the solubility of the salt is reduced. This reduction occurs because the equilibrium between the undissolved salt and its ions shifts toward the formation of more undissolved salt in order to maintain a constant concentration of ions in the solution.

For example, if a solution has a high concentration of $\text{Na}^+$ ions and $\text{NaCl}$ is subsequently added, the equilibrium between $\text{NaCl}$ and its dissociated ions will shift toward the undissolved $\text{NaCl}$. Consequently, less $\text{NaCl}$ will dissolve in the solution, as the excess $\text{Na}^+$ ions will combine with the $\text{Cl}^-$ ions from the dissolved $\text{NaCl}$ to form more undissolved $\text{NaCl}$.

The common ion effect also influences acid-base equilibria. For example, if a weak acid is dissolved in a solution that contains its conjugate base, the equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base will shift toward the formation of more undissociated acid. This shift results in a decrease in the acidity of the solution.

In summary, the common ion effect can significantly impact chemical equilibria. Thus, it is essential to consider this effect when predicting the behavior of solutions.
