An illustrative example of the coagulation of various types of colloids is the addition of salt to a mixture containing clay and protein colloids.

When salt is introduced into a mixture of clay and protein colloids, the salt ions effectively neutralize the charges present on the surfaces of the colloids. This neutralization diminishes the repulsive forces acting between the colloids, allowing them to come closer together. Consequently, the colloids begin to aggregate and form larger particles, which ultimately settle due to the influence of gravity. This process is referred to as coagulation.

The coagulation of clay and protein colloids represents a significant phenomenon in soil science. In natural soils, clay and protein colloids exist in considerable quantities, and their coagulation plays a crucial role in altering the physical and chemical properties of the soil. For instance, the coagulation of these colloids can lead to the formation of soil aggregates, which enhance soil structure and improve water retention. Conversely, excessive coagulation may result in soil compaction and diminished water infiltration.

In addition to salt, several other factors can influence the coagulation of colloids. These factors include pH, temperature, and the presence of various ions or molecules. Understanding the coagulation of colloids is essential across multiple disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and materials science.
