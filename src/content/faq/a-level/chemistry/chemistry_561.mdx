Metal crystals can be classified into three primary structures: body-centered cubic (BCC), face-centered cubic (FCC), and hexagonal close-packed (HCP). These structures significantly influence the properties of various alloys.

**Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)**: In BCC structures, atoms are positioned at each corner of the cube as well as at the center. Notable examples of BCC metals include iron, tungsten, and chromium. Generally, BCC metals exhibit increased hardness but lower ductility compared to their FCC counterparts.

**Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)**: In FCC structures, atoms occupy the corners of the cube and the centers of each face. Common examples of FCC metals are copper, aluminum, and gold. Metals with an FCC structure tend to be more ductile and possess higher melting points than BCC metals.

**Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP)**: HCP metals feature an arrangement where atoms are organized in a hexagonal pattern, with each layer being offset from the one beneath it. Examples of HCP metals include titanium, zinc, and magnesium. HCP metals typically exhibit lower ductility when compared to FCC metals.

The crystal structure of a metal profoundly impacts its mechanical and physical properties, allowing for the design of alloys that exploit these characteristics. For instance, when small quantities of carbon are added to iron, the resulting alloy, steel, adopts a BCC crystal structure and exhibits significantly greater strength than pure iron. Similarly, the addition of nickel to copper results in the formation of cupronickel, an FCC alloy renowned for its exceptional resistance to corrosion. By understanding the various crystal structures of metals, scientists and engineers can tailor alloys to achieve specific properties for a wide range of applications.
