### Example of a Carboxylic Acid and an Ester

A **carboxylic acid** is an organic compound characterized by the presence of a carboxyl group ($-COOH$) attached to a carbon atom. A well-known example of a carboxylic acid is **acetic acid**, which can be found in vinegar and has the chemical formula $CH_3COOH$.

An **ester** is a type of compound formed through the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Esters typically possess a sweet, fruity aroma and are widely utilized in perfumes and flavorings. A notable example of an ester is **ethyl acetate**, commonly used as a solvent, with the chemical formula $CH_3COOCH_2CH_3$.

Both carboxylic acids and esters play significant roles in biological systems. Carboxylic acids are crucial in the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates and are involved in the synthesis of proteins and other biomolecules. Esters, on the other hand, are present in many natural substances, such as fats and oils, and are also important in the synthesis of hormones and various signaling molecules.

In summary, **acetic acid** serves as an example of a carboxylic acid, while **ethyl acetate** exemplifies an ester. Both compounds are vital in biological processes and have numerous applications in industry and daily life.
