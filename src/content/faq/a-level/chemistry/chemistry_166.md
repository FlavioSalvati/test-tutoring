The alkaline earth metals are characterized by their high reactivity and basic nature.

Alkaline earth metals exhibit significant reactivity due to their low ionization energy, which allows them to easily lose two electrons and form stable $2^+$ cations. This property leads to vigorous reactions with substances such as water, oxygen, and halogens. For instance, when magnesium is introduced to water, it reacts vigorously to yield magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Similarly, when calcium is exposed to air, it reacts with oxygen to produce calcium oxide.

In addition to their reactivity, alkaline earth metals are also classified as basic. This basicity arises from their low electronegativity and large atomic radius, which facilitate the loss of electrons and the formation of cations. When these cations interact with water, they generate hydroxide ions, resulting in a basic solution. For example, when calcium oxide is mixed with water, it reacts to form calcium hydroxide, a strong base.

The basic properties of alkaline earth metals render them valuable in a range of applications. For example, calcium hydroxide is utilized in agriculture to neutralize acidic soils and in water treatment processes to eliminate impurities. Magnesium hydroxide serves as an antacid to neutralize stomach acid and is also employed as a flame retardant in plastics and textiles.

In summary, the alkaline earth metals are both highly reactive and basic, which contributes to their versatility in various applications. Their reactivity and basicity stem from their low ionization energy and their propensity to lose electrons and form cations.
