Crystal field splitting results in the division of d-orbitals into distinct energy levels, ultimately leading to the various colors observed in transition metal complexes.

When transition metal ions interact with ligands to form complexes, the d-orbitals undergo a splitting process, creating two energy levels. This phenomenon is known as crystal field splitting. The energy difference between these two levels is crucial, as it dictates the color of the complex.

For instance, consider a transition metal ion like $Fe^{2+}$, which possesses five d-electrons. When this ion forms a complex with six ligands, the d-orbitals split into two groups: three orbitals with lower energy, referred to as $t_{2g}$, and two orbitals with higher energy, known as $e_g$. The energy gap between these two sets of orbitals corresponds to the absorption of light in the visible spectrum. In this case, the complex appears green because it absorbs light in the red region.

Similarly, when a transition metal ion such as $Ni^{2+}$, which has four d-electrons, forms a complex with six ligands, the d-orbitals also split into two levels. However, in this scenario, there are two lower-energy orbitals ($e_g$) and three higher-energy orbitals ($t_{2g}$). The energy difference between these levels corresponds to the absorption of light in the blue region of the spectrum. Consequently, the complex appears yellow, as it absorbs blue light.

In summary, crystal field splitting causes the d-orbitals of transition metal complexes to separate into different energy levels, which results in distinct colors. The specific energy difference between these levels determines the color of the complex, a phenomenon that can be observed through absorption spectroscopy.
