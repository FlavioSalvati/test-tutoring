An acyl chloride is a specific type of organic compound created by substituting a hydroxyl group with a chlorine atom.

Acyl chlorides, commonly referred to as acid chlorides, are characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group ($\text{C=O}$) and a chlorine atom attached to the same carbon atom. These compounds are known for their high reactivity and play a significant role in various chemical reactions, including the synthesis of esters, amides, and anhydrides.

The formation of acyl chlorides occurs through the reaction of a carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride ($\text{SOCl}_2$) or phosphorus pentachloride ($\text{PCl}_5$). In this process, the hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom ($-\text{Cl}$), resulting in the formation of an acyl chloride. This reaction is exothermic and generates hydrogen chloride gas ($\text{HCl}$) as a by-product.

For instance, the reaction between ethanoic acid and thionyl chloride can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{SOCl}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COCl} + \text{HCl} + \text{SO}_2
$$

Acyl chlorides are vital in the synthesis of numerous organic compounds and serve as intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and polymers. However, due to their high reactivity, they must be handled with caution, as they can cause severe burns and respiratory issues.
