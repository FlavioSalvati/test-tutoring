The boiling and melting points of various aromatic compounds differ significantly due to their unique molecular structures.

Aromatic compounds are a category of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a benzene ring or other similar cyclic structures. The boiling and melting points of these compounds are influenced by their molecular configurations, which can vary widely.

The boiling point of an aromatic compound is primarily determined by the strength of the intermolecular forces acting between its molecules. These forces are affected by factors such as the size and shape of the molecule, as well as the presence of functional groups. Generally, compounds with larger molecular sizes and multiple functional groups exhibit higher boiling points due to the stronger intermolecular interactions.

Conversely, the melting point of an aromatic compound is influenced by the strength of the intramolecular forces that exist within the molecule itself. These forces are determined by the arrangement of atoms and the presence of functional groups. Compounds with more complex structures and additional functional groups typically have higher melting points because they possess stronger intramolecular forces.

For instance, benzene has a boiling point of $80.1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and a melting point of $5.5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. In comparison, toluene has a boiling point of $110.6\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and a melting point of $-93\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The higher boiling point of toluene can be attributed to its larger molecular size and the presence of more functional groups, which result in stronger intermolecular forces. Similarly, naphthalene exhibits a boiling point of $218\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and a melting point of $80\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, reflecting its greater size and more complex structure compared to benzene.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of aromatic compounds vary based on their molecular structures, which are influenced by factors such as size, shape, and functional groups.
