Concentration and temperature have distinct effects on chemical equilibrium.

Concentration refers to the amount of a substance present in a specific volume. When the concentration of a reactant is increased, the equilibrium shifts to the right, favoring the formation of products to consume the excess reactant. Conversely, if the concentration of a product is increased, the equilibrium shifts to the left, promoting the formation of more reactants. This behavior is described by Le Chatelier's principle.

Temperature, on the other hand, is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. When the temperature is raised, the equilibrium shifts in the direction of the endothermic reaction to absorb the additional heat. In contrast, when the temperature is lowered, the equilibrium shifts in the direction of the exothermic reaction to generate more heat. This phenomenon is also governed by Le Chatelier's principle.

The influence of concentration on equilibrium depends on the stoichiometry of the reaction. If a reactant is present in excess, increasing its concentration may not significantly impact the equilibrium position. However, if a reactant is limiting, increasing its concentration will enhance the rate of the reaction and drive the equilibrium to the right.

Similarly, the impact of temperature on equilibrium is contingent upon the enthalpy change of the reaction. In an exothermic reaction, raising the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the left, as the system will absorb the extra heat. Conversely, in an endothermic reaction, increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium to the right, since the reaction requires more heat to proceed.

In summary, concentration and temperature exert different influences on equilibrium. Concentration affects the reaction's stoichiometry, while temperature influences the enthalpy change of the reaction.
