A chiral center is defined as a carbon atom that is bonded to four distinct groups, which gives rise to the phenomenon of optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism is a specific type of stereoisomerism wherein two molecules share the same chemical formula and connectivity, yet differ in their ability to rotate plane-polarized light. This occurs when a molecule possesses a chiral center, specifically a carbon atom connected to four different substituents. The arrangement of these four groups can lead to two distinct configurations, resulting in two molecules that are mirror images of one another, known as enantiomers.

Enantiomers exhibit identical physical and chemical properties, with the notable exception of their interaction with plane-polarized light. One enantiomer will rotate the plane of polarized light in a clockwise direction, while the other will rotate it counterclockwise. This characteristic is referred to as optical activity, and both enantiomers are described as being optically active.

Chiral centers are prevalent in numerous biological molecules, including amino acids and sugars, and their optical isomerism can have profound biological implications. For instance, one enantiomer of a pharmaceutical compound may be effective in treating a specific condition, whereas its counterpart may be ineffective or even detrimental. Consequently, it is crucial to separate and accurately identify the enantiomers of drugs to ensure their safety and therapeutic efficacy.
