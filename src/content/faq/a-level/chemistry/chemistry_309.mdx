The collision theory provides a framework for understanding how chemical reactions take place and is closely related to the study of reaction kinetics.

Chemical reactions occur when particles collide with sufficient energy and in the correct orientation to break existing bonds and form new ones. According to the collision theory, for a reaction to happen, the reacting particles must collide with the proper orientation and at least a minimum amount of energy, referred to as the activation energy, denoted as $E_a$. The rate of a chemical reaction is influenced by both the frequency of these collisions and the proportion of collisions that possess enough energy to surpass the activation energy.

Reaction kinetics, on the other hand, is the field that investigates the rates of chemical reactions and the various factors that influence these rates. The collision theory plays a crucial role in reaction kinetics, as it elucidates how different parameters—such as temperature, concentration, and surface area—affect reaction rates. For instance, increasing the temperature raises the kinetic energy of the particles, which in turn increases both the frequency of collisions and the fraction of those collisions that have enough energy to exceed the activation energy, leading to a quicker reaction rate.

In summary, the collision theory is a fundamental concept for understanding the mechanisms behind chemical reactions and how various factors influence these processes. It is a critical aspect of reaction kinetics that A-Level Biology students must grasp to fully comprehend the dynamics of chemical reactions.
