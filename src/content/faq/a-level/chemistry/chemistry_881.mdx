The anode and cathode reactions in a voltaic cell are distinct in terms of electron transfer and electrode polarity.

In a voltaic cell, the anode serves as the electrode where oxidation takes place, while the cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs. At the anode, a metal or ion loses electrons and is oxidized. Conversely, at the cathode, a metal or ion gains electrons and undergoes reduction. This transfer of electrons generates a flow from the anode to the cathode, producing an electric current.

The reaction at the anode is characterized by the loss of electrons and the generation of cations, which migrate towards the cathode through the electrolyte. For instance, in a zinc-copper cell, the anode reaction can be represented as:

$$
\text{Zn(s)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-
$$

In this reaction, zinc metal loses two electrons and forms zinc ions, which then travel towards the cathode.

On the other hand, the reaction at the cathode involves the gain of electrons and the formation of anions, which move towards the anode through the electrolyte. In the case of a zinc-copper cell, the cathode reaction is represented as:

$$
\text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu(s)}
$$

Here, copper ions acquire two electrons and are converted into solid copper metal, which deposits onto the cathode.

In summary, the anode and cathode reactions in a voltaic cell are complementary processes essential for generating electrical energy. The anode supplies electrons, while the cathode receives them. The resulting flow of electrons creates a potential difference that can be utilized for practical applications.
