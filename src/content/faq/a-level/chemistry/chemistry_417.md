A covalent bond is established when two atoms share electrons, whereas an ionic bond occurs when one atom transfers an electron to another atom.

For example, consider the covalent bond formed between two hydrogen atoms in a hydrogen molecule, denoted as $H_2$. Each hydrogen atom possesses one electron in its outermost shell, and they share these electrons to create a stable molecule. This mutual sharing of electrons results in a strong bond between the two hydrogen atoms.

In contrast, an example of an ionic bond can be seen in the relationship between sodium ($Na$) and chlorine ($Cl$) in sodium chloride ($NaCl$). Sodium has one electron in its outermost shell, while chlorine has seven. In this case, sodium donates its electron to chlorine, resulting in the formation of a positively charged sodium ion ($Na^+$) and a negatively charged chloride ion ($Cl^-$). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions creates a robust bond.

In summary, covalent bonds arise from the sharing of electrons, while ionic bonds are formed through the transfer of electrons. Both types of bonds are vital in biological systems, as they significantly influence the structure and function of essential molecules such as DNA, proteins, and enzymes.
