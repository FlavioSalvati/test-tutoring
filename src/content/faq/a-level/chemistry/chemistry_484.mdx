Structural isomers and stereoisomers differ fundamentally in their atomic arrangements. Structural isomers, also referred to as constitutional isomers, share the same chemical formula yet vary in the connectivity of their atoms. This means that the atoms are bonded together in different ways. For instance, the coordination compound $[Co(NH_3)_5Cl]Cl$ can exist as two structural isomers: $\text{cis-}[Co(NH_3)_4Cl_2]^+$ and $\text{trans-}[Co(NH_3)_4Cl_2]^+$. In the cis-isomer, two chloride ions are positioned next to each other, while in the trans-isomer, they are located opposite each other.

In contrast, stereoisomers maintain the same atomic connectivity but differ in their spatial arrangement. These compounds have identical chemical formulas and bonding patterns, yet their three-dimensional structures vary. Stereoisomers can be categorized into two main types: geometric isomers and optical isomers. Geometric isomers arise from different arrangements of ligands around a metal ion due to restricted rotation, whereas optical isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. For example, the coordination compound $[Co(en)_2Cl_2]^+$ exhibits two geometric isomers: $\text{cis-}[Co(en)_2Cl_2]^+$ and $\text{trans-}[Co(en)_2Cl_2]^+$, along with two optical isomers: $[Co(R,R-en)_2Cl_2]^+$ and $[Co(S,S-en)_2Cl_2]^+$.

In summary, the primary distinction between structural isomers and stereoisomers in coordination compounds lies in their connectivity and spatial arrangement of atoms, respectively. Grasping these differences is essential for the study of coordination chemistry and its various applications.
