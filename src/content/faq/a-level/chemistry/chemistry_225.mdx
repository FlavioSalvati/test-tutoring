The pH of acid-base equilibria is influenced by the strength and concentration of the acids or bases involved.

The pH of an acid-base equilibrium is primarily determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H$^+$) present in the solution. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), fully dissociate in water, leading to a high concentration of H$^+$ ions and consequently a low pH value. In contrast, weak acids, like acetic acid (CH$_3$COOH), only partially dissociate, resulting in a lower concentration of H$^+$ ions and a relatively higher pH.

Similarly, strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), completely dissociate in water, producing a high concentration of hydroxide ions (OH$^-$) and a correspondingly high pH. On the other hand, weak bases, such as ammonia (NH$_3$), only partially dissociate, yielding a lower concentration of OH$^-$ ions and a lower pH value.

Buffer solutions, which consist of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid, exhibit a relatively stable pH. They resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are introduced. This stability is due to the ability of the weak acid or base to neutralize added H$^+$ or OH$^-$ ions, respectively, without causing significant alterations to the pH.

In summary, the pH of acid-base equilibria varies according to the strength and concentration of the acids and bases involved. Strong acids and bases result in low and high pH values, respectively, while weak acids and bases lead to higher and lower pH values, respectively. Buffer solutions maintain a stable pH due to the presence of a weak acid or base along with its conjugate counterpart.
