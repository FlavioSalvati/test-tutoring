The thermodynamic stability of complexes refers to the energy changes that occur during the formation of these complexes, specifically whether energy is released or absorbed.

When a metal ion interacts with a ligand, a complex is formed. The stability of this complex is primarily determined by the strength of the interaction between the metal ion and the ligand. The thermodynamic stability can be quantified by the change in Gibbs free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$, during the formation of the complex. If $\Delta G$ is negative, the complex is considered thermodynamically stable; conversely, if $\Delta G$ is positive, the complex is deemed unstable.

Several factors influence the stability of a complex, including the charge of the metal ion, as well as the size and shape of the ligand. Additionally, the nature of the coordinating atoms plays a crucial role. Ligands that form strong bonds with metal ions—such as those containing nitrogen or oxygen—tend to create more stable complexes compared to ligands that form weaker bonds, like halides.

The thermodynamic stability of complexes is significant in various biological processes, including enzyme catalysis, the transport of metal ions across cell membranes, and DNA binding. Gaining insight into the factors that affect complex stability can aid in the design of new drugs and catalysts.

In summary, the thermodynamic stability of complexes provides a measure of the energy changes associated with complex formation. This stability is influenced by the strength of interactions between the metal ion and the ligand, along with several factors, such as the metal ion's charge and the characteristics of the ligand.
