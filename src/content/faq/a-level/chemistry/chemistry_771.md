The structure of DNA is a double helix formed from nucleotides, the fundamental building blocks of nucleic acids.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a long, double-stranded molecule that encodes the genetic information of an organism. It is composed of four distinct types of nucleotides: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Each nucleotide consists of three components: a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous bases pair in a specific manner: adenine pairs with thymine (A with T), and guanine pairs with cytosine (G with C). This pairing is stabilized by hydrogen bonds.

The double helix structure of DNA arises from the two strands of nucleotides winding around one another. The sugar and phosphate groups form the backbone of the molecule, while the nitrogenous bases extend inward, resembling the rungs of a ladder. The specific sequence of these nitrogenous bases along the DNA strand encodes the genetic information.

Nucleic acids are a category of biomolecules that includes both DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid). Like DNA, RNA is also made up of nucleotides, which are composed of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The arrangement of nucleotides in both DNA and RNA determines the genetic code and is essential for cellular function. DNA primarily serves the purpose of storing and transmitting genetic information, whereas RNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. Overall, the structure of DNA is intricately linked to the properties and functions of nucleic acids, highlighting its fundamental role in biological systems.
