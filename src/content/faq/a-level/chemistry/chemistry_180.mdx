A telluride is a compound that consists of tellurium combined with one or more other elements.

Tellurides are formed through various geological processes, including hydrothermal activity, magmatic activity, and sedimentary processes. Hydrothermal activity involves the circulation of hot fluids through rocks, which can lead to the deposition of tellurides. Magmatic activity occurs when magma cools and solidifies, also resulting in the formation of tellurides. Additionally, sedimentary processes refer to the gradual accumulation of tellurides in sedimentary rocks over extended periods.

Tellurides play a significant role in the mining industry because they can contain valuable metals such as gold, silver, and copper. Moreover, these compounds are of great interest to researchers investigating material properties, as they display a variety of intriguing electronic and magnetic characteristics.

Despite their significance, tellurides are relatively rare in the Earth's crust, often found in small, isolated deposits. This rarity can make their extraction challenging and costly. Nevertheless, advancements in mining technology and exploration techniques are improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of extracting tellurides.
