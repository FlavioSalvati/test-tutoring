The pH of an aqueous solution serves as an indicator of its acidity or alkalinity, reflecting the concentration of hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) present in the solution.

Acid-base equilibria describe the balance between the concentrations of hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) and hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) in a solution. A solution characterized by a high concentration of $\text{H}^+$ ions is considered acidic, whereas one with a high concentration of $\text{OH}^-$ ions is deemed alkaline. The pH scale spans from $0$ to $14$, with $7$ representing a neutral state. A pH value below $7$ signifies acidity, while a pH value above $7$ indicates alkalinity.

To determine the pH of an aqueous solution, one can utilize either a pH meter or indicator paper. A pH meter functions by measuring the voltage difference between a reference electrode and a glass electrode, which is sensitive to variations in $\text{H}^+$ ion concentration. In contrast, indicator paper changes color based on the pH of the solution it contacts.

Acid-base equilibria are crucial in biological systems, as many biochemical reactions are pH-dependent. For instance, enzymes operate optimally within specific pH ranges. Deviations in pH can denature enzymes, rendering them inactive. Consequently, the pH of bodily fluids, such as blood and urine, is tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis.

In summary, the pH of an aqueous solution is a critical measure of its acidity or alkalinity and is intrinsically linked to acid-base equilibria. This parameter plays a vital role in biological systems and is carefully controlled to ensure optimal conditions for biochemical reactions.
