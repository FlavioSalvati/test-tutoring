An illustrative example of the enthalpy and entropy changes in a chemical reaction is the combustion of methane.

The combustion of methane is classified as an exothermic reaction, which means it releases heat energy into the surroundings. The change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) for this reaction is negative, signifying that energy is being released. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:

$$
\text{CH}_4 + 2 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

Specifically, the enthalpy change for this reaction is $-890 \, \text{kJ/mol}$, indicating that $890 \, \text{kJ}$ of energy is released for every mole of methane that undergoes combustion.

In addition to enthalpy, the entropy change ($\Delta S$) for this reaction is positive, which implies an increase in the disorder or randomness of the system. This increase in entropy occurs because there are more molecules present on the product side of the equation compared to the reactant side. The rise in entropy is primarily attributed to the generation of additional gas molecules, which possess greater freedom of movement than the solid or liquid molecules present in the reactants.

The entropy change for the combustion of methane is $186 \, \text{J/K/mol}$, indicating that the disorder of the system increases by $186 \, \text{J/K}$ for each mole of methane burned.

In summary, the combustion of methane is an exothermic process that not only releases heat energy but also leads to an increase in the disorder of the system.
