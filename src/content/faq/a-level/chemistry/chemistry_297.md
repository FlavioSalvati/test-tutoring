An acyl chloride is an organic compound that is formed when a hydroxyl group is replaced by a chlorine atom.

Acyl chlorides, also referred to as acid chlorides, are characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group ($\text{C}= \text{O}$) and a chlorine atom attached to the same carbon atom. Due to their highly reactive nature, acyl chlorides play a crucial role in various chemical reactions, including the formation of esters, amides, and anhydrides.

The synthesis of acyl chlorides typically involves the reaction of a carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride ($\text{SOCl}_2$) or phosphorus pentachloride ($\text{PCl}_5$). In this reaction, the hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$) of the carboxylic acid is substituted with a chlorine atom ($-\text{Cl}$), resulting in the formation of an acyl chloride. This reaction is exothermic and produces hydrogen chloride gas ($\text{HCl}$) as a by-product.

For instance, when ethanoic acid reacts with thionyl chloride, the products are ethanoyl chloride and hydrogen chloride gas:

$$
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{SOCl}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COCl} + \text{HCl} + \text{SO}_2
$$

Acyl chlorides are valuable in the synthesis of a wide range of organic compounds and serve as intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and polymers. However, due to their high reactivity, acyl chlorides must be handled with caution, as they can cause severe burns and respiratory issues.
