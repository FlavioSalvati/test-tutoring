Group 2 hydroxides exhibit varying degrees of solubility and basicity.

These compounds are formed when Group 2 metals react with water, resulting in alkaline substances that can neutralize acids. Notably, the solubility of Group 2 hydroxides increases as one moves down the group. For instance, beryllium hydroxide is insoluble in water, while the hydroxides of magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium are soluble. This trend can be attributed to the increasing atomic radius of the metal ions. As the size of the metal ion increases, its polarizability also increases, facilitating the attraction of water molecules to form hydrated ions.

In addition to solubility, the basicity of Group 2 hydroxides also rises down the group. This phenomenon occurs because the strength of the metal-oxygen bond diminishes as the atomic radius of the metal increases. Consequently, the hydroxides of larger Group 2 metals exhibit greater basicity compared to those of smaller metals. For example, barium hydroxide is a stronger base than calcium hydroxide. The basicity of these hydroxides can be quantified by their capacity to neutralize acids; the more basic a hydroxide is, the greater the amount of acid it can neutralize.

In summary, both the solubility and basicity of Group 2 hydroxides increase as one progresses down the group. This trend is primarily due to the increasing size of the metal ions, which enhances their polarizability and weakens their bond with oxygen.
