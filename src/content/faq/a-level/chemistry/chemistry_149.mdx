### Example of an Animal and an Enamine

An example of an animal is the lion, while an example of an enamine is pyrrolidine.

Lions are large, carnivorous mammals that belong to the family Felidae. They are renowned for their distinctive manes and powerful roars. As apex predators, lions inhabit sub-Saharan Africa and have a small population in India. These social animals live in groups known as prides, which typically consist of several females, their cubs, and a few males.

In contrast, pyrrolidine is an organic compound classified as a cyclic secondary amine. It features a five-membered ring structure. Pyrrolidine is widely utilized as a building block in organic synthesis and is also present in certain natural products. It can be synthesized by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with ammonia or an amine, using an acid catalyst to facilitate the reaction.

Enamines are a class of compounds characterized by the presence of both a double bond and an amine functional group. They are formed through the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with an amine in the presence of an acid catalyst. Enamines serve as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis and are employed in the preparation of a broad array of compounds. Additionally, they can act as ligands in coordination chemistry and as chiral auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis.
