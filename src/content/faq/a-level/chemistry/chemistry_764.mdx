The alkaline earth metals exhibit varying levels of reactivity and basicity.

Alkaline earth metals comprise a group of elements in the periodic table, specifically beryllium ($\text{Be}$), magnesium ($\text{Mg}$), calcium ($\text{Ca}$), strontium ($\text{Sr}$), barium ($\text{Ba}$), and radium ($\text{Ra}$). These elements are characterized by their significant reactivity and basicity, although each element possesses distinct properties.

Reactivity is defined as the propensity of an element to engage in chemical reactions with other substances. Within the alkaline earth metals, reactivity increases as you progress down the group. Beryllium ($\text{Be}$) is the least reactive element, whereas radium ($\text{Ra}$) is the most reactive. This trend can be attributed to the increasing atomic size and the decreasing ionization energy, which makes it easier to remove the outermost electrons as one moves down the group.

Basicity, on the other hand, refers to the capacity of an element to generate a basic solution upon reacting with water. While alkaline earth metals are generally recognized for their basic characteristics, their basicity also rises as you descend the group. Notably, beryllium oxide ($\text{BeO}$) is amphoteric, meaning it can function as both an acid and a base, while radium hydroxide ($\text{Ra(OH)}_2$) is highly basic.

In conclusion, both the reactivity and basicity of alkaline earth metals increase down the group, with beryllium being the least reactive and least basic, and radium being the most reactive and most basic.
