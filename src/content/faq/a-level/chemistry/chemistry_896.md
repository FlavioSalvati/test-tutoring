Substitution and electrophilic substitution reactions are distinguished by the types of reactants involved and the mechanisms through which these reactions occur.

**Substitution Reactions**
Substitution reactions entail the replacement of an atom or a group of atoms within a molecule by another atom or group. This process occurs when a nucleophile, which is a species possessing a lone pair of electrons—such as a halide ion ($\text{X}^-$) or an alcohol—attacks the molecule. During this interaction, the nucleophile displaces a leaving group. The leaving group is an atom or group capable of departing with a pair of electrons, examples of which include halogens or protons.

Substitution reactions can be classified into two main types based on their mechanisms: unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2). In SN1 reactions, the rate-determining step involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, while in SN2 reactions, the nucleophile directly displaces the leaving group in a single concerted step.

**Electrophilic Substitution Reactions**
In contrast, electrophilic substitution reactions involve the addition of an electrophile to a molecule, which subsequently undergoes rearrangement to yield a new molecular structure. This process begins when an electrophile—an electron-deficient species such as a proton ($\text{H}^+$) or a halogen—attacks the molecule, resulting in the formation of a positively charged carbocation intermediate. This carbocation can then rearrange to generate a substituted product.

Electrophilic substitution reactions are particularly prevalent in aromatic compounds, where the electrophile interacts with the aromatic ring, leading to the formation of a new substituted aromatic compound.

**Summary**
In summary, substitution reactions focus on the replacement of an atom or group of atoms in a molecule, while electrophilic substitution reactions involve the addition of an electrophile to a molecule, followed by a rearrangement that results in the formation of a new molecular structure.
