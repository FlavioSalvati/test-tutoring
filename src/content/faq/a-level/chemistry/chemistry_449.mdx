Group 2 elements exhibit distinct differences in their reactivity and solubility, primarily due to variations in their atomic structure.

**Reactivity:**

The reactivity of Group 2 elements tends to increase as you move down the group. This trend is attributed to the outermost electrons occupying higher energy levels that are farther from the nucleus. As these electrons are increasingly distant from the positive charge of the nucleus, they are more easily lost. Consequently, the elements become more reactive with both water and oxygen as you proceed downward in the group. For instance, magnesium reacts slowly with cold water, whereas barium reacts vigorously. This increasing reactivity is clearly demonstrated in the reactivity series.

**Solubility:**

The solubility of Group 2 compounds also varies as you descend the group. Specifically, the solubility of hydroxides and sulfates decreases down the group. This trend occurs because the ionic radius of the cation increases, making it more challenging for water molecules to effectively surround and dissolve the ions. For example, calcium hydroxide is more soluble than strontium hydroxide, which in turn is more soluble than barium hydroxide. Conversely, the solubility of carbonates and nitrates of Group 2 elements increases as you move down the group. This increase in solubility can be explained by the fact that carbonates and nitrates decompose upon heating to yield the corresponding oxides, which are more soluble than their original compounds.

In conclusion, the reactivity and solubility of Group 2 elements are influenced by differences in their atomic structure, particularly the number of outermost electrons and the ionic radius of the cation.
