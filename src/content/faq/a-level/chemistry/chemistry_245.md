Group 3 elements exhibit similar reactivity but possess varying oxidation states.

Group 3 elements, often referred to as rare earth metals, include scandium ($\text{Sc}$), yttrium ($\text{Y}$), and the lanthanides. The reactivity of these elements is largely attributed to their valence electron configuration, which features two electrons in the outermost shell. This configuration renders them highly electropositive and reactive, particularly with non-metals such as oxygen and halogens.

Despite their similar reactivity, the oxidation states of group 3 elements can differ significantly. Scandium typically has an oxidation state of $+3$, while yttrium can exhibit oxidation states of $+2$ and $+3$. The lanthanides are known for their diverse range of oxidation states, predominantly $+3$, but they can also display oxidation states of $+2$, $+4$, and even $+5$. The variation in oxidation states arises from the differences in the sizes and energies of the atomic orbitals within each element, influencing their capacity to lose or gain electrons.

These differences in oxidation states have significant implications for the properties and applications of group 3 elements. For instance, scandium is utilized in aluminum alloys to enhance strength and corrosion resistance, whereas yttrium is employed in superconductors and lasers. The lanthanides find a broad spectrum of applications, including their use in magnets, catalysts, and lighting technologies.

In conclusion, while the elements of group 3 share similar reactivity, their distinct oxidation states confer unique properties and uses. A thorough understanding of these differences is crucial for leveraging their applications across various industries.
