Le Chatelier's principle asserts that a system at equilibrium will adjust its equilibrium position in response to any applied stress. 

Chemical equilibrium is defined as a state in which the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, leading to no net change in the concentrations of the reactants and products. Le Chatelier's principle provides insight into how alterations in conditions such as temperature, pressure, and concentration impact the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction.

For instance, if the concentration of one of the reactants is increased, the equilibrium will shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas in order to alleviate the stress. Similarly, if the pressure is increased, the equilibrium will again shift towards the side with fewer moles of gas, which helps to reduce the pressure. In the case of an increase in temperature, the equilibrium will shift in the direction of the endothermic reaction to absorb the excess heat.

Le Chatelier's principle is a valuable tool for predicting how changes in conditions will influence the equilibrium position of a reaction. It enables us to adjust conditions to favor the formation of a desired product or to enhance the yield of a reaction. However, it is crucial to understand that Le Chatelier's principle applies solely to reversible reactions and does not provide insight into the rate of the reaction.
