Chelation refers to the process in which a ligand forms a complex with a metal ion through coordination.

In more detail, chelation is a chemical interaction where a ligand—a molecule or ion that possesses one or more lone pairs of electrons—attaches to a metal ion, facilitating the formation of a coordination compound. This compound consists of the metal ion coordinated with one or more ligands. The term "chelate" is derived from the Greek word "chele," meaning "claw," which aptly describes how the ligand encircles the metal ion akin to a claw gripping its prey.

Chelation has numerous applications across various fields, including biology, medicine, and industry. In biological systems, chelation plays a critical role in transporting metal ions across cell membranes and regulating enzyme activity, particularly for enzymes that require metal ions as cofactors. In the medical field, chelation therapy is employed to treat metal poisoning. This involves administering chelating agents that bind to toxic metal ions, promoting their elimination from the body. In industrial settings, chelation is utilized for metal purification, to inhibit scale formation in boilers and pipes, and to improve the stability and solubility of metal-containing compounds.

In summary, chelation is a vital process in coordination chemistry characterized by the formation of complexes between metal ions and ligands. This process is crucial for various biological functions, therapeutic interventions in medicine, and diverse industrial applications.
