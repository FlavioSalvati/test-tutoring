An illustrative example of the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic products can be observed in the reaction between 1-butene and hydrogen.

This reaction can yield two distinct products: 1-butene-1-hydrogen and 1-butene-2-hydrogen. The kinetic product, 1-butene-1-hydrogen, is generated more rapidly and at lower temperatures. In contrast, the thermodynamic product, 1-butene-2-hydrogen, forms more slowly and at elevated temperatures.

The formation of the kinetic product is favored due to its lower activation energy. This product arises from a reaction pathway that involves a lower-energy intermediate, enabling a faster reaction rate. Conversely, the thermodynamic product is produced through a pathway that entails a higher-energy intermediate, requiring additional energy for its formation, which leads to a slower reaction rate.

The thermodynamic product is more stable than the kinetic product, as it possesses lower free energy and is favored at equilibrium. Consequently, at higher temperatures, the reaction shifts towards the more stable thermodynamic product, making it the predominant product formed.

In summary, the reaction between 1-butene and hydrogen exemplifies the concepts of kinetic and thermodynamic products. The kinetic product is formed more quickly and at lower temperatures, while the thermodynamic product is produced more slowly and at higher temperatures, demonstrating greater stability at equilibrium.
