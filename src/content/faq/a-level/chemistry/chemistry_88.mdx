Paramagnetic transition metal complexes contain unpaired electrons, whereas diamagnetic complexes have all their electrons paired.

Paramagnetic transition metal complexes exhibit unpaired electrons, which results in their attraction to magnetic fields and their ability to become magnetized. This phenomenon arises from the presence of one or more unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. Moreover, these complexes frequently display color, as the unpaired electrons can absorb light and transition to higher energy levels. Notable examples of paramagnetic complexes include the ions $Fe^{2+}$ and $Cu^{2+}$.

Conversely, diamagnetic transition metal complexes possess all paired electrons, rendering them non-attractive to magnetic fields and incapable of being magnetized. The pairing of electrons in their d-orbitals leads to a net magnetic moment of zero. Typically, these complexes are colorless, as they do not absorb light within the visible spectrum. Examples of diamagnetic complexes include the ions $Zn^{2+}$ and $Ni^{2+}$.

In summary, the primary distinction between paramagnetic and diamagnetic transition metal complexes lies in the presence or absence of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. This difference significantly influences their magnetic properties and coloration: paramagnetic complexes are attracted to magnetic fields and often exhibit vibrant colors, while diamagnetic complexes lack attraction to magnetic fields and are usually colorless.
