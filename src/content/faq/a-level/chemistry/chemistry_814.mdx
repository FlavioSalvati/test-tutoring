The rates of reaction for zero, first, and second order reactions vary in relation to the concentration of reactants. 

**Zero Order Reactions**  
In zero order reactions, the rate of reaction remains constant and is independent of the concentration of the reactants. This implies that even if the concentration of reactants changes, the rate of reaction does not fluctuate. Notable examples of zero order reactions include the metabolism of alcohol in the liver and the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the enzyme catalase.

**First Order Reactions**  
First order reactions exhibit a rate of reaction that is directly proportional to the concentration of a single reactant. In this case, as the concentration of the reactant increases, the rate of reaction correspondingly increases. Examples of first order reactions include radioactive decay and the hydrolysis of esters.

**Second Order Reactions**  
Second order reactions feature a rate of reaction that is directly proportional either to the concentration of two different reactants or to the square of the concentration of a single reactant. Thus, the rate increases either with a rise in the concentrations of both reactants or with the square increase in the concentration of one reactant. Common examples of second order reactions include the neutralization reaction between hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions to produce water, as well as the reaction between iodine and propanone.

Understanding the order of a reaction is crucial for determining its rate and the concentrations of reactants required to achieve a specific reaction rate. Additionally, it aids in predicting how variations in reactant concentrations will influence the overall rate of the reaction.
