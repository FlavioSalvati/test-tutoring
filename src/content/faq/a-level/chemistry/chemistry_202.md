### Examples of a Carboxylic Acid and an Ester

A **carboxylic acid** is a type of compound that contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to a carbon atom. A well-known example of a carboxylic acid is **acetic acid**, which is commonly found in vinegar and has the chemical formula $CH_3COOH$.

An **ester**, on the other hand, is a compound formed through the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Esters are characterized by their sweet, fruity aromas, making them popular in perfumes and flavorings. A notable example of an ester is **ethyl acetate**, which serves as a solvent and has the chemical formula $CH_3COOCH_2CH_3$.

Both carboxylic acids and esters play significant roles in biological systems. Carboxylic acids are crucial in the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates, and they are also involved in the synthesis of proteins and various other biomolecules. Esters are prevalent in many natural products, such as fats and oils, and they are also important in the synthesis of hormones and other signaling molecules.

In summary, **acetic acid** exemplifies a carboxylic acid, while **ethyl acetate** is an example of an ester. Both compounds are not only essential in biological systems but also have a wide range of applications in industry and daily life.
