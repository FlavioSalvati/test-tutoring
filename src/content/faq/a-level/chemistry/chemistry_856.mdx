An illustrative example of oxidation numbers in redox reactions can be seen in the reaction between magnesium and oxygen.

When magnesium reacts with oxygen, it undergoes oxidation, while oxygen experiences reduction. Specifically, magnesium loses two electrons, resulting in the formation of $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ions, which possess an oxidation number of $+2$. Conversely, oxygen gains two electrons to form $\text{O}^{2-}$ ions, which have an oxidation number of $-2$.

The oxidation number of an element indicates the number of electrons it has either gained or lost during a chemical reaction. In a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction, one element is oxidized (loses electrons) while another is reduced (gains electrons).

In the reaction between magnesium and oxygen, magnesium is oxidized as it loses electrons, leading to an increase in its oxidation number from $0$ to $+2$. Simultaneously, oxygen is reduced by gaining electrons, which causes its oxidation number to decrease from $0$ to $-2$.

The overall reaction between magnesium and oxygen can be summarized as follows:

$$
2\text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{MgO}
$$

In this equation, magnesium is oxidized, and oxygen is reduced, with the corresponding changes in oxidation numbers clearly illustrated.
