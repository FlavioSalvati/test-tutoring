Interhalogen compounds exhibit varying degrees of reactivity and stability based on the properties of the halogens involved.

Interhalogen compounds are formed by the combination of two distinct halogens. Their high reactivity stems from the significant difference in electronegativity between the two halogens. The reactivity of these compounds is influenced by both the size and electronegativity of the halogens. For instance, interhalogen compounds that include fluorine tend to be more reactive than those that feature iodine. This enhanced reactivity is attributed to fluorine being the most electronegative element, coupled with its small atomic size, which facilitates bond formation.

The stability of interhalogen compounds is primarily determined by the strength of the bonds between the two halogens. This bond strength is influenced by the size and electronegativity of the halogens involved: as the size of the halogens increases, the bond strength generally decreases, leading to reduced stability of the compound. For example, compounds containing iodine are typically less stable than those containing fluorine. This difference in stability arises because the bond between two larger iodine atoms is weaker than the bond between two smaller fluorine atoms.

In summary, interhalogen compounds are characterized by their high reactivity, which is a result of the differences in electronegativity between the halogens involved. The reactivity is further influenced by the size of these halogens. Additionally, the stability of interhalogen compounds is governed by the strength of the bonds formed between the halogens, which is again determined by their size and electronegativity.
