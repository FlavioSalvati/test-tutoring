Strong field ligands induce significant splitting of the $d$-orbitals in transition metals, which leads to a lower energy state and a reduction in the number of unpaired electrons in their electron configuration. Conversely, weak field ligands result in minimal splitting of the $d$-orbitals, yielding higher energy states and an increased number of unpaired electrons.

For instance, the strong field ligand $\text{CN}^-$ induces a substantial splitting of the $d$-orbitals, resulting in a low-spin complex characterized by a smaller number of unpaired electrons. This occurs because the $\text{CN}^-$ ligand donates electrons to the metal ion, thereby lowering the energy levels of the $d$-orbitals. Consequently, electrons tend to pair up in the lower energy orbitals, producing a low-spin complex.

In contrast, the weak field ligand $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ leads to a minor splitting of the $d$-orbitals, which results in a high-spin complex with a greater number of unpaired electrons. This is attributed to the fact that the $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ ligand does not significantly donate electrons to the metal ion, causing the energy levels of the $d$-orbitals to remain elevated. As a result, electrons occupy the higher energy orbitals, culminating in a high-spin complex.

Grasping the influence of strong and weak field ligands on the electron configurations of transition metals is crucial for predicting the properties and reactivity of coordination compounds.
