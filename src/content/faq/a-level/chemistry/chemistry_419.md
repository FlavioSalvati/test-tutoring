Hückel's rule provides a criterion for determining whether a compound is aromatic, stating that a compound is considered aromatic if it contains $4n + 2$ pi electrons, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.

Aromatic compounds are a distinctive class of organic molecules characterized by exceptional stability and unique reactivity, which arise from their delocalized pi-electron systems. Hückel's rule serves as a straightforward mathematical guideline to predict the aromatic nature of a compound. For a compound to be classified as aromatic, it must meet the following criteria: it should have a planar ring structure, all atoms in the ring must be $\text{sp}^{2}$ hybridized, and it must possess $4n + 2$ pi electrons. Conversely, if a compound contains $4n$ pi electrons, it is classified as antiaromatic.

The delocalization of pi electrons in aromatic compounds means that these electrons are not confined to individual bonds; instead, they are distributed across the entire ring structure. This delocalization leads to a lower energy state, thereby enhancing the stability of the compound. Additionally, due to their stability, aromatic compounds typically undergo substitution reactions rather than addition reactions, which is a hallmark of their unique reactivity.

Hückel's rule is an indispensable tool for predicting the aromaticity of compounds, providing insights into their stability and reactivity. It finds applications across a range of disciplines, including organic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science.
