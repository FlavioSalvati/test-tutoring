The E1 and E2 elimination reactions exhibit distinct mechanisms for proton loss and have different substrate requirements.

### E1 Elimination

E1 elimination follows a two-step mechanism. In the first step, the leaving group departs, resulting in the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Subsequently, a proton is lost from an adjacent carbon, leading to the creation of a double bond. E1 reactions typically require a tertiary or secondary substrate, a strong acid catalyst, and heat to facilitate the process. The rate of the reaction is influenced by the concentrations of both the substrate and the catalyst.

### E2 Elimination

In contrast, E2 elimination is characterized by a one-step mechanism. During this process, the leaving group and a proton are eliminated simultaneously. The reaction proceeds through a single transition state, and the stereochemistry of the substrate remains intact. E2 reactions require a primary or secondary substrate, a strong base catalyst, and heat. Similar to E1, the rate of E2 reactions is also dependent on the concentrations of the substrate and the catalyst.

### Key Differences

The primary distinction between E1 and E2 reactions lies in their mechanisms of proton loss. E1 reactions involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate, whereas E2 reactions occur in a single transition state. Furthermore, E1 reactions necessitate a tertiary or secondary substrate, while E2 reactions can proceed with a primary or secondary substrate. The choice of catalyst is another area of difference; E1 reactions require a strong acid, while E2 reactions call for a strong base.
