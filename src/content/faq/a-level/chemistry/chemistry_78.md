Condensation and addition polymerization are two distinct processes by which monomers combine to form polymers, each characterized by its unique mechanism.

**Condensation Polymerization**  
This type of polymerization occurs through the elimination of a small molecule, typically water. In condensation polymerization, monomers possessing two functional groups—such as carboxylic acids and alcohols—react to form ester bonds while simultaneously releasing a water molecule. Notable examples of condensation polymers include nylon and polyester.

**Addition Polymerization**  
In contrast, addition polymerization involves the formation of a polymer by adding monomers that contain unsaturated bonds, like ethene. During this process, the double bond in the monomer is broken, allowing the monomers to link together and create a long-chain polymer. Common examples of addition polymers are polyethylene and polypropylene.

**Molecular Weight Considerations**  
In condensation polymerization, the molecular weight of the resulting polymer is less than the total molecular weights of the individual monomers used, due to the loss of the small molecule during the reaction. Conversely, in addition polymerization, the molecular weight of the polymer is equal to the sum of the molecular weights of the monomers utilized.

In summary, condensation and addition polymerization operate through different mechanisms and yield distinct types of polymers. Understanding these differences is crucial for the synthesis and application of polymers across various industries.
