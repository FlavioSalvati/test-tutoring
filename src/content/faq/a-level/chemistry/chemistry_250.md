Hybridization refers to the process of combining atomic orbitals to create new hybrid orbitals that possess distinct shapes and energy levels.

In transition metals, hybridization is essential in determining the nature of chemical bonding. These metals have partially filled $d$-orbitals, which can hybridize with $s$ and $p$ orbitals to generate hybrid orbitals. These newly formed hybrid orbitals are capable of overlapping with other orbitals, resulting in the formation of covalent bonds.

The specific type of hybridization that occurs in transition metals is influenced by the number of $d$-electrons present. For instance, if there are four $d$-electrons, the $d$-orbitals can hybridize with one $s$ and three $p$ orbitals to create four $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals. These hybrid orbitals can subsequently overlap with other orbitals to establish four covalent bonds.

In addition to hybridization, transition metals can also engage in the formation of complex ions through coordination bonding. In this bonding mode, the transition metal ion accepts electron pairs from ligands, which are typically molecules or ions that possess lone pairs of electrons. The resulting complex ion is characterized by a coordination number, which indicates the number of ligands attached to the metal ion.

In summary, hybridization is a crucial concept for understanding the bonding behavior of transition metals. By mixing atomic orbitals, these metals can form hybrid orbitals that are involved in both covalent and coordination bonding, leading to a diverse array of chemical properties and applications.
