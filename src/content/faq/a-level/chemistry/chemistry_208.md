Hydrolysis and complexation are two distinct chemical reactions that take place in aqueous solutions.

**Hydrolysis** refers to a reaction in which a molecule is cleaved into two components through the addition of water. This process is frequently observed in the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, where larger biomolecules are broken down into their subunits. In aqueous environments, hydrolysis can also occur when a salt dissolves in water. For instance, when sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$) dissolves, it dissociates into sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$). Subsequently, water molecules can interact with these ions, producing hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) and hydronium ions ($\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$), which leads to a slightly basic solution.

**Complexation**, in contrast, involves the interaction of two or more molecules to form a complex. This reaction is particularly evident in the formation of metal complexes, where a metal ion coordinates with a ligand to create a coordination complex. In aqueous solutions, complexation can occur between organic molecules and metal ions as well. For example, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) serves as a widely used chelating agent that forms stable complexes with metal ions. This property is especially useful for removing heavy metals from wastewater.

In conclusion, hydrolysis and complexation are two fundamental chemical reactions occurring in aqueous solutions. Hydrolysis involves the breakdown of a molecule through the addition of water, while complexation entails the formation of a complex from multiple interacting molecules. A comprehensive understanding of these reactions is crucial across various fields, including biology, chemistry, and environmental science.
