The Malonic ester synthesis is a valuable method for producing carboxylic acids, primarily utilizing diethyl malonate as the ester and a strong base for the reaction.

In this synthesis, diethyl malonate reacts with a strong base, such as sodium ethoxide or sodium hydride. The base serves to deprotonate diethyl malonate, generating a negatively charged intermediate. This intermediate is capable of undergoing nucleophilic substitution with an alkyl halide or other electrophiles, leading to the addition of an alkyl group to the malonic ester.

Following the alkyl group addition, the reaction proceeds to hydrolysis. During this stage, the ester groups are removed and replaced with carboxylic acid groups. The end product of this process is a substituted carboxylic acid. The Malonic ester synthesis is particularly adept at synthesizing dicarboxylic acids, as the intermediate can participate in a second nucleophilic substitution to introduce an additional alkyl group.

In summary, the ester involved in the Malonic ester synthesis is diethyl malonate, while the resulting product is a carboxylic acid formed after hydrolysis. This reaction is typically facilitated by a strong base, which deprotonates diethyl malonate and enables nucleophilic substitution with electrophiles. Overall, the Malonic ester synthesis is a versatile and effective method for synthesizing carboxylic acids, especially dicarboxylic acids.
