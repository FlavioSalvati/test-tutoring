Crystal field splitting leads to the division of d-orbitals into distinct energy levels, which in turn results in the diverse colors observed in transition metal complexes.

When transition metal ions interact with ligands to form complexes, the d-orbitals experience a splitting into two energy levels. This phenomenon is referred to as crystal field splitting. The energy difference between these two levels is crucial as it dictates the color of the complex.

For instance, consider a transition metal ion with five d-electrons, such as $Fe^{2+}$. When it forms a complex with six ligands, the d-orbitals split into two groups: three orbitals at a lower energy level, denoted as $t_{2g}$, and two orbitals at a higher energy level, labeled $e_g$. The energy gap between these two levels corresponds to the absorption of light within the visible spectrum. In this case, the complex appears green because it absorbs red light.

Similarly, for a transition metal ion with four d-electrons, such as $Ni^{2+}$, the formation of a complex with six ligands results in a different arrangement: two orbitals at a lower energy level ($e_g$) and three orbitals at a higher energy level ($t_{2g}$). The energy difference in this scenario aligns with the absorption of light in the blue region of the spectrum. Consequently, this complex appears yellow, as it absorbs blue light.

In summary, crystal field splitting causes the d-orbitals to segregate into varying energy levels, which results in the different colors exhibited by transition metal complexes. The energy difference between these levels is what determines the color of the complex, a phenomenon that can be observed through absorption spectroscopy.
