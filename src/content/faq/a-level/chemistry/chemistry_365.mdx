The Hoffmann and Saytzeff rules are essential guidelines for predicting the major products in elimination reactions.

The Hoffmann rule states that when a hydrogen atom is removed from a quaternary ammonium salt, the product formed is the least substituted alkene. This phenomenon occurs because the bulky groups attached to the quaternary ammonium salt create steric hindrance, which impedes the formation of the more substituted alkene.

In contrast, the Saytzeff rule asserts that when a hydrogen atom is removed from a tertiary amine, the more substituted alkene is produced. The rationale behind this is that the more substituted alkene is generally more stable, owing to the increased number of alkyl groups that stabilize the double bond.

Together, the Hoffmann and Saytzeff rules provide valuable insights into the major products of elimination reactions. Hoffmann's rule indicates that in the case of quaternary ammonium salts, steric hindrance favors the formation of the least substituted alkene. Conversely, Saytzeff's rule highlights that in reactions involving tertiary amines, the formation of the more substituted alkene is preferred due to its enhanced stability. These rules illustrate how molecular structure influences the outcomes of organic reactions.
