The ion product and the solubility product are both indicators of a substance's solubility; however, they have distinct calculations and applications.

The ion product, often referred to as the reaction quotient, quantifies the concentration of ions in a solution at a specific moment. It is determined by multiplying the concentrations of the individual ions, each raised to the power of its respective stoichiometric coefficient. The ion product is useful for assessing whether a solution is at equilibrium. By comparing the ion product to the solubility product, one can predict whether a precipitate will form.

Conversely, the solubility product represents the maximum concentration of solute that can dissolve in a solvent under specified temperature and pressure conditions. It is calculated by multiplying the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution, with each concentration raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient. The solubility product is a constant value for a particular substance at a given temperature, making it a valuable tool for predicting the solubility of that substance in a specific solvent.

In summary, while both the ion product and solubility product pertain to a substance's solubility, they serve different purposes: the ion product reflects ion concentrations at any moment, indicating whether a solution is in equilibrium, while the solubility product denotes the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve, remaining constant under specified conditions. Understanding these concepts is essential for predicting whether a solution will remain clear or if a precipitate will form.
