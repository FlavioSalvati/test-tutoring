Nucleophilic substitution is a chemical reaction in which a nucleophile replaces a leaving group in a molecule. 

Esters are particularly susceptible to nucleophilic substitution reactions, where the ester group can be replaced by a nucleophile. For instance, when an ester is treated with a strong nucleophile such as the hydroxide ion, denoted as $\text{OH}^-$, the ester undergoes hydrolysis. This process results in the formation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. This specific reaction is termed saponification and is a key step in soap production.

Another notable example of nucleophilic substitution involving esters is the reaction with ammonia or primary amines, which leads to the formation of amides. This reaction is known as amidation and plays a critical role in the synthesis of peptides and proteins.

Additionally, esters can undergo nucleophilic substitution with alcohols, resulting in the formation of different esters. This process is referred to as transesterification and is widely utilized in the production of biodiesel.

In summary, esters can participate in nucleophilic substitution reactions with various nucleophiles, leading to the formation of different compounds. These reactions are significant in various applications, including the production of soap, peptides, proteins, and biodiesel.
