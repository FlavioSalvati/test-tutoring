Boranes and alkanes are two distinct classes of compounds that differ significantly in their chemical composition and properties.

**Boranes** are chemical compounds composed of boron and hydrogen atoms. In contrast, **alkanes** are hydrocarbons made exclusively of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Due to the presence of the highly electronegative boron atom, boranes exhibit lower boiling points and are generally more reactive than alkanes. Additionally, boranes are known to be highly flammable and toxic.

On the other hand, alkanes possess higher boiling points and are less reactive when compared to boranes. This lower reactivity can be attributed to their sole composition of carbon and hydrogen atoms. As a result, alkanes are commonly utilized as fuels and solvents, prized for their stability and low reactivity. Furthermore, alkanes are generally less toxic than boranes.

In terms of their chemical behavior, boranes serve as strong reducing agents and can react with various compounds, including alkenes and alkynes, to form boron-containing derivatives. Conversely, alkanes are relatively inert and typically require elevated temperatures and pressures to initiate chemical reactions.

In summary, while both boranes and alkanes are important classes of compounds, they exhibit markedly different chemical properties and applications. Boranes are characterized by their high reactivity and toxicity, whereas alkanes are stable compounds that are widely used as fuels and solvents.
