A carbene is a reactive molecule consisting of a neutral carbon atom that possesses two unshared valence electrons.

Carbenes are known for their high reactivity and can engage in a wide range of chemical reactions, including the insertion into C-H bonds, cyclopropanation, and olefin metathesis. A notable example of a carbene is methylene, represented as $\text{CH}_2$, which is produced through the thermal decomposition of diazomethane. Methylene is an extremely reactive species and has the ability to insert into C-H bonds, thereby forming new carbon-carbon bonds.

In contrast, a carbanion is a species that contains a carbon atom carrying a negative charge. Like carbenes, carbanions are also highly reactive and can participate in various reactions, including nucleophilic substitution and addition reactions. A prominent example of a carbanion is the enolate anion, which is generated by the deprotonation of a carbonyl compound using a strong base. Enolates play a crucial role as intermediates in organic synthesis and are valuable for forming new carbon-carbon bonds.

In summary, the study of carbene and carbanion chemistry is a vital aspect of organic chemistry, with numerous applications in the field of organic synthesis.
