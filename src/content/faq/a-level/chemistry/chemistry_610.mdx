Oxidation and reduction are two contrasting chemical processes that occur concurrently in what is known as a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction.

**Oxidation** refers to the process by which a substance loses electrons, leading to an increase in its oxidation state. This process often entails the addition of oxygen or the removal of hydrogen from a molecule. For instance, when iron undergoes oxidation, it reacts with oxygen to form rust, resulting from the loss of electrons by iron.

In contrast, **reduction** is the process through which a substance gains electrons, causing a decrease in its oxidation state. This process typically involves the addition of hydrogen or the removal of oxygen from a molecule. A common example of reduction is the conversion of copper ions into copper metal, where the copper ions gain electrons.

In a redox reaction, oxidation and reduction happen simultaneously; while one substance is oxidized, another is reduced. The substance that undergoes oxidation is referred to as the **reducing agent** because it facilitates the reduction of another substance by donating electrons. Conversely, the substance that is reduced is called the **oxidizing agent** since it promotes the oxidation of another substance by accepting electrons.

In summary, oxidation and reduction are two opposing reactions that occur together in a redox process, where one substance loses electrons while another gains them. These reactions are vital for numerous biological processes, including cellular respiration and photosynthesis.
