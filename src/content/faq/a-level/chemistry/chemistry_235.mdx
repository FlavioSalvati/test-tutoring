Ligand field theory provides a comprehensive explanation of the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.

Transition metal complexes are coordination compounds featuring a central metal ion surrounded by ligands. This theory elucidates the electronic structure of these complexes by examining the interactions between the metal ion and the surrounding ligands. The ligands generate a field of electron density around the metal ion, which in turn influences the energy levels of the metal's $d$ orbitals.

Within ligand field theory, the $d$ orbitals are categorized into two distinct sets: the $e_g$ set and the $t_{2g}$ set. The $e_g$ set comprises the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, which are oriented directly towards the ligands. Conversely, the $t_{2g}$ set consists of the $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, which are oriented between the ligands. This ligand field interaction causes a splitting of the energy levels of the $d$ orbitals, with the $e_g$ set positioned at a higher energy level than the $t_{2g}$ set.

Furthermore, ligand field theory explains the coloration observed in transition metal complexes. When light is absorbed by a complex, electrons can be excited from the $t_{2g}$ set to the $e_g$ set. The energy of the absorbed light corresponds to the energy difference between these two sets of orbitals. Consequently, the color of the complex is determined by the wavelength of light that is absorbed.

In summary, ligand field theory elucidates both the electronic structure and the coloration of transition metal complexes by analyzing the interactions between the central metal ion and its ligands.
