Group 2 hydroxides, also referred to as alkaline earth metal hydroxides, are characterized by their limited solubility and basic nature. These compounds are formed through the reaction of Group 2 metals with water and possess the general formula $ \text{MOH} $, where $ \text{M} $ denotes the metal ion.

The solubility of Group 2 hydroxides exhibits a trend that decreases as one moves down the group. Specifically, beryllium hydroxide is the least soluble, while barium hydroxide is the most soluble. This trend can be attributed to the increasing ionic radius and lattice energy as one progresses down the group.

In addition to solubility, the basicity of Group 2 hydroxides also increases down the group. This is primarily due to the increasing electropositivity of the metal ion, which enhances the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide ion. Consequently, this results in a stronger attraction between the metal ion and the hydroxide ion, leading to a more potent basic character. The basicity of these hydroxides can be quantitatively assessed through their $ \text{pK}_a $ values, which decrease as one moves down the group.

In summary, Group 2 hydroxides are sparingly soluble and exhibit increasing basicity down the group. This behavior results from variations in ionic radius, lattice energy, and the electropositivity of the metal ions, as well as the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide ions.
