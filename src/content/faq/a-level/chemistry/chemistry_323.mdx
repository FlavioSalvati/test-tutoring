Titration is a laboratory technique employed to ascertain the concentration of a solution. This method is closely associated with acid-base equilibria, as it is frequently utilized to measure the concentration of either an acid or a base within a solution.

In a titration, a solution of known concentration, referred to as the titrant, is gradually added to a solution of unknown concentration, known as the analyte. The titrant is carefully introduced to the analyte until the reaction between the two reaches completion. This completion is typically signaled by a noticeable change in the color of an indicator or by a shift in pH. The specific point at which the reaction is complete is termed the equivalence point.

In the context of acid-base titrations, the equivalence point is defined as the moment when the number of moles of acid is equal to the number of moles of base present in the solution. This phenomenon is recognized as neutralization. The concentration of the analyte can be determined using the volume and concentration of the titrant utilized, along with the stoichiometry of the reaction involved.

Titration curves can be constructed to illustrate the variation in pH of the solution as the titrant is added. These curves are valuable tools for identifying the equivalence point and for calculating the pKa of the acid or base being titrated.

Titration is a vital technique in analytical chemistry and is employed to determine the concentration of a diverse array of substances, including acids, bases, and salts. Furthermore, it finds applications in the pharmaceutical industry for assessing the purity of drugs and in environmental monitoring for evaluating the concentration of pollutants in water samples.
