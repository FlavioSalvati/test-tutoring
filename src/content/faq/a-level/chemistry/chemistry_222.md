Metals possess a variety of properties that set them apart from non-metals. Notably, metals are excellent conductors of heat and electricity, and they exhibit characteristics such as malleability, ductility, and a distinctive metallic luster.

One of the most prominent features of metals is their ability to conduct heat and electricity. This capability arises from the presence of free electrons within the metal lattice, which can move freely and transport electrical charge. Additionally, metals are malleable, meaning they can be easily shaped without breaking. This property is attributed to the relatively weak metallic bonds between atoms, which allow the atoms to slide past one another when subjected to external force.

Another significant characteristic of metals is their ductility, the ability to be drawn into thin wires. This is also a result of the same weak metallic bonds that facilitate malleability. Furthermore, metals are known for their metallic luster, which is produced by the reflection of light off the free electrons in the metal lattice.

Beyond these attributes, metals are typically dense, possess high melting and boiling points, and are adept at forming alloys with other metals. These properties render metals invaluable in a wide array of applications, spanning construction, manufacturing, electronics, and transportation.
