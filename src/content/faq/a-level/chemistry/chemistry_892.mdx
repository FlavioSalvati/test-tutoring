Strong field ligands lead to larger energy separations between the $ d $ orbitals, whereas weak field ligands result in smaller separations.

In ligand field theory, the strength of a ligand's interaction with a metal ion is assessed by its ability to split the $ d $ orbitals of that metal ion. Strong field ligands, such as $ \text{CN}^- $, $ \text{CO} $, and $ \text{NH}_3 $, induce a significant energy gap between the $ d $ orbitals, which typically results in the formation of low-spin complexes. In these low-spin complexes, electrons preferentially occupy the lower energy $ d $ orbitals before filling the higher energy ones, leading to a reduced magnetic moment.

Conversely, weak field ligands, such as $ \text{H}_2\text{O} $ and $ \text{F}^- $, create a smaller energy separation between the $ d $ orbitals, resulting in high-spin complexes. In high-spin complexes, electrons fill the higher energy $ d $ orbitals before the lower energy ones, which results in a larger magnetic moment.

The strength of the ligand also plays a critical role in determining the color of the complex. Typically, complexes formed with strong field ligands are either colorless or exhibit a faint color intensity, while those with weak field ligands tend to display more vibrant colors.

In summary, the strength of the ligand influences the energy separation between the $ d $ orbitals, which subsequently affects the spin state, magnetic moment, and color of the complex.
