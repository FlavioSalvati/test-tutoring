Amino acids possess distinct physical properties that set them apart from other organic compounds.

Amino acids are organic molecules characterized by the presence of both an amino group ($-NH_2$) and a carboxyl group ($-COOH$) attached to a central carbon atom. They serve as the fundamental building blocks of proteins and play a vital role in numerous biological processes. Due to their polar nature and the presence of hydrogen bonding, amino acids are soluble in water and exhibit high melting and boiling points. Additionally, they are optically active, which means they can rotate plane-polarized light.

One of the key physical properties of amino acids is their capacity to form peptide bonds. Peptide bonds are covalent linkages that connect amino acids, facilitating the formation of proteins. This bonding process occurs through the elimination of a water molecule, a reaction known as dehydration synthesis. Moreover, amino acids can engage in hydrogen bonding with one another, further enhancing the stability of protein structures.

Amino acids can exist in various forms depending on the pH of their environment. When the pH is below their isoelectric point ($pI$), amino acids carry a positive charge and are referred to as cations. Conversely, when the pH exceeds their $pI$, amino acids carry a negative charge and are termed anions. At their $pI$, amino acids possess no net charge and exist in a zwitterionic form.

In summary, the physical properties of amino acids are unique and crucial for their biological roles. Their water solubility, high melting and boiling points, ability to form peptide bonds, and pH-dependent charge distinguish them from other organic compounds.
