Hereâ€™s a revised version of your content, with enhanced clarity and readability, along with proper formatting for mathematical expressions:

An example of addition polymerization is the formation of polyethylene, while condensation polymerization can be exemplified by the creation of nylon.

**Addition Polymerization** is a chemical process in which monomers containing unsaturated double bonds react with each other to create a polymer. A notable example of this is polyethylene, commonly used in the production of plastic bags and bottles. In this process, ethylene gas is polymerized using a catalyst, resulting in a long chain of repeating units. This method is specifically known as free radical polymerization, as it involves the formation of free radicals that initiate the reaction.

**Condensation Polymerization** differs in that it involves the reaction of monomers with two distinct functional groups. In this process, the reaction not only forms a polymer but also produces a small molecule as a byproduct, such as water or alcohol. A prominent example is the synthesis of nylon, a material frequently used in clothing and carpets. Nylon is created through the reaction between a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid, leading to a long chain of repeating units linked by amide bonds. During this reaction, water is released as a byproduct.

Both addition and condensation polymerization play crucial roles in the production of polymers for a wide range of applications. A comprehensive understanding of these processes is essential for the development of new materials and for enhancing the properties of existing ones.
