The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides increases as the pH of the solution decreases.

Alkaline earth metal hydroxides are compounds formed by the reaction of alkaline earth metals with water. These compounds exhibit basic properties and typically have a high pH. The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides is influenced by the pH of the solution; specifically, as the pH decreases, their solubility increases.

This phenomenon can be explained by the common ion effect. When an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, such as calcium hydroxide, is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. For instance, calcium hydroxide can be represented as:

$$
\text{Ca(OH)}_2 \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + 2\text{OH}^-
$$

The solubility of the hydroxide is constrained by the concentration of hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) present in the solution. When an acid is introduced, it reacts with the hydroxide ions to form water, thereby decreasing their concentration. This reduction in hydroxide ion concentration leads to a decrease in the solubility of the hydroxide, often resulting in the precipitation of the compound from the solution.

The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides is significant in various biological processes. For example, calcium hydroxide is utilized in dentistry as a base for dental cements and as a disinfectant. Similarly, magnesium hydroxide serves as an antacid to neutralize stomach acid. The effectiveness of these compounds in their respective applications is directly related to their solubility, which is influenced by the pH of the solution.
