Crystal field splitting leads to the division of d-orbitals into distinct energy levels, which results in the varied colors observed in transition metal complexes.

When transition metal ions interact with ligands to form complexes, the d-orbitals undergo splitting into two energy levels. This phenomenon is referred to as crystal field splitting. The energy difference between these two levels is critical, as it determines the color of the complex.

For instance, consider a transition metal ion such as $Fe^{2+}$, which has five d-electrons. When $Fe^{2+}$ forms a complex with six ligands, the d-orbitals split into two groups: three orbitals with lower energy, known as $t_{2g}$, and two orbitals with higher energy, referred to as $e_g$. The energy gap between these two sets of orbitals corresponds to the absorption of light in the visible spectrum. In this specific case, the complex appears green because it absorbs red light.

Similarly, when a transition metal ion like $Ni^{2+}$, which has four d-electrons, forms a complex with six ligands, the d-orbitals also split into two groups. Here, two orbitals have lower energy ($e_g$) and three orbitals have higher energy ($t_{2g}$). The energy difference between these levels relates to the absorption of light in the blue region of the spectrum, causing the complex to appear yellow as it absorbs blue light.

In conclusion, crystal field splitting results in the separation of d-orbitals into different energy levels, which in turn leads to the diverse colors of transition metal complexes. The energy difference between these levels is crucial in determining the observed color, which can be effectively analyzed using absorption spectroscopy.
