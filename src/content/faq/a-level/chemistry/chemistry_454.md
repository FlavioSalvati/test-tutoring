Chelation is the process through which a ligand forms a complex with a metal ion by coordinating to it.

In chemical terms, chelation occurs when a ligand—a molecule or ion possessing one or more lone pairs of electrons—donates these electrons to a metal ion. This interaction leads to the formation of a coordination compound, which consists of a metal ion bonded to one or more ligands. The term "chelate" is derived from the Greek word "chele," meaning "claw," which aptly describes how the ligand encircles the metal ion in a claw-like fashion.

Chelation has a wide range of applications across various fields, including biology, medicine, and industry. 

In biological systems, chelation plays a crucial role in transporting metal ions across cell membranes and regulating the activity of enzymes that require metal ions as cofactors. 

In the medical field, chelation therapy is employed to treat metal poisoning. This is achieved by administering chelating agents that bind to toxic metal ions, facilitating their excretion from the body. 

In industrial applications, chelation is utilized for several purposes: purifying metals, preventing scale formation in boilers and pipes, and enhancing the stability and solubility of metal-containing compounds.

In summary, chelation is a fundamental process within coordination chemistry, involving the formation of a complex between a metal ion and a ligand. This process is critical for numerous applications in biology, medicine, and industry, and it plays an essential role in the functioning of many biological systems.
