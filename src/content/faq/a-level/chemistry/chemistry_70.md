Enantiomers and diastereomers are two distinct types of stereoisomers, which are molecules that share the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space.

**Enantiomers** are characterized as mirror images of one another. Importantly, they are non-superimposable, meaning that one cannot be placed over the other in a way that all parts align perfectly. Enantiomers possess identical physical and chemical properties, with one notable exception: their interaction with plane-polarized light. They rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, which is why they are often referred to as optical isomers. Enantiomers typically contain one or more chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.

In contrast, **diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They exhibit different physical and chemical properties, such as melting points, boiling points, and solubility. Diastereomers have two or more chiral centers, but they differ in the configuration of only some of these centers. As a result, diastereomers exhibit distinct chemical reactivities and biological activities. They can be separated using techniques such as chromatography.

To summarize, enantiomers are mirror images of each other, while diastereomers are neither identical nor mirror images. Enantiomers share the same physical and chemical properties, except for their behavior with plane-polarized light, whereas diastereomers display different physical and chemical characteristics. Recognizing the differences between enantiomers and diastereomers is crucial in various fields, including drug design, where the biological activity of a molecule can be significantly influenced by its stereochemistry.
