Aldehydes and ketones are both classes of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group, but they exhibit distinct structural differences and properties.

Aldehydes contain a carbonyl group ($-C=O$) located at the terminal position of a carbon chain, whereas ketones possess a carbonyl group situated between two carbon atoms. This key structural distinction influences their physical and chemical properties. Specifically, aldehydes generally have lower boiling points compared to ketones. This is primarily due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, facilitated by the presence of a terminal hydroxyl group ($-OH$). In contrast, ketones, which lack this terminal -OH group, are unable to form such hydrogen bonds, resulting in higher boiling points.

In terms of reactivity, aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones. This increased reactivity can be attributed to the greater polarity of the carbonyl group in aldehydes, coupled with the presence of a hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon. As a result, aldehydes are more susceptible to nucleophilic attacks and oxidation processes. They can be easily oxidized to form carboxylic acids, while ketones are notably resistant to oxidation.

The chemical behavior of aldehydes and ketones also differs in their reactions. Aldehydes readily undergo nucleophilic addition reactions with various reagents, such as hydrogen cyanide and sodium bisulfite. In contrast, ketones do not participate in these specific reactions. However, ketones can engage in nucleophilic addition reactions with reagents like Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds, which are typically unreactive with aldehydes.

In summary, while both aldehydes and ketones contain a carbonyl group, they differ significantly in their structural configurations, physical properties, chemical reactivity, and interactions with various compounds.
