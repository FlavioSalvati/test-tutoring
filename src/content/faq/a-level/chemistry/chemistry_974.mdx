Group 7 elements, commonly referred to as halogens, exhibit high reactivity and strong oxidizing power.

The reactivity of halogens is primarily attributed to their electronegativity. Each halogen possesses seven valence electrons and requires only one additional electron to achieve a complete outer shell. This characteristic makes them highly reactive. However, reactivity tends to decrease as one moves down the group. This decline is due to the increasing atomic radius and the shielding effect, which diminishes the effective nuclear charge experienced by the outermost electrons.

In addition to their reactivity, the oxidizing power of Group 7 elements also varies within the group. As the atomic radius increases, the attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electrons weakens. Consequently, this makes it easier for halogens to gain an electron and form negative ions. This capacity to accept electrons underlines their role as potent oxidizing agents.

A notable example of the oxidizing power of halogens is their reaction with metals. Halogens can react with metals to produce metal halides, during which the halogen gains an electron while the metal relinquishes electrons. For instance, chlorine can react with sodium to yield sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$), commonly known as table salt. This reaction is highly exothermic, releasing a significant amount of energy.

In summary, the high reactivity and oxidizing power of Group 7 elements stem from their electronegativity and their propensity to gain electrons. These properties render them crucial in numerous chemical reactions, including the formation of salts and various other compounds.
