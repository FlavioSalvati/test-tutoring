The physical properties of alcohols change as their molecular size increases.

Alcohols are a class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a carbon atom. The physical properties of these compounds are influenced by their molecular size, shape, and polarity. As the molecular size of alcohols increases, their boiling points, melting points, and viscosity tend to rise. This increase can be attributed to the greater intermolecular forces of attraction present in larger molecules, which necessitate more energy to overcome.

The boiling point of alcohols rises with increasing molecular size, owing to the enhancement of intermolecular forces. Specifically, as the size of the molecule grows, more energy is required to break the bonds between the molecules and transition the substance from a liquid to a gas. Likewise, the melting point of alcohols also increases with molecular size for the same reason; larger molecules have more contact points with one another, resulting in stronger intermolecular interactions.

Viscosity, which measures a liquid's resistance to flow, also increases as molecular size increases. Larger alcohol molecules exhibit more complex shapes and have more points of contact with adjacent molecules, leading to enhanced intermolecular forces and, consequently, higher viscosity.

In summary, the physical properties of alcohols vary with increasing molecular size. Larger alcohol molecules exhibit higher boiling points, melting points, and viscosity, which can be attributed to the increase in intermolecular forces of attraction.
