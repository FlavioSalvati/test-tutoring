Group 2 carbonates are known for their thermal stability, yet they exhibit reactivity towards acids.

Examples of Group 2 carbonates include calcium carbonate ($\text{CaCO}_3$) and magnesium carbonate ($\text{MgCO}_3$). These compounds are thermally stable, meaning they do not readily decompose at elevated temperatures. This stability arises from the strong ionic bonds formed between the metal cation and the carbonate anion, which require a considerable amount of energy to break. Consequently, Group 2 carbonates are widely utilized as building materials, manifesting in forms such as limestone and marble.

On the other hand, Group 2 carbonates are reactive with acids. When an acid, like hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$), is introduced to a Group 2 carbonate, a chemical reaction takes place, yielding carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and a salt. For instance, the reaction of calcium carbonate with hydrochloric acid can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{CaCO}_3 + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CaCl}_2
$$

This reaction has practical applications in various industries, such as agriculture, where calcium carbonate is employed to neutralize acidic soils. Furthermore, the production of carbon dioxide gas from this reaction is crucial for numerous applications, including the manufacturing of carbonated beverages and the operation of fire extinguishers.

In conclusion, Group 2 carbonates stand out for their thermal stability, making them suitable for use in construction materials, while their reactivity with acids allows for diverse industrial applications.
