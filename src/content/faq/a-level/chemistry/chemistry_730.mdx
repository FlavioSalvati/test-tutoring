A carborane is a molecular cluster consisting of boron, carbon, and hydrogen atoms, formed through various chemical synthesis methods.

Carboranes are unique clusters composed of boron, carbon, and hydrogen atoms. They are typically synthesized using a range of techniques, including electrophilic substitution, nucleophilic addition, and metal-catalyzed reactions. The resulting carborane clusters can vary significantly in size and shape, with some containing as few as $6$ atoms, while others can exceed $100$ atoms.

One of the most notable characteristics of carboranes is their remarkable thermal and chemical stability. This property makes them valuable for a variety of applications, including their use as catalysts, components in electronic devices, and promising candidates for drug development. Additionally, carboranes exhibit unique physical and chemical properties that make them particularly appealing for materials science and nanotechnology applications.

Despite their potential, carboranes remain relatively underexplored compared to other molecular clusters. This is partly due to the challenges involved in their synthesis and characterization, as well as the limited availability of appropriate analytical techniques. Nevertheless, ongoing research is gradually enhancing our understanding of carboranes and their potential applications across various fields.
