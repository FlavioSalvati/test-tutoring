Chelation is a chemical process that involves the formation of a complex between a metal ion and a ligand.

In this process, a ligand—a molecule or ion equipped with one or more lone pairs of electrons—coordinates with a metal ion. This interaction leads to the creation of a coordination compound, which consists of the metal ion bonded to one or more ligands. The term "chelate" is derived from the Greek word "chele," meaning "claw," which aptly describes the manner in which the ligand encircles the metal ion, resembling a claw.

Chelation plays a vital role across various fields, including biology, medicine, and industry. In biological systems, it is crucial for transporting metal ions across cell membranes and regulating the activity of enzymes that depend on metal ions as cofactors. In the medical field, chelation therapy is employed to treat metal poisoning; it involves administering chelating agents that bind to toxic metal ions, thereby facilitating their elimination from the body. In industrial applications, chelation is utilized for purifying metals, preventing scale formation in boilers and pipes, and enhancing the stability and solubility of metal-containing compounds.

In summary, chelation is a fundamental process within coordination chemistry that involves the formation of a complex between a metal ion and a ligand. This process is essential for various biological functions and has significant applications in medicine and industry, highlighting its importance in both natural and applied sciences.
