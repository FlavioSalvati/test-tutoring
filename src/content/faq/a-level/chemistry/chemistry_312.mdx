An example of a nitro compound is nitroglycerin, while an example of an amino compound is glycine.

Nitro compounds are organic molecules characterized by the presence of a nitro functional group, denoted as $-NO_2$. Nitroglycerin, a well-known nitro compound, is a pale yellow, oily liquid primarily used as a powerful explosive. In addition to its explosive properties, nitroglycerin plays a significant role in medical treatments, particularly for angina, a condition that causes chest pain due to decreased blood flow to the heart. The mechanism of nitroglycerin involves the relaxation of smooth muscles in blood vessels, leading to increased blood flow and a reduction in the heart's workload.

On the other hand, amino compounds are organic molecules that contain an amino functional group, represented as $-NH_2$. Glycine is the simplest amino acid and serves as a common example of an amino compound. It is naturally found in proteins and is also utilized as a dietary supplement. Glycine is recognized for its calming effects on the brain, and it is often used to address various conditions such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and sleep disorders. The action of glycine involves the regulation of specific neurotransmitters in the brain, which contributes to anxiety reduction and promotes relaxation.

In summary, nitroglycerin and glycine exemplify nitro and amino compounds, respectively. Nitroglycerin is utilized both as an explosive and in the treatment of angina, while glycine, found in proteins, serves as a dietary supplement known for its relaxation-promoting properties.
