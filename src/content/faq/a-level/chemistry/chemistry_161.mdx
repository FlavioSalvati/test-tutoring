An illustrative example of anti-Markovnikov addition is the reaction between HBr and propene when peroxides are present.

In organic chemistry, electrophilic addition reactions can be categorized into two types: Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov additions. In a Markovnikov addition, the electrophile—typically a hydrogen halide—attaches to the carbon atom that has the greatest number of hydrogen atoms. This results in the formation of a more stable carbocation intermediate. Subsequently, the halide ion adds to this carbocation, yielding the final product.

Conversely, during an anti-Markovnikov addition, the electrophile adds to the carbon atom that possesses the least number of hydrogen atoms. This process leads to the formation of a less stable carbocation intermediate. However, this intermediate can be stabilized by radical initiators, such as peroxides. These radical initiators generate free radicals that abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkene, resulting in the formation of a radical intermediate. Following this, the halide ion adds to the radical intermediate, resulting in the final product.

A specific example of anti-Markovnikov addition is the reaction of HBr with propene in the presence of peroxides. In this reaction, a radical intermediate is generated, which is subsequently attacked by the halide ion to form 2-bromopropane. This reaction is particularly significant in the synthesis of alcohols, as it enables the conversion of alkenes to alcohols in a single step.
