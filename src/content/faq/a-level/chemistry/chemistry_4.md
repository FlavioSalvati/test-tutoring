Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one unit of mass by one degree Celsius. In contrast, molar heat capacity refers to the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree Celsius.

Both specific heat and molar heat capacity quantify a substance's capacity to absorb heat. However, they differ fundamentally in their units of measurement: specific heat is expressed in relation to mass, while molar heat capacity is based on the number of moles. Consequently, specific heat depends on the mass of the substance, whereas molar heat capacity is concerned with the number of particles within that substance.

Another key distinction is that specific heat is an intrinsic property of a substance, while molar heat capacity is influenced not only by the substance itself but also by its physical state. For example, the molar heat capacity of water varies significantly between its liquid and gaseous states.

When performing calculations, specific heat is utilized to determine the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a specified mass of a substance, expressed as:

$$ Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T $$

where $Q$ is the heat added, $m$ is the mass, $c$ is the specific heat, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. On the other hand, molar heat capacity is used to find the heat required to raise the temperature for a specific number of moles, represented as:

$$ Q = n \cdot C \cdot \Delta T $$

where $n$ is the number of moles, $C$ is the molar heat capacity, and $\Delta T$ is again the change in temperature.

In summary, while specific heat and molar heat capacity are related concepts, they differ in their units, dependence on mass versus moles, and their relevance to different states of a substance.
