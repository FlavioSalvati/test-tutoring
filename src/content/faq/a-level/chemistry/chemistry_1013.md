Group 2 carbonates exhibit a trend of decreasing thermal stability as one moves down the group, which consequently leads to increased reactivity.

The carbonates of Group 2 elements, such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and barium carbonate, are generally stable compounds. However, their thermal stability diminishes progressively down the group. As a result, the reactivity of these carbonates increases with each successive element.

For instance, calcium carbonate ($\text{CaCO}_3$) is relatively stable and requires a high temperature to decompose, typically above $800^\circ C$. In contrast, barium carbonate ($\text{BaCO}_3$) is much less stable and can decompose at significantly lower temperatures, around $700^\circ C$. This trend can be attributed to the increasing size of the Group 2 metal cation as one moves down the group, which weakens the bond between the metal cation and the carbonate ion ($\text{CO}_3^{2-}$).

Moreover, the reduced thermal stability of Group 2 carbonates influences their solubility in water. As these carbonates become more reactive, they are more prone to react with water, resulting in the formation of metal hydroxides and carbon dioxide. Therefore, the solubility of Group 2 carbonates tends to increase as one moves down the group.

In summary, the thermal stability of Group 2 carbonates decreases down the group, leading to heightened reactivity. This increased reactivity is primarily due to the weakening of the bond between the metal cation and the carbonate ion, which also impacts their solubility in water.
