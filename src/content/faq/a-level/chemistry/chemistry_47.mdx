Alkenes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of at least one carbon-carbon double bond, whereas alkanes consist solely of single bonds between carbon atoms.

Specifically, alkenes contain a double bond that comprises one sigma bond and one pi bond. The pi bond is formed through the overlap of two p orbitals. The general formula for alkenes is given by 

$$ 
\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n} 
$$ 

where $n$ represents the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. The presence of the double bond significantly contributes to the reactivity of alkenes, enabling them to participate in addition reactions.

When comparing alkenes to alkanes, there are notable differences in their physical and chemical properties. Alkenes typically exhibit lower boiling points and are less dense than alkanes with similar molecular weights, primarily due to the presence of the double bond. Furthermore, alkenes are more reactive than their alkane counterparts and can readily engage in addition reactions with electrophiles, such as hydrogen halides and water.

Alkenes are also capable of undergoing isomerization, a process in which the position of the double bond is altered within the molecule. This shift leads to the formation of different isomers, each possessing distinct physical and chemical properties. Additionally, alkenes serve as valuable starting materials for synthesizing various organic compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids.

In summary, alkenes are hydrocarbons that feature a double bond between two carbon atoms. They differ from alkanes in terms of their physical and chemical properties, reactivity, and capacity for isomerization and addition reactions.
