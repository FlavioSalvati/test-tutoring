The activation energy ($E_a$) is defined as the minimum energy required for a chemical reaction to take place.

For a chemical reaction to occur, reactant molecules must collide with sufficient energy to break existing bonds and form new ones. However, not every collision results in a reaction. This is due to the fact that only a small fraction of collisions possess enough energy to surpass the activation energy barrier.

You can visualize the activation energy as a hurdle that reactant molecules must overcome to produce products. A higher activation energy indicates a greater challenge for the reaction to proceed. Consequently, reactions characterized by high activation energies typically occur at a slower rate compared to those with lower activation energies.

The rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the frequency of successful collisions per unit time. As such, the rate of reaction is influenced by the activation energy. Reactions with lower activation energies have a greater proportion of successful collisions, leading to a faster reaction rate. In contrast, reactions with higher activation energies experience a reduced proportion of successful collisions, resulting in a slower reaction rate.

In summary, activation energy is a pivotal factor in determining the rate of a chemical reaction. Reactions with lower activation energies tend to proceed more rapidly, whereas those with higher activation energies generally progress more slowly.
