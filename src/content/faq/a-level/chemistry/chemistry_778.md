A lactone is a cyclic ester that is formed through the intramolecular condensation of a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group. 

Lactones belong to a class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a cyclic ester functional group. The formation of a lactone involves a reaction between a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group, resulting in the creation of a cyclic ester along with the release of a water molecule. These compounds can be categorized based on the size of the cyclic structure they form, with the most common types being four-, five-, six-, and seven-membered rings.

Lactones are prevalent in various natural products, including certain antibiotics, antifungal agents, and pheromones. Additionally, they play a significant role in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fragrances. The properties of lactones are influenced by several factors: the size of the ring, the nature of any substituents present, and the positioning of the carbonyl group. Generally, smaller lactones exhibit greater reactivity compared to their larger counterparts, while lactones that contain electron-withdrawing substituents tend to be more stable than those with electron-donating substituents.

Various synthetic methods can be employed to produce lactones. These include the reaction of a carboxylic acid with a carbonyl compound in the presence of an acid catalyst, the reaction of an alcohol with a carboxylic acid using a dehydrating agent, and the ring-closing metathesis of an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The synthesis of lactones remains a vital area of research within organic chemistry, with ongoing efforts to develop new methods that enhance the efficiency and selectivity of these reactions.
