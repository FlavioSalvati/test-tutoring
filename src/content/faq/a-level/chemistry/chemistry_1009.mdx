Strong acids and bases fully dissociate in aqueous solutions, whereas weak acids and bases only partially dissociate.

Strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$), sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$), and nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$), exhibit a strong tendency to donate protons ($\text{H}^+$ ions$) to water molecules. This behavior results in a high concentration of $\text{H}^+$ ions in the solution, thereby rendering it acidic. Similarly, strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$) and potassium hydroxide ($\text{KOH}$), readily accept protons from water molecules, leading to a high concentration of hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) in the solution, which makes it basic.

In contrast, weak acids and bases exhibit only partial dissociation in aqueous solutions. This means that only a fraction of the acid or base molecules will donate or accept protons, resulting in a lower concentration of $\text{H}^+$ or $\text{OH}^-$ ions in the solution. For instance, weak acids like acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$) and carbonic acid ($\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$) have a lesser tendency to donate protons to water, resulting in a solution that is less acidic. Likewise, weak bases such as ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$) and methylamine ($\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2$) are less likely to accept protons from water, resulting in a solution that is less basic.

The strength of an acid or base is quantified by its dissociation constant, denoted as $K_a$ for acids and $K_b$ for bases, which reflects the extent of dissociation in solution. Strong acids and bases possess very high dissociation constants, indicating nearly complete dissociation, whereas weak acids and bases have lower dissociation constants, signifying partial dissociation. Understanding the distinctions between strong and weak acids and bases is essential in various fields of biology, including biochemistry and physiology.
