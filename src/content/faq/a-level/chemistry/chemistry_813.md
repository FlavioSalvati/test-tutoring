A carboxylic acid is an organic compound characterized by the presence of a carboxyl group, denoted as $-COOH$. These compounds are typically formed through the oxidation of primary alcohols or aldehydes.

Carboxylic acids represent a significant class of organic compounds that feature a carboxyl group attached to a carbon atom. The carboxyl group is primarily responsible for the acidic properties of these acids, as it is capable of donating a proton to a base. Carboxylic acids are prevalent in many natural products, including amino acids and fatty acids, and they play a vital role in various industrial applications, such as the production of polymers, pharmaceuticals, and food additives.

The formation of carboxylic acids generally occurs via the oxidation of a primary alcohol or an aldehyde. This oxidation reaction is typically facilitated by an oxidizing agent, such as potassium permanganate or chromic acid. In this process, the alcohol or aldehyde is first converted into a carboxylic acid intermediate, which can then be isolated and purified for further use.

Additionally, carboxylic acids can be synthesized through the hydrolysis of esters. This reaction often employs either an acid or base catalyst, leading to the formation of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. This hydrolysis reaction is particularly important in the production of soaps and detergents, as well as in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds.

In summary, carboxylic acids are a crucial class of organic compounds with diverse applications across industry and biology. Their distinctive properties render them useful in a variety of contexts, ranging from food additives to pharmaceutical formulations.
