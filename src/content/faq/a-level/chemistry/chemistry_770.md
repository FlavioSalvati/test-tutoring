Alkynes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of a triple bond between two carbon atoms, whereas alkenes feature a double bond.

Specifically, alkynes contain at least one carbon-carbon triple bond, which is composed of one sigma bond and two pi bonds. This triple bond is both shorter and stronger than the double bond found in alkenes, contributing to the increased reactivity of alkynes. The general formula for alkynes is given by:

$$ C_nH_{2n-2} $$

where $n$ represents the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.

The presence of a triple bond in alkynes allows each carbon atom to add two atoms or groups. Consequently, alkynes can participate in addition reactions with various reagents, including hydrogen, halogens, and other molecules. Additionally, alkynes are capable of undergoing substitution reactions, in which one atom or group is replaced by another.

In terms of physical properties, alkynes generally exhibit higher boiling and melting points compared to alkanes and alkenes, primarily due to the strength of the triple bond. However, when comparing alkynes to similar-sized alkanes and alkenes, they tend to have lower boiling and melting points because of their lower molecular weight.

In summary, alkynes are defined by their triple bond between carbon atoms, which enhances their reactivity relative to alkenes. They demonstrate higher boiling and melting points than alkenes, yet lower than those of comparable alkanes. The ability of alkynes to undergo both addition and substitution reactions makes them valuable in organic synthesis.
