Doping in semiconductors involves the intentional introduction of impurities into a pure semiconductor material to modify its electrical characteristics. There are two primary types of doping: n-type and p-type.

In n-type doping, impurities such as phosphorus or arsenic are introduced into the semiconductor. These impurities provide additional electrons, which are negatively charged, leading to an excess of charge carriers. For instance, when phosphorus, which has five valence electrons, is added to silicon (which has four valence electrons), it contributes an extra electron. This additional electron becomes available for conduction, resulting in a semiconductor that is negatively charged. N-type semiconductors are widely utilized in electronic devices, including solar cells and transistors.

Conversely, p-type doping involves adding impurities like boron or aluminum to the semiconductor. Boron has three valence electrons, one less than silicon. When boron is introduced into silicon, it creates an electron deficiency, resulting in positively charged "holes." These holes can move through the semiconductor, effectively acting as positive charge carriers. P-type semiconductors are commonly found in devices such as diodes and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

The doping process is essential in the fabrication of electronic devices, as it enables the creation of semiconductors with tailored electrical properties. By carefully controlling the type and concentration of impurities added, engineers can optimize the conductivity and other characteristics of semiconductors for specific applications.
