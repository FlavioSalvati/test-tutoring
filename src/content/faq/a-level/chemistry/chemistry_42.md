Cations and anions exhibit distinct behaviors in aqueous solutions.

In an aqueous environment, cations and anions interact with water molecules through electrostatic forces. Cations are positively charged ions that are drawn to the negatively charged oxygen atoms present in water molecules. This electrostatic attraction leads to the formation of a hydration shell around the cation, where water molecules cluster around it. The strength of this hydration shell is influenced by both the size and charge of the cation. For instance, small, highly charged cations such as $Mg^{2+}$ and $Al^{3+}$ exhibit stronger hydration shells compared to larger, less charged cations like $Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$.

Conversely, anions are negatively charged ions that are attracted to the positively charged hydrogen atoms in water molecules. Similar to cations, this attraction results in the formation of a hydration shell around the anion. However, the hydration shell for anions is generally weaker than that for cations. This is primarily because anions tend to be larger and possess a more diffuse charge distribution.

The differing behaviors of cations and anions in aqueous solutions have significant implications for biological systems. For example, the hydration shells around these ions can affect the solubility and stability of proteins and other biomolecules. Furthermore, the interactions between cations and anions can influence the structure and function of biological membranes, which are composed of lipid bilayers containing both positively and negatively charged components.
