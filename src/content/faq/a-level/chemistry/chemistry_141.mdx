Transition metals can crystallize in either a face-centered cubic (FCC) or a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure.

The face-centered cubic (FCC) structure is prevalent among transition metals, including copper, silver, and gold. In this arrangement, atoms occupy the corners of a cube, with an additional atom positioned at the center of each face. This configuration leads to a close-packed structure with a coordination number of 12, meaning each atom is in contact with 12 neighboring atoms. The FCC structure is notable for its high ductility and exceptional electrical conductivity.

Conversely, the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure is characteristic of transition metals such as iron, tungsten, and chromium. In the BCC arrangement, atoms are also located at the corners of a cube, but there is one atom situated at the center of the cube itself. This results in a less densely packed arrangement, with a coordination number of 8, indicating that each atom interacts with 8 adjacent atoms. The BCC structure is recognized for its remarkable strength and toughness.

Both crystal structures possess distinct properties that render them valuable for various applications. For instance, the FCC structure's excellent conductivity and ductility make it ideal for use in electrical wiring and jewelry. In contrast, the BCC structure's high strength and toughness make it suitable for structural materials such as steel. A thorough understanding of the crystal structures of transition metals is essential for grasping their properties and potential applications.
