An illustrative example of electron transfer between different metals is the reaction between copper and silver.

When copper and silver are brought into contact, a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction takes place. In this process, copper atoms lose electrons, resulting in the formation of positively charged copper ions, while silver ions gain those electrons and are transformed into neutral silver atoms. This electron transfer is the driving force behind the reaction.

The reaction can be represented by the following chemical equation:

$$
\text{Cu}(s) + 2\text{Ag}^+(aq) \rightarrow \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) + 2\text{Ag}(s)
$$

In this equation, $\text{Cu}$ denotes copper, $\text{Ag}$ denotes silver, and the symbols $(s)$ and $(aq)$ indicate the physical states of the elementsâ€”solid and aqueous, respectively. The arrow signifies the direction of the reaction, with reactants on the left and products on the right.

This reaction exemplifies a spontaneous redox process, which means it occurs naturally without the necessity for an external energy source. Additionally, it serves as a classic example of a displacement reaction, where copper atoms displace silver ions from their respective compounds.

In summary, the electron transfer between copper and silver represents a fundamental process in chemistry with significant implications in fields such as electrochemistry and metallurgy.
