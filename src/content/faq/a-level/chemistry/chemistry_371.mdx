Weak acids and bases only partially dissociate in water, whereas strong acids and bases completely dissociate.

When an acid or base is dissolved in water, it can either fully or partially dissociate, which means it separates into ions. Strong acids and bases entirely dissociate, leading to a high concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) for strong acids and hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) for strong bases.

In contrast, weak acids and bases only partially dissociate, resulting in a smaller fraction of their molecules breaking apart into ions. Consequently, this leads to a lower concentration of hydrogen or hydroxide ions in solution.

The strength of an acid or base is primarily determined by its ability to donate or accept protons. Strong acids and bases exhibit a high affinity for protons, while weak acids and bases possess a lower affinity.

For instance, examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) and sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$). In comparison, weak acids include acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$) and carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$). Similarly, strong bases consist of sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$) and potassium hydroxide ($KOH$), while weak bases encompass ammonia ($NH_3$) and the bicarbonate ion ($HCO_3^-$).

In summary, the key differences between weak and strong acids and bases lie in their dissociation behavior in water and their proton affinity. Understanding these distinctions is crucial in various fields of biology, particularly in biochemistry and physiology.
