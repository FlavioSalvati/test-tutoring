Amines are classified based on the number of alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. Primary amines contain one alkyl or aryl group, secondary amines have two, and tertiary amines possess three.

**Primary Amines**  
Primary amines, characterized by a single alkyl or aryl group bonded to the nitrogen atom, are basic in nature and can engage in hydrogen bonding with water molecules. These compounds can be synthesized through various methods, including the reduction of nitriles or the addition of ammonia to alkyl halides. Primary amines are important in industries for the production of dyes, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides.

**Secondary Amines**  
Secondary amines feature two alkyl or aryl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. Similar to primary amines, they exhibit basic properties and can form hydrogen bonds with water. Secondary amines can be synthesized by reacting primary amines with alkyl halides or by reducing nitro compounds. They play a significant role in the production of rubber, dyes, and pharmaceuticals.

**Tertiary Amines**  
Tertiary amines are defined by having three alkyl or aryl groups connected to the nitrogen atom. They are generally less basic than their primary and secondary counterparts and do not form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The synthesis of tertiary amines can be accomplished by reacting secondary amines with alkyl halides or through the dealkylation of quaternary ammonium salts. Tertiary amines are widely used as catalysts, solvents, and in the manufacture of surfactants.
