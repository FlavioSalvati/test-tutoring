The free energy of a chemical reaction represents the amount of energy available to perform work. It is closely related to the spontaneity of a reaction, as indicated by the change in free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$.

In general, spontaneous reactions exhibit a negative $\Delta G$, which signifies that they release energy and are energetically favorable. Conversely, non-spontaneous reactions have a positive $\Delta G$, indicating that they require an input of energy and are energetically unfavorable.

The value of $\Delta G$ for a given reaction is determined by the difference between the free energy of the products and the free energy of the reactants. This difference is influenced by both the enthalpy change ($\Delta H$) and the entropy change ($\Delta S$) associated with the reaction.

Specifically, the conditions for spontaneity are as follows:
- If $\Delta H$ is negative and $\Delta S$ is positive, the reaction is spontaneous at all temperatures.
- If $\Delta H$ is positive and $\Delta S$ is negative, the reaction is non-spontaneous at all temperatures.
- If $\Delta H$ is positive and $\Delta S$ is positive, the reaction is spontaneous at high temperatures but non-spontaneous at low temperatures.

Moreover, $\Delta G$ can be utilized to determine the equilibrium constant ($K$) of a reaction. The relationships are as follows:
- If $\Delta G$ is negative, then $K > 1$, indicating that the reaction favors the formation of products.
- If $\Delta G$ is positive, then $K < 1$, suggesting that the reaction favors the reactants.
- If $\Delta G$ is zero, then $K = 1$, signifying that the reaction is at equilibrium.

In summary, the free energy of a chemical reaction is a crucial factor in assessing both its spontaneity and its equilibrium constant.
