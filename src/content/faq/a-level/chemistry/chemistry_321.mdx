Colloids are mixtures characterized by particles that are larger than those found in solutions but smaller than those in suspensions. These particles typically range in size from $1$ to $1000$ nanometers and are evenly dispersed throughout a medium. Colloids can be categorized into four main types: sols, gels, emulsions, and aerosols.

One of the notable properties of colloids is the Tyndall effect. This phenomenon occurs when light is scattered by the colloidal particles, causing the mixture to appear cloudy. In contrast, this scattering effect is absent in true solutions, which remain clear.

Another significant property of colloids is Brownian motion. This refers to the random movement of colloidal particles, which is induced by their collisions with the surrounding molecules of the dispersing medium. The thermal energy of the medium drives this motion, and it is not observed in solutions.

Colloids can also be stabilized through various methods, such as the addition of surfactants or by creating electrostatic repulsion between the particles, which helps prevent them from aggregating.

Colloids have a wide range of practical applications across multiple fields, including medicine, food science, and cosmetics. For instance, emulsions are commonly utilized in food products to maintain the stability of mixtures that contain both oil and water-based ingredients. In the medical field, colloids are employed as drug delivery systems due to their ability to traverse cell membranes effectively. A thorough understanding of colloidal properties is essential for the development of innovative technologies and for enhancing existing applications.
