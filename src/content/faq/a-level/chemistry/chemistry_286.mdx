Crystal field splitting occurs when d-orbitals in transition metal complexes separate into distinct energy levels, leading to the observation of different colors.

When transition metal ions form complexes with ligands, the presence of these ligands causes the d-orbitals to split into two energy levels. This phenomenon is known as crystal field splitting. The energy difference between these two levels plays a crucial role in determining the color of the complex.

For instance, consider a transition metal ion with five d-electrons, such as $Fe^{2+}$. When it forms a complex with six ligands, the d-orbitals split into two sets: three orbitals at a lower energy level, referred to as $t_{2g}$, and two orbitals at a higher energy level, known as $e_g$. The energy difference between these two levels corresponds to the absorption of light in the visible spectrum. In this case, the complex appears green because it absorbs red light.

In another example, take a transition metal ion with four d-electrons, such as $Ni^{2+}$. Upon forming a complex with six ligands, the d-orbitals also split into two energy levels, but in this scenario, there are two orbitals at a lower energy level ($e_g$) and three orbitals at a higher energy level ($t_{2g}$). The energy difference between these levels relates to the absorption of light in the blue region of the spectrum, causing the complex to appear yellow due to the absorption of blue light.

In summary, crystal field splitting leads to the division of d-orbitals into different energy levels, which results in various colors for transition metal complexes. The specific energy difference between these levels determines the color observed, which can be analyzed through absorption spectroscopy.
