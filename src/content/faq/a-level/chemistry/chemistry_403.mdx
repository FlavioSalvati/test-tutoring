The influence of common ions on the solubility of various ionic compounds depends significantly on the specific compounds in question.

When a common ion is introduced into a solution containing a particular ionic compound, it often leads to a decrease in the solubility of that compound. This phenomenon occurs because the presence of the common ion reduces the concentration of the ions in solution, which subsequently lowers the solubility product and prompts the ionic compound to precipitate. For instance, adding NaCl to a solution of AgCl decreases the solubility of AgCl due to the common ion, chloride ($\text{Cl}^-$).

In certain situations, however, the addition of a common ion can actually enhance the solubility of an ionic compound. This increase occurs when the common ion forms a complex ion with one of the ions in the compound, thereby elevating the compound's solubility. A notable example is when $\text{NH}_4^+$ is added to a solution of $\text{Cu(OH)}_2$, which results in an increased solubility of $\text{Cu(OH)}_2$ due to the formation of the complex ion $\text{Cu(NH}_3\text{)}_4^{2+}$.

Furthermore, the impact of common ions on the solubility of ionic compounds can also be influenced by the relative concentrations of the ions present in the solution. If the concentration of the common ion is significantly higher than that of the ion in the compound, the solubility of the compound will be substantially diminished. Conversely, if the concentration of the common ion is only slightly greater than that of the ion in the compound, the effect on solubility may be minimal.

In summary, the effect of common ions on the solubility of ionic compounds is intricate and varies based on the specific compounds involved and their concentrations within the solution.
