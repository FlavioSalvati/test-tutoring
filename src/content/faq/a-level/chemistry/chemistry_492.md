The half-life of a reaction is defined as the duration required for half of the reactants to be consumed. 

Different reactions exhibit varying half-lives, which are influenced by their respective reaction rates. For instance, the half-life of radioactive decay can span from mere fractions of a second to billions of years. A notable example is Carbon-14, a radioactive isotope utilized in the dating of archaeological artifacts, which has a half-life of approximately $5,700$ years. This implies that after $5,700$ years, half of the initial quantity of Carbon-14 will have decayed into Nitrogen-14.

Enzyme-catalyzed reactions also possess half-lives. The half-life of such reactions is contingent upon several factors, including the concentrations of the enzyme and substrate, as well as the temperature and pH of the reaction environment. For example, the half-life of the enzyme catalase, which facilitates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, can vary from a few seconds to several minutes based on these conditions.

Chemical reactions, too, have associated half-lives. The half-life of a chemical reaction is influenced by the concentrations of the reactants, temperature, and the presence of any catalysts. For instance, the half-life of the reaction between hydrogen and iodine to form hydrogen iodide can range from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on these variables.

Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the half-lives of various reactions is crucial in fields such as medicine, where the half-life of pharmaceuticals can influence their effectiveness and appropriate dosage. Additionally, in nuclear physics, the half-life of radioactive isotopes is essential for determining their decay rates and assessing potential hazards.
