### Comparison of Carboranes and Boranes

A **carborane** is a unique cluster compound composed of carbon, boron, and hydrogen atoms, whereas a **borane** is a simpler compound consisting solely of boron and hydrogen atoms.

Carboranes belong to a distinctive class of compounds characterized by their intricate three-dimensional structures. These compounds are widely utilized in various applications, including as molecular building blocks in materials science and in the field of medical imaging. A notable example of a carborane is **1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaborane**, which features a cage-like architecture made up of 12 boron atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and two carbon atoms.

Conversely, boranes represent a group of compounds that serve as effective reducing agents and catalysts in organic chemistry. An illustrative example of a borane is **borane dimethyl sulfide**, which plays a crucial role in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols. Despite their high reactivity and potential hazards during handling, boranes are invaluable tools in synthetic chemistry.

In summary, both carboranes and boranes contain boron and hydrogen atoms; however, they differ significantly in structure and application. Carboranes exhibit a unique three-dimensional framework and find uses in materials science and medical imaging, while boranes are primarily employed as reducing agents and catalysts in organic chemistry.
