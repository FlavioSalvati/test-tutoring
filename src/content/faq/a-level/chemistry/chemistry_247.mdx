The process of electron transfer involves the movement of electrons between atoms.

In metals, the outermost electrons are only loosely bound to the nucleus, allowing them to move freely throughout the metal lattice. This characteristic enables the efficient transfer of electrons between atoms, which is a key reason for the high electrical conductivity observed in metals.

The movement of electrons in metals is further facilitated by the presence of a "sea" of delocalized electrons. These electrons can freely traverse the metal lattice. When an electric field is applied, they respond by moving, thereby generating an electric current.

Electron transfer in metals is also essential in chemical reactions. For instance, during oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, electrons are transferred from one molecule to another. In the context of metals, this transfer can lead to the formation of metal ions, which may subsequently react with other molecules to produce new compounds.

In summary, the mechanism of electron transfer is fundamental to the properties and behavior of metals. A thorough understanding of this process is crucial across various scientific fields, including materials science and biochemistry.
