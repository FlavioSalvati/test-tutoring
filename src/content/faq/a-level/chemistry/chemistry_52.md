The primary distinction between esters and ketones in the context of Claisen condensation lies in their reactivity.

Esters are generally less reactive than ketones. This reduced reactivity is attributed to the presence of an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group and an electron-donating alkoxyl group. The combination of these effects makes the carbonyl carbon of esters less electrophilic, thereby decreasing its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack. Consequently, esters necessitate more vigorous reaction conditions—such as elevated temperatures or stronger bases—to successfully undergo Claisen condensation.

In contrast, ketones exhibit greater reactivity due to the absence of an electron-donating group. This absence renders the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, thereby increasing its likelihood of undergoing nucleophilic attack. As a result, ketones can participate in Claisen condensation reactions under milder conditions.

Another notable difference between esters and ketones in Claisen condensation is the nature of the products formed. When an ester undergoes Claisen condensation, the resulting product is a β-ketoester, which can subsequently be hydrolyzed to yield a β-ketoacid. In the case of ketones, the product of the Claisen condensation is a β-diketone.

In summary, the differences in reactivity and product formation between esters and ketones during Claisen condensation stem from the presence or absence of an electron-donating group on the carbonyl carbon.
