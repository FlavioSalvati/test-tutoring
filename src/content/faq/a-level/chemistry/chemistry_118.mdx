The boiling and melting points of amides are influenced by their molecular structure and the nature of their intermolecular forces.

Amides are a class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group ($\text{C}= \text{O}$) and an amino group ($\text{NH}_2$) attached to the same carbon atom. The variations in their boiling and melting points arise from these structural features and the intermolecular interactions at play.

A significant factor that elevates the boiling and melting points of amides is the formation of hydrogen bonds between the molecules. For instance, formamide ($\text{HCONH}_2$) exhibits a boiling point of $210^\circ \text{C}$ and a melting point of $2.5^\circ \text{C}$. These relatively high values can be attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding that occurs between its molecules.

On the other hand, amides that lack hydrogen bonding, such as acetamide ($\text{CH}_3\text{CONH}_2$), typically exhibit lower boiling and melting points. Acetamide has a boiling point of $222^\circ \text{C}$ and a melting point of $82^\circ \text{C}$, which are influenced by weaker intermolecular forces, including dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces.

Additionally, the length and branching of the amide chain play a crucial role in determining their thermal properties. Generally, longer amide chains with greater branching have higher boiling and melting points due to increased surface area and stronger intermolecular forces.

In conclusion, the boiling and melting points of amides are contingent upon their molecular structure and the intermolecular forces present, with hydrogen bonding being a particularly important factor in defining their physical characteristics.
