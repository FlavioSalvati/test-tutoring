Carboxylic acids and esters are distinct classes of organic compounds that differ in their functional groups and chemical properties.

Carboxylic acids are characterized by the presence of a carboxyl group, denoted as $-\text{COOH}$, which is attached to a hydrocarbon chain. The carboxyl group imparts acidic properties to these compounds, as it can donate a proton ($\text{H}^+$) to produce a carboxylate ion, represented as $-\text{COO}^-$. Carboxylic acids are polar molecules, which makes them soluble in water. They exhibit relatively high boiling points due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding among their molecules.

In contrast, esters contain an ester group, represented as $-\text{COO}-$, which is also connected to a hydrocarbon chain. Esters are synthesized through a chemical reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, typically facilitated by an acid catalyst. Unlike carboxylic acids, esters are less acidic and do not produce carboxylate ions. Additionally, esters have lower water solubility and lower boiling points compared to carboxylic acids. While esters can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water molecules, these bonds are generally weaker than those formed by carboxylic acids.

Both carboxylic acids and esters have important applications in various industries and everyday life. Carboxylic acids are utilized in the production of plastics, detergents, and pharmaceuticals, and they are also found in numerous food products, such as vinegar and citrus fruits. On the other hand, esters serve as solvents, fragrances, and flavorings in the food and cosmetic industries, contributing to the characteristic aromas and tastes of many fruits and flowers.
