The thermodynamic stability of coordination complexes is influenced by the types of ligands involved.

The stability of a complex is primarily determined by the strength of the bond between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands can be categorized into various types based on their binding strength. For instance, strong ligands, such as cyanide ($\text{CN}^-$) and carbon monoxide ($\text{CO}$), form stable complexes with metal ions due to their effective electron-donating ability. Conversely, weak ligands, such as water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) and ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), create less stable complexes because of their comparatively weaker electron donation.

Additionally, the bond strength between the metal ion and the ligand can be influenced by the ligand's size and charge. Larger ligands may lead to weaker bonds due to steric hindrance, while ligands with higher charges can form stronger bonds owing to enhanced electrostatic attraction.

The thermodynamic stability of complexes is also affected by the presence of other ligands within the coordination sphere. For example, introducing a strong ligand to a complex containing a weak ligand can result in the displacement of the weaker ligand, thereby leading to the formation of a more stable complex.

In conclusion, the thermodynamic stability of coordination complexes varies depending on the types of ligands, which can be classified according to their binding strength, size, and charge. Additionally, the stability of a complex may be significantly altered by the presence of other ligands.
