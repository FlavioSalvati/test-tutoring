In the context of electrolysis, the amount of substance and current are two distinct measurements that play critical roles.

The amount of substance, commonly referred to as the mole, quantifies the number of particles present in a given sample. In electrolysis, this measurement is essential for determining the quantity of product generated or consumed during the chemical reaction. The standard unit for measuring the amount of substance is the mole ($\text{mol}$).

Conversely, current refers to the flow of electric charge and indicates the rate at which this charge moves through a conductor. In electrolysis, current is crucial for regulating the speed of the reaction. The unit of measurement for current is the ampere ($\text{A}$).

These two measurements are interconnected through Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Specifically, these laws assert that the amount of product formed or consumed during electrolysis is directly proportional to the total electric charge that passes through the electrolyte. This relationship implies that a higher current results in a faster reaction rate, leading to an increased production or consumption of products.

In summary, while both the amount of substance and current are vital measurements in the process of electrolysis, they fulfill different functions. The amount of substance is utilized to calculate the quantity of products formed or consumed, whereas current is employed to control the rate of the electrochemical reaction.
