Hydrolysis and complexation are fundamental reactions that occur in aqueous solutions.

**Hydrolysis** is a chemical reaction in which water is utilized to decompose a compound. This process takes place when a salt dissolves in water, resulting in the dissociation of the salt into its constituent ions. For instance, when sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$) is dissolved in water, it dissociates into sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$). The hydrolysis of $\text{NaCl}$ serves as a straightforward example of a neutralization reaction.

On the other hand, **complexation** refers to a chemical reaction in which a molecule or ion interacts with a metal ion, resulting in the formation of a complex. This reaction occurs when a metal ion is introduced into water, allowing a ligand to bind to it. A notable example is when copper(II) ions ($\text{Cu}^{2+}$) dissolve in water and subsequently form a complex with ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), resulting in the coordination complex [$\text{Cu}(\text{NH}_3)_4$]$^{2+}$. 

Both hydrolysis and complexation reactions play crucial roles in biological systems. Hydrolysis is essential for the breakdown of macromolecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Meanwhile, complexation is vital for the transport of metal ions within biological systems, exemplified by the binding of iron to transferrin in the bloodstream.

In conclusion, hydrolysis and complexation are significant reactions that occur in aqueous solutions. Hydrolysis involves the decomposition of compounds through the action of water, whereas complexation entails the binding of molecules or ions to metal ions. These reactions are vital for the metabolic processes involved in the breakdown of macromolecules and the transport of essential metal ions within living organisms.
