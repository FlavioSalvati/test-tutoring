Oxidation and reduction in aqueous solutions involve the transfer of electrons between different chemical species.

**Oxidation** is defined as the process in which a species loses electrons, leading to an increase in its oxidation state. In the context of aqueous solutions, oxidation can occur when a species reacts with oxygen or when it transfers electrons to another species. For instance, when iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water, it undergoes oxidation, resulting in the formation of rust. Another example can be observed when copper interacts with silver ions in a solution; during this reaction, copper loses electrons and is oxidized to form copper ions.

**Reduction**, on the other hand, is the process where a species gains electrons, which causes a decrease in its oxidation state. In aqueous solutions, reduction typically occurs when a species accepts electrons from another species. For example, when silver ions interact with copper in solution, the silver ions gain electrons and are reduced to form silver metal. Additionally, when hydrogen ions react with oxygen in water, they also gain electrons, resulting in their reduction to form water.

In many cases, oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously in aqueous solutions, as one species loses electrons while another gains them. This simultaneous occurrence is referred to as a **redox reaction**. Redox reactions play a crucial role in various biological processes, such as cellular respiration and photosynthesis. They are also significant in industrial applications, including electroplating and corrosion prevention.
