The thermal stability and reactivity of alkaline earth metal carbonates exhibit variation among the different elements in the group.

The thermal stability of alkaline earth metal carbonates increases as one moves down the group. This trend can be attributed to the increasing size of the cation, which results in a lower charge density. Consequently, the carbonate ion experiences a reduced attraction to the cation, making it less prone to decomposition. For instance, magnesium carbonate ($\text{MgCO}_3$) is more thermally stable than calcium carbonate ($\text{CaCO}_3$).

Similarly, the reactivity of alkaline earth metal carbonates also escalates down the group. This is again due to the increasing size of the cation, which leads to a decrease in ionization energy. As a result, the cation becomes more inclined to lose electrons and form compounds. For example, magnesium carbonate reacts more readily with acids compared to calcium carbonate.

In summary, the thermal stability and reactivity of alkaline earth metal carbonates are influenced by the cation's size and charge density. These properties vary among the elements, leading to distinct behaviors. Understanding these differences is crucial in practical applications, such as agriculture, where both calcium and magnesium carbonates are utilized to neutralize acidic soils.
