An example of a strong acid titration is the reaction between hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$) and sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$). Conversely, an example of a weak acid titration is the reaction between acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$) and sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$).

In a strong acid titration, the acid is fully dissociated in water, meaning it releases all of its hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$). During this process, a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide, is gradually added to the acid until the solution achieves a neutral pH. The endpoint of the titration is reached when the number of moles of acid equals the number of moles of base, resulting in a neutral solution. The chemical reaction can be represented as:

$$
\text{HCl} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
$$

In contrast, a weak acid titration involves an acid that is only partially dissociated in water, releasing only a fraction of its hydrogen ions. As in the strong acid titration, a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide, is added to the weak acid until the solution reaches a pH that is slightly above neutral. The endpoint in this case is also determined by the equivalence of moles of acid and base, but the resulting solution is slightly basic. The reaction is represented as follows:

$$
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COONa} + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
$$

The primary distinction between strong and weak acid titrations lies in the degree of dissociation of the acid in water. Strong acids, such as $\text{HCl}$, completely dissociate, while weak acids, like $\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$, dissociate only partially. This difference significantly influences the pH of the solution during the titration and the endpoint that is achieved. Specifically, strong acid titrations culminate in a neutral endpoint, whereas weak acid titrations result in a slightly basic endpoint.
