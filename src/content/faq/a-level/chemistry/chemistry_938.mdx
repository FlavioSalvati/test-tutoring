Strong field ligands lead to greater energy separations between the $d$ orbitals, whereas weak field ligands result in smaller separations.

In ligand field theory, the strength of a ligand's interaction with a metal ion is defined by its capacity to split the $d$ orbitals of that metal ion. Strong field ligands, such as $\text{CN}^-$, $\text{CO}$, and $\text{NH}_3$, induce a significant energy separation among the $d$ orbitals, producing a low-spin complex. This configuration implies that electrons occupy the lower energy orbitals before advancing to the higher energy ones, resulting in a reduced magnetic moment.

Conversely, weak field ligands, such as $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ and $\text{F}^-$, generate a smaller energy separation between the $d$ orbitals, leading to a high-spin complex. In this scenario, electrons fill the higher energy orbitals before any occupy the lower energy orbitals, resulting in an increased magnetic moment.

The strength of the ligand also influences the color of the resulting complex. Strong field ligands typically yield complexes that are either colorless or possess a low-intensity color. In contrast, weak field ligands produce complexes with more vibrant colors.

In summary, the strength of the ligand plays a crucial role in determining the energy separation between the $d$ orbitals. This, in turn, affects the spin state and magnetic moment of the complex, as well as its color.
