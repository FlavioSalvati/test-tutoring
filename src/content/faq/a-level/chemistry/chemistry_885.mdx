Nucleophilic addition is a fundamental chemical reaction in which a nucleophile, an electron-rich species, attacks an electron-deficient carbon atom. This interaction leads to the formation of a new bond between the nucleophile and the carbon atom.

Aldehydes and ketones are both classified as carbonyl compounds, each containing a carbon atom that is double-bonded to an oxygen atom. Due to this carbonyl group, both types of compounds are particularly susceptible to nucleophilic addition reactions.

In the case of aldehydes, the nucleophile targets the carbon atom of the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of a new bond, a process referred to as nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. The product of this reaction is known as a hemiacetal, which can subsequently react with another molecule of the nucleophile to yield an acetal.

Similarly, when ketones undergo nucleophilic addition, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon atom, forming a new bond in the process. This reaction is also described as nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon. The resulting product in this case is termed a hemiketal, which can further react with an additional molecule of the nucleophile to produce a ketal.

In summary, nucleophilic addition is a crucial reaction mechanism in organic chemistry, especially relevant for understanding the behavior of aldehydes and ketones due to their carbonyl groups. Grasping this mechanism is essential for A-Level Biology students who are delving into organic chemistry topics.
