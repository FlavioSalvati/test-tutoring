Interhalogen compounds are molecules created by the combination of two distinct halogens. 

Halogens are a group of elements that includes fluorine ($\text{F}$), chlorine ($\text{Cl}$), bromine ($\text{Br}$), iodine ($\text{I}$), and astatine ($\text{At}$). These elements are highly reactive nonmetals, which readily form compounds with one another and with other elements. Interhalogen compounds arise when two different halogens combine; for instance, chlorine and fluorine can form $\text{ClF}$, while iodine and bromine can yield $\text{IBr}$. These compounds exhibit unique properties that differentiate them from their parent halogens, such as increased reactivity and lower boiling points.

Interhalogen compounds have a diverse array of applications, including serving as oxidizing agents, catalysts, and disinfectants. They also play a significant role in the production of pharmaceuticals, plastics, and various industrial chemicals. The properties of these compounds can often be predicted by examining the electronegativity of the halogens involved. For example, when a more electronegative halogen bonds with a less electronegative halogen, the resulting compound typically features a polar covalent bond, leading to greater reactivity.

In summary, interhalogen compounds result from the combination of two different halogens and possess unique properties that set them apart from their parent halogens. Their wide-ranging applications across different industries, along with the predictability of their properties based on halogen electronegativity, underscore their importance in both chemistry and industry.
