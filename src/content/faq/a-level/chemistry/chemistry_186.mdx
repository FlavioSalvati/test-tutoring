The Born-Haber cycle is a systematic series of steps that elucidates the formation of ionic compounds.

Ionic compounds are typically formed through the reaction between a metal and a non-metal. The Born-Haber cycle serves as a framework for understanding the energy changes that occur throughout this process. It is named after Max Born and Fritz Haber, who introduced the concept in the early 20th century.

The cycle begins with the formation of gaseous atoms from the metal and non-metal elements. These gaseous atoms are then ionized to create gaseous ions. The subsequent step involves the formation of a solid ionic compound from these gaseous ions, a process that releases energy known as lattice energy.

Additional steps in the cycle encompass the formation of metal and non-metal ions from their respective elemental forms, the dissociation of the ionic compound into its constituent ions, and the creation of gaseous molecules from the individual atoms.

The Born-Haber cycle is a valuable tool for predicting the stability of ionic compounds and understanding the various factors that influence their formation. It can also be employed to calculate the enthalpy of formation of an ionic compound, which quantifies the energy released or absorbed during the compound's formation.

In summary, the Born-Haber cycle provides a detailed overview of the energy changes associated with the formation of ionic compounds and is a crucial concept in the field of chemistry.
