The boiling and melting points of ethers are influenced by their molecular structures.

Ethers are organic compounds characterized by an oxygen atom that is bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups. The boiling and melting points of these compounds are affected by the size and shape of the attached alkyl or aryl groups.

For instance, diethyl ether, with the chemical formula $C_4H_{10}O$, has a boiling point of $34.6^\circ C$ and a melting point of $-116.3^\circ C$. The relatively small and nonpolar ethyl groups attached to the oxygen atom contribute to weak intermolecular forces between the molecules, resulting in its low boiling and melting points.

In contrast, diphenyl ether, represented by the formula $C_{12}H_{10}O$, exhibits a boiling point of $258^\circ C$ and a melting point of $26^\circ C$. The larger and more polar phenyl groups increase the strength of the intermolecular forces, leading to higher boiling and melting points.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of ethers provide valuable insights into their physical properties and behavior in various chemical reactions.
