An example of enantiomers is L-alanine and D-alanine, while glucose and galactose serve as an example of diastereomers.

Enantiomers are a type of stereoisomer that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They possess identical chemical and physical properties, with the exception of their interaction with polarized light. Specifically, L-alanine and D-alanine are enantiomers of the amino acid alanine, sharing the same chemical formula and structural framework. However, their functional groups are arranged differently in three-dimensional space: L-alanine rotates polarized light to the left, whereas D-alanine rotates it to the right.

In contrast, diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images and exhibit different chemical and physical properties. These molecules typically arise from compounds with more than one chiral center and differ in configuration at one or more of these centers. For instance, glucose and galactose are diastereomers, differing in the orientation of their hydroxyl groups at carbon 4. In glucose, the hydroxyl group is oriented upwards, while in galactose, it is oriented downwards.

The distinction between enantiomers and diastereomers holds significant implications in biological systems, as they can interact differently with enzymes, receptors, and other biomolecules. A notable example is the drug thalidomide, which exists as a mixture of enantiomers; one enantiomer is associated with birth defects while the other is deemed safe. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the properties and interactions of enantiomers and diastereomers is essential in the fields of drug design and development.
