**Example:** $2$-methylbutane is classified as a branched-chain alkane.

Branched-chain alkanes are hydrocarbons characterized by a carbon backbone that features one or more branches. These branches can consist of either methyl ($\text{CH}_3$) or ethyl ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$) groups. The existence of these branches significantly influences the physical properties of the compound, including its boiling point and solubility.

A prime example of a branched-chain alkane is $2$-methylbutane. This compound consists of a four-carbon chain with a methyl group attached to the second carbon atom. The nomenclature of this compound adheres to the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system. This method involves identifying the longest continuous carbon chain and naming the substituents connected to it. In this case, the longest continuous chain comprises four carbons, which gives it the parent name "butane." The methyl group, which is attached to the second carbon, is denoted by the prefix "2-methyl." Hence, the full name of this compound is $2$-methylbutane.

Branched-chain alkanes are prevalent in petroleum and natural gas and are widely utilized as fuels and solvents. They also play a crucial role in the production of polymers and various industrial chemicals. A solid understanding of the properties and nomenclature of branched-chain alkanes is essential for the study of organic chemistry.
