The enthalpy of vaporization is the energy required to convert a liquid into a gas.

This property serves as an important indicator of the strength of intermolecular forces acting between molecules in a liquid. When a liquid is heated, the intermolecular forces that hold the molecules together are weakened, allowing them to move more freely. As the temperature continues to increase, the molecules acquire sufficient energy to overcome these intermolecular forces and transition into the gas phase.

The relationship between intermolecular forces and enthalpy of vaporization is straightforward: the stronger the intermolecular forces between the molecules in a liquid, the more energy is necessary to overcome these forces and facilitate the transition from liquid to gas. Consequently, liquids characterized by strong intermolecular forces exhibit higher enthalpies of vaporization compared to those with weaker intermolecular forces.

For instance, water has a high enthalpy of vaporization due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds between its molecules. Breaking these hydrogen bonds requires a significant amount of energy, which is why water necessitates a considerable amount of heat to convert into steam. In contrast, ethanol has weaker intermolecular forces and thus a lower enthalpy of vaporization.

In summary, the enthalpy of vaporization is a valuable measure of the strength of intermolecular forces in a liquid. It provides insights into the properties and behaviors of various substances.
