An illustrative example of an addition reaction involving alkenes is the reaction between ethene and hydrogen, which produces ethane.

Alkenes are classified as unsaturated hydrocarbons, characterized by the presence of at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Addition reactions are chemical processes in which two or more reactants unite to yield a single product. In the context of alkenes, these reactions entail the breaking of the double bond, allowing new atoms or groups of atoms to be incorporated into the molecule.

To illustrate, consider the reaction between ethene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$) and hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$), which results in the formation of ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$). This transformation is facilitated by a metal catalyst, such as nickel or platinum, and is commonly referred to as hydrogenation.

During this reaction, the double bond in ethene is cleaved, and each of the two carbon atoms forms a new bond with a hydrogen atom. Consequently, a single bond is established between the two carbon atoms, leading to the saturation of the molecule with hydrogen atoms.

Addition reactions involving alkenes play a vital role in the synthesis of a diverse array of products, including plastics, fuels, and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms governing these reactions is crucial for chemists and chemical engineers engaged in these industries.
