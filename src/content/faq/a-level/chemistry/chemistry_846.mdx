A substitution reaction refers to the process in which an atom or a group of atoms within a molecule is replaced by another atom or group of atoms.

In such reactions, an existing atom or group in a molecule is substituted with a different atom or group. This process can occur through one of two primary mechanisms: nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic substitution.

**Nucleophilic Substitution** involves the interaction of a nucleophile, which is an electron-rich species, with an electrophilic carbon atom. For instance, consider the reaction between ethyl bromide and sodium hydroxide. In this case, the hydroxide ion ($\text{OH}^-$) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromine atom from ethyl bromide, resulting in the formation of ethanol ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}$) and sodium bromide ($\text{NaBr}$).

Conversely, **Electrophilic Substitution** involves the attack of an electrophile, an electron-deficient species, on an aromatic ring. A typical example is the reaction between benzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_6$) and nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$). In this reaction, the nitronium ion ($\text{NO}_2^+$) acts as the electrophile, substituting a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring and yielding nitrobenzene ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NO}_2$).

Both nucleophilic and electrophilic substitution reactions play a crucial role in organic chemistry, serving as fundamental processes in the synthesis of a diverse array of organic compounds. A solid understanding of these reactions is essential for A-Level Biology students who are studying organic chemistry.
