An example of the aldehyde and ketone utilized in the Wittig reaction is benzaldehyde and acetone.

The Wittig reaction is a significant chemical transformation that converts a carbonyl compound—such as an aldehyde or ketone—into an alkene. This conversion is achieved through the use of a phosphorus ylide and a base. The reaction is named after its discoverer, Georg Wittig, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979 for his pioneering work on this reaction.

Benzaldehyde is classified as an aromatic aldehyde and has the chemical formula $C_6H_5CHO$. It is commonly employed as a flavoring agent and plays a vital role in the production of dyes and perfumes. In contrast, acetone is a ketone with the chemical formula $(CH_3)_2CO$. It is widely recognized as a common solvent and is utilized in the manufacture of numerous chemicals and plastics.

During the Wittig reaction, benzaldehyde can be transformed into stilbene, a compound characterized by two benzene rings linked by a double bond, through the reaction with a phosphorus ylide and a base. Similarly, acetone can serve as the carbonyl compound in the reaction, allowing for the synthesis of various alkenes depending on the specific phosphorus ylide employed.

In summary, the Wittig reaction stands out as a powerful tool for synthesizing alkenes from carbonyl compounds, making it extensively used in both organic chemistry research and industrial applications.
