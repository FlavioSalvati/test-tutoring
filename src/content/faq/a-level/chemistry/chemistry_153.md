The Pauling and Mulliken electronegativity scales are essential tools for measuring the relative attraction of atoms for electrons.

Electronegativity quantifies an atom's ability to attract electrons toward itself in a covalent bond. The Pauling electronegativity scale is grounded in the concept of bond dissociation energy, which refers to the energy necessary to break a chemical bond. An atom with a higher bond dissociation energy is considered more electronegative. The Pauling scale ranges from $0.7$ (for cesium) to $4.0$ (for fluorine).

In contrast, the Mulliken electronegativity scale is determined by averaging an atom's ionization energy and electron affinity. Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom, while electron affinity represents the energy released when an electron is added to an atom. The Mulliken scale spans from $0.5$ (for francium) to $3.98$ (for fluorine).

Both electronegativity scales are valuable for predicting the polarity of molecules and the direction of electron flow in chemical reactions. While the Pauling scale is more widely used in chemistry, the Mulliken scale tends to be favored in physics. It is crucial to understand that electronegativity is a relative property, meaning that the values assigned on each scale are not absolute but instead reflect relative differences in electron-attracting ability among atoms.
