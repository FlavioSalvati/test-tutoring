Electronegativity is defined as an element's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond, while polarity describes how electrons are distributed between two atoms in that bond.

Electronegativity serves as a quantitative measure of an atom's capability to draw electrons toward itself within a chemical bond. This property is influenced by several factors, including the number of protons in the nucleus and the distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons. Generally, elements with higher electronegativity values have a stronger tendency to attract electrons compared to those with lower values.

Conversely, polarity pertains to the manner in which electrons are shared between two atoms in a bond. A bond can be classified as nonpolar if the electrons are distributed equally between the two atoms, or as polar if the electrons are shared unequally. The polarity of a bond is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms involved.

As a general rule, the larger the difference in electronegativity between two atoms, the more polar the bond will be. For instance, the bond between hydrogen and chlorine is polar because chlorine exhibits a higher electronegativity than hydrogen. In contrast, a bond between two hydrogen atoms is nonpolar, as both atoms have identical electronegativity values.

In summary, electronegativity reflects an element's ability to attract electrons, whereas polarity indicates the distribution of those electrons between two bonded atoms. The greater the difference in electronegativity between two atoms, the more pronounced the polarity of the bond will be.
