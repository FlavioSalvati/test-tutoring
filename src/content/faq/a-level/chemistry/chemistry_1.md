The rate of a chemical reaction is influenced by several factors, one of the most significant being temperature. As temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the reactant molecules also rises. This increase in kinetic energy leads to more frequent and more energetic collisions between molecules, which ultimately results in an enhanced reaction rate.

The Arrhenius equation mathematically describes the relationship between the rate of reaction and temperature. It can be expressed as:

$$
k = A \cdot e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}
$$

In this equation, $k$ represents the rate constant of the reaction, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin. 

The activation energy, $E_a$, is defined as the minimum energy required for a reaction to proceed. As temperature rises, a greater proportion of the molecules possess the energy necessary to surpass the activation energy barrier. Consequently, this leads to an increased rate of reaction. 

The Arrhenius equation is particularly useful for calculating the rate constant at various temperatures and for determining the activation energy of a reaction. 

In summary, the rate of reaction increases with temperature due to the rise in kinetic energy of the molecules, as illustrated by the Arrhenius equation. This equation establishes a clear mathematical relationship between the rate constant, activation energy, and temperature, enabling calculations of reaction rates at different thermal conditions.
