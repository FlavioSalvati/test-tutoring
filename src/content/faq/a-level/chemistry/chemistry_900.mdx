One prominent example of chromatography utilized in organic analysis is gas chromatography.

Gas chromatography is a technique designed to separate and analyze volatile compounds present in a sample. The process begins with the injection of the sample into a column that contains a stationary phase. A carrier gas is then employed to propel the sample through the column. As the sample traverses the column, it interacts with the stationary phase, leading to the separation of different compounds based on their unique physical and chemical properties. Subsequently, these separated compounds are detected and identified using a detector, such as a mass spectrometer.

Another significant example of chromatography in organic analysis is liquid chromatography. This technique is particularly effective for separating and analyzing non-volatile compounds within a sample. Similar to gas chromatography, the sample is injected into a column filled with a stationary phase; however, in this case, a liquid solvent is used to drive the sample through the column. As the sample moves through the column, it interacts with the stationary phase, resulting in the separation of compounds according to their physical and chemical characteristics. The separated compounds are then detected and identified using a detector, such as a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

In summary, chromatography serves as a powerful tool in organic analysis, enabling scientists to efficiently separate and identify various compounds within a sample. By employing different chromatographic techniques, researchers can analyze a diverse array of organic compounds, ranging from volatile substances to non-volatile materials, and from small molecules to large biomolecules.
