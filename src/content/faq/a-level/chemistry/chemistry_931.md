DNA and RNA exhibit distinct differences in their structure, function, and chemical composition.

**DNA** (deoxyribonucleic acid) is structured as a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a sugar molecule known as deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C). DNA is primarily located in the nucleus of cells and serves as the repository of genetic information that is transmitted from one generation to the next. Prior to cell division, DNA replication occurs, ensuring that each daughter cell inherits a complete copy of the genetic code.

**RNA** (ribonucleic acid), on the other hand, is a single-stranded molecule comprised of nucleotides as well. Each nucleotide in RNA contains a sugar molecule called ribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), or cytosine (C). RNA is found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of cells, and it plays a vital role in the process of protein synthesis. There are three primary types of RNA: 

1. **Messenger RNA (mRNA)** - This type of RNA carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosome, where it is translated into a protein.
2. **Transfer RNA (tRNA)** - tRNA is responsible for transporting amino acids to the ribosome, where they are assembled into proteins.
3. **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)** - rRNA constitutes the ribosome, which is the site for protein synthesis.

In conclusion, DNA is a double-stranded molecule that functions as the carrier of genetic information, whereas RNA is a single-stranded molecule that is crucial for protein synthesis. Notably, DNA contains the nitrogenous base thymine (T), while RNA contains uracil (U) instead. Additionally, RNA demonstrates greater versatility than DNA, as its various types serve distinct functions within the cell.
