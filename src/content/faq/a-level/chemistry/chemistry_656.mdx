Proteins are composed of long chains of amino acids, which are intricately folded into complex three-dimensional structures.

Amino acids serve as the fundamental building blocks of proteins, and there are $20$ distinct types that can be combined in various sequences to create a protein. Each amino acid features a central carbon atom, known as the alpha carbon, which is bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a unique side chain. This side chain imparts specific properties to each amino acid, such as polarity, charge, and size.

When amino acids connect through peptide bonds, they form a polypeptide chain. The order of amino acids in this chain dictates the protein's primary structure. This chain subsequently folds into a specific three-dimensional shape, which is influenced by the interactions among the amino acid side chains and their surrounding environment. This folded configuration represents the protein's tertiary structure.

In some cases, proteins consist of multiple polypeptide chains, each possessing its own tertiary structure, that assemble to form a quaternary structure. The overall shape of a protein is crucial for its function, as it determines how the protein interacts with other molecules within the body.

Protein structure can be disrupted by changes in pH, temperature, or the presence of denaturants. When a protein loses its specific shape, it can no longer fulfill its biological function and is referred to as being denatured. Understanding protein structure is vital in fields such as medicine, biochemistry, and biotechnology, as it aids researchers in designing drugs and comprehending how proteins interact with one another and with other molecules in the body.
