Interhalogen compounds are molecules that result from the combination of two different halogens. The halogen group consists of the following elements: fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. These elements are highly reactive nonmetals that readily form compounds with other elements.

When two distinct halogens combine, they create interhalogen compounds. For example, chlorine and fluorine can form chlorofluoride ($\text{ClF}$), while iodine and bromine can yield iodine bromide ($\text{IBr}$). These interhalogen compounds exhibit unique properties that distinguish them from their constituent halogens, such as increased reactivity and lower boiling points.

Interhalogen compounds have a diverse range of applications. They are utilized as oxidizing agents, catalysts, and disinfectants, and they play a crucial role in the production of pharmaceuticals, plastics, and various industrial chemicals. The properties of these compounds can often be predicted based on the electronegativity of the halogens involved. For instance, when a more electronegative halogen combines with a less electronegative one, the resulting compound will typically possess a polar covalent bond and demonstrate higher reactivity.

In summary, interhalogen compounds arise from the combination of two distinct halogens and exhibit properties that differ from those of their parent halogens. Their unique characteristics enable a wide array of applications across various industries, and their behavior can often be anticipated by considering the electronegativity of the halogens involved.
