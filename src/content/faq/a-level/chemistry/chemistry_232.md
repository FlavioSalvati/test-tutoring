A thioester is a chemical compound characterized by the presence of a sulfur atom bonded to a carbonyl group ($C=O$). In contrast, an ester is defined as a compound where a carbonyl group is bonded to an oxygen atom ($O$).

Thioesters play a crucial role in biological systems, particularly in the metabolism of fatty acids. One notable thioester is acetyl-CoA, which is essential for the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA is produced through the reaction between coenzyme A (CoA) and acetyl chloride. This compound contains a thioester bond formed between the sulfur atom of CoA and the carbonyl group of acetyl.

Similarly, esters are significant in biological processes and are commonly found in lipids such as triglycerides and phospholipids. A well-known example of an ester is ethyl ethanoate, frequently used as a solvent and flavoring agent. Ethyl ethanoate is synthesized through the reaction of ethanol and ethanoic acid, resulting in an ester bond between the carbonyl group of ethanoic acid and the oxygen atom from ethanol.

In summary, both thioesters and esters represent important classes of compounds that have a wide range of biological and industrial applications.
