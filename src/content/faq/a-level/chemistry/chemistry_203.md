Interhalogen compounds are unique molecules created through the combination of two distinct halogen elements. 

Halogens, which are located in Group 7 of the periodic table, consist of non-metallic elements such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. These elements exhibit similar chemical characteristics, including high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions. When two different halogens interact, they result in the formation of an interhalogen compound. For instance, when chlorine and fluorine react, they produce chlorine trifluoride, denoted as $\text{ClF}_3$.

Interhalogen compounds serve various purposes in both industrial applications and scientific research. They are utilized as oxidizing agents, catalysts, and sources of halogens in various chemical reactions. A notable example is iodine monochloride ($\text{ICl}$), which is employed as a disinfectant and as a reagent in organic chemistry. Additionally, chlorine trifluoride ($\text{ClF}_3$) plays a critical role in semiconductor manufacturing and is also used as a rocket propellant.

In summary, interhalogen compounds arise from the combination of different halogen elements found in Group 7 of the periodic table. These compounds have diverse applications in industry and research, making them significant in the exploration of chemical reactions involving halogens.
