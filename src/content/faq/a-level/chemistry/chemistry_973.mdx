Oxidation refers to the loss of electrons, while reduction refers to the gain of electrons. These two processes are intertwined in what are known as redox reactions.

Redox reactions are chemical processes that involve the transfer of electrons between reactants. During these reactions, one reactant is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons, whereas another reactant is reduced, meaning it gains electrons. The reactant that loses electrons is referred to as the reducing agent, while the one that gains electrons is called the oxidizing agent.

Oxidation and reduction are opposite processes that occur simultaneously in redox reactions. Specifically, oxidation results in an increase in the oxidation state of an atom or molecule due to the loss of electrons, while reduction leads to a decrease in the oxidation state of an atom or molecule as it gains electrons.

These redox reactions play a crucial role in biological systems, as they are fundamental to many metabolic processes. For instance, in cellular respiration, glucose is oxidized to release energy, while in photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is reduced to synthesize glucose.

In summary, oxidation represents the loss of electrons, reduction signifies the gain of electrons, and redox reactions encompass both of these processes. These reactions are vital in biological systems, underpinning numerous metabolic functions.
