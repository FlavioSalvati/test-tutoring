Nucleophilic substitution reactions involving amides can take place with various nucleophiles, including hydroxide ions and amines.

Amides are characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group ($\text{C}= \text{O}$) and an amino group ($\text{NH}_2$) bonded to the same carbon atom. In nucleophilic substitution reactions, one nucleophile is replaced by another. Within the context of amides, the carbonyl group acts as the electrophilic site, being electron-deficient, and is susceptible to attack by a nucleophile. This interaction results in the formation of a new compound.

A notable example of nucleophilic substitution in amides is the hydrolysis reaction with hydroxide ions. In this process, the hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. Subsequently, this intermediate collapses, resulting in the cleavage of the carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bond and the production of a carboxylate ion along with an amine.

Another example involves the reaction of amides with amines, which can yield new amides. In this scenario, the amine attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. This intermediate then collapses, breaking the C-N bond and giving rise to a new amide.

In summary, the nucleophilic substitution of amides can generate a variety of compounds, including carboxylic acids, amine salts, and new amides. These reactions play a crucial role in the synthesis and degradation of biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.
