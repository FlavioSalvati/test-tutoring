Structural isomers and stereoisomers are two fundamental types of isomerism that arise from differences in atomic connectivity and spatial arrangements of atoms, respectively.

**Structural Isomers**  
Structural isomers, also referred to as constitutional isomers, share the same chemical formula but differ in how their atoms are bonded to one another. This variation in bonding results in different connectivity among the atoms. For instance, the coordination compound $$[\text{Co}(\text{NH}_3)_5\text{Cl}]\text{Cl}$$ can exhibit two structural isomers: $$\text{cis-}[\text{Co}(\text{NH}_3)_4\text{Cl}_2]^+$$ and $$\text{trans-}[\text{Co}(\text{NH}_3)_4\text{Cl}_2]^+$$. In the cis-isomer, two chloride ions are positioned adjacent to one another, while in the trans-isomer, they are located opposite each other.

**Stereoisomers**  
In contrast, stereoisomers possess the same connectivity of atoms but differ in their three-dimensional spatial arrangement. Although they share the same chemical formula and bonding structure, their distinct three-dimensional configurations lead to different properties. Stereoisomers can be categorized into two types: geometric isomers and optical isomers. Geometric isomers arise from different arrangements of ligands around a metal ion, often due to restricted rotation, while optical isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. For example, the coordination compound $$[\text{Co}(\text{en})_2\text{Cl}_2]^+$$ has two geometric isomers: $$\text{cis-}[\text{Co}(\text{en})_2\text{Cl}_2]^+$$ and $$\text{trans-}[\text{Co}(\text{en})_2\text{Cl}_2]^+$$, as well as two optical isomers: $$[\text{Co}(R,R-\text{en})_2\text{Cl}_2]^+$$ and $$[\text{Co}(S,S-\text{en})_2\text{Cl}_2]^+$$.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, the key distinction between structural isomers and stereoisomers in coordination compounds lies in their connectivity and spatial arrangement of atoms. Structural isomers differ in their atomic connectivity, while stereoisomers differ in their three-dimensional configurations. A solid understanding of these differences is essential for the study of coordination chemistry and its various applications.
