Chlorine interacts with water through a series of chemical reactions that lead to the formation of hypochlorous acid.

When chlorine is introduced into water, it reacts with water molecules to produce hypochlorous acid ($\text{HOCl}$) and hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$). This reaction, known as hydrolysis, represents the initial step in the disinfection process. Hypochlorous acid is a potent oxidizing agent capable of reacting with and destroying various microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses.

The effectiveness of chlorine as a disinfectant is influenced by the pH of the water. At a pH of $7.5$, approximately $80\%$ of the chlorine exists as hypochlorous acid, which is the most effective form for disinfection. As the pH rises above this level, the proportion of hypochlorous acid diminishes, leading to a decrease in the overall effectiveness of chlorine as a disinfectant.

Additionally, chlorine can react with organic matter present in the water, resulting in the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). These DBPs raise concerns because certain compounds within this category have been associated with negative health effects, including cancer and reproductive issues.

In summary, the chemical behavior of chlorine in water is intricate and is influenced by various factors, such as pH, temperature, and the presence of organic matter. While chlorine is recognized as an effective disinfectant, it is crucial to monitor and manage its application to minimize the formation of DBPs and ensure the safety of drinking water.
