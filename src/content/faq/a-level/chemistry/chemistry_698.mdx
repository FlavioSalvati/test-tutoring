There are several types of spectroscopy utilized in organic analysis, each possessing its own set of advantages and limitations.

**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**  
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy measures the absorption of infrared radiation by organic molecules. This technique is particularly effective for identifying functional groups and elucidating the structures of unknown compounds. However, it has limitations; for instance, it cannot detect certain functional groups that contain only carbon-carbon single bonds.

**Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**  
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy involves measuring the absorption of radiofrequency radiation by atomic nuclei placed in a magnetic field. This method is invaluable for determining the structure and purity of organic compounds, as well as for investigating molecular dynamics. Nonetheless, NMR can be costly and requires a high level of expertise to accurately interpret the results.

**Mass Spectrometry (MS)**  
Mass spectrometry (MS) works by ionizing organic molecules and measuring their mass-to-charge ratio. This technique is useful for identifying unknown compounds, determining molecular weights, and analyzing the fragmentation patterns of molecules. However, interpreting the results can be challenging and may require supplementary techniques to confirm the identity of a compound.

**Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy**  
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy measures the absorption of ultraviolet or visible radiation by organic molecules. It is effective for studying the electronic structure of molecules and determining the concentration of a compound in solution. Despite its usefulness, this technique is limited to compounds that exhibit conjugated double bonds and does not provide detailed structural information.
