An electrophile is defined as a positively charged or electron-deficient species that readily reacts with alkenes to form covalent bonds.

Electrophiles are attracted to the electron-rich double bond present in alkenes, which behaves as a nucleophile. When an electrophile approaches, it attacks the double bond, resulting in the breaking of the double bond and the formation of a new covalent bond with one of the carbon atoms. This interaction leads to the creation of a carbocation intermediate, which is characterized by its high reactivity and propensity to undergo further reactions.

A notable example of an electrophilic addition reaction involving alkenes is the reaction with hydrogen halides. In this process, the hydrogen halide molecule serves as the electrophile, with the hydrogen atom acting as the positively charged component. The hydrogen atom attacks the alkene's double bond, leading to the formation of a new covalent bond with one of the carbon atoms and the subsequent cleavage of the double bond. Following this, the halide ion attacks the carbocation intermediate, resulting in the formation of the final product.

Additional examples of electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes include interactions with halogens, such as bromine and chlorine, as well as reactions with protic acids like sulfuric acid and nitric acid. All of these reactions adhere to a similar general mechanism: the electrophile targets the double bond, generating a carbocation intermediate in the process.

In summary, a thorough understanding of electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes is crucial in organic chemistry, as it facilitates the synthesis of a diverse array of organic compounds.
