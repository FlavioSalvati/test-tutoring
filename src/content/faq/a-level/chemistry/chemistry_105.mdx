The equilibrium constant is a key parameter that quantifies the extent of a chemical reaction when it reaches equilibrium.

At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction. The equilibrium constant, denoted as $K_c$, is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants, with each concentration raised to the power of its corresponding stoichiometric coefficient. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
K_c = \frac{[\text{products}]}{[\text{reactants}]}
$$

The value of $K_c$ provides insight into the position of equilibrium. Specifically:

- If $K_c > 1$, the equilibrium favors the formation of products, suggesting that the forward reaction is more dominant.
- If $K_c < 1$, the equilibrium favors the reactants, indicating that the reverse reaction is more prevalent.
- If $K_c = 1$, the concentrations of reactants and products are equal, signifying that the system is at equilibrium.

Additionally, the equilibrium constant can be utilized to determine the concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium, provided the initial concentrations and the stoichiometry of the reaction are known. This capability is particularly valuable for predicting the yield of a reaction and for designing chemical processes.

In summary, the equilibrium constant serves as a quantitative measure of the extent of a chemical reaction at equilibrium, linking the concentrations of reactants and products. Its value not only indicates the position of equilibrium but also allows for the calculation of reactant and product concentrations at equilibrium.
