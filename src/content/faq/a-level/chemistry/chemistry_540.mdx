The thermodynamic stability of coordination complexes varies significantly with the type of ligands present.

The stability of a complex is primarily influenced by the strength of the bond formed between the ligand and the metal ion. Ligands can be categorized into different types based on their bonding capabilities with metal ions. Generally, the stability of a complex increases with the strength of the ligand-metal bond.

For instance, strong field ligands, such as cyanide ($\text{CN}^-$) and carbon monoxide ($\text{CO}$), form robust bonds with metal ions, resulting in greater thermodynamic stability compared to weak field ligands, like water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) and ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$). This enhanced stability arises because strong field ligands exhibit a superior ability to split the d-orbitals of the metal ion, leading to increased stabilization of the complex.

Moreover, the size and shape of the ligand also play crucial roles in influencing the thermodynamic stability of a complex. Bulky ligands, such as tertiary phosphines, can obstruct the approach of other ligands, which may ultimately reduce the overall stability of the complex.

In summary, the thermodynamic stability of a coordination complex is contingent upon the type of ligand and its capacity to form strong bonds with the metal ion. Strong field ligands are typically more thermodynamically stable than weak field ligands, and factors such as the size and shape of the ligand further contribute to the stability of the complex.
