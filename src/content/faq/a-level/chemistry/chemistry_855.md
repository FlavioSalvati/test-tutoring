Superconductivity varies among materials primarily due to differences in their crystal structures and electron behaviors.

Superconductivity is defined as the phenomenon where a material can conduct electricity with zero resistance when cooled to low temperatures. There are two main types of superconductors: Type I and Type II.

Type I superconductors, such as mercury and lead, possess a simple crystal structure. They exhibit a sudden transition to a state of zero resistance at a specific temperature known as the critical temperature, which is typically below $10 \, \text{K}$. These materials are also highly sensitive to magnetic fields, which can disrupt their superconducting state.

In contrast, Type II superconductors, including niobium-titanium and yttrium-barium-copper-oxide, feature a more complex crystal structure. They display a gradual reduction in resistance over a range of temperatures, with critical temperatures that can reach up to $135 \, \text{K}$. Type II superconductors have the unique ability to tolerate stronger magnetic fields and possess a layered crystal structure that enables the formation of vortices. These vortices can carry small amounts of electrical current without resistance, allowing for more robust superconducting properties.

Additionally, some materials, such as iron-based superconductors, can demonstrate characteristics of both Type I and Type II superconductors. The behavior of these materials is influenced by their composition and temperature, and their complex electron interactions are not yet fully understood.

In conclusion, the variations in superconductivity across different materials stem from their distinct crystal structures and electron behaviors. These factors influence critical temperature, tolerance to magnetic fields, and resistance characteristics.
