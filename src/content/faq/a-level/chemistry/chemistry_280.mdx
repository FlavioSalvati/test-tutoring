The reduction potential of an element quantifies its tendency to gain electrons during a redox reaction.

Redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between different species. The species that gains electrons is referred to as being reduced, whereas the species that loses electrons is described as being oxidized. Elements with a high reduction potential are more inclined to be reduced, while those with a low reduction potential are less likely to undergo reduction.

To compare the reduction potential of various elements, we use the standard hydrogen electrode as a reference point. The standard hydrogen electrode is assigned a reduction potential of $0$ volts, and the reduction potentials of all other elements are measured relative to this standard. For instance, the reduction potential of copper is $+0.34$ volts, whereas that of zinc is $-0.76$ volts. This indicates that copper is more likely to be reduced in a redox reaction compared to zinc.

Moreover, the reduction potential of an element can be influenced by its oxidation state. For example, the reduction potential of iron in the +2 oxidation state is $-0.44$ volts, while in the +3 oxidation state, it is $+0.77$ volts. This suggests that iron is more prone to reduction when in the +2 oxidation state than when it is in the +3 oxidation state.

In summary, the reduction potential serves as an indicator of an element's ability to gain electrons during redox reactions. By utilizing the standard hydrogen electrode, we can compare the reduction potentials of different elements, which can also vary depending on the oxidation state of the element.
