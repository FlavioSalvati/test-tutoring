Paramagnetic transition metal complexes contain unpaired electrons, whereas diamagnetic complexes have all their electrons paired.

Paramagnetic transition metal complexes exhibit unpaired electrons, which renders them susceptible to magnetic fields and enables them to be magnetized. This magnetism arises from the presence of one or more unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. Additionally, these complexes are often colored since the unpaired electrons can absorb light and transition to higher energy levels. Notable examples of paramagnetic complexes include $ \text{Fe}^{2+} $ and $ \text{Cu}^{2+} $.

Conversely, diamagnetic transition metal complexes have all their electrons paired. As a result, they are not attracted to magnetic fields and cannot be magnetized. The pairing of electrons in their d-orbitals leads to a net magnetic moment of zero. These complexes are frequently colorless, as they do not absorb light in the visible spectrum. Examples of diamagnetic complexes include $ \text{Zn}^{2+} $ and $ \text{Ni}^{2+} $.

In summary, the key distinction between paramagnetic and diamagnetic transition metal complexes lies in the presence or absence of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. This difference significantly influences their magnetic properties and color: paramagnetic complexes are attracted to magnetic fields and are often colored, while diamagnetic complexes are neither attracted to magnetic fields nor typically colored.
