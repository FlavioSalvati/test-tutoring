The Pauling and Mulliken electronegativity scales offer different perspectives on the electronegativity of elements, with the former based on bond energies and the latter on ionization energies.

The Pauling electronegativity scale, developed by Linus Pauling in 1932, posits that the electronegativity of an atom correlates with the energy necessary to break a bond between that atom and another atom. In this context, a higher bond dissociation energy indicates a more electronegative atom. Pauling assigned electronegativity values to elements ranging from $0.7$ for cesium to $4.0$ for fluorine.

Conversely, the Mulliken electronegativity scale, named after Robert Mulliken, is founded on the principle that an atom's electronegativity relates to the energy required to remove an electron from that atom. Similar to the Pauling scale, a higher ionization energy suggests a more electronegative atom. Mulliken's scale assigns values from $0.7$ for francium to $3.98$ for fluorine.

Although both scales are extensively utilized, the Pauling scale is predominantly favored in chemistry, while the Mulliken scale finds more application in physics. It is important to note that the two scales can yield slightly different electronegativity values for certain elements. For instance, the Pauling electronegativity of oxygen is $3.44$, which coincidentally matches the Mulliken electronegativity of oxygen, also measured at $3.44$.
