The influence of temperature on the spontaneity of chemical reactions is dependent on their activation energy.

For reactions characterized by low activation energy, an increase in temperature generally enhances the reaction rate and increases spontaneity. This occurs because higher temperatures provide greater kinetic energy to the reactant molecules, enabling them to more easily surpass the activation energy barrier. Consequently, these reactions tend to proceed more readily and spontaneously.

Conversely, for reactions with high activation energy, raising the temperature does not always result in increased spontaneity. In such cases, elevated temperatures may lead to the disintegration of reactant molecules before they can react, or they may cause the products to decompose back into their elemental components. As a result, for these reactions, increasing the temperature could lead to a decrease in spontaneity.

Moreover, it is important to note that some reactions have an optimal temperature at which spontaneity is maximized. At this specific temperature, the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction, establishing a dynamic equilibrium. Deviations from this optimal temperature, whether upwards or downwards, will shift the equilibrium either towards the reactants or the products, thereby reducing the overall spontaneity of the reaction.

In conclusion, the impact of temperature on the spontaneity of a reaction is contingent upon its activation energy and the particular conditions under which the reaction occurs.
