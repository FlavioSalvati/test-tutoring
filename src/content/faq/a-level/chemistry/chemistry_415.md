A selenide is a compound that contains selenium, whereas a sulfide is a compound that contains sulfur.

Both selenium and sulfur are nonmetals located in the same group of the periodic table, which grants them similar chemical properties. These elements can react with metals to form various compounds, many of which are utilized in industrial processes or serve as semiconductors.

For instance, cadmium selenide ($\text{CdSe}$) is a notable example of a selenide. This compound is a semiconductor material that plays a crucial role in the production of solar cells and other electronic devices. Another example is hydrogen selenide ($\text{H}_2\text{Se}$), which is a toxic gas that can be generated through the reaction of selenium with acids.

Sulfides are also prevalent both in nature and in various industrial applications. Iron sulfide ($\text{FeS}$) is a mineral commonly found in rocks and soils, and it serves as a source of sulfur for the manufacturing of sulfuric acid. Similarly, zinc sulfide ($\text{ZnS}$) appears as a white powder and is used as a pigment in paints and plastics, in addition to its applications in semiconductor production.

Both selenides and sulfides have significant biological roles as well. For example, the amino acid cysteine contains a sulfhydryl group ($-\text{SH}$) that can form disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues, which is essential for stabilizing protein structures. Additionally, selenium is an essential nutrient required for the function of certain enzymes in the body.
