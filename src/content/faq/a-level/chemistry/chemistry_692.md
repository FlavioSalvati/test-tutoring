Hydrolysis and complexation are prevalent reactions that occur in aqueous solutions.

**Hydrolysis** refers to a chemical reaction in which water is utilized to decompose a compound. This process takes place when a salt is dissolved in water, causing the water molecules to separate the salt into its constituent ions. For instance, when sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolves in water, it dissociates into sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$). The hydrolysis of NaCl serves as a straightforward example of a neutralization reaction.

On the other hand, **complexation** involves the chemical reaction in which a molecule or ion binds to a metal ion, resulting in the formation of a complex. This reaction occurs when a metal ion is dissolved in water and interacts with a ligand. For example, when copper(II) ions ($\text{Cu}^{2+}$) are dissolved in water, they can form a complex with ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), yielding the coordination complex [$\text{Cu}(\text{NH}_3)_4$]$^{2+}$. 

Both hydrolysis and complexation reactions play crucial roles in biological systems. Hydrolysis is essential for the degradation of macromolecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. In contrast, complexation is vital for the transport of metal ions within biological environments, such as the binding of iron to transferrin in the bloodstream.

In summary, hydrolysis and complexation are significant reactions that occur in aqueous solutions. Hydrolysis involves the decomposition of compounds through the action of water, while complexation pertains to the binding of molecules or ions to metal ions. These reactions are fundamental in biological systems, contributing to the breakdown of macromolecules and the transport of metal ions.
