The common ion effect influences the stability of complexes in varying ways, depending on the nature of the complexes involved.

Generally, the common ion effect refers to the decrease in the solubility of a salt when a common ion is introduced into the solution. When it comes to metal complexes, this effect can alter their stability based on whether the complexes are formed with weak or strong ligands.

For complexes that are formed with weak ligands, the common ion effect can enhance their stability. This occurs because the introduction of a common ion shifts the equilibrium toward the formation of the complex. By reducing the concentration of the free metal ion, the common ion increases the likelihood that the metal ion will bind to the ligand.

Conversely, for complexes involving strong ligands, the common ion effect can diminish their stability. Strong ligands exhibit a high affinity for the metal ion, and the presence of a common ion can compete with the ligand for binding sites on the metal ion. As a result, this competition can lead to a decrease in the concentration of the complex.

In summary, the common ion effect can significantly influence the stability of metal complexes. It is crucial to consider both the type of ligand and the metal ion involved when assessing the potential impact of this effect on stability.
