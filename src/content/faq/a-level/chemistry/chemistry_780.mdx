One key characteristic that differentiates various types of semiconductors is their band gap energy.

Semiconductors are materials that possess electrical conductivity that lies between that of conductors and insulators. The band gap energy is defined as the energy difference between the valence band (the highest energy level occupied by electrons) and the conduction band (the lowest energy level that electrons can occupy while still being able to conduct electricity).

Intrinsic semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, exhibit a small band gap energy, indicating that they require only a modest amount of energy to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. This property makes them particularly valuable for use in electronic devices, including transistors.

Extrinsic semiconductors are modified through the introduction of impurities, a process known as doping, to adjust their electrical properties. Depending on the dopants used, these semiconductors can exhibit either a larger or smaller band gap energy compared to their intrinsic counterparts. For instance, n-type semiconductors, which are doped with elements like phosphorus, gain additional electrons. This not only enhances their conductivity but also typically reduces their band gap energy. Conversely, p-type semiconductors are doped with elements such as boron, creating additional "holes" (or vacancies for electrons). This process generally decreases their conductivity while increasing their band gap energy.

The properties of semiconductors are essential for the design and functionality of electronic devices. Ongoing research is dedicated to developing new materials with tailored properties to enhance device performance.
