The enthalpy of formation refers to the energy change associated with the formation of one mole of a compound from its constituent elements in their standard states.

For instance, the enthalpy of formation of water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) is given as $-285.8 \, \text{kJ/mol}$. This indicates that when one mole of water is synthesized from its basic elements—hydrogen and oxygen—$285.8 \, \text{kJ}$ of energy is released. The negative sign signifies that this reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy into the surroundings.

Similarly, consider the enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), which is $-393.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}$. This value implies that the formation of one mole of carbon dioxide from its elemental components—carbon and oxygen—results in the release of $393.5 \, \text{kJ}$ of energy. Again, the negative sign indicates that this is also an exothermic reaction.

The enthalpy of formation is not only significant for individual compounds but can also be utilized to calculate the overall enthalpy change of a chemical reaction. By knowing the enthalpies of formation for both the reactants and the products, one can apply Hess's Law to determine the total enthalpy change of the reaction.

In summary, the concept of enthalpy of formation is crucial in the field of thermodynamics, as it helps to elucidate the energy transformations that occur during chemical reactions.
