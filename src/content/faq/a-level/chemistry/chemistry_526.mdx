Ligands play a crucial role in influencing the electron configuration of transition metals, leading to the formation of complex ions.

When transition metals interact with ligands, they create complex ions. This occurs because ligands donate a pair of electrons to the metal ion, resulting in the formation of a coordination sphere around the metal. As a consequence of this bonding, the electron configuration of the metal ion undergoes a transformation. For instance, the metal ion may lose some of its $d$-electrons to the ligands, causing the $d$-orbitals to split into two distinct energy levels. This phenomenon is referred to as ligand field splitting. The energy difference between these two levels is what determines the color of the complex ion.

The nature of the ligand that binds to the metal ion significantly influences the electron configuration as well. Ligands can be categorized as either strong-field or weak-field ligands. Strong-field ligands induce a greater extent of ligand field splitting compared to weak-field ligands. This results in a larger energy difference between the two levels for strong-field ligands, which consequently produces a more intense color for the complex ion. Additionally, the type of ligand affects the stability of the complex ion; strong-field ligands typically lead to the formation of more stable complex ions than their weak-field counterparts.

In summary, ligands impact the electron configuration of transition metals by facilitating the formation of complex ions. The specific type of ligand that binds with the metal ion determines the degree of ligand field splitting and influences the stability of the resulting complex ion.
