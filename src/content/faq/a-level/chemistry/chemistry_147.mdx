The boiling and melting points of alkenes are influenced by their molecular structure and size.

Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The boiling and melting points of these compounds are determined by the strength of the intermolecular forces acting between their molecules. Generally, larger alkene molecules exhibit stronger intermolecular forces, resulting in higher boiling and melting points.

For instance, ethene (C$_2$H$_4$) has a boiling point of $-103.7\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-169.4\,^{\circ}\text{C}$. This low temperature is attributed to ethene's small molecular size, which leads to relatively weak intermolecular forces. In contrast, propene (C$_3$H$_6$) displays a boiling point of $-47.6\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-185.2\,^{\circ}\text{C}$. As a larger molecule than ethene, propene possesses stronger intermolecular forces.

Continuing this trend, butene (C$_4$H$_8$) has a boiling point of $-6.3\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-185.2\,^{\circ}\text{C}$. Due to its increased size compared to propene, butene experiences even stronger intermolecular forces. This pattern persists; as the molecular size of alkenes increases, so do their boiling and melting points.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of alkenes are contingent upon their molecular size and structure. As the size of the alkene molecules increases, the strength of the intermolecular forces also increases, resulting in higher boiling and melting points.
