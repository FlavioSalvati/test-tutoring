Interhalogen compounds exhibit a wide range of reactivity and stability characteristics.

These compounds are formed by the combination of two distinct halogen elements. Their high reactivity can be attributed to the significant difference in electronegativity between the participating halogens. Specifically, the reactivity of interhalogen compounds is influenced by the size and electronegativity of the halogens involved. For instance, compounds that include fluorine tend to be more reactive compared to those that contain iodine. This heightened reactivity is primarily because fluorine is the most electronegative element, and its small atomic size facilitates bond formation.

The stability of interhalogen compounds is determined by the strength of the bonds formed between the two halogens. This bond strength is influenced by both the size and electronegativity of the halogens in the compound. Generally, larger halogens lead to weaker bonds and, consequently, less stable compounds. For example, compounds containing iodine are typically less stable than those containing fluorine. This reduced stability arises because the bond between two larger iodine atoms is weaker than the bond between two smaller fluorine atoms.

In summary, interhalogen compounds are characterized by their high reactivity, which stems from the differences in electronegativity between the halogens. Their reactivity is contingent upon the size and electronegativity of the halogens involved. Furthermore, the stability of these compounds is governed by the strength of the bonds between the halogens, which is also influenced by their size and electronegativity.
