Carboxylic acids exhibit a range of boiling and melting points that depend significantly on their molecular structure.

These organic compounds feature a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to a hydrocarbon chain. Several factors influence the boiling and melting points of carboxylic acids, including the length of the hydrocarbon chain, the presence of additional functional groups, and the strength of intermolecular forces.

Short-chain carboxylic acids, such as formic acid ($\text{HCOOH}$) and acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$), tend to have lower boiling and melting points than their long-chain counterparts. This phenomenon occurs because short-chain carboxylic acids experience weaker intermolecular forces due to their smaller molecular size.

In contrast, carboxylic acids that contain functional groups such as alcohols, amines, or halogens generally exhibit higher boiling and melting points. The presence of these functional groups enhances the strength of intermolecular forces, leading to elevated thermal properties.

For instance, 2-chlorobenzoic acid ($\text{C}_7\text{H}_5\text{ClO}_2$) displays a higher boiling and melting point than benzoic acid ($\text{C}_7\text{H}_6\text{O}_2$) due to the inclusion of a chlorine atom, which contributes to stronger intermolecular interactions.

Overall, carboxylic acids typically have higher boiling and melting points when compared to alkanes and alkenes. This increase in thermal stability is primarily attributed to the presence of the polar carboxyl group, which significantly enhances the strength of intermolecular forces in these compounds.
