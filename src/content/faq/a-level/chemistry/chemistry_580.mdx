Carboranes and boranes are types of cluster compounds composed of atoms bonded together in a specific arrangement. Carboranes consist of clusters made up of carbon, boron, and hydrogen atoms, whereas boranes are clusters formed exclusively from boron and hydrogen atoms.

Both carboranes and boranes are classified as cluster compounds, which are defined as molecules comprised of multiple atoms or ions. The key distinction lies in their composition: carboranes include both carbon and boron atoms, while boranes contain only boron and hydrogen. Carboranes can be categorized as "closo" or "nido," depending on the number of vertices present in the cluster. In contrast, boranes are typically classified into "closo," "nido," or "arachno" based on their geometric structure.

One significant difference between carboranes and boranes is their stability. Carboranes are generally more stable than boranes, primarily due to the presence of carbon atoms. These carbon atoms provide additional bonding sites that enhance the structural integrity of the cluster. Conversely, boranes are known for their high reactivity; they can readily decompose or react with other substances.

Furthermore, carboranes and boranes exhibit distinct physical and chemical properties. Carboranes are typically more soluble in organic solvents and show lower reactivity toward acids and bases compared to boranes. They also possess higher melting and boiling points and demonstrate greater resistance to oxidation. On the other hand, boranes are often highly reactive and are frequently utilized as reducing agents or catalysts in various chemical reactions.

In summary, both carboranes and boranes are significant types of cluster compounds, each with unique properties and applications in the fields of chemistry and materials science.
