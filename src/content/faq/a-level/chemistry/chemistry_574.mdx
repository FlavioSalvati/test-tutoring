The distinctions between anti-Markovnikov and Markovnikov additions lie primarily in the manner in which a hydrogen atom is added to a carbon-carbon double bond.

In a Markovnikov addition, the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon atom that already has the greatest number of hydrogen atoms attached. This phenomenon occurs due to the electrophilic addition mechanism, where a positively charged hydrogen ion is attracted to the negatively charged carbon atom. Consequently, the other carbon atom in the double bond receives the remaining atom or group.

Conversely, in an anti-Markovnikov addition, the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon atom with the fewest hydrogen atoms attached. This process is governed by a radical addition mechanism, where the hydrogen atom is preferentially added to the carbon atom with the highest availability of electrons. Again, the other carbon atom in the double bond is bonded to the remaining atom or group.

Anti-Markovnikov addition is typically facilitated by the use of radical initiators, such as peroxides. These compounds generate free radicals that can effectively add to the double bond. This type of addition is particularly significant in the synthesis of alcohols, where the anti-Markovnikov product is often the desired outcome.

In contrast, Markovnikov addition is more frequently observed in electrophilic addition reactions, such as the addition of hydrogen halides to alkenes. This addition is crucial for the synthesis of alkyl halides, where the Markovnikov product is typically sought after.

In summary, Markovnikov addition refers to the process where hydrogen attaches to the carbon atom with more hydrogen atoms in an alkene bond, following an electrophilic addition mechanism. In contrast, anti-Markovnikov addition results in hydrogen being added to the carbon atom that is less hydrogen-rich, via a radical addition mechanism often initiated by peroxides. While Markovnikov's rule is instrumental in the formation of alkyl halides, the anti-Markovnikov approach is essential for synthesizing alcohols.
