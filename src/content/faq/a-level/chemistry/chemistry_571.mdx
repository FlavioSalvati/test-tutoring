Metals exhibit a range of distinctive properties that set them apart from non-metals.

Metals are elements characterized by their shiny appearance, malleability, ductility, and excellent conductivity of heat and electricity. Typically, metals possess high melting and boiling points, and they are solid at room temperature, with the notable exception of mercury, which is liquid. Additionally, metals have a tendency to lose electrons easily, which makes them effective reducing agents.

In contrast, non-metals lack many of the properties associated with metals. They are generally dull in appearance, brittle, and poor conductors of heat and electricity. Non-metals typically have low melting and boiling points and can exist in all three states of matter—solid, liquid, and gas—at room temperature. Moreover, non-metals tend to gain electrons easily, which qualifies them as good oxidizing agents.

A key difference between metals and non-metals lies in their electron configuration. Metals usually have a small number of electrons in their outermost shell, which they readily lose to form positively charged ions, while non-metals have nearly complete outermost shells and tend to gain electrons to form negatively charged ions.

Reactivity is another area where metals and non-metals diverge significantly. Metals are generally more reactive, as they readily lose electrons to form positive ions. In contrast, non-metals are typically less reactive, as they preferentially gain electrons to form negative ions.

In conclusion, metals and non-metals possess distinct properties that differentiate them from one another. A clear understanding of these properties is essential for the study of chemistry and biology.
