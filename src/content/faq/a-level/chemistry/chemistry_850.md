Electrophilic addition is a fundamental reaction mechanism in organic chemistry, characterized by the addition of an electrophile to a molecule.

In this process, an electrophile—defined as an electron-deficient species—is attracted to a molecule with a double bond. Upon interaction, the electrophile attacks the double bond, resulting in its cleavage and the formation of two new single bonds. This mechanism effectively incorporates the electrophile into the molecule. Typically, the reaction occurs in the presence of a catalyst, which may be a strong acid or a metal catalyst, to facilitate the process.

Alkynes exhibit heightened reactivity towards electrophilic addition due to their triple bond. The triple bond comprises two pi bonds, which are more easily broken compared to the single pi bond found in alkenes. Consequently, alkynes are more prone to undergoing electrophilic addition reactions than alkenes.

A notable example of electrophilic addition involving alkynes is the reaction with hydrogen halides, such as hydrogen chloride ($\text{HCl}$). In this scenario, the hydrogen halide serves as the electrophile, adding across the triple bond and yielding a halogenated alkene. This reaction plays a vital role in the production of plastics and various industrial chemicals.

In summary, electrophilic addition is a crucial reaction mechanism in organic chemistry, especially for the synthesis of complex molecules. Alkynes, with their reactive triple bonds, are particularly valuable as building blocks in organic synthesis, enabling the development of diverse chemical products.
