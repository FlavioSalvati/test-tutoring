The acid-base equilibrium refers to the balance between the concentrations of hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) and hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) in a solution. This equilibrium is crucial for maintaining pH levels in aqueous solutions.

Acids are defined as substances that release hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) when dissolved in water, whereas bases release hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$). The relative concentrations of these ions determine whether a solution is acidic, neutral, or basic. The pH scale quantifies the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution: a pH of 7 indicates neutrality, values below 7 indicate acidity, and values above 7 indicate basicity.

The acid-base equilibrium is a dynamic process, characterized by the continual variation in the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions as acids and bases interact. Factors such as the addition of more acid or base, or variations in temperature or pressure, can shift this equilibrium.

Buffer solutions play a vital role in sustaining acid-base equilibrium in biological systems. These solutions resist significant changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are introduced. This property is essential for maintaining the pH of bodily fluids, such as blood, which must remain within a narrow range to ensure proper physiological function.

In summary, the concept of acid-base equilibrium is fundamental in both chemistry and biology, with significant implications for the pH stability of aqueous solutions.
