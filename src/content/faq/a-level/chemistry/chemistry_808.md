Superconductors are remarkable materials that exhibit zero electrical resistance and can conduct electricity with 100% efficiency when cooled below a specific temperature known as the critical temperature, denoted as $T_c$. This phenomenon, called superconductivity, occurs due to the formation of Cooper pairsâ€”pairs of electrons that move through the material as a single quantum entity. In addition to zero resistance, superconductors also display the Meissner effect, which is the expulsion of magnetic fields from the material once it transitions into the superconducting state.

Superconductors distinguish themselves from conventional materials in several significant ways. First, their zero electrical resistance allows them to conduct electricity without any energy loss, making them highly efficient for applications in power transmission and electrical storage. Second, superconductors can carry substantially higher currents than ordinary conductors without overheating or dissipating energy, which is particularly advantageous in technologies such as MRI machines and particle accelerators. Lastly, superconductors possess unique magnetic properties, including the ability to levitate in the presence of a magnetic field, offering exciting prospects for advancements in transportation and energy storage solutions.

In summary, superconductors are exceptional materials characterized by their zero electrical resistance and their capability to conduct electricity with 100% efficiency at low temperatures. Their unique properties make them valuable for a wide range of applications, including power transmission, electrical storage, and medical imaging technologies.
