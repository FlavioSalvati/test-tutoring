An example of an alkane is methane, whereas an example of an alkene is ethene.

Alkanes are a class of hydrocarbons that exclusively contain single bonds between carbon atoms. Methane, denoted as $CH_4$, is the simplest alkane, consisting of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. It appears as a colorless and odorless gas and serves as the primary component of natural gas. Generally, alkanes exhibit low reactivity due to the strong carbon-carbon ($C-C$) and carbon-hydrogen ($C-H$) bonds.

On the other hand, alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. Ethene, also known as ethylene and represented as $C_2H_4$, is the simplest alkene, composed of two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms. This compound is a colorless gas that is widely utilized in the production of plastics, solvents, and various chemicals. Alkenes are typically more reactive than alkanes, primarily due to the presence of the double bond, which allows them to participate in addition reactions with other molecules.

In summary, methane ($CH_4$) exemplifies an alkane, while ethene ($C_2H_4$) exemplifies an alkene. Alkanes feature only single bonds between carbon atoms and are generally unreactive, whereas alkenes possess at least one double bond between carbon atoms and demonstrate greater reactivity.
