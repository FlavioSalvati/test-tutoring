A positive change in free energy indicates an endergonic reaction, while a negative change signifies an exergonic reaction.

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds, which necessitates the input or release of energy. The change in free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$, is key in determining whether a reaction is energetically favorable. Specifically, a negative $\Delta G$ indicates that the reaction is exergonic, meaning it releases energy. This released energy can be utilized to perform work, such as powering various cellular processes. For instance, during cellular respiration, the breakdown of glucose yields a negative $\Delta G$, releasing energy that is subsequently harnessed to produce ATP.

Conversely, a positive $\Delta G$ signifies that the reaction is endergonic, implying that it requires an input of energy to proceed. This energy is commonly supplied by ATP, which is hydrolyzed to furnish the necessary energy. An illustrative example of an endergonic reaction is the synthesis of glucose during photosynthesis. This process requires energy from sunlight, which is captured by chlorophyll and utilized to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water.

While exergonic reactions are generally favorable, endergonic reactions are essential for vital processes such as growth and repair. By coupling endergonic reactions with exergonic ones, cells can maintain a continuous supply of ATP to fuel their metabolic activities. In summary, the change in free energy for a reaction is a crucial determinant of its feasibility and significance within biological systems.
