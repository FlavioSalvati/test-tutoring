The solubility and basicity of alkaline earth metal hydroxides differ significantly among the elements of this group.

Alkaline earth metals belong to Group 2 of the periodic table and include beryllium ($\text{Be}$), magnesium ($\text{Mg}$), calcium ($\text{Ca}$), strontium ($\text{Sr}$), barium ($\text{Ba}$), and radium ($\text{Ra}$). When these metals react with water, they produce hydroxides that exhibit basic characteristics. However, the degree of solubility and the strength of basicity of these hydroxides vary depending on which alkaline earth metal is involved.

Beryllium hydroxide ($\text{Be(OH)}_2$) is the least soluble and the least basic among all alkaline earth metal hydroxides. It is classified as amphoteric, meaning it can function as both an acid and a base. Magnesium hydroxide ($\text{Mg(OH)}_2$), on the other hand, is only slightly soluble and possesses weak basic properties. It is commonly utilized as an antacid and laxative.

Calcium hydroxide ($\text{Ca(OH)}_2$), often referred to as slaked lime, has moderate solubility and exhibits strong basic properties. It finds application in various fields, including construction, agriculture, and water treatment. Strontium hydroxide ($\text{Sr(OH)}_2$) is more soluble than calcium hydroxide and shares similar basic characteristics. 

Barium hydroxide ($\text{Ba(OH)}_2$) stands out due to its high solubility and the strongest basic properties among the alkaline earth metal hydroxides. It is frequently employed in the production of various chemicals and serves as a reagent in laboratory settings.

In conclusion, the solubility and basicity of alkaline earth metal hydroxides are dependent on the specific element involved. Beryllium hydroxide is characterized by its low solubility and basicity, while barium hydroxide is notable for its high solubility and strong basic properties.
