**Example: What Are the Properties of Different Types of Glass?**

Glass is a solid material characterized by its lack of a crystalline structure. It finds application in numerous areas, such as windows, lenses, and containers. The specific properties of glass vary based on its chemical composition and structural characteristics.

**Soda-Lime Glass**  
Soda-lime glass is the most prevalent type of glass, commonly used in windows and bottles. Its composition includes silica, sodium oxide, and calcium oxide. This type of glass is transparent and has a relatively low melting point, which facilitates shaping. However, it is also brittle, making it susceptible to breakage.

**Borosilicate Glass**  
Borosilicate glass contains boron oxide, which imparts a low coefficient of thermal expansion. This property allows it to endure rapid temperature fluctuations without cracking. As a result, borosilicate glass is widely utilized in laboratory equipment, cookware, and lighting fixtures.

**Lead Glass**  
Also referred to as crystal, lead glass contains lead oxide, which contributes to its high refractive index and brilliant sparkle. This type of glass is commonly used in fine glassware, including wine glasses and chandeliers. However, lead glass tends to be heavy and more expensive than other types.

**Tempered Glass**  
Tempered glass is produced by a process of heating followed by rapid cooling, which strengthens the material. It is utilized in applications such as car windows, shower doors, and smartphone screens. Tempered glass is more robust than standard glass and, when it breaks, it shatters into small, rounded pieces, thereby minimizing the risk of injury.

In summary, the properties of various types of glass are influenced by their chemical composition and structure. Soda-lime glass is transparent and easy to shape but is brittle. In contrast, borosilicate glass can withstand rapid temperature changes. Lead glass is known for its weight and expense but offers a high refractive index, while tempered glass is both stronger and safer than ordinary glass.
