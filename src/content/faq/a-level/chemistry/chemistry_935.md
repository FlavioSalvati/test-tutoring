Paramagnetic transition metal complexes are characterized by the presence of unpaired electrons, whereas diamagnetic complexes have all their electrons paired.

Paramagnetic transition metal complexes possess one or more unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. This results in a net magnetic moment, causing these complexes to be attracted to an external magnetic field and allowing them to be magnetized. Furthermore, the presence of unpaired electrons contributes to their coloration, as these electrons can absorb light and transition to higher energy levels. Notable examples of paramagnetic complexes include $ \text{Fe}^{2+} $ and $ \text{Cu}^{2+} $.

In contrast, diamagnetic transition metal complexes have all of their electrons paired. This complete pairing results in a net magnetic moment of zero, meaning these complexes are not attracted to a magnetic field and cannot be magnetized. Diamagnetic complexes are typically colorless, as they do not absorb light in the visible spectrum. Common examples of diamagnetic complexes include $ \text{Zn}^{2+} $ and $ \text{Ni}^{2+} $.

In summary, the primary distinction between paramagnetic and diamagnetic transition metal complexes lies in the presence or absence of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. This fundamental difference influences their magnetic properties and coloration: paramagnetic complexes are attracted to magnetic fields and are often colored, while diamagnetic complexes lack this attraction and are generally colorless.
