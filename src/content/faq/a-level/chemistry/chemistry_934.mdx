### Example of pH in Acid-Base Equilibria

The pH of an acid-base equilibrium is influenced by the relative strengths of the acids and bases involved. For instance, a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) will yield a low pH, whereas a weak acid such as acetic acid (CH₃COOH) will result in a higher pH.

1. **Strong Acid - Strong Base Equilibrium:**
   In the case of a strong acid-strong base equilibrium, such as that between HCl and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the resulting pH will be neutral, specifically at $7$. This neutrality occurs because both the strong acid and the strong base fully dissociate into their respective ions: H⁺ and Cl⁻ from HCl, and Na⁺ and OH⁻ from NaOH, leading to a balanced solution.

2. **Weak Acid - Strong Base Equilibrium:**
   When examining a weak acid-strong base equilibrium, such as acetic acid reacting with NaOH, the pH will be basic. This is due to the weak acid only partially dissociating into its ions, which leads to a higher concentration of OH⁻ ions contributed by the strong base, consequently raising the pH.

3. **Strong Acid - Weak Base Equilibrium:**
   In a strong acid-weak base equilibrium, like that between HCl and ammonia (NH₃), the pH will be acidic. This occurs because the strong acid completely dissociates into H⁺ ions, resulting in an increased concentration of H⁺ ions, which lowers the pH.

4. **Weak Acid - Weak Base Equilibrium:**
   Finally, in a weak acid-weak base equilibrium, such as acetic acid combined with ammonia, the pH will depend on the relative strengths of the acid and the base. If the acid is stronger than the base, the solution will be acidic; conversely, if the base is stronger than the acid, the solution will be basic.

In summary, the behavior of pH in acid-base equilibria is a direct reflection of the strength and dissociation characteristics of the acids and bases involved.
