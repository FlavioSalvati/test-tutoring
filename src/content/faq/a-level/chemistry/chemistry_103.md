The entropy of a reaction is a crucial factor in determining its spontaneity.

Entropy, denoted as $S$, is a measure of the disorder or randomness within a system. In the context of chemical reactions, the change in entropy, represented as $\Delta S$, is calculated by comparing the entropy of the products to that of the reactants. If the products possess a higher entropy than the reactants, the reaction is said to have a positive $\Delta S$ value, indicating a greater likelihood of spontaneity.

For instance, consider the combustion of wood. This reaction exhibits a positive $\Delta S$ because the reactants—wood and oxygen—have relatively low entropy compared to the products, which include carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ash, all of which possess higher entropy. Consequently, this reaction is spontaneous and can occur without requiring external energy input.

Conversely, the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide results in a negative $\Delta S$ value. In this case, the reactants have higher entropy than the products, which consist of salt and water. As a result, this reaction is non-spontaneous and necessitates external energy input for it to proceed.

In summary, the entropy change of a reaction plays a vital role in assessing its spontaneity and the energy requirements for its occurrence.
