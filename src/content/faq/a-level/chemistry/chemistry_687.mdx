A thiol is a type of compound that contains a sulfhydryl group, denoted as $-SH$, whereas an alcohol is characterized by the presence of a hydroxyl group, $-OH$. For example, cysteine serves as a representative thiol, while ethanol exemplifies an alcohol.

Cysteine is an amino acid that features a thiol group in its side chain. This amino acid plays a crucial role in the structure of many proteins, as it can form disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues, which helps to stabilize the overall protein structure. Additionally, cysteine is significant in redox reactions, functioning as a reducing agent by donating electrons to other molecules.

On the other hand, ethanol is a simple alcohol widely utilized as a solvent and fuel. It is generated through the fermentation of sugars by yeast or bacteria and also occurs as a byproduct of carbohydrate metabolism in the human body. Ethanol is classified as a psychoactive substance; when consumed in excessive quantities, it can lead to intoxication and is often used recreationally.

In summary, both thiol and alcohol groups are vital functional groups in organic chemistry, with numerous applications across biology, medicine, and industry. A thorough understanding of their properties and reactivity is essential for comprehending various biological processes and for the development of new drugs and materials.
