### Example of the Electron Configuration of a Transition Element

The electron configuration of a transition element describes the arrangement of electrons within its atomic orbitals.

Transition elements are defined as those elements that possess partially filled $d$ orbitals in their ground state. These elements occupy the central portion of the periodic table, situated between the main group elements and the inner transition elements. Notable examples of transition elements include iron, copper, and zinc.

To determine the electron configuration of a transition element, we can apply the Aufbau principle. This principle dictates that electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first. For instance, the electron configuration of iron (Fe) is represented as:

$$
\text{Fe}: 1s^2 \, 2s^2 \, 2p^6 \, 3s^2 \, 3p^6 \, 4s^2 \, 3d^6
$$

This notation indicates that iron has two electrons in the $1s$ orbital, two electrons in the $2s$ orbital, six electrons in the $2p$ orbital, two electrons in the $3s$ orbital, two electrons in the $3p$ orbital, two electrons in the $4s$ orbital, and six electrons in the $3d$ orbital.

The presence of partially filled $d$ orbitals in transition elements enables them to readily form complex ions and compounds. These compounds often display distinctive properties, including vibrant colors, magnetic characteristics, and catalytic activity.

In summary, the electron configuration of a transition element can be accurately determined using the Aufbau principle. The unique characteristic of having partially filled $d$ orbitals makes transition elements particularly valuable in various applications.
