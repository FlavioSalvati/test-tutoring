Alkaline earth metal hydroxides are both soluble and basic compounds.

These hydroxides are formed when alkaline earth metals react with water. Generally, their solubility in water increases with the atomic number of the metal. For instance, magnesium hydroxide ($\text{Mg(OH)}_2$) is only slightly soluble in water, whereas barium hydroxide ($\text{Ba(OH)}_2$) exhibits high solubility.

The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides can be attributed to their basic properties. When dissolved in water, these hydroxides dissociate to release hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$), which then interact with water molecules to create a basic solution. The basicity of these hydroxides tends to increase with the atomic number of the metal, primarily due to the enhanced polarizability of the metal ion.

The basic characteristics of alkaline earth metal hydroxides render them valuable in various applications. For example, calcium hydroxide ($\text{Ca(OH)}_2$), commonly known as slaked lime, is utilized in agriculture to neutralize acidic soils and in construction for making mortar. Additionally, magnesium hydroxide ($\text{Mg(OH)}_2$) serves as an effective antacid for neutralizing stomach acid, while barium hydroxide ($\text{Ba(OH)}_2$) is employed in analytical chemistry to detect sulfates.

In conclusion, alkaline earth metal hydroxides are characterized by their solubility and basicity, both of which increase with the atomic number of the metal. Their basic nature makes them essential in a wide range of applications, spanning agriculture, medicine, and analytical chemistry.
