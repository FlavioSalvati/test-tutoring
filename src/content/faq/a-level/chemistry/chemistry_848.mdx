The Nernst equation provides a valuable tool for calculating the potential of a redox reaction under non-standard conditions.

### Example Reaction
Consider the redox reaction:

$$
\text{Fe}^{2+} + 2 \text{e}^- \rightarrow \text{Fe(s)}
$$

The standard reduction potential ($E^\circ$) for this reaction is $-0.44 \, \text{V}$. However, if the concentration of $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ ions deviates from $1 \, \text{M}$, the potential of the reaction will also change. The Nernst equation can be utilized to determine this adjusted potential:

$$
E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln(Q)
$$

where:
- $E$ is the potential of the reaction,
- $E^\circ$ is the standard reduction potential,
- $R$ is the universal gas constant ($8.314 \, \text{J/(mol K)}$),
- $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin,
- $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction,
- $F$ is Faraday's constant ($96485 \, \text{C/mol}$),
- $Q$ is the reaction quotient.

### Calculation
For the reaction involving $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ ions at a concentration of $0.1 \, \text{M}$ and at a temperature of $25^\circ \text{C}$ (which is $298 \, \text{K}$), we can calculate the potential as follows:

Given:
- $E^\circ = -0.44 \, \text{V}$
- $T = 298 \, \text{K}$
- $n = 2$ (since $2 \, \text{e}^-$ are transferred)
- The reaction quotient $Q$ is $\frac{[\text{Fe}^{2+}]}{[\text{Fe}]} = \frac{0.1}{1} = 0.1$ (assuming solid iron does not contribute to the reaction quotient)

Substituting these values into the Nernst equation:

$$
E = -0.44 \, \text{V} - \frac{(8.314 \, \text{J/(mol K)})(298 \, \text{K})}{(2)(96485 \, \text{C/mol})} \ln(0.1)
$$

Calculating the term:

$$
\frac{(8.314)(298)}{(2)(96485)} \approx 0.0257 \, \text{V}
$$

Thus,

$$
E \approx -0.44 \, \text{V} - (0.0257 \, \text{V})(\ln(0.1))
$$

Calculating $\ln(0.1)$, we find:

$$
\ln(0.1) \approx -2.302
$$

Plugging this value into the equation gives:

$$
E \approx -0.44 \, \text{V} - (0.0257 \, \text{V})(-2.302)
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
E \approx -0.44 \, \text{V} + 0.0592 \, \text{V}
$$

Calculating the final potential:

$$
E \approx -0.49 \, \text{V}
$$

### Conclusion
This result indicates that the reaction is less favorable at a concentration of $0.1 \, \text{M}$ of $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ ions compared to standard conditions. The Nernst equation is applicable to any redox reaction, allowing for the determination of potential under varied conditions.
