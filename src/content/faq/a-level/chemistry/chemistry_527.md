The boiling and melting points of alkanes rise as their molecular size increases.

Alkanes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. The boiling and melting points of these compounds are influenced by their molecular size and shape. As the size of the alkane molecule increases, both the boiling and melting points tend to increase as well, primarily due to the enhancement of intermolecular forces among the molecules.

For instance, methane ($\text{CH}_4$) has a boiling point of $-161.5\,^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-182.5\,^\circ\text{C}$. This low temperature range is attributed to methane being a small molecule with relatively weak intermolecular forces, which means that it requires less energy to overcome these forces and separate the molecules.

In contrast, pentane ($\text{C}_5\text{H}_{12}$) exhibits a boiling point of $36.1\,^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-129.8\,^\circ\text{C}$. The larger size of pentane contributes to stronger intermolecular forces, necessitating more energy to break these interactions compared to methane.

Similarly, decane ($\text{C}_{10}\text{H}_{22}$) has a boiling point of $174.1\,^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-29.7\,^\circ\text{C}$. As an even larger molecule, decane experiences stronger intermolecular forces, which means it requires even more energy to disrupt the interactions between its molecules.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of alkanes consistently increase with increasing molecular size, a trend that can be attributed to the corresponding increase in intermolecular forces that must be overcome.
