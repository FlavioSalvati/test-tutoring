Alloys exhibit distinct physical properties when compared to pure metals.

An alloy is defined as a mixture comprising two or more metals or a combination of a metal with a non-metal. The unique properties of alloys arise from variations in their crystal structures and compositions. Alloys typically demonstrate enhanced strength, hardness, and durability relative to their pure metal counterparts. This enhancement occurs because the introduction of an additional metal or non-metal alters the atomic arrangement within the crystal lattice, thereby impeding the movement of atomic layers. Consequently, this leads to the formation of stronger and harder materials.

Moreover, alloys possess different melting and boiling points when contrasted with pure metals. The incorporation of another metal or non-metal can either elevate or lower the melting and boiling points of the alloy. For instance, when carbon is added to iron, the resulting material, steel, boasts a higher melting point than that of pure iron. This characteristic makes steel particularly advantageous for applications requiring high-temperature resistance.

Alloys also demonstrate variations in electrical and thermal conductivity compared to pure metals. The addition of another element can significantly influence the electrical and thermal conductivity of the alloy, either enhancing or diminishing these properties. For example, adding copper to gold produces an alloy with greater electrical conductivity than pure gold, making it more suitable for applications such as electrical wiring.

In conclusion, alloys possess distinct physical properties compared to pure metals, primarily due to alterations in their crystal structures and compositions. These differences manifest as enhanced strength, hardness, and durability, along with varying melting and boiling points, as well as changes in electrical and thermal conductivity.
