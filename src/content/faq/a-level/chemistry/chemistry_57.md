The solubility and basicity of alkaline earth metal hydroxides exhibit significant variation among the different elements.

Alkaline earth metals comprise the second group of the periodic table, which includes beryllium ($\text{Be}$), magnesium ($\text{Mg}$), calcium ($\text{Ca}$), strontium ($\text{Sr}$), barium ($\text{Ba}$), and radium ($\text{Ra}$). When these metals react with water, they produce hydroxides that are inherently basic. However, the degree of solubility and the strength of basicity of these hydroxides differ depending on the specific metal involved.

Beryllium hydroxide ($\text{Be(OH)}_2$) is the least soluble and least basic of all the alkaline earth metal hydroxides. It is classified as amphoteric, meaning it can function as both an acid and a base. In contrast, magnesium hydroxide ($\text{Mg(OH)}_2$) has limited solubility and exhibits weak basic properties; it is commonly utilized as an antacid and laxative.

Calcium hydroxide ($\text{Ca(OH)}_2$), also referred to as slaked lime, is moderately soluble and possesses strong basic characteristics. Its applications span various fields, including construction, agriculture, and water treatment. Strontium hydroxide ($\text{Sr(OH)}_2$) is more soluble than calcium hydroxide and displays similar basic properties. On the other hand, barium hydroxide ($\text{Ba(OH)}_2$) is highly soluble and exhibits the strongest basic properties among the alkaline earth metal hydroxides. It is frequently used in the production of various chemicals and as a reagent in laboratory settings.

In summary, the solubility and basicity of alkaline earth metal hydroxides vary significantly based on the specific element. Beryllium hydroxide is characterized by its low solubility and basicity, while barium hydroxide stands out for its high solubility and robust basic properties.
