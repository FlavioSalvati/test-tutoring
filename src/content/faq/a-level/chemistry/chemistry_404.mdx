The oxidation numbers of various elements in redox reactions can change significantly.

In redox reactions, oxidation numbers serve as a tool to monitor the transfer of electrons between atoms. Specifically, the oxidation number of an element represents the hypothetical charge it would possess if all its bonds were ionic. In the context of a redox reaction, the oxidation number of the element that loses electrons (is oxidized) increases, while the oxidation number of the element that gains electrons (is reduced) decreases.

For instance, consider the reaction between magnesium and oxygen to produce magnesium oxide. In this reaction, magnesium is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. The oxidation number of magnesium rises from $0$ to $+2$, whereas the oxidation number of oxygen falls from $0$ to $-2$.

Certain elements, such as oxygen and hydrogen, exhibit predictable oxidation numbers in most of their compounds. Typically, oxygen has an oxidation number of $-2$, and hydrogen has an oxidation number of $+1$. However, there are notable exceptions to these generalizations; for example, in peroxides, oxygen has an oxidation number of $-1$.

Transition metals, on the other hand, can exist in multiple oxidation states, which complicates the prediction of their oxidation numbers. For example, iron can exhibit oxidation numbers of $+2$ or $+3$ in its compounds.

In summary, the oxidation numbers of different elements in redox reactions can vary widely, depending on the specific reaction and the compounds involved.
