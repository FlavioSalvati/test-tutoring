Ethers are organic compounds characterized by a central oxygen atom bonded to two carbon groups, while alcohols contain a hydroxyl group.

The general formula for ethers is given by:

$$
\text{R-O-R'}
$$

In this expression, $R$ and $R'$ represent alkyl or aryl groups. The oxygen atom in ethers possesses two lone pairs of electrons, which endows it with Lewis base characteristics. This property allows ethers to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

In contrast, alcohols are defined by the presence of a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) rather than an oxygen atom bonded to two carbon groups. The hydroxyl group in alcohols contributes to their increased polarity compared to ethers, significantly influencing their physical and chemical properties. For instance, alcohols typically exhibit higher boiling points and greater solubility in water than ethers.

Ethers can be synthesized through a method known as Williamson ether synthesis, which involves the reaction between an alkoxide ion and an alkyl halide. Due to their relatively inert nature and low toxicity, ethers are frequently utilized as solvents in organic chemistry. However, it is important to note that ethers can also be explosive and flammable, particularly when exposed to air or oxygen.

In summary, ethers consist of a central oxygen atom bonded to two carbon groups, whereas alcohols have a hydroxyl group. Ethers are less polar than alcohols, resulting in lower boiling points and reduced solubility in water. They serve as common solvents in organic chemistry, though caution is warranted due to their potential for explosiveness and flammability.
