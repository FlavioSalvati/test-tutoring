The boiling and melting points of alkanes rise with the increasing length of their carbon chains.

Alkanes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by having only single bonds between carbon atoms. The boiling and melting points of these compounds are influenced by their molecular size and shape. Specifically, as the number of carbon atoms in an alkane increases, both the boiling and melting points tend to increase. This trend is attributed to the fact that larger molecules exhibit stronger intermolecular forces of attraction, which necessitate more energy to overcome.

For instance, methane ($\text{CH}_4$) has a boiling point of $-161.5\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-182.5\,^{\circ}\text{C}$. In contrast, butane ($\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$) has a boiling point of $-0.5\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-138.4\,^{\circ}\text{C}$. The increase in boiling and melting points with the addition of carbon atoms can be attributed to the growing size and complexity of the molecules.

Additionally, branched alkanes generally have lower boiling and melting points compared to their straight-chain isomers. This phenomenon occurs because branching reduces the surface area of the molecule, thereby diminishing the strength of the intermolecular forces of attraction.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of alkanes increase with the length of the carbon chain. Furthermore, branched alkanes exhibit lower boiling and melting points than their straight-chain counterparts. Understanding these properties is essential, as they play a significant role in determining the physical and chemical characteristics of alkanes, which have numerous practical applications in both industry and everyday life.
