A carbene is a molecule featuring a carbon atom that possesses two unshared electrons. It is generated through the removal of a leaving group from a precursor molecule.

Carbenes are known for their high reactivity, mainly due to the presence of these unshared electrons on the carbon atom. They can engage in a variety of chemical reactions, including the insertion into C-H bonds, cyclopropanation, and olefin metathesis. Depending on the spin state of the unshared electrons, carbenes can be classified into two categories: singlet and triplet.

Carbenes can be generated through several methods, including the thermal decomposition of diazo compounds, photolysis of diazo compounds, and metal-catalyzed decomposition of diazo compounds. Diazo compounds are characterized by the presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond and a leaving group. When these compounds decompose, the nitrogen-nitrogen bond breaks, leading to the formation of a carbene.

The applications of carbenes in organic synthesis are diverse, encompassing the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, they are utilized in materials science, particularly in the preparation of polymers and coatings. Despite their inherent reactivity, carbenes can be stabilized by appropriate substituents attached to the carbon atom, facilitating their isolation and characterization.
