An isotope is a variant of an element characterized by a different number of neutrons in its nucleus. This variation results in a change in the atomic mass of the element.

Isotopes are atoms that share the same number of protons and electrons as their parent element but possess differing numbers of neutrons. For instance, carbon-12 ($^{12}\text{C}$) and carbon-14 ($^{14}\text{C}$) are both isotopes of carbon. Both contain 6 protons and 6 electrons; however, carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, whereas carbon-14 has 8 neutrons.

Isotopes can exhibit distinct physical and chemical properties compared to their parent element. Notably, radioactive isotopes are capable of undergoing decay, emitting radiation in the process. This property makes them valuable in various applications, such as medical imaging and cancer treatment. Additionally, isotopes play a crucial role in dating geological specimens like rocks and fossils, as well as in tracing chemical reactions and metabolic pathways.

The natural abundance of isotopes can vary significantly, with some being more prevalent than others. For example, carbon-12 constitutes about 98.9% of all carbon atoms, making it the most common isotope, while carbon-14 is much less abundant, accounting for only about 0.011% of all carbon atoms.

In summary, isotopes are variations of an element that differ in their neutron count, leading to differences in atomic mass and various physical and chemical properties. Their unique characteristics render them essential in a wide range of scientific disciplines, including medicine and geology.
