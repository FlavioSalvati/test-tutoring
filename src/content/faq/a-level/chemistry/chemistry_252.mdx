The boiling and melting points of alkynes rise as the number of carbon atoms in the molecule increases.

Alkynes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of a triple bond between two carbon atoms. As the size of the alkyne increases—specifically, as the number of carbon atoms grows—the boiling and melting points also tend to increase. This trend can be attributed to the enhanced strength of the intermolecular forces that arise when the molecular size increases.

For instance, ethyne (C$_2$H$_2$) has a boiling point of $-84^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-80^\circ\text{C}$. In contrast, but-1-yne (C$_4$H$_6$) exhibits a boiling point of $8^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-117^\circ\text{C}$. The higher boiling and melting points of but-1-yne can be explained by the presence of more electrons within the molecule, which results in stronger London dispersion forces between the molecules.

Continuing this trend, pent-1-yne (C$_5$H$_8$) has a boiling point of $36^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-80^\circ\text{C}$. Meanwhile, hex-1-yne (C$_6$H$_{10}$) shows a boiling point of $69^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-30^\circ\text{C}$. Again, the increase in molecular size contributes to stronger intermolecular forces, leading to higher boiling and melting points.

In summary, the trend observed in alkynes is that both boiling and melting points increase with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule, primarily due to the strengthening of intermolecular forces as molecular size increases.
