There are four primary types of metal crystal structures: body-centered cubic (BCC), face-centered cubic (FCC), hexagonal close-packed (HCP), and simple cubic (SC).

**Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)**: In BCC structures, atoms are arranged within a cubic lattice, featuring one atom at each corner and a single atom positioned at the center of the cube. Notable examples of BCC metals include iron, chromium, and tungsten.

**Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)**: FCC structures consist of atoms arranged in a cubic lattice, with one atom at each corner of the cube and an additional atom at the center of each face. Common examples of FCC metals are copper, silver, and gold.

**Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP)**: HCP metals have atoms organized in a hexagonal lattice, where each atom is surrounded by six others. Examples of metals with HCP structures include magnesium, titanium, and zinc.

**Simple Cubic (SC)**: In SC structures, atoms are arranged in a straightforward cubic lattice, with one atom located at each corner. Polonium and certain allotropes of chromium are examples of SC metals.

The crystal structure of a metal significantly influences its physical and chemical properties, including strength, ductility, and electrical conductivity. A thorough understanding of a metal's crystal structure is crucial in materials science and engineering, as it aids in predicting the metal's behavior under various conditions.
