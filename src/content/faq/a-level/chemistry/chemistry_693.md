An azide is a compound characterized by the presence of the -N₃ group, which is formed through the reaction of sodium azide with an alkyl halide.

Azides represent a group of compounds that include the -N₃ unit, comprising three nitrogen atoms arranged in a linear configuration. These compounds are widely utilized in organic synthesis as a nitrogen source, and they also play a significant role in explosives and propellant formulations.

The formation of azides occurs through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between sodium azide and an alkyl halide. In this process, the azide ion ($\text{N}_3^-$) acts as a nucleophile, effectively substituting the halide ion in the alkyl halide. The outcome of this reaction is the production of an alkyl azide, which can subsequently participate in various chemical reactions to yield a diverse array of other compounds.

It is important to note that azides are highly reactive and can pose significant hazards if not managed with care. They are particularly sensitive to heat and shock, with the potential to detonate under such conditions. Consequently, azides are typically handled in inert environments and stored in cool, dry locations to minimize risks.

In summary, azides are a class of compounds containing the -N₃ group, synthesized through the reaction of sodium azide with an alkyl halide. They find applications in organic synthesis and explosive materials, but their high reactivity necessitates careful handling and storage to ensure safety.
