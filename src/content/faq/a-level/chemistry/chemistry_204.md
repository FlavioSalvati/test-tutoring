Hydrolysis and complexation are two distinct chemical reactions that take place in aqueous solutions.

**Hydrolysis** refers to a reaction in which a molecule is cleaved into two parts through the addition of water. This process is frequently observed in the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats during digestion. In the context of aqueous solutions, hydrolysis can also occur when a salt is dissolved in water. For instance, when sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$) dissolves in water, it dissociates into sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$). Water molecules can then interact with these ions to produce hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) and hydronium ions ($\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$), resulting in a slightly basic solution.

Conversely, **complexation** is a reaction where two or more molecules come together to form a complex. This is commonly seen in the formation of metal complexes, in which a metal ion binds to a ligand, resulting in a coordination complex. In aqueous solutions, complexation can also occur between organic molecules and metal ions. A notable example is EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), a widely used chelating agent that forms stable complexes with metal ions, facilitating the removal of heavy metals from wastewater.

In summary, hydrolysis and complexation are two different chemical reactions occurring in aqueous solutions. Hydrolysis involves the addition of water to break down a molecule, while complexation entails the formation of a complex between two or more molecules. Understanding these reactions is crucial across various fields, including biology, chemistry, and environmental science.
