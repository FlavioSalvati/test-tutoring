### Examples of Structural and Stereoisomers in Coordination Compounds

Coordination compounds can display two types of isomerism: structural isomerism and stereoisomerism. Structural isomers have the same chemical formula but differ in the arrangement of atoms within the molecule. In contrast, stereoisomers have the same chemical formula and the same arrangement of atoms, but they differ in the spatial orientation of their atoms.

A notable example of a structural isomer in coordination compounds is the complex $[\text{Co}(\text{NH}_3)_4\text{Cl}_2]^+$. This compound can exist in two distinct forms: cis and trans. In the cis configuration, the two chloride ions are positioned adjacent to one another, whereas in the trans configuration, they are located opposite each other. These isomers exhibit different physical and chemical properties, including variations in melting point, solubility, and reactivity.

Another example of stereoisomerism can be seen in the complex $[\text{Co}(\text{en})_2\text{Cl}_2]^+$, where $\text{en}$ stands for ethylenediamine. Similar to the previous example, this compound can also exist in cis and trans forms. In the cis configuration, the two ethylenediamine ligands are adjacent, while in the trans configuration, they are positioned opposite each other. Although these isomers share the same chemical formula and atom arrangement, their different spatial orientations lead to variations in their optical properties, such as the ability to rotate plane-polarized light.

In summary, coordination compounds can exhibit both structural and stereoisomerism. Understanding these forms of isomerism is crucial for exploring the properties and applications of coordination compounds in diverse fields, including medicine, catalysis, and materials science.
