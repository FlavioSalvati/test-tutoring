Electrophilic addition is a type of chemical reaction in which an electrophile is added to an unsaturated molecule. For instance, consider the reaction between ethene and hydrogen chloride, which can be represented as:

$$
\text{CH}_2=\text{CH}_2 + \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Cl}
$$

In this reaction, the hydrogen chloride molecule acts as the electrophile. It attacks the electron-rich double bond of ethene, resulting in the formation of a new single bond between the carbon atom of ethene and the chlorine atom from hydrogen chloride, while simultaneously breaking the double bond.

Another example of electrophilic addition is the reaction between propene and bromine:

$$
\text{CH}_3\text{CH}=\text{CH}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CHBrCH}_2\text{Br}
$$

Here, the bromine molecule serves as the electrophile as well. It attacks the electron-rich double bond of propene, leading to the formation of two new single bonds between the carbon atoms of propene and the bromine atoms, while again breaking the double bond.

Electrophilic addition reactions play a crucial role in organic chemistry, enabling the synthesis of a diverse array of compounds. These reactions are also instrumental in the production of various plastics, such as polyethylene, which is generated through the polymerization of ethene.
