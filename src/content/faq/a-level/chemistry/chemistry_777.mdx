A benzene ring is a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms characterized by alternating double bonds. It is formed through a chemical process known as electrophilic aromatic substitution.

Benzene itself is a highly stable aromatic compound comprising six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. The carbon atoms are organized in a hexagonal configuration, where each carbon is bonded to two neighboring carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. The presence of alternating double bonds contributes significantly to its unique stability and aromatic properties.

The formation of a benzene ring occurs via electrophilic aromatic substitution, a reaction in which a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring is replaced by an electrophile, such as a halogen or a nitro group. The electrophile is attracted to the electron-rich $\pi$ bonds present in the benzene ring. The reaction generates a reactive intermediate, which is then stabilized through resonance.

This resonance stabilization is crucial, as it renders the formation of a benzene ring energetically favorable. The delocalization of electrons across the entire ring structure leads to a compound that is not only highly stable but also resistant to further chemical reactions.

In summary, the benzene ring is a fundamental structural motif in numerous organic compounds, and its formation through electrophilic aromatic substitution is a pivotal reaction in the field of organic chemistry.
