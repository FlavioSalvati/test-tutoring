An acetal is a functional group characterized by the presence of two ether groups attached to a single carbon atom.

Acetals are formed through a reaction between an aldehyde or ketone and an alcohol, facilitated by an acid catalyst. In this process, the alcohol undergoes nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group of the aldehyde or ketone, resulting in the formation of a hemiacetal or hemiketal intermediate. The acid catalyst then protonates the oxygen atom of the hemiacetal or hemiketal, ultimately leading to the formation of an acetal or ketal, respectively.

In organic chemistry, acetals serve an essential purpose as protecting groups for aldehydes and ketones. By converting an aldehyde or ketone into an acetal, the carbonyl group is effectively masked, rendering it less reactive. This allows for modifications of other functional groups without interfering with the carbonyl group. The acetal can then be readily removed through hydrolysis under acidic conditions, thereby regenerating the original aldehyde or ketone.

Acetals also play significant roles in biological systems, contributing to various metabolic pathways. For instance, acetaldehyde—an important industrial chemical and metabolic intermediate—can react with two molecules of ethanol to create the acetal known as ethylidene diacetate. This compound has a fruity aroma and contributes to the distinctive flavors of certain fruits and alcoholic beverages.
