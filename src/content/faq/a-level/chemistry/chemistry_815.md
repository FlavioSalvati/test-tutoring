Carboxylic acids and esters are distinct types of organic compounds that differ in their functional groups and chemical properties.

Carboxylic acids are characterized by the presence of a carboxyl group ($-COOH$) attached to a hydrocarbon chain. This functional group imparts acidic properties to the compound, allowing it to donate a proton and form a carboxylate ion. Carboxylic acids are generally soluble in water and exhibit relatively high boiling points, which can be attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding that occurs between their molecules. This capability enables them to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water, contributing to their polar nature.

In contrast, esters contain an ester group ($-COO-$) connected to a hydrocarbon chain. Esters are produced through the reaction of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, typically facilitated by an acid catalyst. Unlike carboxylic acids, esters are less acidic and do not form carboxylate ions. Furthermore, esters tend to be less soluble in water and have lower boiling points compared to their carboxylic acid counterparts. Although esters can also form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water molecules, these interactions are generally weaker than those found in carboxylic acids.

The differences between carboxylic acids and esters extend to their applications in industry and everyday life. Carboxylic acids are utilized in the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and pharmaceuticals. They are also commonly found in various foods, such as vinegar and citrus fruits. On the other hand, esters are employed as solvents, fragrances, and flavorings in the food and cosmetics industries. They play a crucial role in imparting the characteristic aromas and tastes of many fruits and flowers.
