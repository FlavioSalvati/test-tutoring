Common ions can significantly influence the solubility of ionic compounds, either decreasing or increasing it.

When two ionic compounds that share a common ion are mixed, the concentration of that ion in the solution rises. This increase can affect the solubility of the compounds involved. For instance, when calcium chloride ($\text{CaCl}_2$) is introduced to a solution containing calcium carbonate ($\text{CaCO}_3$), the concentration of calcium ions ($\text{Ca}^{2+}$) elevates. This elevated concentration leads to a decrease in the solubility of calcium carbonate, as the surplus calcium ions react with carbonate ions ($\text{CO}_3^{2-}$) to form insoluble calcium carbonate.

Conversely, when two ionic compounds that do not share a common ion are combined, the concentration of each individual ion in the solution tends to decrease. This reduction can enhance the solubility of the compounds. For example, when sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$) is added to a solution containing silver nitrate ($\text{AgNO}_3$), the concentrations of sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and nitrate ions ($\text{NO}_3^-$) rise, while the concentration of silver ions ($\text{Ag}^+$) declines. This decrease in silver ion concentration increases the solubility of silver nitrate, as the additional nitrate ions interact with silver ions to produce soluble silver nitrate.

The impact of common ions on solubility is also illustrated by the common ion effect. This phenomenon occurs when the presence of a common ion reduces the solubility of a slightly soluble salt. For instance, the solubility of lead chloride ($\text{PbCl}_2$) diminishes when hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$) is added to the solution due to the increased concentration of chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$).

In summary, the presence of common ions can have a profound effect on the solubility of ionic compounds, either reducing or enhancing it depending on the specific ions involved.
