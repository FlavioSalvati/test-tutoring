The melting point trend of Period 3 elements exhibits an initial increase from sodium to silicon, followed by a decrease.

This trend can be understood by examining the nature of the bonding in these elements. Sodium and magnesium exhibit metallic bonding, characterized by a "sea" of delocalized electrons that surround positively charged metal ions. The strength of metallic bonds is influenced by the number of delocalized electrons available; as we progress from sodium to magnesium, this number increases, which accounts for magnesium's higher melting point compared to sodium.

Aluminium forms a giant metallic lattice structure, where each atom is bonded to eight neighboring atoms. This extensive bonding leads to strong metallic interactions, resulting in a significantly high melting point.

Silicon, on the other hand, features a giant covalent lattice structure. In this configuration, each silicon atom is bonded to four neighboring atoms, creating robust covalent bonds that also contribute to a high melting point.

In contrast, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and argon have simple molecular structures, which are maintained by relatively weak intermolecular forces. As we move from silicon to argon, the number of electrons in the outer shell decreases, leading to weaker intermolecular forces and consequently lower melting points.

In summary, the melting point trend of Period 3 elements is primarily determined by the nature of their bonding. Metallic bonding is associated with high melting points, while covalent bonding and weak intermolecular forces result in lower melting points.
