Alkanes and alkenes are two distinct classes of hydrocarbons that differ in their bonding and reactivity.

**Alkanes** are saturated hydrocarbons, meaning they consist exclusively of single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. This saturation implies that each carbon atom in an alkane is fully bonded to hydrogen atoms. The general formula for alkanes is given by 

$$
C_nH_{2n+2}
$$ 

where $n$ represents the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. Due to their stable structure, alkanes are relatively unreactive and are commonly utilized as fuels and lubricants.

In contrast, **alkenes** are unsaturated hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of at least one carbon-carbon double bond. This double bond results in a lower hydrogen atom count compared to alkanes, making alkenes more reactive. The general formula for alkenes can be expressed as 

$$
C_nH_{2n}
$$ 

where, again, $n$ denotes the number of carbon atoms. The double bond allows alkenes to participate in various addition reactions with other molecules, increasing their reactivity.

Moreover, the physical properties of alkanes and alkenes differ significantly. Alkanes tend to be less dense than water and typically have lower boiling points compared to alkenes of similar molecular weight. Alkenes exhibit greater polarity due to the presence of the double bond, which can result in stronger intermolecular forces and consequently higher boiling points.

In conclusion, alkanes and alkenes represent two fundamental categories of hydrocarbons, each with unique structures and properties. Alkanes are saturated and relatively inert, whereas alkenes are unsaturated and more reactive due to their carbon-carbon double bonds.
