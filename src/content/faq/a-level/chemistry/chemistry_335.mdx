Half-cell reactions pertain to the transfer of electrons between different chemical species, whereas redox equations represent the complete transfer of electrons during a chemical reaction.

Half-cell reactions are the specific reactions that occur at each electrode within an electrochemical cell. In these reactions, one species undergoes oxidation, meaning it loses electrons, while another species undergoes reduction, gaining electrons. These reactions are typically expressed as half-equations, where the species involved in either the oxidation or reduction process are presented on opposite sides of the equation. For instance, the half-equation for the oxidation of zinc in a zinc-copper cell can be represented as:

$$
\text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-
$$

In contrast, redox equations encapsulate the overall electron transfer that occurs in a chemical reaction. They combine the half-cell reactions for both oxidation and reduction processes to produce a balanced equation reflecting the entire reaction. Redox equations are expressed in terms of the reactants and products, with the transferred electrons indicated as a separate entity. For example, the redox equation for the reaction between zinc and copper in a zinc-copper cell is:

$$
\text{Zn}(s) + \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + \text{Cu}(s)
$$

In summary, half-cell reactions illustrate the individual electron transfer processes occurring in an electrochemical cell, while redox equations convey the overall electron transfer associated with a chemical reaction.
