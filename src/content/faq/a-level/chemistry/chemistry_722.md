Alloys exhibit distinct properties compared to pure metals, primarily due to the incorporation of additional elements. 

Alloys are composed of two or more metals, or a combination of a metal and a non-metal, which are blended to form a new material that possesses different characteristics than those of the individual pure metals. The inclusion of other elements can significantly alter the physical and chemical properties of the base metal, affecting attributes such as strength, ductility, and melting point. For instance, when carbon is added to iron, it results in steel, a material that is stronger and more durable than pure iron.

Moreover, alloys can be specifically engineered to achieve particular properties suited for various applications. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is valued for its corrosion resistance and aesthetic appeal, making it ideal for decorative items. Similarly, titanium alloys are employed in aerospace and medical fields due to their remarkable strength, lightweight nature, and biocompatibility.

In contrast, pure metals maintain uniform properties throughout the material. Composed of only one type of atom, they exhibit a regular atomic arrangement in a crystal lattice structure. Generally, pure metals are soft and malleable, with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. However, they can also be brittle and exhibit low strength.

In summary, the properties of alloys differ from those of pure metals due to the addition of other elements, allowing them to be tailored for specific applications. While pure metals possess consistent properties, they may not always meet the requirements for certain uses.
