Strong acids and bases fully dissociate in water, whereas weak acids and bases only partially dissociate.

**Strong Acids**  
Examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$), sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$), and nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$). When these acids are introduced to water, they completely dissociate into their respective ions, leading to a significant release of hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) into the solution. This process results in a low pH, typically below $3$.

**Weak Acids**  
In contrast, weak acids such as acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$), carbonic acid ($\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$), and citric acid ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_8\text{O}_7$) only partially dissociate when added to water. This partial dissociation results in a lower concentration of hydrogen ions compared to strong acids, leading to a higher pH.

**Strong Bases**  
Strong bases include sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$), potassium hydroxide ($\text{KOH}$), and calcium hydroxide ($\text{Ca(OH)}_2$). When these bases are added to water, they completely dissociate into their respective ions, resulting in a substantial release of hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) into the solution. This process results in a high pH, typically above $11$.

**Weak Bases**  
Conversely, weak bases such as ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), pyridine ($\text{C}_5\text{H}_5\text{N}$), and trimethylamine ($\text{N}(\text{CH}_3)_3$) undergo only partial dissociation when added to water. Consequently, this leads to a lower concentration of hydroxide ions and a lower pH compared to strong bases.

Understanding the relative strength of acids and bases is crucial for various biological processes, including enzyme activity and cellular respiration. It also plays a significant role in environmental science, as the pH of water can greatly influence the health of aquatic organisms.
