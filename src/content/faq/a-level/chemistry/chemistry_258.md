The sp, $\text{sp}^{2}$, and $\text{sp}^{3}$ hybridization in transition elements varies based on the number of hybrid orbitals formed.

Transition elements can create hybrid orbitals through the mixing of their s and p orbitals. 

1. **sp Hybridization**: This type involves the combination of one s orbital and one p orbital, resulting in the formation of two hybrid orbitals. The geometry associated with sp hybridization is linear, with a bond angle of $180^\circ$. Examples of elements that exhibit sp hybridization include Be, B, and C.

2. **$\text{sp}^{2}$ Hybridization**: In this case, one s orbital and two p orbitals are mixed to create three hybrid orbitals. The resulting geometry is trigonal planar, characterized by a bond angle of $120^\circ$. Examples of transition elements that undergo $\text{sp}^{2}$ hybridization include N, O, and F.

3. **$\text{sp}^{3}$ Hybridization**: This hybridization involves the mixing of one s orbital and three p orbitals, producing four hybrid orbitals. The geometry formed is tetrahedral, with a bond angle of $109.5^\circ$. Examples of elements that display $\text{sp}^{3}$ hybridization include C, Si, and Ge.

In summary, the sp, $\text{sp}^{2}$, and $\text{sp}^{3}$ hybridization in transition elements differ in the number of hybrid orbitals formed, which leads to distinct geometries and bond angles. Understanding these hybridizations is crucial for predicting the properties and behaviors of transition elements in various chemical reactions.
