Nitro compounds are characterized by the presence of a nitro group ($-$NO$_2$), whereas amino compounds feature an amino group ($-$NH$_2$).

Nitro compounds are organic substances that have a nitro group ($-$NO$_2$) bonded to a carbon atom. Due to their unique chemical structure, these compounds are commonly utilized in various applications, such as explosives, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. Nitro compounds are known for their high reactivity and can undergo reduction reactions, which convert them into amino compounds. The nitro group contributes significantly to the explosive characteristics of these compounds, as it holds a substantial amount of potential energy that can be released during a chemical reaction.

On the other hand, amino compounds are organic molecules that contain an amino group ($-$NH$_2$) attached to a carbon atom. These compounds serve as the fundamental building blocks of proteins and are vital for sustaining life. Amino compounds can be synthesized within the body through a process known as transamination, where an amino group is transferred from one molecule to another. Additionally, amino compounds are extensively used in the manufacturing of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and plastics.

The primary distinction between nitro compounds and amino compounds lies in the functional groups attached to the carbon atom. Nitro compounds possess a nitro group ($-$NO$_2$), while amino compounds are characterized by an amino group ($-$NH$_2$). In summary, nitro compounds are highly reactive and can exhibit explosive properties, whereas amino compounds are crucial for life and have diverse applications across various industries.
