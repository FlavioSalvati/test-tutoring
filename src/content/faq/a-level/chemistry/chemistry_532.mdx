title: "Provide an example of internal energy and enthalpy"
summary: "Internal energy is the sum of all the kinetic and potential energies of the particles that make up a system. Enthalpy, on the other hand, is the sum of the internal energy and the product of pressure and volume of a system."

Internal energy is defined as the total sum of all kinetic and potential energies of the particles that constitute a system. In contrast, enthalpy is the combined total of internal energy and the product of pressure and volume within that system.

To illustrate internal energy, consider a gas-filled balloon. The gas molecules inside the balloon are in constant motion, colliding with one another and the walls of the balloon. This motion generates kinetic energy, which contributes to the internal energy of the system. Additionally, the potential energy of the gas molecules is included in the internal energy, as it accounts for the energy stored in the bonds between the atoms.

Enthalpy can be exemplified through a chemical reaction, such as the combustion of methane. Before the reaction occurs, the reactants—methane and oxygen—possess a specific internal energy. During the reaction, the bonds between the atoms are broken and new bonds are formed, leading to a change in internal energy. Furthermore, the pressure and volume of the system may also vary during the reaction, which impacts the overall enthalpy of the system.

A solid understanding of internal energy and enthalpy is crucial in the field of thermodynamics, as it enables us to predict and analyze the behavior of systems under varying conditions. This knowledge also has practical applications in various domains, including engineering and chemistry.
