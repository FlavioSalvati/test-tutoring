An example of an aldehyde is formaldehyde, while acetone serves as a representative ketone.

Both aldehydes and ketones are classes of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group, which consists of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom. In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is situated at the terminal end of a carbon chain, whereas in ketones, it is found within the chain.

Formaldehyde is a simple aldehyde widely utilized in various industries as a disinfectant and preservative. It is also a byproduct of combustion processes and can be found in cigarette smoke and automobile exhaust. Due to its high reactivity, formaldehyde can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, as well as respiratory issues.

Acetone, on the other hand, is a prevalent ketone employed as a solvent in numerous sectors, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and plastics. It is commonly found in products such as nail polish remover and paint thinner. Acetone is highly flammable and may lead to skin irritation and respiratory problems if not handled with care.

Both aldehydes and ketones play significant roles in biological processes. For instance, glucose, a type of sugar, is classified as an aldehyde and is a vital source of energy for cells. Ketones are produced by the liver during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, serving as an alternative energy source for the body. However, elevated levels of ketones in the blood can indicate a serious medical condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis.
