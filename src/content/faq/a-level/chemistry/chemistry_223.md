Surface tension refers to the natural tendency of a liquid to minimize its surface area. 

The surface tension of a liquid is primarily influenced by its intermolecular forces, which are the attractive forces that exist between molecules. Generally, the stronger these intermolecular forces, the greater the surface tension of the liquid.

For instance, water exhibits a high surface tension due to the strong hydrogen bonds that form between its molecules. This strong attraction causes water droplets to adopt a spherical shape, as the surface tension works to pull the molecules together, thereby minimizing the surface area.

Conversely, liquids with weaker intermolecular forces exhibit lower surface tension. A prime example of this is ethanol, which has weaker intermolecular interactions compared to water. As a result, ethanol droplets spread out more on surfaces compared to water droplets, which tend to remain more compact.

Another notable example is mercury, which possesses an exceptionally high surface tension attributable to its strong metallic bonding. This characteristic is responsible for mercury droplets forming nearly perfect spheres, as the strong surface tension effectively counters the force of gravity.

In conclusion, the surface tension of a liquid is fundamentally determined by the strength of its intermolecular forces. The stronger these forces, the higher the liquid's surface tension.
