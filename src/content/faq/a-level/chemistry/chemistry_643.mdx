An enamine is a chemical compound characterized by a carbon-carbon double bond ($C=C$) with a nitrogen atom attached to one of the carbon atoms. A notable example of an enamine is N-ethylcinnamamide.

Enamines are synthesized through the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a secondary amine, facilitated by an acid catalyst. These compounds serve as crucial intermediates in organic synthesis, playing a significant role in the preparation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

N-ethylcinnamamide, a commonly utilized enamine in organic synthesis, is produced by the reaction of cinnamaldehyde with ethylamine in the presence of an acid catalyst. This compound can act as a starting material for the synthesis of various other compounds, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

On the other hand, an imine is defined as a compound featuring a carbon-nitrogen double bond ($C=N$). An example of an imine is benzaldehyde imine.

Imines are formed when a carbonyl compound reacts with a primary amine. Like enamines, they are important intermediates in organic synthesis and find applications in the preparation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

Benzaldehyde imine is a widely used imine in organic synthesis, generated from the reaction of benzaldehyde with ammonia. This compound can also serve as a precursor for the synthesis of various other compounds, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.
