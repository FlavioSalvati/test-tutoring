Chlorine reacts with water through a series of chemical processes, leading to the formation of hypochlorous acid.

When chlorine is introduced into water, it undergoes hydrolysis, a reaction with water molecules that produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This hydrolysis reaction marks the initial step in the disinfection process. Hypochlorous acid is a potent oxidizing agent that effectively targets and eliminates microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses.

The effectiveness of chlorine as a disinfectant is influenced by the pH level of the water. At a pH of $7.5$, approximately $80\%$ of the chlorine is present as hypochlorous acid, which is the most effective form for disinfection. However, as the pH rises, the proportion of hypochlorous acid diminishes, leading to a decrease in chlorine's disinfecting efficacy.

Additionally, chlorine can react with organic matter present in the water, resulting in the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). The presence of these DBPs raises health concerns, as some have been associated with adverse effects, including cancer and reproductive issues.

In summary, the chemical behavior of chlorine in water is intricate and influenced by various factors such as pH, temperature, and the presence of organic materials. While chlorine serves as an effective disinfectant, it is crucial to monitor and manage its application to minimize the production of DBPs and ensure the safety of drinking water.
