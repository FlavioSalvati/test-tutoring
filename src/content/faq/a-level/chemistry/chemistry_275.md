Aromatic compounds exhibit a range of boiling and melting points that depend significantly on their molecular structures.

The boiling and melting points of these compounds are primarily influenced by the strength of the intermolecular forces present between their molecules. Aromatic compounds that experience stronger intermolecular forces—such as hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions—typically have higher boiling and melting points. Conversely, those with weaker intermolecular forces, like London dispersion forces, generally exhibit lower boiling and melting points.

For instance, benzene has a boiling point of $80.1^\circ C$ and a melting point of $5.5^\circ C$. This can be attributed to its symmetrical structure, which enables efficient molecular packing and results in relatively weak London dispersion forces.

In comparison, naphthalene possesses a boiling point of $218^\circ C$ and a melting point of $80^\circ C$. The larger molecular size of naphthalene, which consists of two fused benzene rings, contributes to stronger London dispersion forces between its molecules.

Phenol serves as another illustrative example, with a boiling point of $181.7^\circ C$ and a melting point of $43^\circ C$. The presence of a hydroxyl group in phenol facilitates hydrogen bonding among its molecules, leading to stronger intermolecular forces and consequently higher boiling and melting points.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of aromatic compounds are largely determined by their molecular structures and the nature of the intermolecular forces at play.
