DNA replication is a crucial biological process through which a cell duplicates its DNA prior to cell division.

During this process, the double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds and separates into two individual strands. Each strand acts as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. The enzyme helicase is responsible for unwinding the DNA, while DNA polymerase facilitates the addition of nucleotides to the newly forming strand. These nucleotides are incorporated in a specific order, guided by the base pairing rules: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).

This replication process is described as semi-conservative because each new DNA molecule comprises one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. This mechanism ensures that the genetic information is accurately preserved and transmitted to the daughter cells.

DNA replication occurs at specific locations known as replication forks. These forks progress along the DNA molecule, unwinding and replicating the DNA as they move. The entire process is highly regulated and involves a multitude of enzymes and proteins working in concert.

While errors can arise during DNA replication, potentially leading to mutations in the genetic code, cells are equipped with various mechanisms to detect and repair these errors, thereby maintaining the integrity of genetic information.

In summary, DNA replication is a complex and tightly regulated process that is vital for cell division and the accurate transmission of genetic information.
