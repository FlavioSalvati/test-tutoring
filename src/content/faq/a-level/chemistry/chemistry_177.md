The face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structures of transition metals exhibit distinct arrangements of atoms.

In the FCC crystal structure, each unit cell is represented as a cube with an atom located at each corner and an additional atom situated at the center of each face. This configuration yields a total of four atoms per unit cell. Conversely, the BCC crystal structure features a cube with atoms at each corner and a single atom positioned at the center of the cube, resulting in a total of two atoms per unit cell.

The packing efficiency of the FCC structure is higher than that of the BCC structure, achieving a packing efficiency of $74\%$. This increased efficiency arises from the closer packing of atoms in the FCC configuration compared to the BCC arrangement. Consequently, metals with an FCC structure tend to be more ductile and malleable than those with a BCC structure.

Regarding material properties, FCC structures are typically associated with metals that are soft, ductile, and possess relatively low melting points. Notable examples of metals that crystallize in the FCC structure include copper, aluminum, and gold. In contrast, the BCC structure is more characteristic of metals that are hard, brittle, and exhibit higher melting points. Examples of BCC metals include iron, tungsten, and chromium.

In summary, the primary distinction between FCC and BCC crystal structures in transition metals lies in their atomic arrangement and packing efficiency. The FCC structure, with atoms located at the corners and faces of the cube, results in a denser packing that contributes to the softness and ductility of metals such as copper and gold. On the other hand, the BCC structure, featuring a central atom within the cube, is associated with harder metals like iron, which tend to be less ductile and possess higher melting points.
