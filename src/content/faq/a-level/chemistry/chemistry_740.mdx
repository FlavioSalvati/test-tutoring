In the Malonic ester synthesis, the ester and acid exhibit distinct differences in their reactivity and functional groups.

The ester utilized in this synthesis is diethyl malonate, which features two ester functional groups ($-COO-$) and an ethyl group ($-C_2H_5$) bonded to the central carbon atom. The ester group is generally less reactive than the carboxylic acid group due to its resonance-stabilized structure, which makes it less susceptible to nucleophilic attack. This property renders diethyl malonate an excellent starting material for the synthesis of carboxylic acids.

Conversely, the acid commonly employed in the Malonic ester synthesis is typically a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. These acids facilitate the conversion of the ester into its corresponding carboxylic acid through hydrolysis. The carboxylic acid group ($-COOH$) is more reactive than the ester group because it does not benefit from the same resonance stabilization. As a result, the carboxylic acid is more prone to nucleophilic attack, allowing it to participate in subsequent reactions.

In summary, the ester and acid in the Malonic ester synthesis differ significantly in terms of reactivity and functional groups. The ester, with its resonance-stabilized structure, is less reactive, while the acid, lacking this stabilization, is more reactive. The acid's role is crucial, as it converts the ester into a carboxylic acid, which can then engage in further chemical reactions.
