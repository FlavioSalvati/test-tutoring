An illustrative example of oxidation and reduction in a chemical reaction is the combustion of methane.

Methane ($\text{CH}_4$) is a hydrocarbon that burns in the presence of oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) to produce carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). In this reaction, methane undergoes oxidation, while oxygen experiences reduction. Specifically, the oxidation of methane involves the loss of hydrogen atoms, whereas the reduction of oxygen entails the gain of electrons.

The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane is:

$$
\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In this equation, methane is oxidized to form carbon dioxide, a more highly oxidized form of carbon. Concurrently, oxygen is reduced to produce water, which represents a more reduced form of oxygen.

During the reaction, the carbon-hydrogen bonds in methane are broken, leading to the formation of new bonds between carbon and oxygen, as well as between hydrogen and oxygen. The energy released during this reaction is utilized to heat the surrounding environment.

The combustion of methane serves as a significant example of oxidation and reduction processes in our daily lives. It is widely employed to generate heat and energy in various industrial and domestic applications, such as home heating and cooking. However, this process also releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Therefore, it is crucial to seek alternatives to fossil fuels and to develop more sustainable energy sources.
