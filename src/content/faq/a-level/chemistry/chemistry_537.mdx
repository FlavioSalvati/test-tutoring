Strong field ligands create larger energy separations between the d orbitals of metal ions, whereas weak field ligands lead to smaller separations.

According to ligand field theory, the strength of a ligand's interaction with a metal ion is primarily determined by its ability to induce splitting of the d orbitals. Strong field ligands, such as $CN^-$, $CO$, and $NH_3$, result in significant energy separation between the d orbitals. This large separation leads to the formation of low-spin complexes, where electrons preferentially occupy the lower energy orbitals before filling the higher energy ones. Consequently, these complexes exhibit a smaller magnetic moment.

Conversely, weak field ligands, including $H_2O$ and $F^-$, produce smaller energy separations between the d orbitals, resulting in high-spin complexes. In these cases, electrons tend to fill the higher energy orbitals before any occupy the lower energy ones, leading to a larger magnetic moment.

The strength of the ligand also influences the color of the resulting complex. Typically, complexes formed with strong field ligands are either colorless or display low-intensity colors, while those with weak field ligands tend to exhibit more vibrant colors.

In summary, the strength of the ligand is a crucial factor that determines the energy separation between the d orbitals, which in turn influences the spin state, magnetic moment, and color of the complex.
