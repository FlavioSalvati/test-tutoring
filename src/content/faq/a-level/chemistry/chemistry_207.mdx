The Cannizzaro reaction involves formaldehyde as the aldehyde and the hydroxide ion as the base. 

This reaction is classified as a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction, where one molecule of aldehyde is oxidized while another molecule of the same aldehyde is reduced. Typically, the reaction occurs in the presence of a strong base, like the hydroxide ion, which serves as a nucleophile. The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. Depending on the experimental conditions, this intermediate can subsequently undergo either oxidation or reduction.

For formaldehyde, the simplest aldehyde, the reaction can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{HCHO} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{HCOO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In this process, one molecule of formaldehyde is oxidized to produce the formate ion ($\text{HCOO}^-$), while another molecule of formaldehyde is reduced to form methanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{OH}$). This overall reaction represents a disproportionation process, where a single aldehyde molecule yields both an oxidized product and a reduced product.

The Cannizzaro reaction is significant in the field of organic chemistry, as it offers a method for synthesizing alcohols from aldehydes. Additionally, it plays a vital role in the production of various chemicals and pharmaceuticals. A thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism and the roles played by the aldehyde and hydroxide ion is crucial for students studying organic chemistry.
