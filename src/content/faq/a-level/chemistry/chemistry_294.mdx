In electrolysis, the reactions occurring at the anode and cathode are distinct in terms of the ions involved and the products generated.

At the anode, the reaction entails the oxidation of negatively charged ions, such as chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$) or sulfate ions ($\text{SO}_4^{2-}$), resulting in the formation of neutral molecules or atoms. For instance, during the electrolysis of a sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$) solution, chloride ions are oxidized to produce chlorine gas ($\text{Cl}_2$), while water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) is formed as a by-product. This process is classified as an oxidation reaction.

Conversely, the cathode reaction involves the reduction of positively charged ions, such as hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) or metal cations, leading to the formation of neutral molecules or atoms. For example, in the electrolysis of a copper(II) sulfate ($\text{CuSO}_4$) solution, copper ions ($\text{Cu}^{2+}$) are reduced to yield copper metal ($\text{Cu}$), with hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) being produced as a by-product. This reaction is referred to as a reduction reaction.

In summary, the reactions occurring at the anode and cathode during electrolysis are crucial for the separation of various elements or compounds from a solution. The specific ions present and the resulting products depend on the electrolyte used and the conditions under which the electrolysis is conducted.
