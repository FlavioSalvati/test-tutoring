An illustrative example of electrophilic addition involving alkynes is the reaction between propyne and hydrogen chloride.

Propyne, also known as methylacetylene, is a three-carbon alkyne with the chemical formula $C_3H_4$. It can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with various electrophiles, including hydrogen halides, halogens, and water.

In the reaction between propyne and hydrogen chloride (HCl), the hydrogen atom of HCl acts as an electrophile. It adds to the carbon-carbon triple bond of propyne, resulting in the formation of 2-chloropropane, which is classified as a halogenated alkane.

The mechanism of this reaction involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. This intermediate is stabilized by the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atom. Subsequently, the chloride ion attacks the carbocation, leading to the formation of the final product.

This reaction exemplifies Markovnikov's rule, which states that the electrophile adds to the carbon atom of the triple bond that has the greater number of hydrogen atoms attached. In the case of propyne, the terminal carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, while the central carbon atom has only one hydrogen atom. Consequently, the hydrogen atom of HCl adds to the terminal carbon atom, resulting in the production of 2-chloropropane.

In conclusion, the electrophilic addition of alkynes represents a significant reaction in organic chemistry, enabling the formation of a diverse array of functional groups. The reaction between propyne and hydrogen chloride serves as a prime example of this type of reaction.
