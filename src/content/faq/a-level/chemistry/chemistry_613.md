The bond dissociation energy (BDE) is defined as the energy required to break a covalent bond, and it serves as a direct indicator of the strength of that bond.

Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons. The strength of these bonds is largely determined by the attractive forces between the shared electrons and the nuclei of the bonded atoms. Specifically, the bond dissociation energy quantifies the energy needed to completely separate the bonded atoms.

In essence, the bond dissociation energy is a measure of covalent bond strength: a higher bond dissociation energy indicates a stronger bond, meaning that more energy is necessary to break it. For instance, the bond dissociation energy of the carbon-carbon bond in ethane is approximately $348 \, \text{kJ/mol}$, whereas the bond dissociation energy of the carbon-oxygen bond in ethanol is about $360 \, \text{kJ/mol}$. This comparison reveals that the carbon-oxygen bond is stronger than the carbon-carbon bond.

Several factors can influence bond dissociation energy, including the size of the bonded atoms, the number of shared electrons, and the presence of other atoms or molecules in the vicinity. A thorough understanding of bond dissociation energy is crucial in various fields of chemistry, including organic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science.
