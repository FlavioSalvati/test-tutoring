Markovnikov's rule is a key principle in organic chemistry that predicts the regioselectivity of electrophilic addition reactions.

When an unsymmetrical alkene reacts with a hydrogen halide, the hydrogen atom from the hydrogen halide adds to the carbon atom of the double bond that is already bonded to a greater number of hydrogen atoms. Meanwhile, the halide ion attaches to the other carbon atom in the double bond. This phenomenon is described by Markovnikov's rule.

The rationale behind this rule can be understood by examining the stability of the intermediate carbocation that forms during the reaction. More substituted carbocations are generally more stable due to the electron-donating effects of the alkyl groups attached to the positively charged carbon atom. Consequently, the hydrogen ion adds to the less substituted carbon atom, leading to the formation of a less stable carbocation intermediate.

Markovnikov's rule is significant in organic chemistry as it aids in predicting the major product of electrophilic addition reactions. It also serves as a useful guideline for anticipating the outcomes of reactions involving other electrophiles, such as water or alcohols.

However, there are exceptions to Markovnikov's rule. For instance, in reactions conducted in the presence of peroxides, the hydrogen atom adds to the less substituted carbon atom, a process known as anti-Markovnikov addition. This occurs because the peroxide acts as a radical initiator, generating a radical intermediate that preferentially adds to the less substituted carbon atom.

In summary, Markovnikov's rule is a fundamental concept in organic chemistry that helps predict the regioselectivity of electrophilic addition reactions.
