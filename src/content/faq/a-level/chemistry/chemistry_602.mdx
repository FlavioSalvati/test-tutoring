Polar bonds involve an unequal sharing of electrons, whereas nonpolar bonds feature an equal sharing.

Both polar and nonpolar bonds are types of covalent bonds, which are formed when atoms share electrons to create stable molecules. In a polar bond, the electrons are shared unequally between the atoms. One atom exerts a stronger attraction for the electrons, leading to a partial negative charge on that atom, while the other atom acquires a partial positive charge. This results in the formation of a dipole moment, indicating that the molecule has distinct positive and negative ends. Common examples of polar molecules include water ($H_2O$) and ammonia ($NH_3$).

Conversely, nonpolar bonds occur when the electrons are shared equally between the atoms. This equal sharing results in a molecule lacking a dipole moment, meaning it has no distinct positive or negative ends. Examples of nonpolar molecules include oxygen ($O_2$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$).

The polarity of a molecule significantly influences its physical and chemical properties. Polar molecules typically exhibit higher boiling and melting points compared to nonpolar molecules, due to the stronger intermolecular forces present in polar substances. Additionally, polar molecules are more likely to dissolve in polar solvents, while nonpolar molecules tend to dissolve in nonpolar solvents.

In conclusion, polar bonds are characterized by an unequal sharing of electrons that leads to a dipole moment, while nonpolar bonds involve equal sharing, resulting in no dipole moment. The polarity of a molecule plays a crucial role in determining its physical and chemical properties.
