Surface tension is the force that binds the molecules of a liquid together at its surface.

This property enables a liquid to resist external forces that attempt to disrupt its surface. Surface tension arises from the intermolecular forces that act between the molecules of the liquid. These forces are typically stronger among the liquid molecules than between the liquid and the surrounding air. As a result, the molecules at the surface experience an inward pull, leading to a tension that counteracts any external forces.

The magnitude of surface tension is directly related to the strength of the intermolecular forces present within the liquid. Liquids with stronger intermolecular attractions exhibit higher surface tensions. For instance, water demonstrates significant surface tension due to the robust hydrogen bonding between its molecules.

Surface tension is crucial in various biological processes. A notable example is the ability of certain insects to walk on water, which is made possible by the high surface tension of water. Additionally, surface tension facilitates the movement of water from plant roots to leaves through capillary action.

In summary, surface tension is a fundamental property of liquids, resulting from the intermolecular forces between their molecules. This concept is vital in biology and has numerous practical applications in our daily lives.
