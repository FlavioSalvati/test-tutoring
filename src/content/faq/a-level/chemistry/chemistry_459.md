An illustrative example of an anode and cathode reaction during electrolysis is the electrolysis of water.

Electrolysis is a process that employs an electric current to decompose a compound into its elemental components. In the case of water, the compound is represented as $H_2O$. The electric current facilitates the breakdown of water into its constituent elements: hydrogen and oxygen.

At the anode, which is the positively charged electrode, water molecules undergo oxidation, resulting in the production of oxygen gas and positively charged hydrogen ions ($H^+$). This reaction can be summarized by the following equation:

$$
2 H_2O \rightarrow O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^-
$$

Conversely, at the cathode, which is the negatively charged electrode, the positively charged hydrogen ions are reduced to generate hydrogen gas. This reaction is represented by the equation:

$$
4 H^+ + 4 e^- \rightarrow 2 H_2
$$

Overall, the electrolysis of water can be expressed by the equation:

$$
2 H_2O \rightarrow 2 H_2 + O_2
$$

This reaction is significant for the production of hydrogen gas, which can serve as a clean fuel source. However, it is important to note that the electrolysis process is energy-intensive. Currently, the majority of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels. Ongoing research aims to develop more efficient and sustainable methods for hydrogen production.
