In titration experiments, the behavior of strong acids and weak acids differs significantly, particularly in how the pH changes during the process.

In a strong acid titration, the pH experiences a rapid transition from acidic to neutral as the strong acid is neutralized by a strong base. The equivalence point is reached swiftly, and the pH at this point is $7$. This type of titration typically involves a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, reacting with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide.

Conversely, a weak acid titration results in a more gradual change in pH. This slower pH adjustment occurs because weak acids do not fully dissociate in solution. As a result, the equivalence point is reached more slowly, and the pH at this point is greater than $7$. This elevated pH is attributed to the presence of the conjugate base formed during the reaction. Weak acid titrations generally involve a weak acid, like acetic acid, combined with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide.

The contrasting pH changes observed in strong and weak acid titrations stem from their differing strengths. Strong acids completely dissociate in solution, leading to a higher concentration of hydrogen ions, while weak acids only partially dissociate. This fundamental difference influences the pH change during the titration process.

Understanding the distinctions between strong and weak acid titrations is crucial for establishing appropriate experimental conditions and accurately interpreting the results.
