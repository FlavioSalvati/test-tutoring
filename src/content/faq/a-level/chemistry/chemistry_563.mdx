The atomic radius is defined as the distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron shell of an atom, while the ionic radius refers to the distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron shell of an ion.

The atomic radius of an element tends to increase as one moves down a group in the periodic table. This increase occurs because the number of electron shells increases with each successive element in a group. Conversely, the atomic radius decreases as one moves across a period from left to right. This decrease is attributed to the increasing number of protons in the nucleus, which exerts a stronger attractive force on the electrons, pulling them closer to the nucleus.

The ionic radius of an ion is influenced by the number of electrons it possesses in comparison to its neutral atom. When an ion loses electrons, it becomes positively charged (a cation), and its ionic radius decreases. This reduction in size occurs because there are fewer electrons to repel each other. In contrast, when an ion gains electrons, it becomes negatively charged (an anion), and its ionic radius increases due to the greater number of electrons that can repel one another.

For instance, the atomic radius of sodium ($\text{Na}$) is larger than that of chlorine ($\text{Cl}$) because sodium has an additional electron shell compared to chlorine. When sodium loses an electron to form a $\text{Na}^+$ ion, its ionic radius decreases as there are fewer electrons to create repulsive forces. On the other hand, when chlorine gains an electron to form a $\text{Cl}^-$ ion, its ionic radius increases due to the added electrons that increase electron-electron repulsion.

Understanding the concepts of atomic and ionic radii is essential for predicting chemical reactions and for comprehending the properties of various elements and compounds.
