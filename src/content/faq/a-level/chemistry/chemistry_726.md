Thiols and alcohols are both organic compounds, but they differ significantly in their functional groups and properties.

Thiols, also known as mercaptans, are characterized by the presence of a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen atom, represented as -SH. These compounds are notorious for their strong, unpleasant odors, which are commonly associated with substances like garlic, onions, and skunks. Thiols exhibit greater acidity compared to alcohols due to the sulfur atom's ability to donate its lone pair of electrons, resulting in the formation of a stable thiolate ion. This property makes thiols valuable in organic synthesis and as reducing agents in various biochemical reactions.

In contrast, alcohols are defined by the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a carbon atom. These compounds are widely used in everyday life, found in alcoholic beverages as well as in solvents, fuels, and the production of plastics and pharmaceuticals. Alcohols are less acidic than thiols, primarily because the electronegativity of the oxygen atom pulls electrons away from the hydrogen atom, making them less likely to donate protons. Consequently, alcohols are generally less reactive than thiols, although they can still participate in reactions such as dehydration and oxidation.

In summary, the primary distinctions between thiols and alcohols lie in their functional groups, acidity, and reactivity. Thiols contain a sulfur atom and are both more acidic and reactive than alcohols, while alcohols contain an oxygen atom and demonstrate lower acidity and reactivity in comparison to thiols.
