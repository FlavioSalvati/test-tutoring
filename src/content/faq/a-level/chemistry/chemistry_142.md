The ligand field theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.

Transition metal complexes are coordination compounds that consist of a central metal ion surrounded by ligands. The ligand field theory elucidates the electronic structure of these complexes by examining the interactions between the metal ion and the ligands. These ligands generate a field of electron density around the metal ion, which influences the energy levels of the metal's $d$ orbitals.

According to ligand field theory, the $d$ orbitals are categorized into two distinct sets: the $e_g$ set and the $t_{2g}$ set. The $e_g$ set includes the $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, which are oriented towards the ligands. In contrast, the $t_{2g}$ set comprises the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, which are oriented between the ligands. This arrangement leads to a splitting of the energy levels of the $d$ orbitals, with the $e_g$ set possessing higher energy than the $t_{2g}$ set.

Furthermore, the ligand field theory accounts for the colors observed in transition metal complexes. When light is absorbed by a complex, electrons are excited from the $t_{2g}$ set to the $e_g$ set. The energy of the absorbed light corresponds to the energy difference between these two sets of orbitals. Consequently, the color of the complex is determined by the wavelength of light that is absorbed.

In summary, the ligand field theory elucidates both the electronic structure and the coloration of transition metal complexes by analyzing the interactions between the metal ion and its surrounding ligands.
