Strong field ligands lead to greater energy separations between d orbitals, whereas weak field ligands result in smaller separations.

According to ligand field theory, the strength of a ligand's interaction with a metal ion is assessed by its capacity to split the d orbitals of that ion. Strong field ligands, such as $\text{CN}^-$, $\text{CO}$, and $\text{NH}_3$, induce a significant energy gap between the d orbitals, which gives rise to a low-spin complex. In such complexes, electrons preferentially occupy the lower energy orbitals before filling the higher energy ones, leading to a reduced magnetic moment.

Conversely, weak field ligands like $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ and $\text{F}^-$ create a smaller energy separation between the d orbitals, resulting in a high-spin complex. This means that electrons tend to fill the higher energy orbitals before the lower ones, resulting in a larger magnetic moment.

The strength of the ligand also influences the color of the complex. Typically, strong field ligands form complexes that are either colorless or exhibit low-intensity colors, while weak field ligands tend to produce complexes with more vibrant and intense colors.

In summary, the strength of the ligand determines the energy separation between the d orbitals, which in turn influences the spin state, magnetic moment, and color of the complex.
