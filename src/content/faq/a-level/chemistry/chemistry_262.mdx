### Examples of Boranes and Alkanes

A **borane** is a compound that consists of boron and hydrogen atoms, whereas an **alkane** is a type of hydrocarbon characterized by having only single bonds between its carbon atoms.

One notable example of a borane is **diborane**, represented by the chemical formula $B_2H_6$. This compound appears as a colorless gas with a pungent odor and is known for its high reactivity, capable of igniting spontaneously in air. Diborane serves various purposes, including the production of boron compounds, acting as a reducing agent in organic synthesis, and functioning as a rocket propellant.

In contrast, a well-known example of an alkane is **methane**, denoted by the formula $CH_4$. Methane is the simplest hydrocarbon, existing as a colorless and odorless gas that constitutes the primary component of natural gas. Its applications include serving as a fuel for heating and cooking, as well as being a feedstock for the synthesis of chemicals such as methanol and ethylene.

Other examples of alkanes include **ethane** ($C_2H_6$), **propane** ($C_3H_8$), and **butane** ($C_4H_{10}$). These compounds are also commonly utilized as fuels and as feedstocks in the chemical industry.

In summary, boranes and alkanes represent two distinct categories of compounds, each with unique properties and applications. Boranes contain both boron and hydrogen, while alkanes are hydrocarbons characterized solely by single bonds between carbon atoms. Diborane and methane serve as illustrative examples of a borane and an alkane, respectively.
