A voltaic cell, also referred to as a galvanic cell, is an electrochemical device that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy through redox reactions.

Voltaic cells consist of two half-cells that are interconnected by a salt bridge or a porous membrane. Each half-cell includes an electrode, which may be composed of a metal or another conductive material, immersed in an electrolyte solution containing ions capable of undergoing oxidation or reduction. In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the reducing agent (the species that is oxidized) to the oxidizing agent (the species that is reduced). This electron transfer creates a potential difference, or voltage, between the two half-cells, which can be measured with a voltmeter.

The direction of electron flow within a voltaic cell is dictated by the relative strengths of the oxidizing and reducing agents present in each half-cell. The electrode associated with the stronger reducing agent donates electrons to the electrode linked to the stronger oxidizing agent, resulting in a current flow from the anode (the electrode where oxidation takes place) to the cathode (the electrode where reduction occurs). The overall reaction in a voltaic cell is spontaneous and releases energy, which can be harnessed for practical uses, such as in batteries and fuel cells.

In summary, voltaic cells are electrochemical systems that leverage redox reactions to convert chemical energy into electrical energy. A solid understanding of redox principles is crucial for comprehending the functionality of voltaic cells and their applications across various domains.
