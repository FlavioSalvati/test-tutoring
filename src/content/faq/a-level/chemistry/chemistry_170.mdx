Oxidation and reduction in aqueous solutions involve the transfer of electrons between different species.

**Oxidation** refers to the process by which a species loses electrons, resulting in an increase in its oxidation state. In aqueous environments, this can occur when a species reacts with oxygen or when it transfers electrons to another species. For instance, when iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water, it undergoes oxidation, leading to the formation of rust. Another example is the reaction between copper and silver ions in solution, where copper loses electrons and is oxidized to form copper ions.

**Reduction**, on the other hand, is the process by which a species gains electrons, resulting in a decrease in its oxidation state. In aqueous solutions, reduction typically occurs when a species accepts electrons from another species. For example, when silver ions interact with copper in solution, the silver ions gain electrons and are reduced to form solid silver metal. Similarly, when hydrogen ions react with oxygen in water, they gain electrons and are reduced to form water.

In aqueous solutions, oxidation and reduction often occur simultaneously; as one species loses electrons, another gains them. This simultaneous process is referred to as a **redox reaction**. Redox reactions play a crucial role in many biological processes, such as cellular respiration and photosynthesis, as well as in various industrial applications, including electroplating and corrosion prevention.
