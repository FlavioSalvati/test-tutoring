The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides increases as the pH of the solution decreases.

Alkaline earth metal hydroxides are compounds formed when alkaline earth metals react with water. These hydroxides exhibit basic properties and typically result in a high pH when dissolved in water. The solubility of these hydroxides is influenced by the pH of the solution; specifically, as the pH decreases, their solubility increases.

This phenomenon can be understood through the common ion effect. When an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, such as calcium hydroxide ($\text{Ca(OH)}_2$), dissolves in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions: calcium ions ($\text{Ca}^{2+}$) and hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$). The solubility of the hydroxide is constrained by the concentration of hydroxide ions present in the solution. When an acid is introduced to the solution, it reacts with the hydroxide ions to form water, thereby reducing the concentration of hydroxide ions. This reduction in hydroxide ion concentration decreases the solubility of the hydroxide, leading to precipitation out of solution.

The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides plays a crucial role in various biological processes. For instance, calcium hydroxide is commonly used in dentistry as a base for dental cements and as a disinfectant. Additionally, magnesium hydroxide serves as an antacid to neutralize stomach acid. The effectiveness of these compounds in their respective applications is significantly influenced by the pH of the surrounding solution.
