The activation energy of a reaction plays a crucial role in determining its rate. For instance, photosynthesis has a high activation energy, which leads to a relatively slow reaction rate.

Activation energy is defined as the minimum amount of energy necessary for a chemical reaction to take place. Reactions that possess a high activation energy require more energy to initiate, resulting in slower reaction rates. Photosynthesis serves as a prime example of a reaction with high activation energy. During this process, light energy is converted into chemical energy, which is then used to produce glucose. The energy needed to break the bonds in water ($H_2O$) and carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and to form new bonds in glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) is substantial, contributing to the slow rate of photosynthesis.

In contrast, reactions characterized by low activation energy require less energy to initiate, leading to faster reaction rates. A notable example is the reaction between hydrogen ($H_2$) and oxygen ($O_2$) to form water ($H_2O$), which has a low activation energy and occurs rapidly. This reaction releases a significant amount of energy, which is why it is commonly utilized as a fuel in rocket propulsion.

Moreover, enzymes can significantly reduce the activation energy of a reaction, thereby increasing its rate. Enzymes are biological catalysts that facilitate chemical reactions by lowering the necessary activation energy. This acceleration is vital for many biological processes. For instance, the enzyme amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch into glucose, a crucial step in digestion.
