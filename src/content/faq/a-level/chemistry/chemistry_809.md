The physical properties of alkanes change with increasing molecular size.

Alkanes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. These molecules are nonpolar, meaning they lack charge separation, which renders them insoluble in water. Alkanes generally exhibit low boiling points and exist as gases or liquids at room temperature, depending on their molecular size. For instance, smaller alkanes such as methane ($\text{CH}_4$) and ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$) are gaseous at room temperature, whereas larger alkanes, such as octane ($\text{C}_8\text{H}_{18}$) and nonane ($\text{C}_9\text{H}_{20}$), are typically found in liquid form.

As the molecular size of alkanes increases, both their boiling points and melting points tend to rise. This trend can be attributed to the fact that larger molecules possess more electrons and a greater surface area, resulting in stronger intermolecular forces. These forces, known as London dispersion forces, intensify with increasing molecular size. Consequently, larger alkanes exhibit higher boiling points and melting points compared to their smaller counterparts.

Furthermore, the solubility of alkanes in water decreases as their molecular size increases. The nonpolar characteristics of alkanes prevent them from dissolving in polar solvents like water. However, alkanes can readily dissolve in nonpolar solvents, such as hexane and benzene.

In conclusion, the physical properties of alkanes are influenced by their molecular size. Larger alkanes not only have higher boiling and melting points but are also less soluble in water compared to smaller alkanes.
