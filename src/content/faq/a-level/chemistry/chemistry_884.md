The Gibbs free energy is a crucial factor in determining the spontaneity of a chemical reaction. Specifically, a negative change in Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) indicates that a reaction is spontaneous.

The Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) quantifies the energy available to perform work in a system. It is calculated using the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

where:
- $\Delta H$ represents the change in enthalpy,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin, and
- $\Delta S$ denotes the change in entropy.

A negative $\Delta G$ value signifies that the reaction can occur spontaneously, while a positive $\Delta G$ value suggests that the reaction is non-spontaneous.

For instance, the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate has a $\Delta G$ value of $-7.3 \, \text{kcal/mol}$. This negative value indicates that the reaction is spontaneous and releases energy. In contrast, the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate yields a positive $\Delta G$ value of $+7.3 \, \text{kcal/mol}$, implying that this reaction is non-spontaneous and requires an input of energy.

Another illustrative example is the combustion of glucose, which has a highly negative $\Delta G$ value of $-686 \, \text{kcal/mol}$. This reaction is extremely spontaneous and releases a substantial amount of energy, primarily in the form of heat and light. Conversely, the reverse reaction—synthesizing glucose from carbon dioxide and water—has a positive $\Delta G$ value of $+686 \, \text{kcal/mol}$, indicating that it is non-spontaneous under standard conditions.

In summary, the Gibbs free energy is an invaluable tool for predicting the spontaneity of chemical reactions and for understanding the energy changes that occur during these processes.
