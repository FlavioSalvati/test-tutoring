In the Friedel-Crafts reaction, two primary types of reactions can take place: alkylation and acylation.

**Alkylation** refers to the process of adding an alkyl group to an aromatic ring. This is typically accomplished by reacting an alkyl halide with an aromatic compound in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as aluminium chloride ($\text{AlCl}_3$). For example, the reaction of benzene with ethyl chloride can yield ethylbenzene:

$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Cl} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3 + \text{HCl}
$$

**Acylation**, on the other hand, involves the addition of an acyl group to an aromatic ring. This reaction is generally achieved by reacting an acyl chloride with an aromatic compound, again utilizing a Lewis acid catalyst. For instance, when benzene reacts with acetyl chloride, acetophenone is formed:

$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{CH}_3\text{COCl} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COCH}_3 + \text{HCl}
$$

Both alkylation and acylation are crucial in organic synthesis since they enable the introduction of new functional groups onto aromatic rings. However, it is important to proceed with caution in these reactions, as they can be susceptible to side reactions, including over-alkylation or over-acylation. Furthermore, certain substrates may not be appropriate for these reactions due to steric hindrance or other steric factors.
