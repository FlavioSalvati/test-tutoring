Transition elements are capable of exhibiting $sp$, $sp^2$, and $sp^3$ hybridization in their compounds. 

These elements are particularly notable for their ability to form a diverse array of complex compounds, which can be attributed to their partially filled d-orbitals. Hybridization refers to the process of mixing atomic orbitals to create new hybrid orbitals that participate in bonding.

In $sp$ hybridization, one $s$ orbital and one $p$ orbital combine to form two $sp$ hybrid orbitals. This type of hybridization is exemplified in the compound $[Ni(CO)_4]$, where nickel undergoes $sp$ hybridization, resulting in a linear geometry.

In contrast, $sp^2$ hybridization involves the combination of one $s$ orbital and two $p$ orbitals to produce three $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals. An example of this can be found in the compound $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-}$, where iron exhibits $sp^2$ hybridization, leading to an octahedral geometry. In this case, the remaining $p$ orbital is utilized to form a $\pi$ bond with the ligands.

Similarly, in $sp^3$ hybridization, one $s$ orbital and three $p$ orbitals merge to create four $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals. This is observed in the compound $[Co(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$, where cobalt displays $sp^3$ hybridization, also resulting in an octahedral geometry. Here again, the leftover $p$ orbital is employed to form a $\pi$ bond with the ligands.

In summary, transition elements can exhibit $sp$, $sp^2$, and $sp^3$ hybridization in their compounds, which facilitates a wide range of geometries and bonding arrangements.
