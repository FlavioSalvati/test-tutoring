Natural polymers, such as proteins, DNA, and cellulose, are those that occur naturally within living organisms. In contrast, synthetic polymers, including nylon, PVC, and polystyrene, are artificially created and do not exist in nature.

Natural polymers play crucial roles in biological functions. For instance, proteins are long chains made up of amino acids, which are essential for numerous physiological processes. Similarly, DNA consists of long chains of nucleotides that carry genetic instructions vital for the development and functioning of all living organisms. Cellulose, another important natural polymer, is found in the cell walls of plants, providing structural support and rigidity.

On the other hand, synthetic polymers are produced through chemical processes and have various applications in our daily lives. Nylon is a widely used synthetic polymer found in clothing and textiles, as well as in products such as toothbrush bristles and fishing lines. PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, is another versatile synthetic polymer, utilized in a range of applications, including pipes, flooring, and electrical cable insulation. Additionally, polystyrene is commonly used in the manufacturing of disposable cups, packaging materials, and insulation products.

While both natural and synthetic polymers serve important functions, the environmental impact of synthetic polymers raises significant concerns. Many synthetic polymers are not biodegradable and can persist in the environment for hundreds of years, leading to pollution and threatening wildlife. Consequently, there is a growing interest in developing more sustainable alternatives to synthetic polymers to mitigate these environmental issues.
