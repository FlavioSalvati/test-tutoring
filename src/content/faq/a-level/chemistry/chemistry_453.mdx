Alkaline earth metals are characterized by their high reactivity and basic nature.

These metals exhibit significant reactivity, primarily owing to their low ionization energy and their tendency to lose two electrons, resulting in the formation of stable $2^+$ cations. This propensity leads to vigorous reactions with water, oxygen, and halogens. For instance, when magnesium is introduced to water, it reacts energetically to yield magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Similarly, calcium reacts with oxygen when exposed to air, resulting in the formation of calcium oxide.

In addition to their reactivity, alkaline earth metals are inherently basic. This basicity can be attributed to their low electronegativity and relatively large atomic radius, which facilitate the loss of electrons and the formation of cations. When these cations interact with water, they generate hydroxide ions, contributing to the basic nature of the solution. For example, when calcium oxide is combined with water, it reacts to form calcium hydroxide, a strong base.

The basic properties of alkaline earth metals render them valuable in various applications. Calcium hydroxide, for example, is utilized in agriculture to neutralize acidic soils and in water treatment processes to eliminate impurities. Additionally, magnesium hydroxide serves as an antacid to counteract stomach acid and is employed as a flame retardant in plastics and textiles.

In summary, alkaline earth metals are both highly reactive and basic, making them beneficial for a wide range of applications. Their reactivity and basicity stem from their low ionization energy and their tendency to lose electrons, forming cations.
