The Zaitsev rule is a key principle in organic chemistry that helps predict the major product of dehydrohalogenation reactions.

In a dehydrohalogenation process, a halogenated alkane loses a hydrogen atom from the beta-carbon, which is the carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the halogen. This reaction results in the formation of an alkene. According to the Zaitsev rule, the predominant product will be the alkene that features the most substituted double bond. In other words, this means the double bond with the highest number of alkyl groups attached to its carbon atoms.

The rationale behind the Zaitsev rule is rooted in thermodynamics: more substituted double bonds are generally more stable due to the increased electron density contributed by the surrounding alkyl groups. However, it's important to note that the Zaitsev rule does not always apply universally. In some instances, steric hindrance or other factors may lead to the formation of a less substituted alkene, despite the expectations set by the rule.

Understanding the Zaitsev rule is crucial for chemists, as it enables the prediction of outcomes in dehydrohalogenation reactions and aids in the design of synthetic pathways for producing specific alkenes. Additionally, the rule serves as a fundamental concept in the study of reaction mechanisms, contributing to a deeper comprehension of the factors that govern chemical reactivity.
