The electrophilic substitution reactions of various aromatic compounds exhibit significant variation due to the influence of different functional groups.

Aromatic compounds are defined by their cyclic structure and the presence of delocalized $\pi$ electrons. Electrophilic substitution occurs when an electrophile interacts with the electron-rich aromatic ring, resulting in the formation of a new compound. The specific product formed is determined by both the nature of the electrophile and the substituent groups attached to the aromatic ring.

Benzene, the simplest aromatic compound, can undergo electrophilic substitution with a range of electrophiles, including the nitronium ion $\text{NO}_2^+$, sulfur trioxide $\text{SO}_3$, and halogens such as chlorine and bromine. The product of the reaction is contingent upon the type of electrophile used. For instance, the nitration of benzene with the nitronium ion produces nitrobenzene, while chlorination or bromination yields halobenzenes.

When it comes to aromatic compounds that contain substituent groups, such as phenols, anilines, and benzoic acids, the electrophilic substitution process varies further. The presence of these functional groups modifies the reactivity of the aromatic ring toward electrophiles. For example, phenols are prone to electrophilic substitution at the ortho and para positions due to the activating effect of the hydroxyl group. In contrast, anilines typically undergo substitution at the meta position because of the deactivating influence of the amino group.

In summary, the electrophilic substitution reactions of different aromatic compounds vary greatly due to the presence of diverse functional groups. The nature of the electrophile and the substituents on the aromatic ring play critical roles in determining the resulting products. A thorough understanding of the reactivity of aromatic compounds is vital in organic chemistry, with important applications in drug discovery and materials science.
