### Example of a Silane and an Alkane

**Silane:** Methoxymethylsilane \((\text{CH}_3\text{Si(OCH}_3\text{)}_3)\)  
**Alkane:** Butane \((\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10})\)

Silanes are chemical compounds that consist of silicon and hydrogen atoms. They serve a wide range of applications, including as adhesives, coatings, and sealants. An example of a silane is Methoxymethylsilane, which is utilized as a crosslinking agent in the manufacture of silicone rubber. It has the molecular formula \(\text{CH}_3\text{Si(OCH}_3\text{)}_3\) and appears as a clear, colorless liquid with a boiling point ranging from \(101\text{°C}\) to \(103\text{°C}\).

Alkanes, on the other hand, are hydrocarbons characterized by having only single bonds between carbon atoms. They are commonly used as fuels and solvents, among other purposes. Butane, represented by the molecular formula \(\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}\), is a well-known alkane frequently used as a fuel in lighters and camping stoves. It is a colorless gas that has a boiling point of \(-1\text{°C}\).

When comparing their chemical properties, silanes and alkanes exhibit notable differences. Silanes are generally more reactive than alkanes, primarily due to the silicon atom's ability to form strong covalent bonds with other elements. In contrast, alkanes are relatively unreactive, attributed to the robust nature of their carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds.
