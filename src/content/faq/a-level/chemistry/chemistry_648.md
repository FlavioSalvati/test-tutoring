The primary distinction between aldehydes and ketones in the context of the Wittig reaction lies in the presence of a hydrogen atom.

Both aldehydes and ketones are classified as carbonyl compounds, characterized by a carbon atom that is double-bonded to an oxygen atom. During the Wittig reaction, these carbonyl compounds react with a phosphorus ylide to yield an alkene. However, the mechanism of the reaction differs slightly between aldehydes and ketones.

Aldehydes possess a hydrogen atom bonded to the carbonyl carbon, which increases their reactivity compared to ketones. Consequently, in the Wittig reaction, aldehydes typically undergo the reaction more rapidly than ketones and require milder reaction conditions. This enhanced reactivity is attributed to the ability of the phosphorus ylide to directly attack the carbonyl carbon, eliminating the need for a proton transfer step.

In contrast, ketones lack a hydrogen atom at the carbonyl carbon. As a result, the phosphorus ylide cannot directly attack the carbonyl carbon; instead, a proton transfer step must occur first. This requirement means that ketones necessitate more rigorous reaction conditions and longer reaction times when undergoing the Wittig reaction compared to aldehydes.

In summary, the key difference between aldehydes and ketones in the Wittig reaction is the presence of a hydrogen atom. Aldehydes are more reactive and can be processed under milder conditions, while ketones require a proton transfer step and harsher conditions for the reaction to proceed.
