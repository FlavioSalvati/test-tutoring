The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation is a significant reaction in organic chemistry where ketones and aldehydes participate in distinct oxidation processes.

Both ketones and aldehydes are classified as carbonyl compounds that can undergo the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation; however, their reactions differ due to variations in their chemical structures.

Ketones possess two alkyl groups linked to the carbonyl carbon, whereas aldehydes have one alkyl group and one hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon. In the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, ketones are transformed into esters, while aldehydes are converted into carboxylic acids.

The mechanism of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation begins with the formation of a peracid, which then reacts with the carbonyl compound to yield an intermediate. This intermediate can either be an ester enolate or an acyl oxaziridine. For ketones, the reaction produces an ester enolate, which subsequently undergoes rearrangement to form the ester product. In contrast, when aldehydes are involved, the acyl oxaziridine is formed and later undergoes hydrolysis to produce the corresponding carboxylic acid.

In summary, the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation serves as a valuable method for synthesizing esters from ketones and converting aldehydes into carboxylic acids. The differing products generated from the oxidation of ketones and aldehydes underscore the importance of understanding the chemical structure and reactivity of various functional groups.
