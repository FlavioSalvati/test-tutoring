The heat of vaporization and the heat of fusion represent two distinct forms of heat energy changes that occur during phase transitions.

The heat of vaporization is defined as the amount of heat energy necessary to transform a substance from a liquid to a gas at its boiling point. This process demands a considerable amount of energy because the intermolecular forces binding the molecules in the liquid state must be overcome for the molecules to escape into the gaseous phase. The energy supplied is utilized to break these intermolecular bonds and to counteract the attractive forces between the molecules. When the substance reaches its boiling point, the heat energy is then directed towards converting the liquid into a gas.

Conversely, the heat of fusion refers to the amount of heat energy required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid at its melting point. Similar to the heat of vaporization, this process also necessitates energy, as the intermolecular forces holding the solid molecules together must be disrupted to allow the transition into the liquid state. The energy expended is applied to break the bonds between the molecules and to overcome the attractive forces that maintain the solid structure. Once the substance attains its melting point, the heat energy facilitates the conversion of the solid into a liquid.

In summary, both the heat of vaporization and the heat of fusion are energy changes associated with phase transitions; however, they differ in the specific type of phase change and the quantity of energy involved. The heat of vaporization requires more energy, as it entails converting a liquid into a gas, whereas the heat of fusion involves the transition from a solid to a liquid.
