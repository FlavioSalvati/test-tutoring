The boiling and melting points of alcohols are influenced by their molecular size and the strength of intermolecular forces.

As the molecular size of an alcohol increases, its boiling point also tends to rise. This is primarily due to the fact that larger molecules possess more electrons, which enhances the strength of London dispersion forces. Additionally, alcohols that feature more polar functional groups, such as the hydroxyl group (-OH), can establish stronger hydrogen bonds, resulting in higher boiling points. For instance, methanol has a boiling point of $64.7^\circ C$, while ethanol reaches a boiling point of $78.3^\circ C$.

The melting point of an alcohol is similarly affected by its molecular size and intermolecular forces. However, it is also influenced by how the molecules are arranged in the solid state. Generally, smaller alcohol molecules exhibit lower melting points because they can pack more tightly together when solidified. For example, methanol has a melting point of $-97.6^\circ C$, in contrast to ethanol, which has a melting point of $-114.1^\circ C$.

In general, primary alcohols tend to have higher boiling and melting points compared to secondary and tertiary alcohols. This is attributed to the presence of a more substantial polar functional group. Furthermore, branched alcohols typically have lower boiling and melting points than their straight-chain counterparts due to their reduced surface area and weaker intermolecular forces.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of alcohols are determined by a combination of factors, including molecular size, polarity, and the strength of intermolecular forces.
