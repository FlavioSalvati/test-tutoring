DNA and RNA exhibit distinct differences in their structure, function, and chemical composition.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is structured as a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine ($A$), thymine ($T$), guanine ($G$), or cytosine ($C$). DNA is primarily located in the nucleus of cells and serves as the repository of genetic information that is transmitted from one generation to the next. Before cell division, DNA undergoes replication to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic code.

In contrast, RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a single-stranded molecule also made up of nucleotides. Each RNA nucleotide includes a sugar molecule (ribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine ($A$), uracil ($U$), guanine ($G$), or cytosine ($C$). RNA is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells, where it plays a vital role in the process of protein synthesis. There are three primary types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). 

- **mRNA** carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosome, where it is translated into a protein.
- **tRNA** transports amino acids to the ribosome, facilitating their assembly into proteins.
- **rRNA** is a fundamental component of the ribosome, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis.

In summary, DNA is a double-stranded molecule that encodes genetic information, while RNA is a single-stranded molecule crucial for protein synthesis. A notable distinction between the two is that DNA contains the nitrogenous base thymine ($T$), whereas RNA contains uracil ($U$). Furthermore, RNA exhibits greater versatility than DNA, with its various types performing specialized functions within the cell.
