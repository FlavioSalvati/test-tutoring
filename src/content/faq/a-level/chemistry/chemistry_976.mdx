title: "Describe the differences between the rate constant and reaction rate"
summary: "The rate constant is a constant value that relates the rate of a reaction to the concentration of reactants. On the other hand, the reaction rate is the change in concentration of reactants or products over time."

The rate constant is a fundamental value that connects the rate of a chemical reaction to the concentrations of the reactants involved. Conversely, the reaction rate refers to the change in concentration of either reactants or products over time.

The rate constant, denoted by the symbol $k$, is specific to each reaction and is determined through experimental methods. Its value is influenced by various factors, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalysts. In the rate equation, the rate constant is essential for calculating the reaction rate at specific concentrations of reactants. The units of the rate constant vary depending on the order of the reaction but are typically expressed in terms of concentration per unit time.

On the other hand, the reaction rate, represented by the symbol $r$, quantifies how quickly reactants are consumed or products are generated. It is also influenced by factors such as reactant concentration, temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalysts. The reaction rate can be measured experimentally by observing the change in concentration of reactants or products over a given time period. Its units are likewise expressed in terms of concentration per unit time.

In summary, the rate constant $k$ is a specific value for each reaction that illustrates the relationship between reactant concentration and reaction rate, while the reaction rate $r$ indicates the speed at which reactants convert into products. Both the rate constant and the reaction rate are crucial for understanding the dynamics of chemical reactions, although they provide different perspectives on the process.
