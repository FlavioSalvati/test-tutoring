An enol is a type of compound characterized by the presence of a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) and a double bond ($-C=C-$) between adjacent carbon atoms. When an enol undergoes deprotonation, it forms an enolate, which is an anion.

Both enols and enolates serve as significant intermediates in various organic chemistry reactions. Enols are typically generated through the tautomerization of carbonyl compounds. During this process, the double bond migrates to an adjacent carbon atom, resulting in the formation of a hydroxyl group. However, enols are relatively unstable and tend to react quickly with electrophiles, such as alkyl halides, leading to the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds.

Enolates are produced by the deprotonation of enols. This results in an anion that carries a negative charge on the oxygen atom, which is stabilized by resonance. Enolates are powerful nucleophiles and can engage in reactions with electrophiles to create new carbon-carbon bonds. Additionally, enolates can function as bases in acid-base reactions, enabling them to abstract protons from other molecules, thereby forming new double bonds.

A notable example of an enol is vinyl alcohol, which features a hydroxyl group and a double bond between adjacent carbon atoms. However, vinyl alcohol is inherently unstable and quickly tautomerizes to form acetaldehyde. Another example is 2-propen-1-ol, which similarly has a hydroxyl group and a double bond in adjacent carbon atoms.

On the other hand, an example of an enolate is the enolate ion derived from acetone, which is formed by the deprotonation of the alpha-carbon. This resulting anion possesses a negative charge on the oxygen atom and is stabilized through resonance. The enolate of acetone is capable of reacting with electrophiles, such as alkyl halides, to generate new carbon-carbon bonds.
