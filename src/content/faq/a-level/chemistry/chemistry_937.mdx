Chlorine serves as both an oxidizing and disinfecting agent when dissolved in water.

It is widely utilized to disinfect water in swimming pools and drinking water supplies. When chlorine is introduced into water, it reacts with organic matter and microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses, resulting in the formation of hypochlorous acid ($\text{HOCl}$) and hypochlorite ions ($\text{OCl}^-$). These compounds are potent oxidizing agents that effectively disrupt the cell walls and membranes of microorganisms, rendering them harmless.

In addition to its disinfecting properties, chlorine's oxidizing capabilities assist in removing various impurities from water. It reacts with organic materials, such as algae and bacteria, producing chloramines, which can be efficiently filtered out. Chlorine also interacts with common contaminants like iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulfide, leading to the formation of insoluble compounds that can be easily eliminated through processes like sedimentation or filtration.

However, it is crucial to note that excessive use of chlorine can produce harmful byproducts, such as trihalomethanes (THMs), which are known to be carcinogenic. Therefore, careful monitoring of chlorine levels in water is essential to maintain a balance between effective disinfection and safety.

In summary, chlorine is an effective oxidizing and disinfecting agent that plays a vital role in eliminating impurities and microorganisms from water. Nonetheless, it is important to use chlorine judiciously and continuously monitor its concentrations to ensure the safety of drinking water supplies.
