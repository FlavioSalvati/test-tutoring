The kinetic stability of coordination complexes is influenced significantly by the nature of their ligands.

Kinetic stability refers to the time it takes for ligands to dissociate from the central metal ion in a complex. The characteristics of the ligand play a crucial role in determining this stability. For instance, strong-field ligands, such as cyanide ($\text{CN}^-$) and carbon monoxide ($\text{CO}$), form highly stable complexes. This is primarily due to their ability to establish strong bonds with the metal ion, resulting in a slow rate of ligand dissociation and, consequently, a high degree of kinetic stability.

Conversely, weak-field ligands, such as water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) and ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), tend to form less stable complexes. The weaker bonds they form with the metal ion lead to a faster rate of ligand dissociation, rendering these complexes kinetically less stable.

Moreover, the size of the ligand can also influence the kinetic stability of a complex. Larger ligands often result in diminished stability due to steric hindrance, which hinders the ligand's ability to effectively approach or detach from the metal ion. This steric effect can lead to an increased rate of ligand dissociation, thereby reducing kinetic stability.

In conclusion, both the type and size of ligands significantly impact the kinetic stability of coordination complexes. Strong-field ligands and smaller ligands are generally associated with more stable complexes, while weak-field ligands and larger ligands typically lead to less stable complexes.
