A protecting group is a chemical modification employed to temporarily shield a reactive functional group from unwanted reactions.

In organic synthesis, protecting groups play a crucial role by safeguarding a functional group that could otherwise react with a reagent or catalyst during a chemical reaction. By masking the reactive group temporarily, chemists can carry out the reaction selectively on other parts of the molecule. After the desired reaction is completed, the protecting group can be removed, revealing the original functional group.

For instance, in peptide synthesis, the amino group ($-NH_2$) of an amino acid is frequently protected by a group such as the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group. This protection prevents the amino group from reacting with other reagents during the synthesis, thereby allowing for the selective formation of a peptide bond between the carboxylic acid of one amino acid and the unprotected amino group of another. Once the peptide bond has been established, the Boc group can be cleaved off using an acid, restoring the original amino group.

Protecting groups are also widely utilized in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and other complex organic molecules. The selection of a protecting group is influenced by the specific functional group being shielded and the conditions of the reaction. Commonly used protecting groups include acetyl ($Ac$), benzyl ($Bn$), and methyl ($Me$) groups.
