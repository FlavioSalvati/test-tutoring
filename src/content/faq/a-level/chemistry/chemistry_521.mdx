Temperature plays a crucial role in influencing the rate of chemical reactions by enhancing the frequency of collisions between particles.

The relationship between temperature and the rate of reaction is primarily due to the kinetic energy of the particles involved. As the temperature rises, the particles gain kinetic energy, causing them to move more rapidly and collide with one another more often. This increase in collision frequency raises the likelihood of successful interactions, thereby accelerating the rate of the reaction.

The Arrhenius equation quantitatively describes this relationship between temperature and reaction rate. It states that the rate constant, denoted as $k$, is directly proportional to the activation energy, $E_a$, and the absolute temperature, $T$, measured in Kelvin. The equation is formulated as:

$$
k = A e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}
$$

In this expression, $A$ represents the frequency factor, and $R$ is the universal gas constant.

Activation energy is defined as the minimum energy required for a reaction to take place. When the temperature increases, a greater number of particles possess sufficient energy to surpass this activation energy threshold, leading to an increased reaction rate. Additionally, the Arrhenius equation illustrates that a minor increase in temperature can yield a substantial enhancement in the reaction rate, as the exponential term in the equation becomes significantly larger.

In conclusion, temperature has a direct and profound impact on the rate of chemical reactions by increasing the frequency of particle collisions. The Arrhenius equation effectively captures this relationship, indicating that the rate constant is influenced by both activation energy and temperature. Notably, even a slight rise in temperature can lead to a considerable increase in the reaction rate due to the properties of the exponential function in the equation.
