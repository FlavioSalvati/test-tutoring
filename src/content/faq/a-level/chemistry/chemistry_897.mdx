Le Chatelier's principle asserts that when a system at equilibrium experiences a perturbation, it will adjust the position of equilibrium in a manner that counteracts the effect of that perturbation.

This principle is crucial for understanding how variations in temperature, pressure, and concentration influence the equilibrium position. For instance, if the concentration of a reactant is increased, the equilibrium will shift to the right, favoring the formation of more products to restore equilibrium. Similarly, an increase in temperature will cause the equilibrium to shift in the direction of the endothermic reaction, allowing the system to absorb the excess heat.

Le Chatelier's principle is also connected to the equilibrium constant, which quantifies the extent to which a reaction proceeds to form products. The equilibrium constant, denoted as $K_{eq}$, is calculated using the formula:

$$
K_{eq} = \frac{[Products]}{[Reactants]}
$$

where the concentrations of the products and reactants are each raised to the power of their respective stoichiometric coefficients. A large equilibrium constant indicates that the reaction favors the formation of products, whereas a small equilibrium constant suggests that the reaction barely proceeds to form products.

While changes in temperature, pressure, and concentration can shift the position of equilibrium, it is important to note that these changes do not affect the equilibrium constant itself. Therefore, Le Chatelier's principle can be effectively employed to predict the impact of these alterations on both the position of equilibrium and the equilibrium constant.
