Doping is the intentional introduction of impurities into a semiconductor to modify its electrical properties.

Semiconductors are materials that exhibit electrical conductivity that falls between that of conductors and insulators. They are essential components in a variety of electronic devices, including transistors, diodes, and solar cells. The doping process is vital in semiconductor fabrication, as it enables the production of both p-type and n-type semiconductors.

P-type semiconductors are formed by incorporating impurities such as boron or aluminum into a pure semiconductor, like silicon. These dopants possess one fewer valence electron than the semiconductor atoms, resulting in "holes" within the crystal lattice where electrons are absent. These holes function as positive charge carriers, thereby facilitating the conduction of electricity.

Conversely, n-type semiconductors are produced by adding impurities such as phosphorus or arsenic, which have one additional valence electron compared to the semiconductor atoms. These extra electrons become mobile within the crystal lattice, creating negative charge carriers and enhancing the material's electrical conductivity.

The doping process requires precision, as the type and quantity of impurities introduced can significantly influence the semiconductor's electrical characteristics. By meticulously controlling the doping parameters, manufacturers can engineer semiconductors with tailored electrical properties, suitable for a wide array of electronic applications.
