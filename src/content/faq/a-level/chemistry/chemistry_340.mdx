The dipole moment of a molecule is a key factor in determining its polarity.

The dipole moment quantifies the separation of positive and negative charges within a molecule. As a vector quantity, it possesses both magnitude and direction. The dipole moment is expressed in units of Debye (D).

Polar molecules exhibit a dipole moment greater than zero, whereas nonpolar molecules have a dipole moment of zero. For instance, water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) is a polar molecule with a dipole moment of $1.85 \, \text{D}$. This is attributed to the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom compared to the hydrogen atoms, which results in a partial negative charge on the oxygen and partial positive charges on the hydrogens.

In contrast, carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) is classified as a nonpolar molecule, possessing a dipole moment of zero. This occurs because the two oxygen atoms are equally electronegative, leading to a cancellation of the charge separation.

Another example of a polar molecule is ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), which has a dipole moment of $1.47 \, \text{D}$. The nitrogen atom's higher electronegativity compared to the hydrogen atoms results in a partial negative charge on the nitrogen and partial positive charges on the hydrogens.

In summary, the dipole moment of a molecule is crucial for determining its polarity. Polar molecules have a dipole moment greater than zero, while nonpolar molecules have a dipole moment of zero. Notable examples of polar molecules include water and ammonia, while carbon dioxide serves as an example of a nonpolar molecule.
