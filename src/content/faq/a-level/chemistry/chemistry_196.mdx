Optical isomers, also referred to as enantiomers, are a specific category of stereoisomers. These molecules share the same chemical formula and functional groups but differ in their spatial arrangement of atoms. This difference in configuration results in distinct physical and chemical properties, including variations in melting and boiling points, solubility, and reactivity.

A prime example of optical isomers is the amino acid alanine. Alanine contains a chiral carbon atom, which is bonded to four different groups. This chiral center gives rise to two distinct molecular arrangements that are mirror images of one another. The two forms of alanine are known as L-alanine and D-alanine. Despite having identical chemical formulas and similar properties, these enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.

Optical isomers play a crucial role in various biological processes. They are involved in enzyme-catalyzed reactions and the selective recognition of molecules by receptors within the body. Furthermore, in the pharmaceutical industry, the unique properties of these isomers can significantly influence their effectiveness and safety, making the study of optical isomers essential in drug development and design.
