Superconductors can be categorized into two main types: conventional and unconventional superconductors.

**Conventional Superconductors** are typically metallic elements that demonstrate superconductivity at very low temperatures, usually below $30 \, \text{K}$. These materials possess a straightforward crystal structure and are well-explained by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Conventional superconductors have a critical magnetic field; when this field is exceeded, they lose their superconducting properties. They also exhibit a critical temperature, below which they transition into the superconducting state. A notable characteristic of these materials is the Meissner effect, where they expel magnetic fields from their interior.

In contrast, **Unconventional Superconductors** feature more complex crystal structures and can sustain superconductivity at significantly higher temperatures, reaching up to $164 \, \text{K}$. Unlike their conventional counterparts, these superconductors do not conform to BCS theory, and their underlying mechanisms of superconductivity remain partially understood. They exhibit various forms of superconductivity, such as $d$-wave or $p$-wave, which are determined by the symmetry of their crystal structure. Unconventional superconductors generally possess a higher critical magnetic field and critical current density, rendering them more suitable for practical applications.

A specific subset of unconventional superconductors is known as **High-Temperature Superconductors**. These materials exhibit superconductivity at temperatures exceeding $30 \, \text{K}$. Composed primarily of copper-oxide compounds, they possess a layered crystal structure. Their exceptionally high critical temperatures and critical magnetic fields make them valuable for high-power applications, such as in magnetic levitation trains.

In summary, the properties of superconductors vary significantly based on their classification. Conventional superconductors display superconductivity at low temperatures and have simpler crystal structures, whereas unconventional and high-temperature superconductors are characterized by more complex crystal structures and higher superconducting temperatures, making them more advantageous for various practical applications.
