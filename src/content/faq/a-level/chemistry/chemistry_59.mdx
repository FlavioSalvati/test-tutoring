An illustrative example of enthalpy and entropy changes in a chemical reaction is the combustion of methane.

The combustion of methane ($\text{CH}_4$) with oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) produces carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$). This reaction is classified as exothermic, meaning it releases heat. The enthalpy change ($\Delta H$) for this reaction is $-890.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}$, signifying that energy is expelled during the process.

To evaluate the entropy change ($\Delta S$) for this reaction, we can use the formula:

$$
\Delta S = \Sigma S(\text{products}) - \Sigma S(\text{reactants}).
$$

In this case, the entropy of the products ($\text{CO}_2$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$) is greater than that of the reactants ($\text{CH}_4$ and $\text{O}_2$). As a result, the entropy change is positive, with $\Delta S$ for this reaction measured at $186.3 \, \text{J/(mol \cdot K)}$.

The change in Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) for this reaction can be determined using the equation:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S,
$$

where $T$ represents the temperature in Kelvin. Under standard conditions, specifically at $298 \, \text{K}$, the calculated $\Delta G$ for this reaction is $-803.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}$. This negative value indicates that the reaction is spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable.

Understanding the changes in enthalpy and entropy of a reaction is crucial for predicting its spontaneity and the amount of energy that will be either released or absorbed during the process. The combustion of methane serves as a fundamental example in chemistry to illustrate these essential concepts.
