A ketal is a chemical compound characterized by a central carbon atom that is bonded to two ether groups.

The formation of ketals occurs through a reaction between a ketone or an aldehyde and an alcohol, facilitated by the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid catalyst protonates the carbonyl oxygen, enhancing its electrophilicity and making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the alcohol. During this process, the alcohol donates a pair of electrons to the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. Subsequently, this intermediate eliminates a water molecule, resulting in the formation of the ketal.

Ketals are widely utilized in organic synthesis as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds. By transforming a carbonyl group into a ketal, the reactivity of the carbonyl is effectively shielded from undesired reactions. This protection allows for the selective functionalization of other regions of the molecule without interference from the carbonyl group. Additionally, ketals can serve as solvents, as they tend to be more stable and less reactive compared to their corresponding aldehydes or ketones.

In biological systems, ketals play crucial roles in various processes, including the biosynthesis of steroids and other natural products. For instance, the biosynthesis of cholesterol involves the formation of a ketal intermediate. Furthermore, ketals are also present in certain pharmaceuticals, such as the antihistamine ketotifen, which features a ketal group within its molecular structure.
