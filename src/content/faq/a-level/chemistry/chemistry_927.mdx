Chelation is the process by which a ligand forms a complex with a metal ion through coordination.

In chemical terms, chelation involves a ligand—a molecule or ion with one or more lone pairs of electrons—that donates these electrons to a metal ion. This interaction leads to the formation of a coordination compound, which consists of the metal ion and one or more ligands. The term "chelate" is derived from the Greek word "chele," meaning "claw," which aptly describes how the ligand encircles the metal ion similar to a claw.

Chelation plays a vital role in various fields, including biology, medicine, and industry. In biological systems, chelation facilitates the transport of metal ions across cell membranes and helps regulate the activity of enzymes that require metal ions as cofactors. In the medical field, chelation therapy is employed to treat metal poisoning by administering chelating agents that bind to toxic metal ions, thereby promoting their excretion from the body. In industrial applications, chelation is utilized for metal purification, preventing scale formation in boilers and pipes, and enhancing the stability and solubility of metal-containing compounds.

In summary, chelation is a fundamental process in coordination chemistry characterized by the formation of a complex between a metal ion and a ligand. This essential process has significant applications across biology, medicine, and industry, contributing to the proper functioning of numerous biological systems.
