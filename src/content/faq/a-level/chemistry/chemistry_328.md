The reactivity and oxidizing power of Group 7 elements, commonly known as halogens, increase as you move down the group.

Halogens are highly reactive non-metals that readily form diatomic molecules. Their reactivity escalates down the group primarily due to two factors: the increasing atomic radius and the decreasing electronegativity. As you progress down the group, the outermost electron resides further from the nucleus and experiences a reduced electrostatic attraction. This makes it easier for these elements to gain an electron and subsequently form a negative ion. For instance, fluorine, being the most reactive halogen, readily reacts with nearly all other elements, whereas iodine, with lower reactivity, only interacts with specific elements under certain conditions.

In addition to their reactivity, the oxidizing power of Group 7 elements also intensifies down the group. This trend is attributed to their high electron affinity, meaning they readily accept electrons to form negative ions. As a result, these elements serve as effective oxidizing agents, capable of oxidizing other substances by accepting electrons from them. For example, chlorine acts as a strong oxidizing agent, readily oxidizing metals such as iron and copper, while iodine functions as a weaker oxidizing agent, reacting only with select substances under specific circumstances.

In summary, both the reactivity and oxidizing power of Group 7 elements increase as you move down the group due to the growing atomic radius and diminishing electronegativity. These traits facilitate the acquisition of electrons and negative ion formation, rendering halogens highly reactive and proficient oxidizing agents. Fluorine stands out as the most reactive halogen, while chlorine is recognized as the strongest oxidizing agent within the group.
