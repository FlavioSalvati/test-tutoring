The boiling and melting points of alkenes rise with increasing molecular weight.

Alkenes are a class of hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of a double bond between two carbon atoms. The boiling and melting points of these compounds are influenced by their molecular weight as well as the strength of the intermolecular forces acting between the molecules. As the molecular weight of alkenes increases, their boiling and melting points also increase. This trend occurs because a larger molecular weight results in a greater number of electrons, which enhances the strength of London dispersion forces among the molecules.

For instance, ethene (C$_2$H$_4$) has a boiling point of $-103.7\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a melting point of $-169.2\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. In comparison, propene (C$_3$H$_6$) exhibits a boiling point of $-47.6\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a melting point of $-185.2\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The variations in boiling and melting points between ethene and propene can be attributed to the higher molecular weight and the stronger intermolecular forces present in propene.

Continuing this trend, butene (C$_4$H$_8$) has a boiling point of $-6.3\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a melting point of $-185.3\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Meanwhile, pentene (C$_5$H$_{10}$) displays a boiling point of $30.3\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ and a melting point of $-138.8\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. This pattern of increasing boiling and melting points with molecular weight persists for higher alkenes.

In conclusion, the boiling and melting points of alkenes increase with greater molecular weight due to an enhanced number of electrons and the resultant stronger intermolecular forces among the molecules.
