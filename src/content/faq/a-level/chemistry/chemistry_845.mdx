Temperature plays a crucial role in influencing the spontaneity of chemical reactions by modifying the energy requirements necessary for these reactions to take place.

At elevated temperatures, the energy needed for a reaction to occur tends to decrease, thereby increasing the reaction's spontaneity. This enhancement is attributed to the rise in kinetic energy of the reactant molecules, which results in more frequent and forceful collisions. Such increased collision energy can effectively surpass the activation energy barrier, facilitating a more favorable environment for the reaction to proceed.

In contrast, at lower temperatures, the energy required for a reaction tends to increase, leading to a decrease in spontaneity. This phenomenon occurs because a decrease in temperature results in reduced kinetic energy of the reactant molecules, causing them to collide less frequently and with diminished force. As a result, the reduced collision energy may fall short of overcoming the activation energy barrier, making the reaction less likely to occur.

A pertinent example of this temperature effect is observed in the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water. At room temperature, this reaction is non-spontaneous and necessitates an external energy source, such as a spark, to initiate the process. However, when the temperature rises—such as in the environment of a combustion engine—the reaction becomes spontaneous and releases energy in the form of heat and light.
