Acyl chlorides, also known as acid chlorides, exhibit greater reactivity compared to carboxylic acids, primarily due to the presence of a highly electronegative chlorine atom.

Acyl chlorides are organic compounds characterized by a functional group that includes a carbonyl group ($\text{C}= \text{O}$) bonded to a chlorine atom ($\text{Cl}$) on the same carbon atom. In contrast, carboxylic acids feature a carboxyl group ($\text{COOH}$), which consists of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group ($\text{OH}$) attached to the same carbon.

The high electronegativity of the chlorine atom in acyl chlorides significantly influences their reactivity. The chlorine atom pulls electron density towards itself, resulting in a partial positive charge on the carbon atom. This electronegativity renders the carbon atom more electrophilic, thereby increasing its tendency to attract nucleophiles (electron-rich species). Consequently, acyl chlorides are highly reactive toward nucleophiles such as water, alcohols, and amines, and readily undergo reactions including hydrolysis, alcoholysis, and aminolysis.

In comparison, carboxylic acids are less reactive due to the presence of the hydroxyl group, which acts as a weaker electron-withdrawing group than the chlorine atom. Although carboxylic acids can participate in reactions such as esterification and amidation, these processes generally proceed at a slower rate and often require a catalyst or elevated temperatures.

In summary, the primary distinction between acyl chlorides and carboxylic acids lies in their reactivity with nucleophiles. Acyl chlorides are more reactive due to the influence of the highly electronegative chlorine atom, which enhances the electrophilic character of the carbon atom.
