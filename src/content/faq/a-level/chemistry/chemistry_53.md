The pH of an aqueous solution serves as an indicator of its acidity or alkalinity, directly reflecting the concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) present in that solution.

Acid-base equilibria describe the balance between the concentrations of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) and hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) in a solution. Solutions characterized by a high concentration of $H^+$ ions are considered acidic, whereas those with a high concentration of $OH^-$ ions are regarded as alkaline. The pH scale extends from $0$ to $14$, with a pH of $7$ representing a neutral state. A pH value below $7$ signifies acidity, while a value above $7$ indicates alkalinity.

To determine the pH of an aqueous solution, one can use either a pH meter or indicator paper. A pH meter functions by measuring the voltage difference between a reference electrode and a glass electrode, which is particularly sensitive to variations in $H^+$ ion concentration. In contrast, indicator paper changes color based on the pH of the solution it contacts.

Acid-base equilibria play a crucial role in biological systems, as numerous biochemical reactions depend on pH levels. For instance, enzymes have specific optimal pH ranges in which they perform most effectively. Deviations from these pH levels can lead to enzyme denaturation, rendering them inactive. Additionally, the pH of bodily fluids—such as blood and urine—is meticulously regulated to ensure homeostasis.

In summary, the pH of an aqueous solution is a vital measure of its acidity or alkalinity, intrinsically linked to acid-base equilibria. This parameter is essential in biological systems, where it is closely monitored to maintain optimal conditions for biochemical reactions.
