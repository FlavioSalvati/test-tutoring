An illustrative example of the use of amine and phthalimide in the Gabriel synthesis is the formation of $1$-aminobutane.

The Gabriel synthesis is a well-established method for synthesizing primary amines from potassium phthalimide and alkyl halides. In this process, phthalimide serves as the source of nitrogen, while the alkyl halide provides the necessary alkyl group. The reaction occurs in two main steps: the first step involves the creation of the phthalimide salt, and the second step entails the nucleophilic displacement of the phthalimide group by the alkyl halide.

To exemplify this, consider the preparation of $1$-aminobutane via the Gabriel synthesis. Initially, potassium phthalimide is reacted with potassium hydroxide, resulting in the formation of the phthalimide salt. Subsequently, this salt is treated with $1$-bromobutane to yield the desired product. The reaction is typically conducted in a polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which facilitates the process.

The Gabriel synthesis is particularly advantageous for producing primary amines that may be challenging to synthesize through other methods. However, it also has certain limitations, including the necessity for a primary alkyl halide and the risk of side reactions, such as the formation of secondary and tertiary amines. Despite these drawbacks, the Gabriel synthesis remains an invaluable technique in the synthetic chemist's repertoire.
