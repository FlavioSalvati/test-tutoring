The heat of vaporization refers to the energy needed to transform a liquid into a gas.

A clear illustration of the heat of vaporization can be observed during the boiling of water. When heat is applied to a pot of water, its temperature rises until it reaches the boiling point, at which stage the water starts to convert into steam, a gaseous state. The heat of vaporization represents the amount of energy required to change liquid water into steam. This energy is absorbed by the water molecules, enabling them to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold them together, thus allowing them to move more freely and transition into the gaseous state.

On the other hand, the heat of fusion is the energy necessary to convert a solid into a liquid.

A practical example of the heat of fusion can be observed when ice melts. As heat is applied to a block of ice, its temperature gradually increases until it reaches the melting point. At this juncture, the ice begins to transform into liquid water. The heat of fusion quantifies the energy required to change solid ice into liquid water. This energy is absorbed by the ice molecules, facilitating the breaking of the bonds that hold them in a rigid structure, enabling them to move more freely and become liquid.
