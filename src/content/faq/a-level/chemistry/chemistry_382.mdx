### Example: Carbon and Its Isotopes

Carbon is a chemical element with the atomic number $6$, which indicates that it has six protons in its nucleus. There are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon: carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14.

**Carbon-12** is the most abundant isotope, constituting approximately $98.9\%$ of all carbon found on Earth. It consists of six protons and six neutrons, resulting in an atomic mass of $12$. **Carbon-13** accounts for about $1.1\%$ of Earth's carbon and has an atomic mass of $13$, due to the presence of an additional neutron. In contrast, **Carbon-14** is a radioactive isotope that exists in a very small proportion of carbon. It contains six protons and eight neutrons, yielding an atomic mass of $14$.

The distinct isotopes of carbon play significant roles in various scientific fields, particularly in archaeology and biology. For instance, carbon-14 is commonly employed in radiocarbon dating, a technique used to ascertain the age of organic materials. Meanwhile, carbon-13 is utilized in stable isotope analysis, which helps trace the flow of carbon through different ecosystems.

Understanding the properties and applications of isotopes is crucial across many scientific disciplines, including biology. By examining the isotopes of elements like carbon, scientists can uncover valuable insights into the natural world and the processes that influence it.
