Chlorine serves as both an oxidizing and disinfecting agent when introduced into water.

It is widely utilized for the disinfection of swimming pools and drinking water supplies. Upon addition to water, chlorine reacts with organic matter and microorganisms—including bacteria and viruses—to produce hypochlorous acid ($\text{HOCl}$) and hypochlorite ions ($\text{OCl}^-$). These compounds function as potent oxidizing agents that disrupt the cell walls and membranes of microorganisms, thereby rendering them harmless.

In addition to its disinfecting capabilities, chlorine's oxidizing properties assist in the removal of impurities from water. It reacts with organic materials, such as algae and bacteria, forming chloramines, which can be efficiently eliminated through filtration. Furthermore, chlorine interacts with common contaminants like iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulfide, resulting in the formation of insoluble compounds that can be easily separated from water through sedimentation or filtration methods.

However, the excessive use of chlorine may lead to the formation of harmful byproducts, such as trihalomethanes (THMs), which have been identified as carcinogenic. Therefore, it is essential to monitor chlorine levels in water closely, ensuring a balance between effective disinfection and safety.

In summary, chlorine is an effective agent for oxidizing and disinfecting water, aiding in the removal of impurities and microorganisms. Nonetheless, it is crucial to use chlorine judiciously and to monitor its concentration to guarantee the safety of drinking water supplies.
