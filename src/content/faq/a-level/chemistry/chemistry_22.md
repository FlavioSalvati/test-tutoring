Paramagnetic transition metal complexes contain unpaired electrons, whereas diamagnetic complexes have all their electrons paired.

Paramagnetic transition metal complexes exhibit unpaired electrons, which results in their attraction to a magnetic field and their ability to be magnetized. The presence of one or more unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals contributes to these properties. Additionally, these complexes are frequently colored because the unpaired electrons can absorb light, promoting them to higher energy levels. Notable examples of paramagnetic complexes include $ \text{Fe}^{2+} $ and $ \text{Cu}^{2+} $.

In contrast, diamagnetic transition metal complexes have all their electrons paired. This configuration means they are not attracted to a magnetic field and cannot be magnetized, as the pairing of electrons in their d-orbitals results in a net magnetic moment of zero. Diamagnetic complexes are often colorless because they do not absorb light in the visible spectrum. Examples of diamagnetic complexes include $ \text{Zn}^{2+} $ and $ \text{Ni}^{2+} $.

To summarize, the primary distinction between paramagnetic and diamagnetic transition metal complexes lies in the presence or absence of unpaired electrons in their d-orbitals. This difference significantly influences their magnetic properties and color characteristics: paramagnetic complexes are attracted to magnetic fields and are often colored, while diamagnetic complexes are not attracted to magnetic fields and tend to be colorless.
