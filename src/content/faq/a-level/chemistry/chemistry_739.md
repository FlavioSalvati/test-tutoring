The boiling and melting points of alcohols vary significantly based on their molecular structure and the strength of their intermolecular forces.

For instance, methanol has a boiling point of $64.7^\circ \text{C}$ and a melting point of $-97.6^\circ \text{C}$. These properties can be attributed to its small molecular size and its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules.

In comparison, ethanol exhibits a higher boiling point of $78.4^\circ \text{C}$ and a melting point of $-114.1^\circ \text{C}$. This increase in boiling and melting points is due to its longer carbon chain, which leads to the formation of weaker hydrogen bonds.

Propanol, which has an even longer carbon chain, has a boiling point of $97.2^\circ \text{C}$ and a melting point of $-126.6^\circ \text{C}$. 

As the length of the carbon chain increases, both the boiling and melting points of the alcohol tend to rise. This trend occurs because longer carbon chains enhance the strength of the intermolecular forces, making it more challenging to separate the molecules from one another.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of alcohols serve as valuable indicators for predicting their physical properties and behavior in various environments.
