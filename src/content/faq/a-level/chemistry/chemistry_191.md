Strong field ligands induce a more significant splitting of the $d$-orbitals, which results in lower energy and more stable coordination complexes. Conversely, weak field ligands lead to less splitting, resulting in higher energy and less stable complexes.

Transition metals possess partially filled $d$-orbitals that can interact with ligands to form coordination complexes. The electron configuration of these complexes is influenced by the strength of the ligands involved. Strong field ligands, such as $\text{CN}^-$ and $\text{CO}$, create a pronounced splitting of the $d$-orbitals, which results in a larger energy gap between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals. This significant energy difference promotes a lower energy, more stable complex, as electrons tend to pair up in the lower energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals before filling the higher energy $e_g$ orbitals.

In contrast, weak field ligands, like $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ and $\text{NH}_3$, cause a smaller degree of splitting in the $d$-orbitals, leading to a reduced energy difference between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals. As a result, these complexes are of higher energy and less stable, allowing electrons to occupy both the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals before pairing occurs. This behavior is characteristic of weak field ligands, which typically result in high-spin complexes, where electrons fill the higher energy orbitals prior to pairing. In contrast, strong field ligands generally lead to low-spin complexes, where electrons are paired in the lower energy orbitals before occupying the higher energy orbitals.

In summary, the strength of the ligands significantly influences the electron configuration of transition metal complexes. Strong field ligands cause greater splitting and yield more stable complexes, while weak field ligands result in less splitting and lead to less stable complexes.
