DNA possesses unique physical properties that set it apart from other organic compounds.

DNA is a long, double-stranded molecule composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide includes a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous bases consist of adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The specific sequence of these bases encodes the genetic information contained within the DNA.

One of the most remarkable physical characteristics of DNA is its shape. DNA adopts a double helix structure, resembling a twisted ladder with two strands that coil around each other. The nitrogenous bases are positioned in the center of this structure, while the sugar-phosphate backbone forms the outer sides.

Another crucial physical property of DNA is its stability. The hydrogen bonds that connect the nitrogenous bases effectively hold the two strands of DNA together, and these bonds exhibit considerable strength. However, DNA can be susceptible to damage from exposure to radiation, chemicals, and various environmental factors.

Additionally, DNA carries a negative charge due to the phosphate groups present in its backbone. This negative charge facilitates the separation and analysis of DNA using techniques such as gel electrophoresis.

In conclusion, DNA has distinct physical properties that differentiate it from other organic compounds. Its double helix structure, stability, and negative charge are vital features that enable it to function as the repository of genetic information.
