An example of the ester and ketone involved in the Claisen condensation is ethyl acetate and ethyl propionate.

The Claisen condensation is a chemical reaction that occurs between two esters or between an ester and a ketone. This reaction results in the formation of either a β-ketoester or a β-diketone. During the process, the carbonyl group of one molecule serves as a nucleophile, attacking the α-carbon of another molecule. This interaction leads to the creation of a new carbon-carbon bond, accompanied by the elimination of a leaving group, which is typically an alkoxide ion.

A specific instance of the Claisen condensation involves the reaction between ethyl acetate and ethyl propionate. In this case, ethyl acetate has a carbonyl group at the α-carbon position and an ethyl group at the β-carbon position, while ethyl propionate features a carbonyl group at the β-carbon and an ethyl group at the α-carbon. When these two compounds react in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium ethoxide, the carbonyl group of ethyl acetate attacks the α-carbon of ethyl propionate. This interaction results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond and the elimination of an ethoxide ion. The product of this reaction is a β-ketoester known as ethyl 3-oxobutanoate.

In summary, the Claisen condensation is a crucial reaction in organic chemistry, facilitating the synthesis of β-ketoesters and β-diketones. These compounds serve as versatile building blocks for the preparation of a wide range of organic molecules.
