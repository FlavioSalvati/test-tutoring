The equilibrium constant, denoted as $K_c$, quantifies the extent to which a chemical reaction proceeds to completion.

For instance, consider the reaction 

$$
A + B \rightleftharpoons C + D.
$$ 

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by the expression 

$$
K_c = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]},
$$ 

where $[C]$, $[D]$, $[A]$, and $[B]$ represent the equilibrium concentrations of the respective species. If $K_c$ is greater than 1, it indicates that the reaction favors the formation of products. Conversely, if $K_c$ is less than 1, the reaction favors the reactants. When $K_c$ equals 1, it signifies that the system is at equilibrium, with equal concentrations of reactants and products.

Another illustrative example is the reaction 

$$
2H_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2H_2O(g).
$$ 

The equilibrium constant for this reaction can be expressed as 

$$
K_c = \frac{[H_2O]^2}{[H_2]^2[O_2]}.
$$ 

This reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat, and it has a very large equilibrium constant, which indicates a strong preference for the products.

The equilibrium constant can be influenced by changes in temperature, pressure, and concentration. For example, increasing the concentration of a reactant will typically shift the equilibrium position towards the products, while decreasing the concentration of a product will shift it towards the reactants.

Understanding the equilibrium constant is crucial in various biological contexts, including enzyme kinetics and metabolic pathways. By analyzing the equilibrium constant of a reaction, researchers can predict the direction and extent of the reaction under different conditions and design experiments to manipulate the equilibrium to achieve desired results.
