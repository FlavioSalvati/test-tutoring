The boiling and melting points of amines are influenced by their molecular structure.

Amines are organic compounds characterized by the presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to one or more alkyl or aryl groups. The boiling and melting points of these compounds are determined by the strength of the intermolecular forces that act between their molecules.

Primary amines typically exhibit higher boiling and melting points compared to secondary amines. This is primarily due to the presence of hydrogen bonds that form between the nitrogen and hydrogen atoms. In contrast, tertiary amines have the lowest boiling and melting points because they do not possess these hydrogen bonds.

Additionally, amines with longer carbon chains generally have higher boiling and melting points. This increase is attributed to the greater van der Waals forces that arise from the larger surface area of the molecules. Aromatic amines, such as aniline, also tend to have elevated boiling and melting points compared to their aliphatic counterparts. This is largely due to the pi-pi stacking interactions that can occur between the aromatic rings.

For instance, ethylamine ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$) has a boiling point of $-6.9\,^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-80.5\,^\circ\text{C}$. In comparison, aniline ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$) has a boiling point of $184.4\,^\circ\text{C}$ and a melting point of $-6.0\,^\circ\text{C}$.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of amines are determined by their molecular structure, specifically factors such as the presence of hydrogen bonds, the length of the carbon chains, and the degree of aromaticity.
