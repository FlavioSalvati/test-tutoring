Acidic hydrolysis is a chemical reaction where a molecule is decomposed into its constituent parts through the addition of water, facilitated by an acid catalyst. A prime example of this process is the breakdown of an ester, which is an organic compound commonly found in fats and oils. When an ester is subjected to an acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, the ester bond is cleaved, resulting in the formation of an alcohol and a carboxylic acid.

Conversely, basic hydrolysis is a chemical reaction in which a molecule is similarly broken down by the addition of water, but this time in the presence of a base catalyst. An illustrative case of this is the hydrolysis of a peptide bond, which links amino acids in proteins. When a peptide bond encounters a base catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide, the bond is cleaved, leading to the release of the individual amino acids.

In both acidic and basic hydrolysis reactions, the introduction of water is crucial for the decomposition of the molecule. However, the choice of catalyst significantly influences the specific mechanism of breakdown. Acidic hydrolysis is generally employed to decompose esters and various organic compounds, while basic hydrolysis is typically utilized for breaking down peptide bonds and other chemical links within biological molecules.
