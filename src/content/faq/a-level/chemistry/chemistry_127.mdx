The electron configuration of transition elements is characterized by the presence of partially filled $d$ orbitals.

Transition elements, found in the $d$-block of the periodic table (groups 3 to 12), exhibit unique properties due to their electron configurations. The key feature of these elements is their partially filled $d$ orbitals, which occur because the energy levels of the $d$ orbitals are closely aligned with those of the outermost $s$ orbital. This proximity allows electrons to transition easily between the two types of orbitals. Consequently, transition elements are capable of exhibiting a wide range of oxidation states, a defining characteristic of their chemistry.

The electron configurations of transition elements can be determined using the Aufbau principle. This principle states that electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy. For instance, the electron configuration of chromium (Cr) is represented as $$[Ar] \, 3d^5 \, 4s^1$$, indicating that it possesses five electrons in its $d$ orbital and one electron in its outermost $s$ orbital. Similarly, copper (Cu) has the electron configuration $$[Ar] \, 3d^{10} \, 4s^1$$, which means it contains ten electrons in its $d$ orbital and one electron in its outermost $s$ orbital.

The partially filled $d$ orbitals of transition elements contribute to several of their distinctive properties, including their ability to form complex ions and compounds, their catalytic activity, and the vibrant colors of their compounds. These characteristics render transition elements essential in various applications, spanning industrial processes to biological systems.
