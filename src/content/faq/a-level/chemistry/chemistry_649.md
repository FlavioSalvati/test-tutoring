Hereâ€™s an enhanced version of your content for clarity and readability, with proper formatting of mathematical expressions and numbers:

An example of an azide is sodium azide, while an example of an amine is ethylamine.

Azides are chemical compounds that contain the azide functional group, represented as $-N_3$. These compounds are widely utilized in organic synthesis and serve as propellants in airbags. Sodium azide, with the chemical formula $\text{NaN}_3$, is a commonly used azide that is known for its high toxicity and explosive properties. It plays a crucial role in the production of various chemicals, including dyes and pharmaceuticals.

Amines, on the other hand, are organic compounds characterized by the presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to one or more carbon atoms. They serve as essential building blocks in the synthesis of many chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, and polymers. Ethylamine, represented by the formula $\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$, is a primary amine frequently used in the manufacture of pesticides, rubber, and pharmaceuticals.

Both azides and amines hold significant importance in the field of organic chemistry. Azides are valuable in the synthesis of numerous compounds, whereas amines are vital components in the production of various chemicals. A thorough understanding of the properties and reactions associated with these compounds is essential for students studying organic chemistry.
