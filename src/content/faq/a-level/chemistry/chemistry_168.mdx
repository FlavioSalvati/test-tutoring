Hydrolysis and complexation are prevalent reactions that occur in aqueous solutions.

**Hydrolysis** is a chemical process in which water is employed to decompose a compound. This reaction typically takes place when a salt is dissolved in water, leading to the dissociation of the salt into its constituent ions. For instance, when sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$) is dissolved in water, it dissociates into sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$). The hydrolysis of $\text{NaCl}$ serves as a straightforward example of a neutralization reaction.

**Complexation**, on the other hand, is a chemical reaction that occurs when a molecule or ion interacts with a metal ion to form a coordination complex. This reaction happens when a metal ion is dissolved in water and a ligand binds to it. For example, when copper (II) ions ($\text{Cu}^{2+}$) are introduced into water, they can form a complex with ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), resulting in the formation of the complex $\left[\text{Cu}(\text{NH}_3)_4\right]^{2+}$. This species is referred to as a coordination complex.

Both hydrolysis and complexation reactions play crucial roles in biological systems. Hydrolysis is essential for the breakdown of macromolecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Meanwhile, complexation is vital for the transport of metal ions within biological systems, exemplified by the binding of iron to transferrin in the bloodstream.

In summary, hydrolysis and complexation are significant reactions in aqueous solutions. Hydrolysis entails the decomposition of compounds through the action of water, whereas complexation involves the binding of molecules or ions to metal ions. These processes are critical in biological systems for the degradation of macromolecules and the transportation of metal ions.
