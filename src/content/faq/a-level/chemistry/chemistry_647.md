An illustrative example of a diazonium salt is benzene diazonium chloride, while nitrobenzene serves as a representative nitro compound.

Benzene diazonium chloride is a widely utilized diazonium salt in organic chemistry. It appears as a white crystalline solid and is characterized by its high reactivity, owing to the presence of the diazonium group ($-N_2^+$). This functional group is capable of facilitating the formation of various compounds, notably azo dyes, which are extensively employed in the textile industry.

On the other hand, nitrobenzene is a nitro compound that functions as a precursor to aniline, a crucial chemical in the manufacture of dyes, pharmaceuticals, and rubber chemicals. Nitrobenzene is a pale yellow liquid with a sweet, pleasant odor; however, it is highly toxic and can lead to severe health issues if ingested or inhaled.

The reaction between benzene diazonium chloride and nitrobenzene exemplifies a diazo coupling reaction. During this process, the diazonium salt reacts with the nitro compound to yield an azo compound. Typically, this reaction is conducted in the presence of a catalyst, such as copper powder or cuprous oxide.

In summary, diazonium salts and nitro compounds represent significant classes of organic compounds with broad applications in the chemical industry. Their high reactivity enables the formation of a diverse array of compounds, including dyes, pharmaceuticals, and rubber chemicals.
