Amino acids exhibit a range of boiling and melting points, primarily due to differences in their chemical structures.

The boiling and melting points of amino acids are influenced by their unique chemical compositions. For instance, glycine, recognized as the simplest amino acid, has a melting point of $240^\circ C$ and a boiling point of $233^\circ C$. In contrast, tryptophan, which is larger and possesses a more complex structure, has a melting point of $290^\circ C$ and a boiling point of $542^\circ C$.

The variations in these physical properties can be attributed to the types of chemical bonds present within the amino acid molecules. Amino acids contain functional groups, such as carboxyl and amino groups, which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with one another. The strength of these hydrogen bonds plays a significant role in determining the boiling and melting points of the amino acids.

Moreover, the presence of aromatic rings in certain amino acids, such as phenylalanine and tryptophan, further influences their boiling and melting points. Aromatic rings are associated with strong intermolecular forces, which can contribute to higher boiling and melting points.

In summary, the boiling and melting points of amino acids can vary significantly due to their distinct chemical structures. Understanding this variation is crucial for comprehending the properties and behaviors of proteins, which are composed of long chains of amino acids.
