An animal is defined as a multicellular organism that arises through the process of sexual reproduction.

Animals represent a highly diverse group of organisms inhabiting nearly every habitat on Earth. They are distinguished by their capacity for movement, their consumption of organic matter, and their ability to respond to environmental stimuli. As multicellular organisms, animals consist of more than one cell. Furthermore, they are classified as eukaryotic, which means their cells contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.

The formation of animals typically begins with sexual reproduction. In the majority of animal species, this process involves the fusion of a sperm cell and an egg cell, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The zygote subsequently undergoes a series of cell divisions, ultimately developing into a structure known as a blastula. Following this, the blastula undergoes further differentiation, transforming into a gastrula, which consists of three primary germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These germ layers are essential as they give rise to the various tissues and organs within the animal.

Animals are categorized into distinct groups based on various characteristics, such as body symmetry, the presence or absence of a backbone, and the type of digestive system they possess. The animal kingdom is broadly divided into several major groups, including sponges, cnidarians, mollusks, arthropods, chordates, and many others.

In summary, animals are intricate organisms that develop through sexual reproduction and progress through a series of developmental stages to form diverse tissues and organs. A comprehensive understanding of the process of animal formation is crucial for the study of animal biology and evolution.
