Crystal defects in materials come in various forms, each possessing distinct characteristics that influence the material's properties.

**Point Defects**  
Point defects represent the simplest category of crystal defects, arising from irregularities in the atomic arrangement. These defects can be classified into three main types: vacancies, interstitials, and substitutional defects. 

- **Vacancies** occur when an atom is absent from its designated lattice site.
- **Interstitials** arise when an atom is positioned in the space between lattice points.
- **Substitutional defects** happen when an atom in the lattice is replaced by a different type of atom.

**Line Defects**  
Line defects, commonly referred to as dislocations, occur due to misalignments of atoms along a line within the crystal lattice. Dislocations can be further classified into two types: edge dislocations and screw dislocations.

- **Edge dislocations** are characterized by the insertion of an extra half-plane of atoms into the lattice.
- **Screw dislocations** occur when the lattice exhibits a twist around a central axis.

**Surface Defects**  
Surface defects manifest at the boundaries between two crystals or between a crystal and its surrounding environment. These can be categorized as grain boundaries, twin boundaries, or stacking faults.

- **Grain boundaries** form when two crystals with differing orientations come together.
- **Twin boundaries** arise when there is a mirror image of the crystal lattice across a specific plane.
- **Stacking faults** occur when there is a deviation from the regular stacking sequence of atoms.

In summary, crystal defects exhibit unique characteristics and can be found across different materials. A comprehensive understanding of these defects is crucial for grasping the properties and behavior of materials in various applications.
