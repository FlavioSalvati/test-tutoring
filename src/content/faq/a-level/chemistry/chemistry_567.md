A polymer is a large molecule composed of repeating units known as monomers. One well-known example of a polymer is polyethylene.

Polymers are classified as macromolecules, which means they consist of many smaller, repeating units called monomers. These monomers are relatively small molecules that can chemically bond together to form long, chain-like structures. When these chains are formed, they result in the creation of a polymer. Polymers can be categorized into two main types: natural and synthetic. Natural polymers include substances such as proteins, DNA, and cellulose, while synthetic polymers encompass materials like plastics, rubber, and nylon.

Polyethylene, specifically, is a synthetic polymer made up of repeating units of ethylene monomers. It is widely utilized in various applications, including packaging materials such as plastic bags and bottles, as well as in toys, electrical insulation, and piping. Polyethylene can be produced in several forms, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE), each of which possesses distinct properties and applications.

The versatility of polymers allows for a broad range of applications across various fields, including medicine, electronics, and construction. Polymers can be engineered to exhibit specific characteristics such as strength, flexibility, and biocompatibility, tailored to their intended use. However, the manufacturing and disposal of certain synthetic polymers can lead to significant environmental challenges, such as pollution and waste accumulation. Consequently, there is an increasing focus on the development of sustainable and biodegradable polymers to mitigate these environmental impacts.
