In the process of electrolysis, the quantity of substance produced and the electric current applied are crucial factors.

Electrolysis involves utilizing an electric current to initiate a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. The quantity of substance, often referred to as the charge quantity, is measured in coulombs ($C$). This measurement represents the amount of electric charge that flows through a conductor in one second when a current of one ampere ($A$) is applied. The quantity of substance generated is directly proportional to the current; thus, an increase in current results in a greater production of substance.

Current refers to the flow of electric charge through a conductor and is measured in amperes ($A$). During electrolysis, the current serves to drive the chemical reaction by supplying the energy necessary to break the bonds between atoms or molecules in the substance undergoing electrolysis. The specific amount of current required depends on the characteristics of the material being electrolyzed and the desired reaction rate. Generally, a higher current leads to a faster reaction.

For instance, consider the electrolysis of water. The amount of substance produced is directly proportional to the current applied. If a current of $1 \, A$ is passed through water for one second, this results in $1 \, C$ of charge passing through the water, producing approximately $0.0112 \, g$ of hydrogen gas and $0.056 \, g$ of oxygen gas. If the current is increased to $2 \, A$, the quantity of substance produced will double. Thus, it is evident that both the amount of substance and the current are significant factors in the process of electrolysis.
