Aldehydes and ketones are both classes of organic compounds that feature a carbonyl group, yet they exhibit distinct structural and property differences.

Aldehydes possess a carbonyl group ($-C=O$) located at the terminal end of a carbon chain, while ketones have a carbonyl group situated between two carbon atoms. This fundamental difference in structure significantly influences their physical and chemical characteristics. For instance, aldehydes generally have lower boiling points compared to ketones. This is primarily due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, facilitated by the presence of a terminal hydroxyl group ($-OH$). In contrast, ketones have higher boiling points because they lack the capacity to form such hydrogen bonds with water.

In terms of reactivity, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones. This increased reactivity is attributed to the polarity of the carbonyl group in aldehydes, which is enhanced by the presence of a hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon. Consequently, aldehydes are more susceptible to nucleophilic attacks and oxidation. They can be readily oxidized to form carboxylic acids, whereas ketones exhibit greater resistance to oxidation reactions.

The chemical behavior of aldehydes and ketones also diverges in their reactions. Aldehydes can participate in nucleophilic addition reactions with various reagents, including hydrogen cyanide and sodium bisulfite, while ketones do not react in the same way. However, ketones are capable of undergoing nucleophilic addition reactions with Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds, which aldehydes cannot.

In summary, while aldehydes and ketones share the common feature of a carbonyl group, they differ markedly in their structural arrangements, physical and chemical properties, and reactivity towards various compounds.
