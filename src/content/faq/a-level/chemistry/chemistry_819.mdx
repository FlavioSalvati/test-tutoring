Phosphines and amines are two distinct classes of organic compounds, each characterized by their unique functional groups.

Phosphines are organic compounds featuring a phosphorus atom that is bonded to three organic groups along with one lone pair of electrons. While they share similarities with amines in terms of basicity and their capacity to form salts, phosphines exhibit weaker basicity. This reduced basicity is primarily attributed to the larger atomic size of the phosphorus atom. Phosphines are widely utilized as ligands in coordination chemistry and as reducing agents in various organic synthesis processes.

In contrast, amines are organic compounds that consist of a nitrogen atom bonded to either two or three organic groups. The basicity of amines arises from the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, which can readily accept a proton, resulting in a positively charged species. Amines can be categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the number of organic groups attached to the nitrogen atom. They play a crucial role in biological systems, as they are integral components of numerous biomolecules, including amino acids, neurotransmitters, and nucleotides.

When comparing their physical properties, amines generally exhibit higher boiling points than phosphines. This difference is due to the stronger hydrogen bonding interactions between nitrogen and hydrogen atoms in amines. Additionally, amines tend to have a more pronounced odor compared to phosphines, which are typically odorless. Moreover, the polarity of amines is greater than that of phosphines, a consequence of the electronegativity difference between nitrogen and hydrogen, as opposed to the smaller electronegativity difference between phosphorus and hydrogen.
