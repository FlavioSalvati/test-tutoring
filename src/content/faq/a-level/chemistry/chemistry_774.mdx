Fullerenes represent a unique class of carbon allotropes characterized by their diverse shapes and sizes.

A prominent example of a fullerene is Buckminsterfullerene, commonly referred to as $C_{60}$. This molecule features a structure resembling a soccer ball, formed by $60$ carbon atoms arranged in a combination of hexagons and pentagons. The discovery of $C_{60}$ occurred in $1985$, thanks to the pioneering work of Harold Kroto, Robert Curl, and Richard Smalley, who were subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in $1996$ for their groundbreaking discovery.

Another variant of fullerene is Carbon Nanotubes, which are elongated, cylindrical structures composed of carbon atoms. These tubes can be classified as either single-walled or multi-walled, depending on the number of carbon atom layers they contain. Carbon nanotubes possess remarkable properties that render them suitable for a wide array of applications, including electronics, energy storage, and drug delivery.

Graphene, which can also be classified as a type of fullerene, consists of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, akin to the hexagonal patterns found in Buckminsterfullerene. Graphene is noted for its exceptional strength, lightweight nature, and excellent electrical conductivity, making it highly valuable for applications in electronics, energy storage, and water filtration.

In summary, fullerenes encompass an intriguing group of carbon allotropes with a variety of shapes and sizes. From the soccer ball-like Buckminsterfullerene to the slender Carbon Nanotubes and the flat, hexagonal structure of Graphene, each type of fullerene displays distinct properties that contribute to its wide-ranging applications.
