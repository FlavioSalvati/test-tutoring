The common ion effect plays a significant role in influencing the stability of complex ions, as illustrated by the formation of silver chloride.

When silver ions ($\text{Ag}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$) interact, they form a complex known as silver chloride ($\text{AgCl}$). This reaction is reversible, meaning that silver chloride can dissociate back into its constituent ions. However, the presence of a common ion, such as chloride ions in the solution, can significantly affect the equilibrium of this reaction.

If additional chloride ions are introduced into the solution, the equilibrium will shift toward the dissociation of the silver chloride complex. This occurs because the increased concentration of the common ion (chloride) reduces the concentration of silver ions ($\text{Ag}^+$). Consequently, the likelihood of silver ions combining with chloride ions to form the complex diminishes, leading to a decrease in the stability of the silver chloride complex.

Conversely, if the concentration of silver ions is increased, the equilibrium will shift toward the formation of more silver chloride complex. The higher concentration of silver ions enhances the probability of their interaction with chloride ions, thus promoting the formation of the complex. As a result, the stability of the silver chloride complex increases.

In summary, the common ion effect can significantly influence the stability of complex ions. By understanding this phenomenon, scientists can strategically manipulate the equilibrium of chemical reactions to favor either the formation or dissociation of specific complexes.
