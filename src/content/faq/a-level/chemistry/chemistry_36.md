Group 3 elements exhibit a range of reactivity and oxidation states.

Located in the central block of the periodic table, Group 3 includes the elements boron ($\text{B}$), aluminium ($\text{Al}$), gallium ($\text{Ga}$), indium ($\text{In}$), and thallium ($\text{Tl}$). These elements possess three valence electrons, which typically leads them to form compounds with a +3 oxidation state. However, some compounds can also exhibit a +1 oxidation state.

Among these, boron is the least reactive. It does not react with water or acids under normal conditions. In contrast, aluminium is highly reactive; it readily combines with oxygen to form a protective oxide layer. Gallium, indium, and thallium are also quite reactive and can react with water and acids, resulting in the formation of hydroxides and salts.

The reactivity of Group 3 elements is influenced by their atomic radius and electronegativity. As one moves down the group, the atomic radius increases, leading to a decrease in reactivity. This trend occurs because the outermost electrons are farther from the nucleus, resulting in a weaker attraction to other atoms. Additionally, electronegativity decreases down the group, indicating that these atoms are less capable of attracting electrons to form bonds.

In conclusion, Group 3 elements display varying levels of reactivity and oxidation states. Boron is the least reactive, while aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium are significantly more reactive. The variations in reactivity can be attributed to changes in atomic radius and electronegativity among the elements.
