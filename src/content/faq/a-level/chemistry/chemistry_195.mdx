Exothermic and endothermic reactions represent two fundamental classes of chemical processes that differ in their energy exchange with the surroundings.

Exothermic reactions are characterized by the release of energy, primarily in the form of heat, light, or sound. In these reactions, the products possess less energy than the reactants, and the surplus energy is emitted into the environment. Notable examples of exothermic reactions include combustion, where a fuel reacts with oxygen to produce heat and light, and neutralization, which occurs when an acid reacts with a base to form water and a salt, simultaneously releasing heat.

In contrast, endothermic reactions absorb energy from their surroundings. As a result, the products of these reactions have higher energy than the reactants, drawing the necessary energy from the environment. Common examples of endothermic reactions include photosynthesis, wherein plants capture energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, and the melting of ice, which requires energy to break the bonds between water molecules.

The energy changes associated with exothermic and endothermic reactions can be quantified using calorimetry. This technique involves measuring the temperature fluctuations in the surroundings. Specifically, exothermic reactions lead to an increase in temperature, while endothermic reactions result in a decrease. A thorough understanding of the distinctions between exothermic and endothermic reactions is crucial in various fields of biology, including metabolism, respiration, and thermoregulation.
