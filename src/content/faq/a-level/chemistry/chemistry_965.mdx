The distinction between positive and negative free energy in a chemical reaction is fundamental to understanding their energy requirements.

Chemical reactions involve energy transfer, which is quantified by free energy. Free energy, denoted as $\Delta G$, represents the amount of energy available to perform work. A negative value of $\Delta G$ signifies that the reaction releases energy, whereas a positive value indicates that the reaction requires energy.

Reactions characterized by a negative $\Delta G$ are termed exergonic. These reactions release energy that can be utilized to drive various cellular processes. Exergonic reactions are spontaneous, meaning they can occur without external energy input. A classic example of an exergonic reaction is the breakdown of glucose during cellular respiration.

On the other hand, reactions with a positive $\Delta G$ are classified as endergonic. Such reactions require an input of energy, which may be derived from several sources, including sunlight or the hydrolysis of ATP. Endergonic reactions are non-spontaneous and necessitate external energy to proceed. An example of an endergonic reaction is the synthesis of glucose during photosynthesis.

In conclusion, the values of free energy in a chemical reaction indicate differing energy requirements. A negative $\Delta G$ denotes an exergonic reaction that releases energy, while a positive $\Delta G$ signifies an endergonic reaction that necessitates energy input.
