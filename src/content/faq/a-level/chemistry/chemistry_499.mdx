A lactone is a type of cyclic ester, exemplified by gamma-butyrolactone. In contrast, a common example of an ester is ethyl acetate.

Lactones are organic compounds characterized by a cyclic ester functional group. This structure includes a ring that contains both an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group ($\text{C=O}$) within the ring. A well-known lactone is gamma-butyrolactone, which is widely utilized as a solvent and in the synthesis of various chemicals. Additionally, lactones are naturally occurring compounds found in the structures of some antibiotics and hormones.

Esters, on the other hand, are another category of organic compounds that feature a carbonyl group ($\text{C=O}$) bonded to an oxygen atom, which is in turn bonded to an alkyl or aryl group. Ethyl acetate serves as a prominent example of an ester and is frequently used as a solvent in the manufacture of various chemicals, including fragrances and flavorings. Esters are also present in nature, notably within the structures of certain fats and oils.

Both lactones and esters play significant roles in organic chemistry and have diverse applications in both industry and natural processes. For A-Level Biology students studying organic chemistry, understanding the structures and properties of these compounds is essential.
