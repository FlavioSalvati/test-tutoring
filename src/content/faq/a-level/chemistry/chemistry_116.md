Interhalogen compounds exhibit a range of reactivity and stability properties based on the halogens that constitute them.

These compounds are formed through the combination of two different halogens, and their high reactivity is primarily attributed to the differences in electronegativity between the two halogens involved. The reactivity of interhalogen compounds is influenced by both the size and electronegativity of the halogens. For instance, compounds that include fluorine are generally more reactive than those that contain iodine. This heightened reactivity can be explained by fluorine being the most electronegative element, coupled with its small atomic size, which facilitates bond formation.

The stability of interhalogen compounds, on the other hand, is contingent upon the strength of the bonds that form between the two halogens. Bond strength is affected by both the size and electronegativity of the halogens involved. Typically, larger halogens tend to form weaker bonds, resulting in less stable compounds. For example, interhalogen compounds containing iodine are less stable than those containing fluorine, as the bond between two large iodine atoms is weaker than the bond between two smaller fluorine atoms.

In summary, interhalogen compounds are characterized by their high reactivity, which arises from the differences in electronegativity between the two halogens. Their reactivity is influenced by the size and electronegativity of the halogens involved. Conversely, the stability of these compounds is determined by the bond strength between the halogens, again influenced by their size and electronegativity.
