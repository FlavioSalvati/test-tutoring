The boiling points of different molecules vary significantly, primarily due to the differences in their intermolecular forces.

A molecule's boiling point is influenced by the strength of its intermolecular interactions, which include hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and London dispersion forces. Molecules that exhibit stronger intermolecular forces necessitate greater energy input to overcome these forces and transition to the gaseous phase, resulting in a higher boiling point.

For instance, water has a boiling point of $100^\circ C$ largely because of its robust hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules require substantial energy to dissociate, which accounts for water's relatively high boiling temperature. In contrast, methane has a much lower boiling point of $-161^\circ C$, as it is held together primarily by weak London dispersion forces.

Another illustrative example is ethanol, which has a boiling point of $78^\circ C$. This is attributable to the presence of both hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. These intermolecular forces are significantly stronger than the London dispersion forces found in methane, which explains why ethanol has a higher boiling point.

In conclusion, the boiling point of a molecule is fundamentally determined by the strength of its intermolecular forces. Molecules with stronger intermolecular interactions require more energy to break these bonds, leading to higher boiling points.
