### Example of a Carboxylic Acid and an Ester

A **carboxylic acid** is a type of organic compound that features a carboxyl group \((-COOH)\) attached to a carbon atom. A well-known example of a carboxylic acid is **acetic acid**, which is commonly found in vinegar and has the chemical formula \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \).

On the other hand, an **ester** is produced through a reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Esters are characterized by their sweet, fruity aromas and are frequently utilized in perfumes and flavorings. A notable example of an ester is **ethyl acetate**, which serves as a solvent and is represented by the chemical formula \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOCH}_2\text{CH}_3 \).

Both carboxylic acids and esters play significant roles in biological systems. Carboxylic acids are integral to the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates and are key components in the synthesis of proteins and other biomolecules. Esters, on the other hand, are present in many natural products, including fats and oils, and are also involved in the synthesis of hormones and various signaling molecules.

In summary, **acetic acid** exemplifies a carboxylic acid, while **ethyl acetate** serves as an example of an ester. Both compounds are vital in biological processes and have diverse applications in industry and daily life.
