Electrolysis is a process that involves the application of an electric current to a substance, inducing a chemical reaction.

In this process, the substance undergoing electrolysis is referred to as the electrolyte. The electrolyte can either be a molten ionic compound or an aqueous solution containing ions. When an electric current flows through the electrolyte, the ions migrate towards the electrodes. At these electrodes, the ions undergo a change: they either gain or lose electrons, resulting in a chemical reaction.

Electrolysis is closely related to redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions, as it entails the transfer of electrons between the electrodes and the ions present in the electrolyte. In redox reactions, one species loses electrons (a process known as oxidation), while another species gains electrons (referred to as reduction). Specifically in electrolysis, the species that gains electrons is reduced, whereas the species that loses electrons is oxidized.

Electrolysis has numerous practical applications, including the extraction and purification of metals, as well as the synthesis of various chemicals. It is also utilized in electroplating, a technique where a metal layer is deposited onto a surface through the process of electrolysis. A solid understanding of electrolysis and redox reactions is essential for A-Level Biology students, as these concepts are pertinent to many fields within chemistry and biology.
