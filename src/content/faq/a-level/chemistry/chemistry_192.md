Electrophilic substitution is a reaction mechanism in which an electrophile replaces a hydrogen atom in an aromatic compound.

Aromatic compounds are organic molecules characterized by the presence of a benzene ring or a similar ring structure. These compounds are notable for their stability and distinctive properties, including their capacity to undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. During these reactions, an electrophile—defined as a species that is attracted to electrons—attacks the aromatic ring, displacing one of the hydrogen atoms. This process results in the formation of a new compound with a different functional group attached to the aromatic ring.

The mechanism of electrophilic substitution can be divided into three primary steps: activation, attack, and deactivation. 

1. **Activation**: In this initial step, the electrophile is attracted to the electron-rich $\pi$ bonds of the aromatic ring.
2. **Attack**: Following activation, the electrophile attacks the aromatic ring, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate.
3. **Deactivation**: In the final step, the carbocation intermediate is stabilized through the loss of a proton, resulting in the formation of the substituted aromatic compound.

Electrophilic substitution plays a crucial role in organic chemistry, particularly in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, dyes, and various other organic compounds. For A-Level Biology students aspiring to pursue careers in chemistry or related fields, a solid understanding of the electrophilic substitution mechanism is essential.
