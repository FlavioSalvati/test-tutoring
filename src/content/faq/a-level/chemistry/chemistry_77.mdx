The general formula for alkanes is given by 

$$ C_nH_{2n+2} $$ 

while the general formula for alkenes is 

$$ C_nH_{2n} $$.

**Alkanes** are a class of hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. The formula 

$$ C_nH_{2n+2} $$ 

indicates that for each alkane, $n$ represents the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. For instance, methane (CH₄) is the simplest alkane, consisting of one carbon atom, which gives it the formula 

$$ C_1H_4 $$.

Ethane (C₂H₆), which contains two carbon atoms, has the formula 

$$ C_2H_6 $$.

Alkanes are classified as saturated hydrocarbons, meaning they possess the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that can bond with their carbon structure.

**Alkenes**, in contrast, are hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of at least one double bond between carbon atoms. The general formula for alkenes is 

$$ C_nH_{2n} $$,

where $n$ again denotes the number of carbon atoms. For example, ethene (C₂H₄) is the simplest alkene, consisting of two carbon atoms, which gives it the formula 

$$ C_2H_4 $$.

Alkenes are categorized as unsaturated hydrocarbons because they contain fewer hydrogen atoms compared to their corresponding alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms.

In summary, the general formula for alkanes is 

$$ C_nH_{2n+2} $$ 

and for alkenes, it is 

$$ C_nH_{2n} $$. 

Alkanes consist solely of single bonds between carbon atoms and are considered saturated hydrocarbons, while alkenes feature at least one double bond between carbon atoms and are classified as unsaturated hydrocarbons.
