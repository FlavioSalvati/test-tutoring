The enthalpy of formation is defined as the energy change that occurs when one mole of a compound is synthesized from its constituent elements.

This thermodynamic property quantifies the energy change associated with the formation of a compound from its elements in their standard states under standard conditions, which are typically set at a temperature of $298 \, \text{K}$ and a pressure of $1 \, \text{atm}$.

The enthalpy of formation is instrumental in assessing the stability of compounds. A negative enthalpy of formation indicates that the compound is stable and the formation reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy. Conversely, a positive enthalpy of formation suggests that the compound is unstable and the reaction is endothermic, implying that energy is absorbed.

Additionally, the enthalpy of formation serves as a valuable tool for calculating the energy changes that occur during chemical reactions. By utilizing the enthalpy of formation values for both reactants and products, one can determine the overall enthalpy change of a reaction through Hess's law.

In summary, the enthalpy of formation measures the energy change involved in the formation of a compound from its elements. It is crucial for predicting the stability of compounds and for calculating the energy released or absorbed during chemical reactions.
