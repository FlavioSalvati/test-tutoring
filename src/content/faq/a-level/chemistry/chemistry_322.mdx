The common ion effect refers to the phenomenon where the presence of a common ion decreases the solubility of a salt in solution. This effect can also influence the formation of complexes.

When a salt is dissolved in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions. For instance, when sodium chloride ($\text{NaCl}$) dissolves in water, it dissociates into sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$). If another salt that contains either $\text{Na}^+$ or $\text{Cl}^-$ is introduced into the solution, the concentration of that common ion will increase. This rise in concentration can lead to a decrease in the solubility of the original salt, as the equilibrium shifts toward the formation of the undissociated salt.

The common ion effect also plays a significant role in complex formation. Complexes are formed when a metal ion binds to one or more ligands. The stability of these complexes is influenced by the strength of the metal-ligand bonds, as well as the concentrations of the metal ions and ligands present in the solution. When a common ion is present, it can compete with the metal ion for binding sites on the ligand. This competition can reduce the concentration of the metal ion in solution, thereby diminishing the stability of the complex.

In summary, the common ion effect is a crucial factor to consider in both solubility and complex formation. By understanding this effect, scientists can more accurately predict and manipulate chemical reactions.
