Interstitial alloys consist of smaller atoms that occupy the spaces, or interstitial sites, between larger atoms in a crystal lattice. Unlike substitutional alloys, the smaller atoms do not replace the larger ones; instead, they fit into the gaps between them. This arrangement increases the density of the alloy and enhances its hardness and strength. A notable example of an interstitial alloy is steel, which is produced by adding carbon to iron.

On the other hand, substitutional alloys are formed when atoms of similar sizes replace one another within the crystal lattice. This process typically results in minimal changes to the overall density of the alloy; however, it can significantly alter the material's properties. For instance, brass is a substitutional alloy created by substituting some copper atoms with zinc atoms, which enhances the alloy's malleability and ductility compared to pure copper.

In summary, interstitial alloys are characterized by smaller atoms fitting into the gaps between larger atoms, leading to a denser, harder, and stronger material, exemplified by steel. Conversely, substitutional alloys involve the exchange of similar-sized atoms, which can modify the alloy's properties without substantially affecting its density, as demonstrated by brass.
