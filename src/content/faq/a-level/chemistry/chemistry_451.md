Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) are widely utilized techniques in organic analysis.

ESI-MS is adept at analyzing both polar and non-polar compounds, accommodating molecular weights that range from small molecules to large biomolecules. This technique involves ionizing the sample by spraying it into a high-voltage field. The ions generated are then separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio within a mass analyzer. ESI-MS is particularly effective for identifying unknown compounds and determining their molecular weights.

On the other hand, MALDI-MS is primarily employed for the analysis of large biomolecules, such as proteins and peptides. In this method, the sample is combined with a matrix and applied to a metal plate. The matrix absorbs energy from a laser and transfers it to the sample, resulting in ionization. The ions produced are subsequently separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio in a mass analyzer. MALDI-MS is especially valuable for identifying and quantifying proteins in complex mixtures.

Both ESI-MS and MALDI-MS serve as powerful tools in organic analysis, enabling researchers to identify and characterize a diverse array of compounds.
