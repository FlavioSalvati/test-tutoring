Lactams and lactones are both cyclic compounds, yet they differ significantly in their functional groups.

Lactams are classified as cyclic amides. This means they feature a carbonyl group ($\text{C=O}$) in conjunction with a nitrogen atom within their ring structure. Lactams are prevalent in various natural products and pharmaceuticals, including well-known antibiotics like penicillin and cephalosporin. Additionally, lactams can be synthesized through several chemical reactions, with the Beckmann rearrangement of ketoximes being one notable method.

In contrast, lactones are cyclic esters, characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group and an oxygen atom within the ring. They are also found in numerous natural products, such as $\gamma$-lactones present in fruits and macrolide antibiotics. Lactones can be produced through various synthetic approaches, including the ring-closing metathesis reaction.

A key distinction between lactams and lactones lies in their reactivity. Lactams are generally more reactive than lactones, primarily due to the nitrogen atom, which can function as a nucleophile in numerous reactions. Conversely, lactones exhibit greater stability and lower reactivity, as they lack a nucleophilic atom in their ring structure.

Regarding biological activity, lactams and lactones have different effects on the human body. Lactams are recognized for their antibacterial and antifungal properties, while lactones have demonstrated anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects.

In summary, although lactams and lactones share similarities as cyclic compounds, their differing functional groups and reactivity result in distinct biological activities and applications.
