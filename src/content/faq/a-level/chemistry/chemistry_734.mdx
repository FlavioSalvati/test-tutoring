Group 2 hydroxides exhibit a range of solubilities that are closely related to the pH of the solution.

Group 2 hydroxides, commonly referred to as alkaline earth metal hydroxides, are compounds created when Group 2 metals react with water. The solubility of these hydroxides varies based on both the specific metal and the pH of the solution.

Generally, the solubility of Group 2 hydroxides increases as one moves down the group. For instance, magnesium hydroxide has a solubility of $0.00064 \, \text{g/100 mL}$ at $25^\circ \text{C}$, while barium hydroxide demonstrates a significantly higher solubility of $3.7 \, \text{g/100 mL}$ under the same conditions.

The solubility of Group 2 hydroxides is also influenced by the pH of the solution. At low pH levels, these hydroxides tend to be insoluble; however, as the pH increases, their solubility enhances. This phenomenon occurs because hydroxide ions react with hydrogen ions in the solution, forming water. This reaction decreases the concentration of hydrogen ions, thereby increasing the pH of the solution.

In summary, the solubility of Group 2 hydroxides, such as magnesium hydroxide and barium hydroxide, tends to increase down the group and is significantly affected by the pH of the solution. As pH rises, the solubility of these hydroxides increases due to the reaction between hydroxide ions and hydrogen ions, resulting in the formation of water and a higher pH.
