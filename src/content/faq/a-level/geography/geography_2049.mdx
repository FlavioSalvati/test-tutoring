Wave refraction plays a critical role in coastal erosion by concentrating wave energy on headlands while dispersing it in bays.

As waves approach the shore, they encounter shallower water, causing them to slow down. This reduction in speed leads to a bending effect, or 'refraction', which directs a greater amount of wave energy toward protruding landforms, such as headlands. The intensified energy in these areas results in heightened erosion, which can create distinct geological features like cliffs and wave-cut platforms.

In contrast, within areas where the coastline recedes, such as bays, wave energy is spread out. This dispersion leads to reduced wave action, resulting in less erosion. Consequently, these regions often experience sediment deposition, where materials eroded from other areas accumulate, forming features like beaches.

Wave refraction also plays a significant role in the process known as longshore drift. As waves refract around a headland, they tend to strike the shore at an angle. This angled approach causes the swash (the forward movement of water up the beach) and backwash (the backward movement of water returning down the beach) to occur at different angles. As a result, sediment is transported along the coastline, which can further influence coastal erosion and the development of various coastal features.

In conclusion, wave refraction significantly impacts coastal erosion by altering the distribution of wave energy along the shoreline. This leads to increased erosion in certain areas while reducing it in others. Overall, this process is essential in shaping coastlines and creating the diverse array of coastal features we observe today.
