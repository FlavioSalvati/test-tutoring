Corals and zooxanthellae have a mutualistic relationship where both species benefit from each other's existence.

Corals, which are marine invertebrates, form a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, a type of microscopic algae. This relationship is crucial for the survival of both species and the overall health of the world's coral reefs. The corals provide the zooxanthellae with a protected environment and the compounds necessary for photosynthesis. These compounds include carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and other nutrients, which the algae need to survive and grow.

In return, the zooxanthellae provide the corals with the products of photosynthesis, such as oxygen and organic compounds. These organic compounds, including glucose, glycerol, and amino acids, are used by the corals for energy production, growth, and reproduction. This symbiotic relationship allows corals to thrive in nutrient-poor waters where they would otherwise not survive.

The relationship between corals and zooxanthellae is also responsible for the vibrant colours of coral reefs. The zooxanthellae contain pigments that are visible through the clear body of the coral, giving them their beautiful and diverse colours. When corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients, they expel the symbiotic zooxanthellae. This leads to a phenomenon known as coral bleaching, where the coral turns completely white. If the stress continues and the coral does not re-establish its symbiotic relationship with the zooxanthellae, it can die.

In summary, the symbiotic relationship between corals and zooxanthellae is a mutualistic one, where both species benefit. The corals provide the zooxanthellae with a protected environment and the necessary compounds for photosynthesis, while the zooxanthellae provide the corals with the products of photosynthesis and contribute to their vibrant colours. This relationship is crucial for the survival of both species and the overall health of the world's coral reefs.
