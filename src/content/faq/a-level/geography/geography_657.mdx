River levees are natural embankments that develop along the banks of a river channel. Their formation occurs gradually over time through the deposition of sediment during flood events. When a river floods, it overflows its banks and spreads out across the floodplain. As the water exits the channel, it slows down, resulting in the deposition of some of the sediment it carries. This sediment accumulates along the edges of the river, leading to the formation of levees.

The process of levee formation is continuous and takes place over extended periods. During each flooding event, additional sediment is deposited, causing the levees to increase in both height and width. The heaviest particles settle first, closest to the river channel, because they are less buoyant and the water loses energy more quickly in that area. Consequently, levees are typically composed of coarser materials such as sand and gravel, while finer materials like silt and clay are transported further onto the floodplain.

The dimensions of river levees can vary significantly, influenced by factors such as the size of the river, the frequency and intensity of flooding, and the quantity and type of sediment available. In some instances, levees can reach such heights that they substantially alter the river's course, causing it to change direction or even divide into multiple channels.

In addition to their natural formation, levees can also be artificially constructed or enhanced by humans for flood control purposes. These man-made levees are often larger and more uniform in shape than their natural counterparts, yet they serve a similar function by preventing floodwaters from inundating surrounding areas. However, the construction of artificial levees can have adverse effects on the river's ecosystem and disrupt the natural processes involved in levee formation.
