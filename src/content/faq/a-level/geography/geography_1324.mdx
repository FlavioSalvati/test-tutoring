The process of demographic transition can profoundly affect the environment by altering resource consumption, waste production, and land use patterns.

The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) illustrates how a country's population evolves over time. It is categorized into four distinct stages: high stationary, early expanding, late expanding, and low stationary. Each stage presents unique environmental challenges due to differences in population size and economic activities.

In the **high stationary stage**, societies are typically rural and reliant on subsistence farming. The environmental impact during this stage is relatively minimal, as both resource consumption and waste production are low. However, practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture can result in deforestation and a decline in biodiversity.

During the **early expanding stage**, the population experiences a rapid increase. This growth can place significant pressure on natural resources, as the demand for land for housing and agriculture rises. The expansion of farming activities may lead to soil degradation and water pollution caused by fertilizers and pesticides. Additionally, urbanization begins to take shape during this stage, resulting in the formation of urban heat islands and heightened air pollution.

The **late expanding stage** is often marked by industrialization, which brings about considerable environmental consequences. There is a marked increase in resource consumption, particularly of fossil fuels, which contributes to air pollution and climate change. Industrial waste can further contaminate water sources. Nonetheless, advancements in technology and the implementation of regulations can help alleviate some of these negative impacts.

Finally, in the **low stationary stage**, population growth stabilizes, but consumption patterns tend to shift towards more resource-intensive lifestyles. This transition can result in greater waste production and increased energy consumption, thereby contributing to global warming. However, societies at this stage typically have the resources and awareness necessary to invest in sustainable practices and technologies.

In summary, demographic transition has a significant impact on the environment. The fluctuations in population size and economic activities throughout the stages of the DTM can lead to heightened resource consumption, increased waste production, and alterations in land use. However, with appropriate policies and technological advancements, it is possible to mitigate many of these environmental impacts.
