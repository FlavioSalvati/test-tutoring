Chain migration is a social phenomenon where migrants from a specific town or country relocate to a new area, subsequently followed by others from their original community. 

This concept is particularly important in the field of human geography, especially in the context of international migration. Chain migration begins when an individual or family migrates to a different country for various reasons, such as seeking better economic opportunities or escaping conflict. Once the initial migrants establish themselves in the new location, they often assist others from their home community in making the same journey. This assistance can take many forms, including providing valuable information about the migration process, helping to secure housing or employment, or offering financial support.

The process is typically facilitated by networks of relationships that exist between the origin and destination locations. These networks may encompass family ties, friendships, and shared cultural or linguistic backgrounds, which can ease the transition for new migrants.

Chain migration can have profound effects on both the origin and destination areas. In the origin location, it can result in population loss, leading to various social and economic repercussions. Conversely, in the destination location, it can foster the establishment of ethnic enclavesâ€”neighborhoods where individuals from the same origin area reside close to one another. Such enclaves enable migrants to preserve their cultural traditions and create a sense of community in their new environment.

However, chain migration is not without its challenges. It can contribute to social segregation and tensions between different ethnic groups in the destination area. Additionally, it may lead to a brain drain in the origin location, where the most skilled or educated individuals migrate, leaving behind a less skilled population. 

Overall, chain migration is a complex process that shapes the experiences of both migrants and their communities.
