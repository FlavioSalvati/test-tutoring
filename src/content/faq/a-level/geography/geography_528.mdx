Human activities have a substantial influence on above-ground flows within drainage basins, primarily through alterations in land use, vegetation cover, and climate.

Activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture can significantly modify the characteristics of a drainage basin, consequently affecting the above-ground water flows. For example, deforestation removes vegetation that typically intercepts rainfall and slows its progression to the ground. This removal results in an increase in the velocity and volume of surface runoff, which can elevate the peak discharge in rivers and heighten the risk of flooding.

Urbanization also plays a critical role in modifying above-ground flows. The development of impermeable surfaces, such as roads and buildings, inhibits the infiltration of water into the ground, leading to increased surface runoff. Moreover, urban areas frequently implement advanced drainage systems that rapidly direct water into rivers, resulting in a quicker response to rainfall and an elevated risk of flash floods.

Agricultural practices, particularly those involving terracing and ploughing, can disrupt the natural flow paths of water across the landscape. These methods may either exacerbate surface runoff by compacting the soil, thus reducing its permeability, or mitigate it by establishing barriers that slow the movement of water.

Climate change, largely driven by human activities, further influences above-ground flows. Variations in temperature and precipitation patterns can modify both the quantity and timing of runoff, impacting river flows and potentially leading to more frequent and severe floods or droughts.

In summary, human activities exert a significant influence on above-ground flows in drainage basins. These effects can have profound implications for water availability, flood risk, and the health of ecosystems. Therefore, it is essential to manage human activities in a manner that minimizes their adverse impacts on drainage basins.
