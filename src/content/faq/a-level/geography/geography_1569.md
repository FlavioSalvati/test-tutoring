Internal migration plays a crucial role in influencing the distribution of regional languages, potentially leading to their spread, dilution, or even extinction.

Internal migration refers to the movement of people within a country and can significantly affect the distribution of languages across various regions. When individuals or groups relocate, they carry their native languages with them, which can result in the introduction of these languages into new areas. This process enhances linguistic diversity. For example, if a substantial number of individuals from a Welsh-speaking region in the UK migrate to an English-speaking area, they may introduce Welsh into the local linguistic environment.

Conversely, internal migration can also result in the dilution or extinction of regional languages. This often occurs when migrants adopt the language spoken in their new region, driven by the need to assimilate and communicate effectively. Over time, the use of their native language may diminish, and it may not be transmitted to subsequent generations. This decline in speakers can lead to the language's eventual disappearance. A historical example is the Cornish language in the UK, which became extinct in the late $18^{th}$ century, in part due to the influx of English speakers into Cornwall.

Moreover, internal migration can foster the emergence of new language varieties or dialects. When individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds converge in a new location, they may blend elements of their languages to form a novel mode of communication. This phenomenon is particularly evident in urban areas, which typically experience high levels of internal migration. For instance, the multicultural city of London has birthed numerous new dialects and accents, reflecting the rich linguistic tapestry of its residents.

In conclusion, internal migration can profoundly alter a country's linguistic landscape, leading to the spread, dilution, or creation of regional languages. The consequences of this movement are multifaceted, highlighting the dynamic interplay between language and human migration.
