Geological features play a significant role in shaping the characteristics of arid environments by influencing temperature, precipitation, and soil composition.

Key geological formations, such as mountains, valleys, and plateaus, are instrumental in determining the climate and ecological conditions of arid regions. For example, mountains can create a rain shadow effect. This occurs when moist air rises over a mountain range: as the air ascends, it cools and loses moisture through precipitation on the windward side, while the leeward side remains dry, leading to arid conditions. A prominent example of this phenomenon is the Atacama Desert in Chile, which ranks among the driest places on Earth, largely due to the rain shadow effect created by the Andes Mountains.

Moreover, the geological composition of an area, particularly the types of rocks present, can significantly influence soil characteristics. This, in turn, affects the types of vegetation that can thrive in an environment. In many arid regions, the soil tends to be sandy or rocky, which restricts the variety of plants that can survive. For instance, the Sahara Desert is predominantly composed of sandstone, resulting in sandy soils that can only support a limited range of resilient, drought-resistant flora.

In addition to precipitation and soil composition, geological features also affect temperature variations within arid environments. Valleys and low-lying areas typically experience higher temperatures as they are closer to the Earth's core and can trap heat. Conversely, elevated regions such as plateaus are cooler due to their altitude. For example, the Ethiopian Highlands, a high-altitude plateau located in the tropics, has a comparatively cool climate despite its geographical location, owing to its elevation above sea level.

Lastly, geological features can impact the availability of water resources in arid regions. Areas underlain by permeable rock types like limestone are conducive to the formation of underground water sources, such as aquifers. In contrast, regions dominated by impermeable rock types, such as granite, hinder the infiltration of water into the ground, resulting in limited groundwater availability. This contributes to the overall arid conditions of the environment.
