Evaporation and condensation are fundamental processes that significantly contribute to atmospheric moisture through the water cycle.

**Evaporation** is the process by which water transitions from a liquid state to a gaseous state, transforming into water vapor. This process predominantly occurs when the sun's heat energy warms the surfaces of bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. As the temperature rises, the water molecules gain energy, move more rapidly, and eventually escape into the atmosphere as water vapor. Evaporation can also take place on land, particularly through a process known as transpiration, where plants release water vapor into the air. The resulting water vapor rises and disperses throughout the atmosphere, thereby increasing its moisture content.

**Condensation**, in contrast, occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere cools and reverts back to liquid water. This typically happens when the air cools to its dew pointâ€”the temperature at which the air can no longer retain all of its water vapor. The excess water vapor condenses into tiny droplets, which aggregate to form clouds. When these droplets become sufficiently heavy, they can no longer remain suspended in the air and fall to the ground as precipitation, which may manifest as rain, snow, or hail. This precipitation can then be evaporated again, perpetuating the cycle.

Together, evaporation and condensation create a continuous cycle of water transfer between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, known as the hydrological cycle or water cycle. This cycle is essential for distributing heat and moisture across the planet, significantly influencing weather patterns and climate. Additionally, it plays a critical role in sustaining life on Earth by replenishing the planet's water supply and regulating the overall humidity and temperature of the atmosphere.
