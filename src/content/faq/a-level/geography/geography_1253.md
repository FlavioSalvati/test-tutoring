Economic development frequently results in a decline in population growth, primarily due to enhancements in living standards and education.

Economic development plays a pivotal role in shaping population growth through various mechanisms. One of the most important concepts in this context is the demographic transition model, which outlines the changes in population dynamics over time as a country undergoes economic development. According to this model, as a nation progresses economically, it transitions from high birth and death rates to lower birth and death rates, ultimately resulting in a reduction in population growth.

In the initial phases of economic development, many countries witness elevated birth rates. This phenomenon can be attributed to factors such as inadequate education, particularly among women, and limited access to contraception. However, as economic development advances, these conditions typically improve. Enhanced living standards, access to superior healthcare, and increased educational opportunities—especially for women—often contribute to a decline in birth rates. Women who attain higher levels of education tend to have fewer children and tend to delay childbearing. Additionally, with advancements in healthcare, child mortality rates are reduced, which decreases the perceived necessity for larger families.

Economic development also fosters urbanization, which can further contribute to a decline in population growth. In urban settings, the cost of living tends to be higher, and living space is often constrained, making large families less feasible. Furthermore, cities generally offer better access to education and employment opportunities, which can shift societal values from prioritizing the number of children to focusing on the education and well-being of fewer children.

It is crucial to recognize, however, that the relationship between economic development and population growth is not universally applicable. Various factors, including cultural and religious beliefs, can also play a significant role in influencing population growth. For instance, in certain societies, having multiple children may be regarded as a status symbol or a form of security for old age, and these beliefs can persist even in the face of economic development. Consequently, while economic development often correlates with a decrease in population growth, the degree of this effect can vary considerably across different countries and regions.
