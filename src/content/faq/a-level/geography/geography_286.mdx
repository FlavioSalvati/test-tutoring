A country's selection of energy sources is shaped by several key factors, including resource availability, production costs, environmental impacts, and technological capabilities.

The availability of natural resources significantly influences a nation's energy choices. Countries endowed with abundant fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, or natural gas—like Russia and Saudi Arabia, typically depend heavily on these resources for their energy production. In contrast, nations with limited fossil fuel reserves often seek alternative energy sources. For example, Iceland capitalizes on its plentiful geothermal energy, while Norway harnesses hydroelectric power from its numerous waterfalls.

The cost of energy production is another critical factor. Fossil fuels, despite their environmental drawbacks, are frequently favored due to their relatively low cost and high energy yield. However, the declining costs of renewable energy technologies are making alternatives like wind and solar power increasingly viable. For instance, Denmark, with its favorable wind conditions, has made significant investments in wind energy, which now accounts for over $40\%$ of its electricity supply.

The environmental consequences of various energy sources are becoming increasingly influential in shaping energy policies. As the impacts of climate change become more pronounced, countries face mounting pressure to lower their carbon emissions. This has sparked a heightened interest in renewable energy sources, which typically produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. For example, Costa Rica aims to achieve carbon neutrality by $2021$ and currently generates over $98\%$ of its electricity from renewable sources.

Finally, a country's technological capabilities can significantly affect its energy source choices. Advanced economies that can invest in research and development are better positioned to explore and implement innovative energy technologies. For example, Japan, while lacking in natural resources, has emerged as a leader in nuclear energy due to its advanced technological infrastructure. Conversely, less developed nations may not have the necessary infrastructure or expertise to exploit complex energy sources, leading them to rely on more accessible and straightforward options, such as biomass or coal.
