Wave energy levels play a significant role in shaping the formation and characteristics of various coastal landforms.

The energy of waves, primarily generated by wind, is crucial in determining the nature of coastal features. This energy can vary considerably, leading to the development of diverse coastal landforms. For example, high-energy waves have the capacity to erode cliffs, resulting in the creation of formations such as wave-cut platforms, sea arches, and sea stacks. Conversely, low-energy waves are responsible for forming depositional features, including beaches, spits, and bars.

The processes of erosion, transportation, and deposition, all driven by wave energy, are fundamental to the development of coastal landforms. High-energy waves erode coastlines by breaking down rocks and cliffs through mechanisms such as hydraulic action, abrasion, and attrition. The material that is eroded is then transported along the shore through a process known as longshore drift, which is influenced by the direction and strength of prevailing winds and waves.

In contrast, depositional landforms are created when wave energy diminishes, causing the waves to deposit the transported sediments. This leads to the formation of features like beaches, where sand and pebbles accumulate, as well as spits and bars, where sediment builds up in shallow waters. The size and shape of these features are directly influenced by the quantity and type of material being deposited, which is in turn determined by the energy levels of the waves.

In summary, wave energy levels are a critical factor in defining the types and characteristics of coastal landforms. High-energy waves are typically associated with erosional features, while low-energy waves promote the development of depositional landforms. A thorough understanding of these processes is essential for predicting and managing changes along our coastlines.
