Prolonged drought can considerably diminish both the peak discharge and the base flow in the hydrograph of a drainage basin.

A hydrograph is a visual representation that illustrates the discharge of a river over a specific period. The discharge is influenced by a variety of factors, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the physical characteristics of the drainage basin. During an extended drought, the amount of precipitation decreases significantly, which directly affects the river's discharge.

The most immediate change observed in the hydrograph is a reduction in the peak discharge. Peak discharge represents the maximum volume of water that a river can carry at any moment, typically following a heavy rainfall event. However, in the context of a drought, the absence of rainfall results in less water entering the river system, leading to a lower peak discharge. This reduction can have far-reaching consequences for the river's capacity to support human activities, such as agriculture and hydroelectric power generation.

Another consequence of prolonged drought is a decrease in the base flow. Base flow refers to the steady, day-to-day discharge of the river, sustained by the gradual release of water from the soil and rocks within the drainage basin. During a drought, the soil and rocks become increasingly dry, impairing their ability to release water, which in turn results in a reduced base flow. This decline can pose serious ecological threats, as many aquatic species depend on a consistent base flow for their survival.

Additionally, the lag time—the interval between peak rainfall and peak discharge—may also increase during drought conditions. This occurs because the dry soil and rocks exhibit lower permeability, causing a delay in water infiltration and its subsequent arrival in the river. As a result, the response to any rainfall that does occur may become more prolonged and less predictable, complicating water resource management efforts.

In summary, prolonged drought can profoundly affect the hydrograph of a drainage basin by altering both the peak discharge and the base flow, as well as increasing the lag time. These changes can have significant implications for human activities and the surrounding natural environment.
