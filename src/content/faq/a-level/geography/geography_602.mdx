The type of soil in a drainage basin plays a crucial role in shaping hydrographs by affecting both infiltration rates and surface runoff.

Different soil types exhibit varying capacities to absorb and retain water, which directly influences the rate of infiltration and the volume of surface runoff. Consequently, these factors significantly impact the shape of a hydrograph. A hydrograph is a graphical representation that illustrates the flow rate (discharge) against time at a specific point in a river or another channel transporting water.

For instance, clay soils consist of small, tightly packed particles that restrict the rate of infiltration. As a result, during a rain event, water is less likely to penetrate the ground and is more prone to running off the surface. This phenomenon leads to a steep rising limb on the hydrograph, indicating a rapid increase in river discharge. The peak discharge is typically high, reflecting the substantial volume of runoff generated. In contrast, the falling limb of the hydrograph may be prolonged, as the slow infiltration rate allows water to continue entering the river system for an extended period after the rainfall has ceased.

In contrast, sandy soils are characterized by larger, loosely packed particles that facilitate a high rate of infiltration. During a rainfall event, a significant portion of the water is absorbed into the soil, thereby reducing surface runoff. This results in a less steep rising limb on the hydrograph and a lower peak discharge, which corresponds to the smaller volume of runoff. Additionally, the falling limb of the hydrograph is likely to be shorter, since the rapid infiltration means that water returns to the river system more quickly once the rain stops.

While soil type is a major factor influencing hydrograph characteristics, other elements such as vegetation cover, slope gradient, and antecedent moisture conditions also play important roles. Nonetheless, the type of soil in a drainage basin remains a key determinant of the hydrograph's overall shape and behavior.
