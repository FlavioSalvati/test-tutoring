Wave dynamics significantly influence the morphology of coastal landscapes through a series of processes including erosion, transportation, and deposition of sediment. These processes collectively give rise to various geological features such as cliffs, beaches, and sandbars.

Erosion is one of the most prominent processes in shaping coastlines. It occurs when waves break against the shore, gradually wearing away the land and transporting the eroded material out to sea. Over extended periods, this action can lead to the development of steep landforms like cliffs. The rate and extent of erosion are influenced by several factors, such as the strength and frequency of the waves, the geological composition of the coastline, and the presence of protective elements like vegetation or man-made structures.

Another important process is sediment transportation, often referred to as longshore drift. As waves approach the coast at an angle, they push sediment up the beach in the direction of the wave's energy. The subsequent backwash carries the sediment back down the beach at a right angle to the shoreline, creating a zigzag pattern of sediment movement along the coast. Over time, this process can result in the formation of features such as spits and sandbars.

Finally, waves also play a crucial role in sediment deposition. When the energy of a wave diminishes, it can no longer transport as much sediment, leading to its deposition. This commonly occurs in areas where the coastline changes direction or where wave energy is dispersed, such as in bays. Gradually, this deposition contributes to the formation of features like beaches and sand dunes.

In summary, wave dynamics are essential drivers of coastal landscape evolution. Through the processes of erosion, transportation, and deposition, waves sculpt our coastlines, giving rise to a diverse array of landforms and habitats.
