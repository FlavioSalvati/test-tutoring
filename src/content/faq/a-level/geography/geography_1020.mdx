Tectonic processes play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of landscapes by forming mountains, valleys, and various other landforms through the movement of tectonic plates.

These processes are driven by convection currents in the Earthâ€™s mantle, leading to movements of the Earth's crust that can be classified as constructive, destructive, or conservative. Each type of movement significantly influences the formation and evolution of landscapes.

**Constructive Processes**: These processes, such as sea-floor spreading and continental drift, contribute to the creation of new landforms. A notable example is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is formed by sea-floor spreading as the Eurasian and North American plates move apart. This movement generates new crust, resulting in the formation of underwater mountain ranges and islands. Another example is the East African Rift Valley, which is the result of continental drift where the African plate is splitting into two distinct plates.

**Destructive Processes**: In contrast, destructive processes, such as subduction and collision, lead to the loss of crust and the formation of various landforms. A prime illustration of this is the Andes mountain range, which arose from the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate. This subduction results in the melting of the subducted plate, causing volcanic activity and the uplift of the mountain range. Similarly, the Himalayas were formed as a result of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates, leading to significant uplift and creating the highest mountain range in the world.

**Conservative Processes**: Unlike constructive and destructive processes, conservative processes, such as those occurring along transform faults, do not create or destroy crust. However, they can still lead to significant alterations in the landscape. The San Andreas Fault in California serves as an example of a transform fault, where the Pacific and North American plates slide past each other. This movement can trigger earthquakes, which may result in landslides and other landscape changes.

In summary, tectonic processes have a profound and lasting impact on landscape evolution. They are responsible for the creation, modification, and destruction of various landforms, thereby shaping the Earth's surface over millions of years.
