Gender equality is a critical factor in demographic transition, impacting fertility rates, population growth, and economic development.

In the initial phases of demographic transition, societies typically experience high fertility and mortality rates, alongside significant gender inequality. In these contexts, women often face restricted access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, which reinforces their primary role as caregivers and childbearers. This lack of gender equality can impede progress towards lower mortality and fertility rates.

As societies move towards greater gender equality, women gain improved access to education and job opportunities. This empowerment enables them to make informed decisions regarding their reproductive health, often resulting in a postponement of marriage and childbirth. Consequently, fertility rates tend to decline. Numerous studies indicate a strong correlation between increased levels of female education and reduced fertility rates.

Furthermore, gender equality significantly influences the economic development of a society, which is a vital component of demographic transition. When women enter the workforce, it can stimulate economic growth, leading to enhancements in healthcare infrastructure and subsequent reductions in mortality rates.

In the later stages of demographic transition, the importance of gender equality remains evident. As societies advance, they frequently encounter the challenge of an aging population. Promoting gender equality in these contexts can mitigate this issue by fostering a balanced workforce that includes both men and women, thereby supporting economic stability.

In summary, gender equality is not merely a social concern; it is also a demographic one. It shapes the pace and characteristics of demographic transition by influencing fertility rates, mortality rates, and economic development. Thus, promoting gender equality can serve as an effective strategy for managing demographic transition.
