Rift valleys arise at divergent boundaries, which are characterized by the separation of tectonic plates and the subsequent subsidence of the land between them.

Divergent boundaries occur where two tectonic plates are moving away from each other. This movement is primarily driven by convection currents in the Earth's mantle. These currents cause the lithosphere—the rigid outer layer of the Earth, which includes the crust and the upper mantle—to crack and separate, a process commonly referred to as rifting.

As the tectonic plates diverge, the land situated between them begins to sink, resulting in the formation of a rift valley. This subsidence is a consequence of the lithosphere becoming thinner and more stretched, which diminishes its capacity to support the overlying land mass. Additionally, the sinking land is subject to erosion from rivers and other weathering processes, further deepening the valley.

A prominent example of a rift valley formed by divergent boundaries is the East African Rift Valley. In this region, the African Plate is splitting into two smaller plates: the Somali Plate and the Nubian Plate. As these plates continue to move apart, the land between them sinks, resulting in the formation of the rift valley. This geological process is ongoing, and over time, the rift valley may continue to deepen and widen, potentially evolving into a new ocean basin.

Moreover, volcanic activity is frequently associated with divergent boundaries. As the tectonic plates separate, magma from the mantle can ascend to fill the void, leading to the creation of a chain of volcanoes along the rift. This volcanic activity not only contributes to the formation of the rift valley but also plays a significant role in shaping its landscape by adding depth and width.

In summary, the development of rift valleys at divergent boundaries is a multifaceted process that involves the movement of tectonic plates, the subsidence of land, and the occurrence of volcanic activity. This dynamic process is essential to understanding the Earth's geology, as it significantly influences the planet's landscape over millions of years.
