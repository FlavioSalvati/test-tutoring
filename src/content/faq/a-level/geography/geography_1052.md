The primary types of physical weathering processes include freeze-thaw weathering, exfoliation, thermal expansion, and biological weathering.

**Freeze-thaw weathering**, often referred to as frost weathering, is a prevalent phenomenon in cold climates. This process occurs when water seeps into cracks or pores in rocks. When the temperature drops, this water freezes and expands, exerting pressure on the surrounding rock and ultimately causing it to fracture. Over time, this leads to the formation of scree slopes, where fragments of broken rock accumulate at the base of cliffs or slopes.

**Exfoliation**, also known as onion skin weathering, represents another form of physical weathering. This process is driven by temperature fluctuations that cause the outer layers of rock to expand and contract at a different rate than the inner layers. Gradually, this differential expansion results in the peeling away of the outer layers, similar to the way an onion's skin comes off. Exfoliation is particularly common in desert regions, where there are significant temperature variations between day and night.

**Thermal expansion** is a type of weathering that occurs when rocks are subjected to intense heat. The heat causes minerals within the rock to expand at varying rates, leading to stress that can crack and break the rock apart. This process is often observed in hot environments, such as deserts.

**Biological weathering** involves the influence of living organisms on rock degradation. For instance, tree roots can infiltrate cracks in rocks, and as they grow, they exert pressure that may cause the rock to split. Additionally, burrowing animals can disturb and fragment rock material. Lichens and mosses also play a role in biological weathering, as they produce acids that can chemically break down rock surfaces.

Each of these physical weathering processes plays a significant role in shaping and transforming the Earth's landscapes. They are driven by natural forces and occur over various timescales, ranging from rapid events like freeze-thaw cycles to the slower, more gradual effects of biological weathering.
