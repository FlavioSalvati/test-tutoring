Traction transport refers to the movement of sediment within river channels, specifically the rolling or sliding of larger particles along the riverbed.

Traction is one of the four primary processes of river transportation, alongside saltation, suspension, and solution. This process involves the movement of larger, heavier particles, such as pebbles, rocks, and boulders. Because these particles are too heavy to be lifted and carried by the water's current, they instead roll, slide, or drag along the riverbed. Traction is most commonly observed in fast-flowing rivers, where the water possesses sufficient energy to move these larger sediment particles.

The effectiveness of the traction process is significantly influenced by the velocity of the river, as well as the size and weight of the sediment particles. When the river's velocity increases, it generates more energy, allowing it to transport larger particles. Conversely, if the river's velocity decreases, it loses energy, leading to a greater likelihood of larger particles being deposited on the riverbed. Additionally, the shape and roughness of the riverbed can impact the traction process. A smoother riverbed reduces friction, facilitating easier transportation of particles, while a rougher riverbed increases friction, making transport more challenging.

Traction plays a crucial role in shaping river channels. As larger particles move along the riverbed, they can cause erosion, which contributes to the deepening and widening of the channel. This phenomenon is known as corrasion or abrasion, and it can significantly alter the course and shape of the river over time. Moreover, sediment transported by traction may be deposited downstream when the river loses energy, contributing to the formation of features such as bars, banks, and deltas.

In summary, traction is an essential process in river transportation. It moves larger sediment particles along the riverbed and plays a key role in shaping river channels and creating various river features.
