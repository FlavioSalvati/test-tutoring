Sea stacks and arches are remarkable geological formations that develop over thousands of years through the process of coastal erosion. This erosion is primarily caused by the relentless action of the sea, which wears away rock through several mechanisms, including hydraulic action, abrasion, and weathering.

Hydraulic action occurs when waves crash against the coastline, compressing air into cracks within the rocks. Over time, the pressure from this compressed air can lead to the disintegration of the rock. In contrast, abrasion involves the mechanical grinding of rocks and pebbles carried by the waves against the coastal land, gradually wearing it down. Additionally, weathering processes—such as freeze-thaw cycles and chemical reactions—further contribute to the erosion of the coastline.

The formation of sea arches begins with the creation of a cave. As the sea erodes a section of the coast, it often generates a notch at the base of the cliff. Continued erosion deepens and widens this notch, eventually forming a cave. If this cave is eroded all the way through the headland, it results in the creation of a natural arch.

Sea stacks are formed when an arch collapses under the combined weight of the rock above it and the ongoing erosion at its base. The remaining pillar of rock that stands isolated from the mainland is referred to as a sea stack. Over time, this sea stack will also succumb to erosion, ultimately leaving behind a stump.

In summary, the formation of sea stacks and arches illustrates the formidable power of the sea and the passage of time. These stunning geological features serve as visual records of the long-term processes of coastal erosion and are an intriguing area of study within the field of geography.
