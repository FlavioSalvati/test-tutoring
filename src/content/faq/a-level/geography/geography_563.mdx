Urbanization has a profound impact on above-ground flow patterns, resulting in increased surface runoff and a heightened risk of flooding.

Urbanization refers to the transformation of natural landscapes into developed environments. This process typically involves replacing permeable surfaces, such as grass and soil, with impermeable materials like concrete and asphalt. These hard surfaces hinder the infiltration of rainwater into the ground, leading to a rise in surface runoff. Consequently, this alteration in flow patterns can result in elevated peak discharge rates in urban streams and rivers, thereby increasing the potential for flooding.

Additionally, the construction of buildings and infrastructure can disrupt natural drainage systems, further modifying flow patterns. For example, roads and buildings may function as barriers, redirecting water flow and causing accumulation in specific areas. This can exacerbate flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall events.

Urbanization often includes the installation of artificial drainage systems, such as storm drains and sewers, designed to manage the increased surface runoff. While these systems can efficiently channel water from urban areas to nearby water bodies, they can also lead to rapid response times in rivers and streams. This quick response can result in flash floods, particularly if the drainage systems become overwhelmed by intense rainfall.

Moreover, the removal of vegetation during urbanization can further intensify changes in flow patterns. Plants and trees play a vital role in intercepting rainfall, which reduces the volume of water that contributes to surface runoff. Their root systems enhance soil permeability, facilitating greater infiltration of water into the ground. The loss of vegetation, therefore, can lead to increased surface runoff and decreased groundwater recharge, further altering above-ground flow dynamics.

In summary, urbanization significantly influences above-ground flow patterns, primarily through the increase in surface runoff and the alteration of natural drainage systems. These changes elevate the risk of flooding, especially in areas with insufficient drainage infrastructure or during periods of heavy rainfall.
