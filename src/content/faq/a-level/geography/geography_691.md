The process of solution transports materials within river channels by dissolving soluble substances and carrying them along with the flow of the river.

Solution, often referred to as chemical transportation, is a crucial mechanism in the movement of materials in river channels. This process is particularly effective in regions where the river water is slightly acidic, which enhances its ability to dissolve certain rocks and minerals. Notably, limestone and chalk are two types of rock that are highly susceptible to this process.

The process initiates when river water interacts with these soluble substances. When the water, especially if acidic, comes into contact with these materials, it dissolves them, integrating them into the water itself. This differs from other forms of river transportation, such as suspension or saltation, where materials are carried as distinct particles. In contrast, solution involves the complete dissolution of materials, making them part of the water's chemical composition.

Once dissolved, these materials are transported downstream by the river's current. The rate and extent of this transportation can vary based on several factors, including the volume and velocity of the river, the acidity of the water, and the type and quantity of soluble substances present. For instance, during periods of heavy rainfall, an increase in both the volume and speed of the river can lead to a heightened rate of dissolution and transportation.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that solution contributes to the overall erosion process within river channels. As water dissolves and removes soluble materials, it gradually wears away the riverbed and banks, altering the shape and course of the river over time.

In summary, solution is a vital process for transporting materials in river channels. By dissolving soluble substances and carrying them along with the river's flow, it plays a significant role in shaping the physical geography of river landscapes.
