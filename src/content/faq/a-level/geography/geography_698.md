River rejuvenation can result in the formation of various new landforms, including terraces, incised meanders, and waterfalls.

River rejuvenation is a geological process that occurs when the base level of a river decreases, or when the land experiences uplift due to tectonic activity. This change provides the river with renewed energy, allowing it to erode downward into its bed and leading to the development of new landforms. One of the most common landforms associated with river rejuvenation is river terraces. These are flat or gently sloping surfaces that run alongside a river, formed when the river cuts into its own floodplain after a drop in base level.

Another notable landform resulting from river rejuvenation is incised meanders. These are meanders that are more pronounced and deeply entrenched in the landscape. When a river with established meanders undergoes rejuvenation, it begins to erode downward rather than laterally. This process creates a deep, narrow river valley with steep sides, leaving the original meanders elevated above the new river level.

Waterfalls also frequently emerge in rejuvenated landscapes. They occur when a river encounters a section of harder rock following a period of downcutting through softer rock layers. The harder rock erodes at a slower rate, resulting in a sudden drop in the river's elevation, which manifests as a waterfall. Over time, the waterfall gradually retreats upstream, leading to the formation of a gorge.

Additionally, river rejuvenation can produce knickpoints, which are sharp breaks or discontinuities in the long profile of a river. These knickpoints signify areas of intensified erosion and are often associated with features such as waterfalls or rapids.

In summary, river rejuvenation significantly influences the landscape by creating a diverse array of distinctive landforms. These features not only enhance the physical complexity of an area but also serve as important indicators of historical changes in climate, tectonic activity, and sea level.
