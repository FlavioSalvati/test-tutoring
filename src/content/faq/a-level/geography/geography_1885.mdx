Urban infrastructure plays a crucial role in shaping residential segregation by influencing the accessibility, affordability, and desirability of various neighborhoods.

Urban infrastructure encompasses the essential physical and organizational structures and facilities required for the functioning of a city. This includes transportation systems, utilities, and public services. The arrangement and quality of these elements can significantly affect how populations are distributed across urban areas, ultimately leading to residential segregation.

Firstly, the accessibility of neighborhoods is greatly influenced by the presence and quality of transportation infrastructure. Areas equipped with efficient public transport systems tend to be more accessible and, therefore, more appealing to lower-income households that may lack private vehicles. In contrast, neighborhoods with inadequate transportation options may become isolated, often resulting in their occupancy by disadvantaged groups.

Secondly, housing affordability is closely tied to infrastructure development. When infrastructure investments are made, property values in those areas typically rise, which can render them unaffordable for lower-income families. This phenomenon can lead to economic segregation, with wealthier households clustering in well-serviced neighborhoods while poorer families are pushed to the outskirts of the city.

Lastly, the desirability of neighborhoods is influenced by the availability of public services and amenities, such as schools, parks, and healthcare facilities. Areas that boast a high concentration of these amenities are likely to attract wealthier households, thereby contributing to socio-economic segregation.

Moreover, the design of urban infrastructure can further exacerbate residential segregation. For instance, the construction of highways or railway lines can create physical divisions within communities, forming 'barriers' that reinforce existing segregation patterns. Additionally, the layout of residential developments—such as the placement of high-rise buildings or gated communities—can foster 'enclaves' of similar households.

In conclusion, urban infrastructure significantly impacts residential segregation by shaping the spatial distribution of populations within a city. Its effects on accessibility, affordability, and desirability of neighborhoods are fundamental to understanding the dynamics of urban living.
