Longshore drift, also referred to as littoral drift, is a crucial process in coastal environments that involves the movement of sediment along the coastline due to wave action. This process primarily transports materials such as sand and pebbles.

The movement of sediment occurs when waves approach the shore at an oblique angle. As these waves strike the shoreline, they push sediment up the beach in the same direction as the wave. When the waves recede back into the ocean, gravity pulls the sediment perpendicularly along the beach in a phenomenon known as backwash.

The interplay between these two actions—swash (the movement of water up the beach following a wave breaking) and backwash—creates a zigzag pattern of sediment transport. This zigzag movement characterizes longshore drift. Over time, this process can lead to significant alterations in the coastline, including the formation of features such as spits, bars, and tombolos.

Several factors can influence the rate of longshore drift. These factors include the size and energy of the waves, the angle at which they strike the shore, the gradient of the beach, and the size and type of sediment present. For instance, larger and more energetic waves, along with steeper beach gradients, tend to increase the rate of longshore drift. Conversely, smaller, less energetic waves and flatter beach gradients may result in a decreased rate of sediment transport.

In conclusion, longshore drift plays a vital role in shaping coastlines. It is a continuous process that can lead to considerable changes in the coastal landscape over time. Understanding longshore drift is essential for effective coastal management strategies, as it significantly impacts decisions regarding coastal defense and erosion prevention.
