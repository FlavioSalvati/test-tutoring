A compelling case study of population policy can be observed in India's family planning program, which serves as a significant example from a developing country.

As the second most populous nation in the world, India has faced persistent challenges in managing population growth. In response to these issues, the Indian government launched its family planning program in 1952, becoming the first country globally to implement a state-sponsored population control policy. The primary goal of this initiative was to curb population growth by promoting contraceptive use and ensuring access to family planning services.

Over the years, this policy has evolved considerably. Initially, it emphasized sterilization, particularly vasectomy, which sparked widespread protests and resistance due to its coercive nature. In light of these concerns, the strategy shifted to a more voluntary and incentive-based model, encouraging contraceptive use and offering financial incentives to individuals who chose sterilization.

In the 1990s, the focus of the policy transitioned to a more comprehensive approach that prioritized women's health and empowerment. This new direction advocated for delaying marriage and the first childbirth, spacing births, and encouraging families to limit their number of children to two. Additionally, the policy highlighted the significance of education, particularly for girls, as a crucial factor in reducing fertility rates.

Despite these initiatives, the effectiveness of India's population policy remains a topic of debate. The fertility rate has significantly decreased from $5.9$ in $1951$ to $2.2$ in $2015$, yet the overall population continues to rise due to the large proportion of young people. Furthermore, the policy has faced criticism for its top-down approach, insufficient focus on male involvement, and a lack of attention to the socio-economic factors that influence fertility.

In recent years, the government has sought to address these shortcomings by adopting a more decentralized approach, which involves local communities in the planning and execution of population control measures. There has also been a concerted effort to enhance access to education and healthcare, particularly in rural areas, in order to tackle the underlying causes of high fertility rates.
