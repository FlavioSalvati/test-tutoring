Albedo, which measures the reflectivity of a surface, generally increases with latitude, leading to cooler temperatures and significantly influencing global climate patterns.

As latitude increases, so does albedo, primarily due to the presence of snow and ice in polar regions. These surfaces possess a high albedo, reflecting a substantial portion of incoming solar radiation back into space. In contrast, regions closer to the equator, predominantly covered by dark oceans and dense forests, exhibit a lower albedo. This results in greater absorption of solar radiation, contributing to warmer temperatures.

The variation in albedo across latitudes plays a crucial role in shaping global climate patterns. The high albedo found in polar areas contributes to their cold climates, as most of the sun's energy is reflected rather than absorbed and converted into heat. Conversely, the low albedo at the equator fosters hot tropical climates by allowing more solar energy to be absorbed, thus raising temperatures.

Moreover, the albedo effect creates a self-reinforcing mechanism, leading to a positive feedback loop. For instance, as global warming causes ice to melt, the overall albedo decreases, resulting in increased absorption of solar radiation and further warming. This phenomenon, known as the ice-albedo feedback loop, is a significant driver of accelerated climate change.

Additionally, variations in albedo can impact atmospheric circulation patterns. The differential heating of the Earth's surface, influenced by changes in albedo, drives the formation of winds and the movement of air masses, which subsequently affect weather and climate dynamics.

In summary, the relationship between albedo and latitude is a fundamental factor in determining global climate patterns. It influences temperature, the rate of climate change, and atmospheric circulation.
