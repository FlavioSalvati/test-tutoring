Orographic precipitation is a weather phenomenon that occurs when moist air is forced to rise over elevated terrain, such as mountains. This type of precipitation, often referred to as relief rainfall, is significantly influenced by the landscape's topography.

When moist air approaches a mountain range, it must ascend due to the physical barrier presented by the mountains. As the air rises, it experiences a decrease in temperature, which leads to condensation and cloud formation, ultimately resulting in precipitation.

Several factors determine the amount of precipitation produced by orographic lifting. Firstly, the height and slope of the mountain range are critical. Taller and steeper slopes compel the air to rise more rapidly, which can lead to more intense precipitation events. Secondly, the direction and speed of the wind play important roles. A strong wind blowing directly toward the mountain can force a larger volume of air upward, amplifying the potential for heavier rainfall.

The characteristics of the air mass itself, including its temperature and humidity, are also essential. Warmer air can hold more moisture, so a warm and humid air mass is likely to produce more substantial precipitation. Conversely, if the air is cold and dry, the resulting precipitation will be limited.

Additionally, the type of terrain on the leeward side of the mountain—that is, the side sheltered from the wind—can influence both the quantity and type of precipitation. If the leeward terrain is steep and smooth, the descending air warms rapidly, creating a "rain shadow" effect. In this scenario, the leeward side receives significantly less rainfall compared to the windward side. Conversely, if the leeward terrain is rugged and uneven, the air may descend more slowly, allowing for greater precipitation accumulation in that area.
