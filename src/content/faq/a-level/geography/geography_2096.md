Human intervention frequently disrupts natural coastal processes, resulting in erosion, habitat destruction, and alterations in sediment transport dynamics.

Human activities—particularly those related to coastal development and engineering—can profoundly affect the natural mechanisms that shape coastal environments. A prevalent form of human intervention is the construction of coastal defenses, including sea walls, groynes, and breakwaters. Although these structures are intended to safeguard coastal communities from rising sea levels and storm surges, they can also obstruct the natural movement of sediment along the shore. This interference can result in increased erosion in certain areas while causing sediment accumulation in others, ultimately transforming the landscape and potentially jeopardizing habitats for various coastal and marine species.

Another major form of human intervention is land reclamation, which involves creating new land from the sea or coastal wetlands. This practice can disrupt natural coastal processes by altering the coastline's shape and modifying water flow patterns. Additionally, it can lead to the loss of vital habitats, such as mangroves and salt marshes, which are essential for coastal protection and biodiversity.

Pollution represents another significant way in which human actions affect coastal processes. Industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and plastic debris can severely harm coastal and marine ecosystems, influencing species diversity and abundance. These changes can, in turn, affect fundamental processes such as nutrient cycling and food chain dynamics.

Furthermore, climate change—driven by human activities like the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation—is causing sea levels to rise and increasing the frequency and intensity of storms. This exacerbates coastal erosion and flooding, placing additional stress on coastal ecosystems and communities.

In summary, while human intervention may sometimes be necessary to protect coastal communities, it can also lead to significant negative consequences for natural coastal processes and ecosystems. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the potential environmental impacts of any coastal development or engineering projects.
