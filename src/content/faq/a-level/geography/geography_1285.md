The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) illustrates the relationship between economic development and changes in population growth rates and structures.

The DTM is a framework utilized by geographers to depict the evolution of a society's population over time. It comprises four distinct stages, each representing a unique phase of economic development. This model is founded on the observation that as a country progresses economically, notable shifts occur in both birth and death rates, which in turn affect overall population growth.

In the first stage, both birth and death rates are high, resulting in a stable yet low population. This scenario is commonly found in less economically developed countries where subsistence farming prevails and healthcare access is limited. The economy primarily relies on primary sector activities such as agriculture, fishing, and mining.

The second stage is marked by a decline in death rates due to improvements in healthcare and sanitation that accompany economic development. In contrast, birth rates remain high, leading to a rapid population increase. This stage often correlates with the onset of industrialization, as the economy begins to transition towards secondary sector activities, including manufacturing.

In the third stage, birth rates begin to decrease as societal values and economic conditions evolve. With further economic development, there is a noticeable shift towards tertiary sector activities, such as services and technology. Although the population continues to grow, the rate of growth slows down significantly.

The final stage is characterized by both birth and death rates being low, resulting in a stable and aging population. This stage is typical of more economically developed countries where the economy is predominantly driven by tertiary and quaternary sector activities, including research and development.

In summary, the DTM serves as a valuable tool for understanding how economic development influences demographic changes in population growth and structure. It provides insights into the demographic transformations that occur as a country evolves economically.
