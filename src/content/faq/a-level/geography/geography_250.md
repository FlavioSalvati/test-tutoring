Informal sector activities are unregulated and untaxed, standing in contrast to formal sector activities, which are governed by regulations and subject to taxation by the government.

Informal sector activities, often referred to as the "shadow" or "underground" economy, encompass economic activities that fall outside government regulation and are not protected by labor laws. These activities are typically small-scale and are characterized by low wages, poor working conditions, and a lack of job security. Common examples of informal sector activities include street vending, unregistered small businesses, casual labor, and home-based work. Individuals or groups often engage in these activities due to limited access to secure employment and social protection.

Conversely, formal sector activities are regulated by the government and are subject to taxation and labor laws. These activities are usually conducted by registered businesses and organizations, and employees in this sector typically enjoy benefits such as health insurance, paid leave, and pension schemes. Examples of formal sector activities include manufacturing, services, and public sector employment.

The primary distinction between the two sectors lies in their relationship with the state. Formal sector activities are recognized by the government and are governed by rules and regulations designed to protect workers and ensure fair business practices. In contrast, informal sector activities operate outside these regulations, often due to barriers that prevent entry into the formal economy. While this can lead to exploitation and precarious working conditions, the informal sector also serves as a crucial source of income for those unable to secure work in the formal sector.

In many developing countries, the informal sector plays a vital role in the economy, providing livelihoods for a significant portion of the population. However, the absence of regulation and protection can result in issues such as income inequality and social instability. Therefore, understanding the differences between the formal and informal sectors is essential for policymakers aiming to promote economic development and social equity.
