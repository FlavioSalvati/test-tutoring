Altitude plays a significant role in determining the type of precipitation that an area receives, as higher elevations typically experience snowfall rather than rain.

The influence of altitude on precipitation is primarily due to the temperature variations associated with increasing elevation. As one ascends, the temperature generally decreases at a rate of about $6.5$ degrees Celsius per kilometer, a phenomenon known as the lapse rate. Consequently, at higher altitudes where temperatures drop below freezing, precipitation is more likely to occur in the form of snow.

Conversely, at lower altitudes, where temperatures are typically warmer, precipitation is more likely to manifest as rain. However, it is essential to recognize that this is not an absolute rule. Several factors, including the time of year, the presence of warm or cold air masses, and the specific geographical features of an area, can also significantly influence the type of precipitation experienced.

For example, during the winter months, even regions at lower altitudes can receive snowfall if temperatures fall below freezing. Additionally, in mountainous regions, a phenomenon known as 'orographic lift' can lead to enhanced precipitation on the windward side of the mountain, often resulting in snowfall due to the lower temperatures at higher elevations.

Moreover, altitude affects not only the type of precipitation but also its intensity and frequency. Areas at higher altitudes tend to receive more precipitation because the cooler temperatures promote increased condensation. This explains why mountainous regions often record higher annual precipitation totals compared to lower-lying areas.

In conclusion, while altitude is a crucial factor in determining the type of precipitation, it is not the only one. Various meteorological and geographical factors interact to influence precipitation patterns. Understanding these interactions is vital for accurately predicting weather patterns and climate conditions.
