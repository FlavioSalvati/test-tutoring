Deforestation significantly heightens the risk of mass movement hazards, including landslides, soil erosion, and rockfalls.

Deforestation, defined as the removal or clearing of forested areas, profoundly affects slope stability and the likelihood of mass movement events. Trees and vegetation are essential for maintaining slope integrity, as their root systems bind the soil together, thereby reducing the likelihood of soil erosion and landslides. When trees are removed, the soil becomes loose and increasingly vulnerable to erosion caused by rainwater. This vulnerability is particularly pronounced on steep slopes, where the risk of landslides escalates.

In addition to binding the soil, trees also play a vital role in regulating soil moisture through a process known as transpiration. This process allows trees to absorb water from the soil, which helps decrease soil saturation and mitigate the risk of slope instability. However, when deforestation occurs, the soil tends to retain more water, making it heavier and more prone to movement. This saturation can trigger mass movement phenomena, such as mudslides and debris flows.

Furthermore, deforestation can lead to alterations in the local climate, which can indirectly exacerbate the risk of mass movement hazards. For example, the absence of trees may contribute to higher temperatures and diminished rainfall, increasing the likelihood of drought conditions. Drought can cause the soil to become dry and compact, rendering it more susceptible to cracking and subsequent movement.

Additionally, deforestation raises the risk of rockfalls. Trees often act as natural barriers that prevent loose rocks from descending slopes. The removal of these trees eliminates this protective barrier, thereby increasing the potential for rockfalls.

In summary, deforestation has a profound impact on the occurrence of mass movement hazards. It amplifies the risks of landslides, soil erosion, and rockfalls by destabilizing slopes, altering local climates, and removing natural protective barriers. Consequently, implementing sustainable forest management practices is essential for mitigating these risks.
