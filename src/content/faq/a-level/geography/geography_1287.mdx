The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) is composed of four distinct stages: pre-industrial, urbanizing/industrializing, mature industrial, and post-industrial.

In the first stage, known as the pre-industrial stage, both birth and death rates are high. This results in a relatively stable population size. The high death rates are often attributed to limited medical knowledge, which contributes to elevated infant mortality rates, as well as a societal reliance on children for labor. Consequently, life expectancy is generally low, and population growth is minimal.

The second stage, termed urbanizing/industrializing, is marked by a decline in death rates, which occurs due to advancements in healthcare and sanitation. Birth rates, however, remain high during this period, leading to significant population growth. Societal development begins to take shape, with enhancements in agriculture and the onset of industrialization, prompting a transition from rural to urban living.

In the third stage, known as mature industrial, birth rates start to decline as individuals migrate from rural areas to urban centers, where children are less economically advantageous. The use of contraception becomes more prevalent, and women increasingly join the workforce, both contributing to the reduction in birth rates. Although death rates continue to decrease, this decline occurs at a slower pace compared to stage two. The overall population continues to grow, but at a reduced rate.

The final stage, post-industrial, is characterized by both low birth and death rates, resulting in a stable or potentially declining population. This phenomenon often arises from increased wealth and improved living standards, which tend to lead to smaller family sizes. Additionally, the population tends to be older, as life expectancy rises and fertility rates decrease.

Each stage of the DTM illustrates a different phase in societal development, beginning with a pre-industrial society marked by high birth and death rates, progressing through stages of industrialization and urbanization, and culminating in a post-industrial society with low birth and death rates. It is essential to recognize that not all countries or regions adhere strictly to this model; cultural, economic, and historical factors can significantly influence demographic trends.
