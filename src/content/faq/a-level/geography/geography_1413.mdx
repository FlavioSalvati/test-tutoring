China's one-child policy effectively controlled population growth but resulted in significant social consequences.

Introduced in 1979, the one-child policy was a drastic measure aimed at curbing the country's rapid population increase. The policy achieved notable success, with the fertility rate declining from $2.75$ children per woman in $1979$ to $1.57$ in $2019$. This substantial reduction in birth rates helped alleviate the social, economic, and environmental pressures associated with overpopulation, allowing resources to be focused on a smaller population, which in turn contributed to China's economic growth.

However, the policy also led to serious social repercussions. One major consequence was a gender imbalance caused by a cultural preference for male children, resulting in a surplus of men and a shortage of women. This imbalance has led to social instability, including increased crime rates and difficulties for men in finding partners. Additionally, the policy has contributed to an aging population, with fewer young people available to support the elderly. This demographic shift has placed significant strain on China's social security and healthcare systems.

Moreover, the implementation of the policy has faced criticism for its methods, which often included forced abortions and sterilizations. These practices not only constituted violations of human rights but also inflicted psychological trauma on many women. Furthermore, the policy led to the emergence of "hidden children," who were born illegally and consequently denied access to essential public services such as education and healthcare.

In summary, while China's one-child policy successfully controlled population growth, it also generated substantial social issues. The negative impacts, including gender imbalance, an aging population, and human rights violations, ultimately led to the policy's relaxation in $2015$ and its replacement with a two-child policy in $2016$.
