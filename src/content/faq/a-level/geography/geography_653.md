A braided river channel is a distinctive type of river morphology characterized by a network of multiple channels that split and rejoin, forming a complex pattern within a larger river system.

This unique structure is defined by numerous small channels that frequently divide and recombine. These channels are separated by small, often temporary islands known as braid bars or, in British English, aits. The braided pattern emerges in environments where the sediment load is substantial enough to result in the deposition of shifting islands or bars between the channels.

The formation of a braided river channel is typically associated with a high sediment load and a steep gradient. A significant sediment load, often originating from glacial, mountainous, or desert environments, leads to frequent deposition within the river. This deposition causes the river to split into several smaller channels, thereby creating the characteristic braided pattern. Meanwhile, the steep gradient provides the energy necessary for the river to transport large volumes of sediment.

Braided rivers are also notable for their dynamic nature. The channels within a braided river are in constant flux, with new channels forming and old ones disappearing as the river deposits and erodes sediment. This variability results in significant changes in both the river's form and flow over time.

From a physical geography perspective, braided rivers are commonly found in environments with a substantial supply of coarse sediment, such as glacial outwash plains, alluvial fans, and river deltas. They are less prevalent in lowland areas where sediment is finer and the river's energy is lower.

In summary, the key features of a braided river channel include its intricate network of interweaving channels, high sediment load, steep gradient, and dynamic characteristics.
