Suspension is a vital process in which fine particles are transported by the flow of a river without making contact with the riverbed.

This process plays a crucial role in the transportation of sediments within a river system. Suspension occurs when the river's flow possesses sufficient strength to lift and carry fine particles, such as silt and clay. These particles become suspended within the water column—hence the term "suspension"—and are transported downstream by the river's current without contacting the riverbed.

The phenomenon of suspension is primarily influenced by the velocity and turbulence of the river flow. Faster and more turbulent flows are capable of carrying larger and heavier particles in suspension. In contrast, in slower, less turbulent flows, particles may settle out of suspension and accumulate on the riverbed. This explains why finer sediments like clay and silt are often found suspended in the middle and lower courses of a river, where the flow is generally more rapid and turbulent.

Furthermore, the volume of material carried in suspension is also affected by the river's load, defined as the total amount of material a river transports. A river with a higher load will have a greater quantity of material available for suspension. Additionally, human activities, such as deforestation and agricultural practices, can increase the amount of eroded material entering a river, thereby enhancing the potential for suspension.

In summary, suspension is a fundamental process in river transportation, enabling fine particles to be carried downstream without touching the riverbed. It is influenced by several factors, including river velocity, turbulence, load, and human activities.
