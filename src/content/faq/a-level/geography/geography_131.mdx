Ocean currents significantly influence the distribution of cyclones by affecting sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and atmospheric conditions.

Ocean currents are key determinants of SSTs, which are essential for the development and intensification of cyclones. For instance, tropical cyclones require SSTs of at least $26.5^\circ C$ to form. Warm ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio Current in the Pacific, can elevate SSTs, thereby creating favorable conditions for cyclone formation. In contrast, cold currents like the California Current in the Pacific and the Canary Current in the Atlantic can decrease SSTs, making cyclone development less likely.

Beyond their impact on SSTs, ocean currents also influence the atmospheric conditions necessary for cyclone formation. Warm ocean currents can increase evaporation rates, resulting in a more humid and unstable atmosphere. This enhanced humidity contributes to increased convective activity, which is vital for cyclone development. Conversely, cold currents can stabilize the atmosphere, thereby reducing the chances of cyclone formation.

Moreover, the direction of ocean currents can affect both the path and speed of cyclones. Cyclones typically follow the trajectory of the prevailing ocean current, which can either accelerate or decelerate their movement. For example, a cyclone moving in the same direction as a warm current may intensify and speed up, whereas a cyclone traveling against a cold current may weaken and slow down.

In summary, ocean currents play a crucial role in determining the distribution of cyclones by influencing both sea surface temperatures and atmospheric conditions. Understanding these interactions is essential for accurately predicting cyclone activity and developing effective disaster management strategies.
