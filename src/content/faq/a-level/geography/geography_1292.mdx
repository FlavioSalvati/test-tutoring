Urbanization significantly influences key population metrics, including growth, density, distribution, and demographic structure.

Urbanization refers to the movement of people from rural areas to cities, and it exerts a profound effect on population dynamics. One of the most notable impacts is on population growth. Urban areas, which offer better job opportunities, education, and healthcare, attract individuals from rural regions, resulting in a rapid increase in urban populations. This influx, combined with natural population growth, leads to a higher growth rate in urban areas compared to their rural counterparts.

Population density, another critical metric, is also affected by urbanization. As more individuals migrate to cities, the number of people per unit area—known as population density—increases. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where rapid and often unplanned urbanization can result in overcrowded slums and informal settlements. High population density places significant pressure on urban infrastructure and services, creating challenges related to housing, sanitation, and transportation.

Furthermore, urbanization influences the distribution of the population. As cities expand, the population becomes increasingly concentrated in urban areas, often leading to a decline in rural populations. This shift can alter the balance between urban and rural demographics. In some instances, it may result in 'urban sprawl,' where cities extend into surrounding rural areas, further changing population distribution.

Lastly, urbanization impacts the demographic structure of the population. Cities tend to attract young adults in search of employment and educational opportunities, resulting in a younger age demographic in urban environments. Consequently, rural areas may experience an 'ageing' population, as younger individuals migrate to cities. Additionally, the gender balance can be affected; often, more men migrate to urban areas for work, which can lead to a higher male-to-female ratio in cities.

In summary, urbanization has a significant impact on various population metrics, shaping growth, density, distribution, and demographic structure. Understanding these effects is essential for effective urban planning and management.
