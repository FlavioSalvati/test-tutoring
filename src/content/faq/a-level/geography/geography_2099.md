Geological factors that influence coastal erosion and deposition include rock type, structural characteristics, and coastal topography.

The type of rock present along a coastline is a critical determinant of the rate at which erosion and deposition occur. Hard rocks, such as granite and basalt, exhibit greater resistance to erosion, resulting in slower erosion rates along coastlines composed of these materials. In contrast, softer rocks like sandstone and limestone are more vulnerable to erosion, leading to more rapid coastal deterioration. The varying resistance of different rock types can give rise to distinct coastal features such as headlands and bays, where softer rocks erode more quickly, leaving behind the more resilient hard rocks.

The structural characteristics of rocks also play a significant role in coastal erosion and deposition. Rocks that are well-jointed or fractured are particularly susceptible to erosion, as water can penetrate these cracks, facilitating processes such as hydraulic action and freeze-thaw weathering. Conversely, rocks that are solid and feature few joints or fractures tend to be less prone to erosion. Additionally, the orientation of rock layers, or bedding planes, can influence erosion rates. For example, rock layers that slope towards the sea are more easily eroded by wave action.

Coastal topography is another vital factor affecting erosion and deposition. Steep cliffs are more likely to undergo mass movement processes such as landslides and rockfalls, which contribute to coastal erosion. In contrast, gentler slopes are less susceptible to such processes, resulting in slower erosion rates. Furthermore, the shape of the coastline can affect wave energy. Irregular coastlines can cause waves to refract, diminishing their energy and reducing their erosive capacity.

When it comes to deposition, areas with a gentle gradient or those sheltered behind headlands often experience sediment accumulation. This occurs because the energy of incoming waves is reduced, allowing sediment to settle. Additionally, coastal features such as spits, bars, and lagoons can facilitate deposition by trapping sediment and further diminishing wave energy. Thus, the geological characteristics of a coastline significantly influence the processes of coastal erosion and deposition.
