Greenhouse gases are essential for regulating temperature on Earth by trapping heat from the sun, which warms the planet's surface.

These gases—such as carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$), methane ($\text{CH}_4$), and nitrous oxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$)—naturally occur in the Earth's atmosphere and are fundamental to the planet's energy balance. They achieve this by absorbing and re-emitting longwave radiation emitted by the Earth. This phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, is crucial for maintaining the Earth's average temperature and supporting life.

When solar energy reaches the Earth, some of it is reflected back into space, while the remainder is absorbed by the Earth's surface. The absorbed energy is subsequently re-emitted as longwave radiation, or heat. Greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere capture this heat, preventing it from escaping back into space. They then re-emit this heat in all directions, including back towards the Earth's surface. This mechanism contributes to the warming of both the Earth's surface and the lower atmosphere, creating conditions conducive to life.

However, human activities—such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation—have significantly elevated the concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere. This increase amplifies the greenhouse effect, resulting in a rise in the Earth's average temperature, a phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. The consequences of this warming include alterations in weather patterns, rising sea levels, and other long-term transformations in the Earth's climate system.

In conclusion, while greenhouse gases play a vital role in atmospheric transfers by trapping heat from the sun and warming the Earth's surface, human activities have intensified this natural process, leading to global warming and significant climate change.
