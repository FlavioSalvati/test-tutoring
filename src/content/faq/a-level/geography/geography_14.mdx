Urban hierarchy refers to a systematic ranking of cities based on their size and functional complexity.

This concept is a fundamental principle in human geography, providing insights into the distribution and roles of cities within a region or country. Urban hierarchy categorizes cities and towns according to factors such as population size, economic activity, and the variety and complexity of services they offer.

At the pinnacle of this hierarchy are large, globally influential cities, often termed 'world cities' or 'global cities'. Examples of such cities include London, New York, and Tokyo. These metropolitan areas are characterized by their substantial populations, diverse economies, and extensive range of services. They serve as major centers of political power, economic activity, and cultural influence, boasting significant international connections.

Just below these world cities are regional or national capitals, which act as administrative, economic, and cultural hubs within their respective areas. While they may not wield the same global influence as world cities, they are vital to their national economies and often hold considerable regional sway.

Further down the hierarchy are smaller cities and towns that cater primarily to localized populations and offer a limited range of services and economic diversity. Examples include provincial or county towns, suburban areas, and small rural settlements.

It is important to note that urban hierarchy is not static; it can evolve over time due to various factors such as economic development, population growth, and advancements in transportation and communication technologies. For instance, the rise of the internet and digital technologies has enabled some smaller cities and towns to ascend the urban hierarchy by becoming influential centers for the tech industry and digital services.

Understanding urban hierarchy is crucial for effective urban planning and policy-making. It assists in identifying where resources and services are most needed and elucidates the connections between different cities and towns within the broader regional, national, or global economy.
