Tropical karst landscapes arise from the dissolution of soluble rocks, such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum, in humid tropical climates.

Karst landscapes are distinguished by unique surface and subterranean features formed through a chemical weathering process known as karstification. This process occurs when water, which becomes slightly acidic due to dissolved carbon dioxide, percolates through the soil and bedrock. In tropical regions, the combination of high rainfall and warm temperatures significantly accelerates this process, resulting in the formation of tropical karst landscapes.

The soluble rocks, primarily limestone, dolomite, and gypsum, are particularly vulnerable to dissolution by this acidic water. As the water infiltrates the cracks and fissures in the rock, it gradually dissolves the material, enlarging these openings and creating intricate underground drainage systems. Over time, this leads to the development of various karst features, including sinkholes, caves, and disappearing streams.

In tropical areas, the abundant rainfall contributes to a rapid rate of rock dissolution. Meanwhile, the warm temperatures increase the water's capacity to hold dissolved carbon dioxide, enhancing its acidity and further promoting the dissolution process. Additionally, the lush vegetation typical of these regions releases organic acids into the water, further elevating its acidity and accelerating the rate of dissolution.

As a result, tropical karst landscapes are characterized by a high density of karst features, including extensive and complex cave systems, vast underground rivers, and striking surface formations such as towers and cones. These landscapes are often aesthetically remarkable and play a vital role in supporting biodiversity. However, they also present challenges for human habitation and development due to their fragile nature and susceptibility to erosion and collapse.
