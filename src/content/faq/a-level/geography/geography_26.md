Urban renewal is a strategy employed by cities to revitalize neighborhoods that have deteriorated or become economically depressed. In the Central Business District (CBD), this process often involves the redevelopment of aging buildings, enhancements to infrastructure, and the creation of new business opportunities. 

One of the most notable outcomes of urban renewal is the enhancement of infrastructure. This can include upgrades to roads, public transportation systems, and utilities, all of which make the CBD more accessible and appealing to both businesses and residents.

Another significant effect of urban renewal is the increase in property values. As areas are improved and become more desirable, property values in those regions often rise. This upward trend can result in increased revenue for the city through property taxes and can benefit property owners. However, rising property values can also lead to gentrification, a process in which original residents may be displaced due to escalating costs.

Gentrification is a contentious aspect of urban renewal. While it can contribute to a more affluent and vibrant CBD, it can also lead to the displacement of lower-income residents. This displacement can create social tensions and result in a reduction of cultural diversity within the CBD.

Moreover, urban renewal can alter the character of the CBD. As historic buildings are replaced with new developments, the area's historical essence may be lost. This transformation can spark controversy, as many people appreciate the historical character of a neighborhood and consider it a vital component of the city's identity.

In summary, urban renewal can have profound effects on the CBD. While it may lead to improvements in infrastructure and increased property values, it can also give rise to gentrification and changes in the area's character.
