Sleet, also known as ice pellets, is a type of solid precipitation that forms under specific atmospheric conditions. It occurs when raindrops pass through a layer of freezing air near the ground, causing them to freeze into ice pellets.

The formation of sleet involves a unique atmospheric structure. Typically, it occurs when a layer of warm air is situated between two layers of cold air. As snowflakes descend from the upper cold layer, they pass through the warm air and melt into raindrops. These raindrops then travel through the colder layer near the ground, where they freeze again and transform into sleet.

Sleet is distinct from other forms of precipitation, such as rain, snow, and hail. While rain and snow generally form in more uniform temperature conditions, sleet requires a vertical temperature profile that includes both above-freezing and below-freezing temperatures. In contrast, hail is produced during thunderstorms and is significantly larger than sleet.

Sleet possesses several notable characteristics. Typically, sleet is transparent and spherical, with a diameter of less than $5$ millimeters. It has a tendency to bounce upon impact with the ground or other hard surfaces, unlike snow, which tends to accumulate. Sleet can create slippery conditions, posing hazards to both pedestrians and vehicles. Additionally, it can accumulate on trees and power lines, leading to potential damage.

Geographically, sleet is more prevalent in temperate regions, where warm and cold air masses can coexist. It is less common in polar and tropical areas, which tend to have more uniform temperature profiles. The frequency of sleet occurrences can vary significantly from year to year and from one location to another, depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions.
