The Barefoot College in Tilonia, India, serves as an inspiring model of rural development achieved through education and empowerment.

Founded in 1972 by social activist Bunker Roy, the Barefoot College is located in the small village of Tilonia in Rajasthan, India. Its mission is to deliver essential services and tackle challenges faced by rural communities, with active involvement from the communities themselves.

The college has effectively pursued its goals by emphasizing the education and empowerment of the rural poor, particularly women. It offers a diverse array of courses such as solar engineering, water testing, and puppetry, all taught by members of the rural community. This unique approach not only equips the rural poor with valuable skills but also empowers them to take an active role in their own development.

One of the college's most notable initiatives is its solar engineering program. This program trains illiterate and semi-literate rural women to become solar engineers, enabling them to return to their villages and install as well as maintain solar lighting systems. As a result, this initiative has provided clean and sustainable energy solutions to rural communities while simultaneously empowering women by offering them a source of income and a renewed sense of purpose.

Additionally, the Barefoot College has made significant strides in promoting sustainable development in rural areas. It has implemented a rainwater harvesting system that supplies clean drinking water to over $200,000$ individuals across more than $1,300$ villages. The college also advocates for organic farming practices and has established a seed bank to preserve indigenous seed varieties.

In summary, the Barefoot College in Tilonia, India, exemplifies a successful case of rural development. It has effectively addressed basic service needs and challenges within rural communities, fostered sustainable development, and empowered the rural poor, with a particular focus on women.
