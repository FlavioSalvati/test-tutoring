Sea level change has a significant impact on coastal landforms, driving processes such as erosion and deposition, while also altering habitats.

Changes in sea level, whether a rise or fall, profoundly affect coastal geographies. A rise in sea level, often caused by thermal expansion of seawater or the melting of ice caps and glaciers, can result in the submergence of coastal areas. This process leads to the formation of new landforms, such as rias, fjords, and drowned valleys. For example, the English Channel was shaped by rising sea levels following the last Ice Age.

Conversely, a decline in sea level exposes previously submerged regions, resulting in the creation of landforms such as raised beaches, marine terraces, and wave-cut platforms. This phenomenon, known as regression, can be observed in locations like the Isle of Jura in Scotland, where raised beaches are notably prominent.

Sea level fluctuations also significantly influence coastal erosion and deposition processes. Elevated sea levels can accelerate coastal erosion, leading to the development of features such as cliffs, wave-cut platforms, and headlands. In contrast, lower sea levels can decelerate erosion while promoting deposition, resulting in the formation of features like beaches, spits, and bars.

Moreover, changes in sea level can dramatically alter coastal habitats. Rising sea levels can inundate coastal marshes and mangroves, converting these areas into open water. This transformation not only reshapes the physical landscape but also impacts the biodiversity within these ecosystems. On the other hand, falling sea levels may expose these habitats, leading to desiccation and the creation of different landforms.

In summary, sea level changes are crucial in shaping coastal landforms. They can generate new landforms, modify existing ones, and even transform coastal habitats. Understanding these dynamic processes is essential for predicting future changes to our coastlines and for effective coastal management.
