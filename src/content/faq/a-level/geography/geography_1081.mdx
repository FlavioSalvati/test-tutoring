Exfoliation is a weathering process in which rocks peel away in layers due to fluctuations in temperature or pressure.

Also known as onion skin weathering, exfoliation is a type of physical weathering that typically affects layered rocks or those with visible joints. This phenomenon is most prevalent in environments that experience significant variations in temperature and pressure.

The exfoliation process begins when rocks are exposed to environmental elements. During the day, the outer layer of the rock absorbs heat and expands more than the cooler, inner layers. At night, this outer layer cools down and contracts. The continuous cycle of expansion and contraction creates stress within the rock, resulting in the formation of cracks that run parallel to the surface. Over time, these cracks deepen and widen, causing the outer layer of the rock to peel away. This specific form of exfoliation is often referred to as thermal exfoliation.

Changes in pressure can also trigger exfoliation. When overlying rock layers are removed due to erosion, the underlying rocks experience a reduction in pressure, which allows them to expand and crack. This process is known as unloading or pressure release exfoliation.

Exfoliation plays a significant role in shaping landscapes, especially in mountainous regions, where it can lead to the development of distinctive rock formations, such as domes. Additionally, it contributes to soil formation, as the weathered rock material enriches the soil layer.

Understanding the mechanism of exfoliation is essential in the field of geography, as it provides insight into the processes that shape the Earth's surface. Furthermore, this knowledge has practical implications in various industries, including construction, where recognizing weathering processes can inform the selection of appropriate building materials.
