Coastal headlands and bays form as a result of differential erosion of various rock types along a coastline.

Coastlines are inherently diverse, consisting of different rock types that exhibit varying degrees of resistance to erosion. When waves strike the coastline, softer and less resistant materials, such as sand and clay, erode more rapidly than harder, more resilient rocks like chalk and granite. This selective erosion is referred to as differential erosion.

As time progresses, the softer rocks are gradually worn away, leading to the creation of indentations in the coastline known as bays. Typically, bays are rounded and provide sheltered waters, flanked by the protruding headlands. In contrast, the harder rocks erode at a slower pace and extend into the ocean, forming headlands. These headlands are often subjected to the full force of incoming waves, which can lead to processes such as hydraulic action and abrasion. Over time, these processes can result in the development of distinct coastal features including caves, arches, stacks, and stumps.

The formation of headlands and bays is a dynamic and ongoing process that spans thousands of years. As the sea continues to erode the softer rock materials, bays expand, and headlands become increasingly prominent. This continual transformation can significantly reshape the coastal landscape, giving rise to a variety of visually striking and geographically important features.

In conclusion, the development of coastal headlands and bays is driven by the differential erosion of various rock types along the coastline. Softer rocks are eroded more quickly, resulting in the formation of bays, while the more resistant rocks persist, creating headlands. This ongoing process can dramatically alter the coastline's appearance over time.
