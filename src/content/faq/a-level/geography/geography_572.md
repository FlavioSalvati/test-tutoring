Land use changes can dramatically affect the characteristics of hydrographs in drainage basins.

These changes, which include deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural practices, have substantial implications for the hydrological cycle within a drainage basin, thereby influencing the shape and features of its hydrograph. A hydrograph is a graphical representation that illustrates how a drainage basin responds to a specific period of rainfall. It serves as a vital tool for understanding the relationship between precipitation and the flow of water in a river.

For instance, deforestation tends to create a more 'flashy' hydrograph. Trees and vegetation play a critical role in intercepting rainfall, slowing its movement, and facilitating its infiltration into the soil. When these plants are removed, rainfall reaches the ground more rapidly, resulting in increased surface runoff and a shorter lag time on the hydrograph. This can lead to a higher peak discharge and an increased risk of flooding.

Conversely, urbanization often results in the development of impermeable surfaces, such as roads and pavements. These surfaces inhibit the infiltration of water into the soil, heightening surface runoff and decreasing the time it takes for water to flow into the river. This process typically leads to a shorter lag time and a higher peak discharge on the hydrograph. Furthermore, urban areas frequently feature efficient drainage systems that rapidly channel water into rivers, further intensifying these effects.

Agricultural practices also play a significant role in shaping hydrographs. For example, ploughing can disrupt the soil surface, enhancing its permeability and promoting infiltration. This may result in a longer lag time and a lower peak discharge on the hydrograph. However, overgrazing by livestock can compact the soil, diminishing its permeability and leading to increased surface runoff.

In summary, land use changes can significantly alter the characteristics of hydrographs in drainage basins. Understanding these impacts is essential for effective water resource management and for mitigating flood risks.
