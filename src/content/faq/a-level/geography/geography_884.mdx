Dew forms when the air cools to its dew point, leading to the condensation of water vapor on cooler surfaces.

Dew is a type of atmospheric moisture that occurs when the air temperature drops to its dew point. The dew point is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated and can no longer retain all of its water vapor. This phenomenon typically takes place during the night when the air near the ground cools. As the air temperature decreases, it reaches a point of saturation, causing the excess water vapor to condense into liquid water droplets. These droplets accumulate on various surfaces, such as grass, leaves, and cars.

Several factors influence the formation of dew, including air temperature, humidity, and the temperature of the surfaces involved. For dew to develop, the surface must be cooler than the air above it. This is why dew is commonly observed in the early morning hours, as the ground cools overnight while the air temperature remains relatively constant. If the surface temperature falls below $0$ degrees Celsius, the dew will freeze, resulting in frost.

Dew plays a significant role in the climate and the water cycle. It contributes to the overall moisture content of the environment, which is particularly vital in arid regions, where it can serve as a crucial water source for plants and animals. Additionally, dew can affect surface temperatures; when it evaporates, it cools the surface, potentially influencing local weather patterns. Furthermore, the formation of dew provides insights into the dew point, a critical parameter in weather forecasting.

In agriculture, understanding the processes behind dew formation can assist farmers in managing irrigation and protecting crops from frost damage. For instance, farmers can utilize dew point forecasts to determine optimal watering times, minimizing water loss due to evaporation. Additionally, being aware of the likelihood of dew formation can help farmers implement strategies to safeguard sensitive crops from frost damage.
