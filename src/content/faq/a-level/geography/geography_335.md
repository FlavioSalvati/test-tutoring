The primary drivers of global environmental degradation include deforestation, pollution, overpopulation, and climate change.

Deforestation plays a crucial role in environmental degradation. This process involves the clearing of forests and vegetation to accommodate agricultural activities, logging, or urban development. The consequences are severe: it results in habitat destruction and a significant loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, deforestation contributes to climate change by diminishing the capacity of forests to absorb carbon dioxide.

Pollution, in its various forms, is another major contributor to environmental degradation. Air pollution arises from industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust, while water pollution stems from untreated sewage and industrial waste. Soil pollution is caused by hazardous chemicals and improper waste disposal. These pollutants pose serious threats to wildlife and ecosystems, contaminate food chains, and jeopardize human health.

Overpopulation is a significant factor in this issue. As the global population continues to rise, the demand for natural resources—such as water, land, and energy—also increases. This heightened demand often leads to the overexploitation and depletion of these vital resources, resulting in further environmental degradation. Additionally, overpopulation generates more waste, which can exacerbate pollution if not managed effectively.

Finally, climate change, predominantly driven by human activities, stands as a major cause of environmental degradation. The rise in global temperatures leads to a variety of environmental impacts, including rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and altered precipitation patterns. Such changes threaten ecosystems, contribute to biodiversity loss, and intensify other forms of environmental degradation.

In summary, environmental degradation is a multifaceted issue with numerous contributing factors. It is primarily fueled by human activities such as deforestation, pollution, overpopulation, and climate change. These activities disrupt ecosystems, deplete natural resources, and contribute to global warming, resulting in further environmental harm.
