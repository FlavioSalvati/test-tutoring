Plate tectonics play a crucial role in shaping global seismic activity, primarily by triggering earthquakes when tectonic plates interact at their boundaries.

The theory of plate tectonics posits that the Earth's outer shell is divided into several large plates that float on the semi-fluid mantle, the rocky layer situated above the core. These tectonic plates are in constant motion, albeit very slowly, driven by convection currents in the underlying mantle. This movement is the principal factor behind seismic activity worldwide.

At the boundaries where these plates meet, they can interact in three primary ways: they can move apart (divergent boundaries), come together (convergent boundaries), or slide past one another (transform boundaries). Each type of interaction leads to distinct seismic phenomena. 

For example, at divergent boundaries, as plates separate, magma rises from the mantle to fill the void, resulting in the formation of new crust. This process often leads to volcanic activity and can trigger minor earthquakes.

In contrast, convergent boundaries occur when one plate is forced beneath another in a process known as subduction. The subducting plate descends into the mantle, where it melts, generating magma that can lead to volcanic eruptions. The immense pressure and friction at these boundaries can also produce powerful earthquakes.

At transform boundaries, tectonic plates slide past each other. During this sliding motion, they may become locked due to friction, leading to a build-up of stress over time. When this stress is eventually released, it results in earthquakes. A notable example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California.

In conclusion, the movement and interaction of tectonic plates are essential for understanding global seismic activity. The specific type of boundary and the nature of the interactions between plates determine the intensity and nature of seismic events, including both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
