Countries in Stage 4 of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) encounter several significant challenges, including an ageing population, low birth rates, and economic pressures.

In Stage 4 of the DTM, countries typically experience both low birth rates and low death rates, resulting in a stable or gradually increasing population. A primary challenge in this stage is the ageing population. As life expectancy increases and birth rates decline, the proportion of older individuals within the population rises. This demographic shift can exert considerable pressure on healthcare systems and social services, as older adults generally require more medical care and support. Furthermore, a declining birth rate can lead to a shrinking working-age population, which carries substantial economic implications.

Another critical issue is the persistently low birth rate. In many Stage 4 countries, women often opt to have fewer children due to various factors, such as greater access to education and career opportunities, alongside the high costs associated with raising children. If the birth rate falls below the death rate, this can result in a declining population. Such a demographic trend can negatively impact the economy by reducing the number of individuals available to work and contribute to economic growth.

Economic pressures also pose a significant challenge for countries in Stage 4. As the population ages and the workforce contracts, governments may face increased demands to provide pensions and healthcare for the elderly. This situation can lead to higher taxes, which may be unpopular and could adversely affect the economy. Additionally, with fewer young people entering the workforce, there may be a shortage of skilled workers in specific sectors, further impacting economic growth.

In conclusion, countries at Stage 4 of the DTM confront a variety of challenges, including an ageing population, low birth rates, and economic pressures. Addressing these challenges necessitates careful management and strategic planning to ensure the stability and prosperity of the country in the future.
