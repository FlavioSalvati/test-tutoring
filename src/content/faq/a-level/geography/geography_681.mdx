Saltation refers to the process by which particles bounce along the riverbed as a result of the water flow's force.

In greater detail, saltation is one of the primary mechanisms of sediment transport within a river channel. This process involves the movement of small to medium-sized particles, such as sand and gravel. These particles are lifted off the riverbed by the water's flow and subsequently dropped back down, resulting in a characteristic bouncing or hopping motion. The term 'saltation' is derived from the Latin word 'saltare,' which means 'to leap.'

The efficacy of saltation largely depends on the velocity and turbulence of the river. When the flow of the river is sufficiently strong, it can generate enough force to lift particles off the riverbed. However, gravity acts on these particles, pulling them back down and causing them to bounce along the riverbed. This bouncing motion can also result in collisions with other particles, which further contributes to the erosion and transportation of sediment.

Saltation plays a significant role in shaping the river landscape. It aids in the erosion of the riverbed and banks, facilitates the downstream transport of sediment, and contributes to the deposition of sediment in areas where the river flow decelerates. Additionally, saltation is a key factor in the formation of various river features, such as bars, braided channels, and meanders.

A comprehensive understanding of the saltation process is essential for geographers who study river dynamics and landscape evolution. This knowledge elucidates how rivers transport sediment and sculpt the land over time, which has important implications for river management and conservation practices.
