Weathering and mass movement play vital roles in the erosion and transformation of coastal cliffs over time.

Both weathering and mass movement significantly influence the morphology of coastal cliffs. Weathering is the process through which rocks at the Earth's surface break down due to atmospheric and environmental conditions. On coastal cliffs, this can occur through two primary types: physical weathering and chemical weathering. Physical weathering includes processes such as freeze-thaw cycles and salt crystallization, while chemical weathering involves reactions such as carbonation and oxidation. These weathering processes weaken the cliff face, making it more vulnerable to erosion.

Physical weathering, exemplified by freeze-thaw cycles, occurs when water infiltrates cracks in the rock. When this water freezes, it expands, exerting pressure on the rock and causing it to fracture. Salt crystallization occurs when seawater evaporates, leaving behind salt crystals that expand and exert pressure on the rock, leading to disintegration. Chemical weathering, on the other hand, involves the interaction of specific minerals in the rock with atmospheric components or acids. A notable example is carbonation, which occurs when rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, forming a weak carbonic acid that reacts with limestone cliffs, causing them to dissolve.

Mass movement, often referred to as mass wasting, entails the downward movement of rock and soil driven by gravity. This movement can occur gradually, as in the case of creep, or suddenly, as seen in landslides or rockfalls. Such movements are typically triggered by factors like heavy rainfall, which saturates the soil and increases its weight, or by wave action that undercuts the cliff. The material removed from cliffs during mass movement contributes significantly to coastal erosion, resulting in cliff retreat and the formation of features such as wave-cut platforms.

In summary, weathering weakens the cliff face, making it more prone to mass movement, which in turn removes material from the cliff. Together, these processes are essential to the ongoing erosion and reshaping of coastal cliffs.
