The informal sector plays a crucial role in bridging gaps in service delivery within urban areas, particularly in developing countries. However, it can also exacerbate existing challenges.

The informal sector encompasses unregulated businesses and services that often emerge to fill voids left by formal, government-operated systems that may be inadequate or inefficient. For example, in many cities, informal transportation services such as minibuses and motorbike taxis are essential for facilitating mobility, especially in regions poorly served by official public transport systems. Additionally, informal waste collectors are instrumental in managing waste in urban environments where formal waste management services are lacking.

Despite these benefits, the unregulated nature of informal services can lead to significant issues. Service quality tends to be inconsistent, and safety can be compromised due to the absence of oversight. For instance, informal transportation providers may not comply with safety regulations, putting passengers at risk. Similarly, informal waste collectors may dispose of refuse in ways that are neither safe nor environmentally sustainable.

The informal sector also influences the delivery of formal services. Informal housing developments, for example, can place considerable strain on urban infrastructure and essential services such as water and electricity. These settlements often expand rapidly and without proper planning, resulting in overcrowding and inadequate service provision, which negatively impacts residents' quality of life.

Moreover, the informal sector can diminish government revenue, as many businesses operating within it do not pay taxes. This loss of tax income restricts the resources available for public services, further complicating the challenges of service delivery in urban areas.

In summary, while the informal sector can effectively fill service gaps in urban environments, it also introduces and intensifies various challenges related to service delivery. Therefore, it is essential to understand and address the role of the informal sector to enhance urban service systems effectively.
