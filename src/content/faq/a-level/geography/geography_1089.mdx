**Freeze-Thaw Weathering: A Detailed Explanation**

Freeze-thaw weathering, often referred to as frost weathering, is a type of physical weathering that occurs through the repeated cycles of freezing and thawing of water within the cracks and crevices of rocks. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in regions characterized by cold climates, where temperatures oscillate around the freezing point of water.

The process initiates when water infiltrates the cracks and fissures of rocks during warmer periods. As temperatures decline and the water freezes, it expands by approximately $9\%$. This expansion generates considerable pressure on the surrounding rock, leading to its weakening. When temperatures rise again, the ice melts, allowing the water to penetrate even deeper into the rock. This cycle of freezing and thawing repeats over time, progressively causing the rock to crack and ultimately break apart.

Although the freeze-thaw action is a slow and gradual process, its long-term effects on the landscape can be substantial. It can result in the formation of features such as scree slopes, where fragments of broken rock accumulate at the base of cliffs or hillsides. Additionally, this weathering process may contribute to the development of larger landforms, including valleys and fjords, particularly in glaciated regions.

In conclusion, freeze-thaw action is a significant natural force that can lead to considerable weathering of rocks. This process illustrates how even water, in its frozen state, can profoundly influence the shaping of the Earth's surface over time.
