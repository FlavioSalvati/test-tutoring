International tourism has the potential to significantly enhance a host country's economy through various channels, including job creation, foreign exchange earnings, and infrastructure development.

To begin with, international tourism serves as a vital source of employment. It generates jobs directly within the tourism sector and indirectly in related fields such as food production and retail. This influx of employment opportunities can lead to a decrease in unemployment rates, particularly in areas with limited job prospects. For instance, in many island nations, the tourism industry is the dominant economic driver, providing the majority of available jobs.

Moreover, international tourism contributes considerably to foreign exchange earnings for the host country. When tourists spend money on accommodations, meals, attractions, and souvenirs, they effectively inject foreign capital into the local economy. This influx can strengthen the host country's currency and improve its balance of payments. For example, in 2019, tourism accounted for $11.9\%$ of Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP), highlighting the significant impact that foreign visitors can have on the economy.

Additionally, the expansion of tourism often leads to infrastructure development. This includes enhancements to roads, airports, and public transportation systems, as well as the construction of new hotels and attractions. While these improvements primarily cater to tourists, they also provide benefits to local residents by enhancing their quality of life and promoting growth in other economic sectors. For example, better transportation links can facilitate the movement of goods to market, thereby supporting local businesses.

However, it is essential to recognize that while international tourism can yield considerable economic advantages, it can also result in negative consequences. These may include environmental degradation, cultural commodification, and an over-reliance on a single industry. Therefore, it is crucial for host countries to manage tourism sustainably, ensuring that the benefits are equitably distributed and that adverse impacts are minimized.
