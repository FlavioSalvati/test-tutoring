The primary types of marine erosion are hydraulic action, abrasion, attrition, and solution.

**Hydraulic Action** is the most powerful form of marine erosion. This process occurs when waves crash against the coastline, trapping air within cracks and crevices of the rock. The pressure from the trapped air, combined with the force of the wave, can cause the rock to fracture and break apart. Over time, this relentless action leads to the formation of features such as caves, arches, and stacks along the coast.

**Abrasion**, also referred to as corrasion, represents another significant type of marine erosion. This process involves the scraping, scouring, and rubbing of rock surfaces by materials carried along by the waves. The rocks and pebbles transported by the waves act like sandpaper, gradually wearing down the coastline. This erosion can result in the creation of wave-cut platforms and various other coastal features.

**Attrition** is a process by which rocks and pebbles carried by the waves are worn down as they collide with one another and with the shoreline. This continual impact results in the formation of smaller, smoother, and rounder particles. Over time, attrition can significantly alter both the shape and composition of the coastline.

**Solution**, also known as corrosion, is a chemical process in which specific types of rock, such as limestone and chalk, are dissolved by the acidity present in seawater. This dissolution can lead to the development of unique coastal formations, including limestone pavements and chalk cliffs.

Each of these processes plays a vital role in shaping our coastlines. They contribute to the formation of a diverse array of coastal features, ranging from dramatic cliffs and headlands to gentle bays and sandy beaches. Understanding these erosion processes is essential for comprehending the dynamic nature of our coastlines and the various forces that influence their evolution.
