International trade has a dual impact on global economic inequality; it can both exacerbate and alleviate disparities, depending on the specific circumstances involved.

International trade can contribute to global economic inequality through various mechanisms. Firstly, it often results in the exploitation of developing nations by wealthier countries. This exploitation is frequently manifested in unfair trade agreements, where developed nations impose tariffs and quotas on goods imported from poorer countries, hindering their ability to compete effectively in the global marketplace. Additionally, multinational corporations tend to capitalize on low labor costs in developing countries, offering meager wages and poor working conditions. Such practices can lead to an increasing divide between the wealthy and the impoverished within these nations, thereby exacerbating global economic inequality.

Conversely, international trade can also play a role in reducing global economic inequality. It provides developing countries with access to larger markets, enabling them to sell their goods and services to a broader audience. This increased market access can result in greater income and economic growth, which can help lift individuals out of poverty. Moreover, international trade can facilitate the transfer of technology and skills from developed nations to developing ones, enhancing productivity and fostering economic development.

Nevertheless, the advantages of international trade are not uniformly distributed. Certain countries may reap more benefits than others, influenced by factors such as their level of development, availability of natural resources, and the strength of their political and economic institutions. For instance, nations with robust institutions and effective governance are more likely to harness the benefits of international trade, while those beset by weak institutions and high corruption may struggle to do the same.

In conclusion, international trade plays a complex role in shaping global economic inequality. It can contribute to inequality as well as help alleviate it, depending on a range of factors. As such, it is crucial for policymakers to thoughtfully evaluate the potential impacts of trade policies on inequality and to implement measures that promote a more equitable distribution of the benefits of trade.
