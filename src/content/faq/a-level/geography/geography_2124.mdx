Longshore drift plays a significant role in the development of depositional landforms by transporting and depositing sediment along coastlines.

Longshore drift is a geological process that involves the movement of sediments—such as sand and pebbles—along the shore. This process is primarily driven by waves that approach the coastline at an angle, a phenomenon referred to as wave obliquity. When waves break upon the shore, they carry sediment upwards and along the beach in the direction of the incoming wave. As the water recedes, it transports sediment back down the beach at a right angle to the shoreline, a movement known as backwash. This alternating motion creates a zigzag pattern in the movement of sediment, commonly referred to as beach drift.

Over time, the persistent action of longshore drift can lead to substantial alterations in the coastline. The sediment that is transported is ultimately deposited in areas where wave energy diminishes, resulting in the formation of various depositional landforms. These features can include spits, bars, tombolos, and barrier islands. For instance, a spit—a narrow, elongated strip of sand that extends from the shore into the water—forms when longshore drift moves sediment along the coast and deposits it in regions where the current slows down.

Additionally, longshore drift can facilitate the growth and movement of sand dunes. As wind and waves transport sand along the beach, it can accumulate and form dunes. These dunes may subsequently be stabilized by vegetation, leading to the creation of new landforms.

In summary, longshore drift is essential for shaping our coastlines. By gaining a deeper understanding of this process, we can more effectively predict and manage changes to our coastal environments.
