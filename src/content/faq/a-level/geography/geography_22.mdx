Shanty towns, often referred to as informal settlements, are predominantly found in low-income countries (LICs) and middle-income countries (MICs), where they encounter several critical challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, insufficient sanitation, and limited access to essential services.

These settlements are typically characterized by substandard housing conditions and overall squalor. One of the most pressing issues is the lack of adequate infrastructure. The dwellings are frequently constructed from makeshift materials such as corrugated iron, cardboard, or plastic, and are not designed to endure extreme weather events. As a result, these structures are particularly susceptible to natural disasters, including floods, landslides, and fires. Moreover, the absence of proper roads and transportation systems complicates residents' ability to reach employment, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities.

Another significant hurdle is the lack of sufficient sanitation. Many shanty towns do not have access to clean water or effective waste disposal systems, leading to unsanitary living conditions that can facilitate the spread of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery. The absence of toilets and sewage systems poses further environmental risks, as waste often contaminates rivers and other water sources.

The limited access to basic services is also a major concern. Numerous shanty towns are not connected to the electricity grid, forcing residents to rely on hazardous and unreliable energy sources, such as kerosene lamps or open flames. Additionally, access to healthcare and education is severely restricted, resulting in many children missing out on schooling and adults suffering from untreated medical conditions.

In addition to these challenges, shanty towns often grapple with issues of crime and social instability. The lack of formal law enforcement, combined with high poverty levels, tends to foster elevated crime rates, including theft, violence, and drug trafficking. This creates a vicious cycle of poverty and crime that is difficult to escape.

Finally, residents of shanty towns frequently lack legal rights to the land they occupy, rendering them vulnerable to eviction. Without legal protections, they can be forcibly removed from their homes with little to no notice, leading to increased instability and hardship.
