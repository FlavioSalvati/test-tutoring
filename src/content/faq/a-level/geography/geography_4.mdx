The perceptions of host societies play a pivotal role in shaping the development of migration policies, as they directly influence public opinion and political decision-making.

The way host societies view migrants is often molded by various factors, including media representations, personal experiences, and prevailing societal attitudes toward diversity and change. When a host society holds a positive view of migrants, it is more inclined to support policies that promote migration and integration. In contrast, negative perceptions can lead to the implementation of restrictive migration policies.

Public opinion is a critical driver in shaping political agendas. Politicians frequently respond to the sentiments of their constituents to maintain support and ensure re-election. Consequently, if a substantial portion of a host society harbors negative views about migrants, politicians may feel compelled to enact stricter migration policies. Such measures may include tighter border controls, more stringent visa requirements, and diminished rights for migrants.

The media also has a significant impact on shaping societal perceptions. The portrayal of migrants in the media can markedly influence public opinion. For instance, if migrants are frequently depicted as threats to employment or national security, this can foster anti-migrant sentiment and bolster support for restrictive migration measures. Conversely, positive portrayals can cultivate a more welcoming attitude toward migrants, encouraging support for inclusive policies.

Moreover, societal attitudes toward diversity and change further influence perceptions of migrants. Societies that embrace diversity and are open to change tend to be more welcoming of migrants and supportive of policies that facilitate migration. In contrast, societies resistant to change and lacking tolerance for diversity may perceive migrants as a threat, resulting in backing for restrictive migration policies.

In summary, the perceptions held by host societies significantly affect the formulation of migration policies. Understanding these perceptions and their underlying causes is essential for policymakers aiming to create effective and inclusive migration strategies.
