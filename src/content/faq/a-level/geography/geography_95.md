Developed countries generally possess more advanced and comprehensive coastal management strategies compared to their developing counterparts.

In developed nations, coastal management strategies tend to be more sophisticated, largely due to the availability of resources, technology, and expertise. These countries typically have the financial means to invest in large-scale engineering projects, such as sea walls, groynes, and beach nourishment initiatives. Additionally, they leverage advanced technologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to monitor and manage coastal areas effectively. Moreover, developed countries often benefit from well-established institutions and legal frameworks that support the implementation and enforcement of coastal management practices. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Environment Agency is tasked with managing flood and coastal erosion risks, operating within a robust legal framework that includes the Flood and Water Management Act of 2010.

Conversely, developing countries frequently encounter significant challenges in executing effective coastal management strategies due to limited resources and capacities. These nations may lack the financial resources necessary for large-scale engineering projects and often do not possess the technological capabilities required for effective monitoring and management of coastal areas. Furthermore, the institutional and legal frameworks governing coastal management in these countries may be weak or nonexistent. Consequently, coastal management in developing countries often resorts to traditional and low-cost methods, such as utilizing natural barriers like mangroves and coral reefs. However, these methods may be inadequate in safeguarding against the escalating threats of coastal erosion and rising sea levels associated with climate change.

Additionally, the socio-economic context plays a crucial role in shaping coastal management strategies. In developed countries, there is often a stronger emphasis on protecting property and infrastructure. In contrast, developing countries may prioritize the protection of livelihoods and natural resources. For example, in Bangladesh—a developing country characterized by a low-lying and densely populated coastline—the primary focus of coastal management is on safeguarding people and their livelihoods from the impacts of cyclones and rising sea levels.
