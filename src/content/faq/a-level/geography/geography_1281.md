Youthful populations can serve as a catalyst for economic growth, but they also present challenges such as unemployment and social instability.

A youthful population, typically characterized by a high percentage of individuals aged $15$ to $24$, can have a profound effect on a developing economy. This demographic trend is often viewed as a potential economic asset, commonly referred to as the "demographic dividend." A larger working-age population can enhance productivity and foster economic growth. As more young people join the workforce, there is a corresponding potential for increased savings and investment, which can further stimulate economic development. Countries like India and Nigeria are currently experiencing this trend, with their youthful populations contributing positively to economic advancement.

However, a youthful population can also bring about significant challenges for developing economies. High numbers of youth can lead to elevated unemployment rates, particularly if the economy fails to generate sufficient job opportunities. This situation can result in social instability, as unemployed youth are often more prone to engage in anti-social behavior or political unrest. For instance, in South Africa, high youth unemployment has been associated with rising crime rates and social upheaval.

Moreover, a youthful population can exert pressure on public services, including education and healthcare. In many developing economies, these public services are already under strain, and an influx of young people can exacerbate these challenges. For example, countries such as Uganda and Kenya have seen their educational institutions and hospitals become overcrowded due to large youth populations, adversely affecting the quality of these essential services.

Additionally, the impact of a youthful population on the dependency ratio—the ratio of non-working-age individuals to those of working age—can also be significant. A high dependency ratio can burden the economy, as there are fewer workers available to support the non-working population. This scenario can lead to increased public expenditure on welfare and social services, potentially diverting resources away from economic development initiatives.

In summary, while a youthful population has the potential to drive economic growth, it also poses considerable challenges for developing economies. The effects of a youthful demographic are complex and multifaceted, necessitating careful management and strategic planning to harness the benefits while mitigating the risks.
