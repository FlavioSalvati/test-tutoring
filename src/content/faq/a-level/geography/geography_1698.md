High levels of migration can exert considerable pressure on natural resources, infrastructure, and waste management systems.

Migration, especially when it occurs in large numbers, can have profound environmental consequences. One of the most immediate effects is the heightened demand for natural resources, such as water, energy, and food, which are essential for supporting a larger population. In regions where these resources are already limited, this increased demand can lead to overexploitation and degradation of the environment.

Another critical impact is on infrastructure. Significant migration inflows often drive rapid urbanization, as individuals move to cities in search of better opportunities. This can result in unplanned and disorderly urban growth, commonly referred to as "urban sprawl." Such expansion not only consumes vast amounts of land—often leading to deforestation and a loss of biodiversity—but also places considerable strain on existing infrastructure, including transportation, sanitation, and waste management systems.

Waste management is particularly affected by high migration inflows. A larger population inevitably generates more waste. In many developing countries, where waste management systems are already insufficient, this surge in waste can exacerbate pollution problems, contributing to increased plastic waste in oceans and heightened air pollution from burning refuse.

Moreover, high migration inflows can lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The migration process typically involves transportation, which is a significant source of these emissions. Additionally, the construction of new infrastructure to accommodate the growing population further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

It is important to recognize that the environmental implications of migration are not exclusively negative. Migrants often bring innovative ideas and practices that can foster sustainable development. For example, they may introduce more efficient agricultural techniques or renewable energy technologies. Thus, while high migration inflows pose environmental challenges, they also present opportunities for innovation and sustainability.
