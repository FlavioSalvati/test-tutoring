Hard engineering along coastlines can result in habitat destruction, disruption of sediment transport, and increased coastal erosion.

Hard engineering entails the construction of physical structures to safeguard coastlines from erosion and flooding. Although these structures can effectively protect human settlements and infrastructure, they often have profound environmental consequences. One of the most significant of these consequences is habitat destruction. Coastal ecosystems, including salt marshes, mangroves, and dunes, are frequently removed to facilitate the construction of hard engineering structures. These ecosystems are crucial not only for maintaining biodiversity but also for providing natural coastal protection and playing a vital role in carbon sequestration.

Another major consequence of hard engineering is the alteration of sediment transport. Coastal areas are dynamic environments where sediment is continuously moved by waves and currents. Hard engineering structures, such as sea walls and groynes, can disrupt this natural process, leading to sediment accumulation in some areas while causing erosion in others. This disruption can result in the loss of beaches and other essential coastal features, adversely affecting marine life that depends on these habitats.

Increased coastal erosion is another potential impact of hard engineering. Although these structures are intended to protect the coastline, they can sometimes worsen erosion. For instance, sea walls can reflect wave energy, intensifying erosion at the base of the wall and on neighboring sections of the coast. This phenomenon can create a 'domino effect', prompting the need for additional hard engineering measures to protect an ever-increasing length of the coastline, thereby amplifying further environmental impacts.

Moreover, hard engineering can lead to indirect environmental consequences. For example, it may encourage increased development and human activity along the coast, placing additional pressure on coastal ecosystems. Additionally, it can alter the natural aesthetics of the coastline, which can negatively affect tourism and the local economy. Therefore, while hard engineering can offer essential protection for coastal communities, it is crucial to consider these potential environmental impacts when devising coastal defense strategies.
