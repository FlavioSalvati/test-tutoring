Sub-aerial processes play a significant role in shaping coastal landscapes through weathering, mass movement, and the effects of wind and rain.

These processes are primarily land-based and contribute to altering the form and structure of coastlines. Key components of sub-aerial processes include weathering, mass movement, and runoff, all of which profoundly influence coastal environments. For example, weathering can lead to the breakdown of coastal rocks through two main mechanisms: physical weathering, which occurs due to freeze-thaw cycles, and chemical weathering, where rainwater dissolves rock materials. Over time, these weathering processes can result in the formation of distinctive coastal features such as caves, arches, and stacks.

Mass movement is another critical sub-aerial process that significantly shapes coastal landscapes. This phenomenon involves the downward movement of material along slopes due to gravitational forces. Mass movement can manifest in various ways, from slow creep, where materials gradually shift over time, to sudden landslides, where large volumes of material collapse quickly. This process contributes to the creation of cliffs and steep coastal slopes. A notable example of this is the iconic white cliffs of Dover, which have been extensively shaped by mass movement.

Furthermore, the actions of wind and rain also have considerable impacts on coastal landscapes. Wind is capable of transporting and depositing sediment, leading to the formation of features like sand dunes. Conversely, rain can exacerbate erosion and accelerate weathering and mass movement processes. Additionally, rainfall can contribute to the development of rills and gullies on coastal slopes.

In summary, sub-aerial processes significantly influence coastal landscapes, leading to the development of a variety of coastal features and playing a crucial role in the ongoing evolution of coastlines. Understanding these processes is essential for comprehending how coastlines are shaped and transformed over time.
