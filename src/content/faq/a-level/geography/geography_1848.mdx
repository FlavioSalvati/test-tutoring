Residential segregation in urban areas is predominantly influenced by socio-economic factors, racial discrimination, and government policies.

**Socio-Economic Factors**  
Socio-economic status significantly impacts where individuals choose to live. People typically reside in neighborhoods that align with their financial means, resulting in a stark division between affluent and impoverished areas. Housing prices are generally higher in regions that offer better amenities, such as high-quality schools, parks, and shopping centers. Consequently, those who can afford these desirable locations tend to settle there, while individuals with lower incomes are relegated to less favorable neighborhoods. This economic disparity contributes to concentrated areas of poverty, further intensifying the problem of residential segregation.

**Racial Discrimination**  
Racial discrimination is another critical factor fueling residential segregation. Historically, practices such as redlining and racial covenants have systematically barred certain racial and ethnic groups from purchasing homes in specific neighborhoods. Although these discriminatory practices have been outlawed, their lingering effects continue to shape residential patterns today. For instance, racial steering—where real estate agents direct potential homebuyers towards or away from neighborhoods based on their race—remains a prevalent issue. This practice perpetuates the concentration of particular racial and ethnic groups in designated areas, reinforcing the cycle of residential segregation.

**Government Policies**  
Government policies also play a significant role in perpetuating residential segregation. Zoning laws can restrict the types of housing available in certain regions, effectively pricing out lower-income individuals and families. Moreover, the strategic placement of public housing often leads to the concentration of poverty in specific neighborhoods. Such policies can create a self-reinforcing cycle of segregation, as residents in these areas frequently face limited opportunities for upward mobility, which can result in generational poverty and sustained segregation.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, residential segregation is a multifaceted issue influenced by a combination of socio-economic factors, racial discrimination, and government policies. A thorough understanding of these elements is essential for effectively addressing and mitigating the impacts of segregation in urban environments.
