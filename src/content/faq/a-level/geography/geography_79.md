Climate change and global warming pose significant threats to coral reefs through mechanisms such as ocean acidification and rising sea temperatures.

These two phenomena are among the most critical challenges facing coral reefs globally. The Earth's rising temperatures, primarily driven by the combustion of fossil fuels, result in warmer oceans. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to even minor temperature fluctuations; a slight increase can trigger a phenomenon known as coral bleaching. This stress response occurs when corals expel the symbiotic algae that reside within their tissues, leading to a stark whitening effect. These algae are essential for the corals, providing them with a major source of nutrition. Without them, corals become more susceptible to diseases and face greater risks to their survival.

In addition to warming, oceans are experiencing increased acidification due to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) in the atmosphere. This process, known as ocean acidification, complicates the ability of corals to construct their calcium carbonate ($CaCO_3$) skeletons. Consequently, this hinders both the growth and reproductive capabilities of corals, undermining the structural integrity of the reefs.

Moreover, climate change is expected to amplify the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as cyclones and hurricanes. These events can inflict physical damage on coral reefs, breaking them apart and scattering coral fragments, which can disrupt the ecosystem.

Rising sea levels, another consequence of global warming, also present a significant threat to coral reefs. Although corals have the ability to grow and adapt to gradual increases in sea level, rapid rises may submerge reefs too deeply, depriving them of the sunlight necessary for photosynthesis.

In conclusion, climate change and global warming create an increasingly hostile environment for coral reefs. This leads to coral bleaching, impedes growth and reproduction, causes physical damage, and risks submerging reefs beyond their capacity to thrive. The survival of coral reefs, which are crucial for marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of numerous coastal communities, is at serious risk due to these changes.
