Urban heat islands (UHIs) significantly influence the structure of settlements, promoting decentralisation and the development of green spaces.

UHIs are metropolitan areas that experience notably higher temperatures compared to their rural surroundings, primarily due to human activities. The temperature disparity is often more pronounced at night and becomes especially evident during periods of weak winds. These temperature variations can profoundly affect the spatial organisation and design of urban areas.

One of the most prominent effects of UHIs on settlement structure is the tendency towards decentralisation. As urban centres become increasingly warmer due to the concentration of materials like concrete and asphalt—which absorb and re-radiate heat—residents and businesses may opt to relocate to the cooler outskirts of the city. This migration often results in a more dispersed and less dense urban form. Furthermore, policy measures aimed at addressing UHIs, such as zoning regulations that restrict development density in city centres, can further encourage decentralisation.

In addition, UHIs place a greater emphasis on the importance of green spaces in urban design. Parks, gardens, and other green areas can mitigate the effects of UHIs by providing shade and lowering surface temperatures. Consequently, cities affected by UHIs may witness an increase in both the quantity and size of these green spaces, which can significantly alter the physical layout of the urban environment. This shift often fosters a greater commitment to sustainable urban planning and design practices, such as the implementation of green roofs and walls, as well as the integration of water features that offer cooling benefits.

Moreover, UHIs can also impact the types of buildings and materials chosen for construction within settlements. For instance, there may be a heightened preference for reflective materials that reduce heat absorption, or architectural designs may evolve to enhance natural ventilation. These changes can ultimately influence the overall aesthetic and character of the urban landscape.

In conclusion, the influence of urban heat islands on the structure of settlements is complex and multifaceted, affecting everything from the spatial organisation of cities to the design of individual buildings and public spaces.
