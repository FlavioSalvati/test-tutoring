Weathering processes vary significantly among igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks due to differences in their mineral compositions and structural characteristics.

Igneous rocks, which form from the cooling of magma or lava, typically exhibit a high resistance to weathering because of their crystalline structure. Nevertheless, the rate and type of weathering can differ based on the specific igneous rock type. For example, basalt, a fine-grained igneous rock, tends to weather more rapidly than granite, a coarse-grained igneous rock. This difference is attributed to basalt's higher surface area to volume ratio. Chemical weathering is particularly significant for igneous rocks, with processes such as hydrolysis and oxidation being the most prominent.

In contrast, sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation of sediments and generally show greater susceptibility to weathering compared to igneous rocks. This increased vulnerability is largely due to their diverse mineral content, which can include minerals that are more prone to weathering. The type of weathering that occurs is largely determined by the composition of the sedimentary rock. For instance, limestone, primarily composed of calcium carbonate, is especially vulnerable to chemical weathering, particularly the dissolution process in weakly acidic rainwater.

Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types under conditions of high pressure and temperature, leading to varying degrees of weathering resistance. This resistance is influenced by both the nature of the parent rock and the extent of metamorphism. For example, marble, which is a metamorphic derivative of limestone, is similarly susceptible to chemical weathering. In contrast, other metamorphic rocks such as quartzite and gneiss demonstrate high resistance to weathering due to their robust, crystalline structures.

In conclusion, the weathering processes affecting rocks are significantly influenced by their mineral composition and structure, which are determined by their formation histories. While igneous rocks generally exhibit a high resistance to weathering, sedimentary rocks are typically more vulnerable, and metamorphic rocks display varying levels of resistance depending on their parent rock and the degree of metamorphic change they have undergone.
