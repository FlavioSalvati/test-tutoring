Plate tectonics significantly contribute to the formation of mountains through the process of crustal deformation driven by tectonic forces.

The theory of plate tectonics posits that the Earth's outer shell is divided into several rigid plates that glide over the mantle, which is the rocky layer situated above the core. These tectonic plates are constantly in motion, albeit very slowly, due to the convective currents within the underlying mantle. The interactions at the boundaries of these plates can lead to the development of various geological features, most notably mountains.

Mountain formation, referred to as orogeny, most commonly occurs at convergent plate boundaries, where two tectonic plates collide. There are primarily two types of convergent boundaries: oceanic-continental and continental-continental. 

In an oceanic-continental convergence, the denser oceanic plate subducts, or slides beneath, the less dense continental plate. This subduction process generates substantial pressure and heat, which can result in the formation of volcanic mountain ranges on the continental crust. A prime example of this is the Andes mountain range in South America.

Conversely, in a continental-continental convergence, both plates possess similar densities, preventing one plate from subducting beneath the other. Instead, they crumple and fold upwards, giving rise to towering mountain ranges. The Himalayas, which are the highest mountain range in the world, were formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates.

Another mechanism by which plate tectonics contribute to mountain formation is through the process of accretion. This occurs when fragments of crust, known as terranes, are scraped off a subducting plate and subsequently added to the edge of a continent. Over time, the accumulation of these terranes can lead to the creation of mountain ranges.

In summary, plate tectonics play an essential role in mountain formation. The movement and interaction of tectonic plates result in crustal deformation, leading to the uplift and emergence of mountains. This dynamic process is a fundamental aspect of the Earth's geology, continuously shaping the planet's diverse landscapes.
