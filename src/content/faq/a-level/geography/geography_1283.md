The decline in death rates in developing countries can be primarily attributed to several key factors: enhanced healthcare services, improved sanitation, and greater access to clean water.

One of the foremost contributors to this decline is the improvement in healthcare services. Over the past few decades, there has been a notable increase in both the availability and quality of healthcare in these regions. This enhancement includes the introduction of new medicines and vaccines, better training for healthcare professionals, and a rise in the number of healthcare facilities. For instance, the widespread implementation of vaccination programs has led to a significant reduction in fatalities from diseases such as measles and polio.

Another critical factor is the improvement in sanitation and hygiene practices. Many developing countries have made substantial progress in providing access to clean water and enhancing sanitation facilities. These improvements have directly contributed to a decrease in waterborne diseases, which were previously major contributors to mortality. For example, the establishment of clean water initiatives and the construction of sanitation infrastructure have significantly lowered the incidence of diseases like cholera and dysentery.

Additionally, advancements in technology have played an essential role in reducing death rates. The integration of modern technology into healthcare, including telemedicine and mobile health applications, has made healthcare services more accessible to individuals in remote areas. This increased accessibility has facilitated early detection and treatment of diseases, thereby contributing to lower mortality rates.

Finally, increased education and awareness regarding health and hygiene have also significantly impacted the decline in death rates. Public health campaigns have fostered a better understanding of disease prevention and treatment, leading to healthier lifestyles and improved health outcomes.

In conclusion, the reduction in death rates in developing countries is the result of a multifaceted approach that includes improved healthcare services, better sanitation, increased access to clean water, technological advancements, and heightened education and awareness.
