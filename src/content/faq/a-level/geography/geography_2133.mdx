Coastal landforms are primarily shaped by various geomorphological processes, including erosion, deposition, weathering, and transportation.

Erosion is a fundamental process that contributes significantly to the formation of coastal landforms. It involves the gradual wearing away of land by the action of the sea. There are four main types of erosion: 

1. **Hydraulic Action**: This occurs when the force of waves crashes against the coastline, exerting pressure on the rocks.
2. **Abrasion**: This refers to the process where pebbles and other materials grind against the coastline, functioning similarly to sandpaper.
3. **Attrition**: In this process, waves cause rocks and pebbles to collide with one another, breaking them down into smaller fragments.
4. **Corrosion**: This involves the chemical dissolution of rock by seawater.

Over time, these erosional processes lead to the formation of various coastal features, such as cliffs, wave-cut platforms, caves, arches, and stacks.

Deposition is another critical process that occurs when the energy of the sea decreases, causing it to drop the materials it has been transporting. This phenomenon typically happens in regions where the water is shallow or where the coastline changes direction. Deposition can result in the creation of features such as beaches, spits, and bars. The size and shape of these depositional features can evolve over time, influenced by factors such as the volume of available material and the direction of prevailing winds.

Weathering also contributes to the transformation of coastal landforms. This process entails the breakdown of rock in its original location, or in situ. There are three primary types of weathering: 

1. **Physical Weathering**: This occurs due to temperature fluctuations that cause the rock to crack.
2. **Chemical Weathering**: This involves the dissolution of rock by rainwater and seawater.
3. **Biological Weathering**: In this type, plants and animals contribute to the breakdown of the rock.

Weathering can lead to the development of features such as wave-cut notches and contributes to the retreat of cliffs.

Lastly, transportation refers to the movement of materials along the coastline. This process can occur through mechanisms such as longshore drift, which describes the zigzag movement of sediment along the shore, and offshore drift, where materials are moved away from the coastline. These transportation processes play a significant role in redistributing materials along the coast, thereby shaping and reshaping features like spits and bars.

In summary, the geomorphological processes of erosion, deposition, weathering, and transportation are all integral to the formation of coastal landforms. These processes are interconnected and can influence each other, creating a dynamic and ever-changing coastline.
