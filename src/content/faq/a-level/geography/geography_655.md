An anastomosed channel is distinct from other river channel types due to its characteristic structure, which consists of multiple active channels separated by stable islands.

Anastomosed channels represent a unique river morphology characterized by a network of several active channels divided by stable islands or bars. These islands are typically formed from cohesive materials, such as clay or silt, which exhibit resistance to erosion. This contrasts with other river channel types, such as braided channels, where multiple channels are interspersed with temporary islands that are easily eroded and frequently shift locations.

The formation of anastomosed channels is commonly associated with low-gradient rivers that carry a high sediment load. This significant sediment load leads to the deposition of material on the riverbed, gradually creating stable islands. Over time, these islands cause the river to bifurcate into multiple channels, resulting in the distinctive anastomosed pattern. The stability of these islands is further enhanced by vegetation, which binds the sediment and mitigates erosion.

Although anastomosed channels are relatively rare compared to other river types, they can be found in various regions across the globe, including North America, Europe, and Asia. They typically occur in specific environmental contexts, such as areas with a high clay content in the soil or regions characterized by low gradients and substantial sediment loads.

From a hydrological perspective, anastomosed channels tend to exhibit a more stable flow regime compared to other channel types. The presence of multiple channels and stable islands helps to distribute water flow more evenly, thereby reducing the risks of flooding and erosion. However, the complexity of managing these systems can be challenging due to the multitude of channels and the necessity of preserving the stability of the islands.
