Sustainable urban growth strategies encompass efficient land use, green infrastructure, renewable energy, and sustainable transport systems. 

Efficient land use is a fundamental component of sustainable urban growth. This strategy involves meticulous planning and management of urban spaces to ensure their utilization is both effective and sustainable. For example, mixed-use development—where residential, commercial, and public spaces are integrated in close proximity—can significantly reduce the necessity for long-distance travel while enhancing walkability. Furthermore, urban densification, which entails increasing the population density in established urban areas, can help curb urban sprawl and prevent the overexploitation of natural resources.

Another critical strategy is the implementation of green infrastructure. This concept involves the establishment and maintenance of green spaces within urban environments, including parks, gardens, and green roofs. These green areas not only enhance residents' quality of life but also yield substantial environmental benefits. They contribute to the reduction of air pollution, help mitigate climate change effects, and support biodiversity. Additionally, green infrastructure plays a crucial role in stormwater management, lessening the risk of flooding.

The adoption of renewable energy sources is also vital for sustainable urban growth. Cities can invest in technologies such as solar and wind energy to diminish their dependence on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This effort can be further supported by energy-efficient building designs and the encouragement of energy-saving practices among residents.

Lastly, sustainable transport systems are essential for minimizing the environmental impact of urban expansion. This includes promoting public transportation, cycling, and walking, as well as investing in electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure. Moreover, developing compact, walkable neighborhoods can significantly reduce the need for car travel, fostering a more sustainable urban environment.
