Headlands and bays are prominent features of coastal landscapes, formed through the process of differential erosion along coastlines characterized by varying rock types.

Differential erosion occurs when softer rocks erode more quickly than harder rocks. Typically, these softer rocks are composed of materials like sand and clay, which are more vulnerable to the forces of erosion caused by waves, wind, and weather. Over time, as the softer rocks wear away, they create an indentation in the coastline known as a bay.

In contrast, harder rocks such as granite or basalt exhibit greater resistance to erosion. As the surrounding softer rocks erode, these resilient formations remain intact, resulting in areas of land that project into the sea, referred to as headlands. Headlands are often characterized by steep cliffs and rugged shores, standing out prominently against the coastline.

The formation of headlands and bays is also influenced by the angle at which waves approach the shore. Waves typically strike the coastline at an angle, concentrating their energy on the headlands. This phenomenon, known as wave refraction, enhances the erosion of the headlands while encouraging deposition in the bays. Over time, this process can lead to the development of additional coastal features, such as caves, arches, and stacks on the headlands, as well as sandy beaches within the bays.

In conclusion, the dynamic formation of headlands and bays results from the interplay between different rock types, the erosive power of waves, and the direction of wave approach. This intricate process shapes our coastlines, creating a diverse and beautiful array of landscapes.
