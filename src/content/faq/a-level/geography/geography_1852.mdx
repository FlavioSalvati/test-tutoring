Shanty towns, often referred to as slums or informal settlements, are predominantly located in developing countries. They are characterized by a significant lack of formal infrastructure and essential services. The economic activities within these communities are predominantly informal, meaning they operate outside government regulation and generally do not comply with standard labor laws or health and safety regulations.

One of the most prevalent economic activities in shanty towns is petty trading. This encompasses the sale of food, clothing, and various other goods, typically from small stalls or directly from residents' homes. Traders in these areas often procure their merchandise from larger markets or wholesalers, creating a crucial source of income for their families. However, earnings from petty trading tend to be unstable and can be influenced by several factors, including weather conditions, competition, and fluctuations in supply and demand.

Another common economic activity in shanty towns is casual labor. This includes various forms of manual work, such as construction and domestic tasks. Casual laborers are usually compensated on a daily or per-task basis, leading to considerable unpredictability in their income. They often face a lack of job security and do not receive benefits like sick pay or pensions, making them particularly vulnerable to economic downturns.

Recycling waste also plays a significant role in the economy of shanty towns. Residents often collect discarded materials, such as plastic, metal, and paper, which they sort and sell to recycling companies. This not only provides a source of income but also contributes to waste management in areas where formal waste collection services are inadequate.

In summary, the economic activities in shanty towns are diverse and multifaceted, reflecting the unique challenges and opportunities faced by residents in these informal settlements. Despite the hardships, these activities are vital for the livelihoods of many and play an important role in the broader economy.
