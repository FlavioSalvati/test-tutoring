Changes in mortality rates have a direct impact on population growth, with lower mortality rates generally leading to an increase in population size.

The mortality rate, often referred to as the death rate, is a critical determinant of population growth. It represents the number of deaths occurring within a specific population, typically expressed per 1,000 or 100,000 individuals annually. When mortality rates decrease, a greater number of individuals survive to reach reproductive age, which can result in a rise in births and, consequently, population growth. Conversely, an increase in mortality rates means that fewer individuals survive to reproductive age, which may lead to a decline in births and a slowdown in population growth.

However, the relationship between mortality rates and population growth is not always linear. For example, a decline in mortality rates resulting from advancements in healthcare can initially trigger rapid population growth. Yet, as life expectancy increases, individuals may opt to have fewer children, ultimately slowing population growth. This phenomenon is encapsulated in the demographic transition model, a theoretical framework that describes how countries evolve from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates.

Furthermore, changes in mortality rates can significantly alter the age structure of a population. A reduction in mortality rates, particularly among infants and children, tends to result in a younger population. In contrast, if mortality rates decrease more significantly among older individuals, the overall population may age. These shifts can have profound implications for a country's economy and social structure; a younger population often necessitates greater investments in education and job creation, whereas an older population may require enhanced healthcare and social security services.

In summary, fluctuations in mortality rates can profoundly influence population growth by affecting the number of individuals who survive to reproductive age and their subsequent reproductive choices. These changes can also transform the age structure of a population, leading to significant repercussions for a nation's economy and social systems.
