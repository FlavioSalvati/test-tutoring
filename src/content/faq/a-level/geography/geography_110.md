The primary causes of earthquakes stem from tectonic forces that arise from the movement of the Earth's crustal plates.

Earthquakes are natural phenomena that occur when there is a sudden release of energy within the Earth's lithosphere. This release generates seismic waves, which cause the ground to shakeâ€”an event we recognize as an earthquake. The principal driver behind these seismic events is tectonic activity, specifically the movement and interaction of the Earth's crustal plates.

The Earth's crust is divided into several large and small segments known as tectonic plates. These plates are in constant motion, albeit very slowly, due to convection currents in the underlying semi-fluid asthenosphere. The boundaries where these plates meet are often sites of intense geological activity, including earthquakes.

There are three main types of plate boundaries: convergent, divergent, and transform. 

1. **Convergent boundaries** occur when two plates move towards each other. In many cases, one plate is forced beneath the other in a process known as subduction, which can lead to powerful earthquakes and volcanic activity.

2. **Divergent boundaries** form where two plates move apart, creating a gap that allows magma to rise and form new crust. Although this process can also generate earthquakes, they are typically less powerful than those that occur at convergent boundaries.

3. **Transform boundaries** occur when two plates slide past each other horizontally. The friction between these plates can cause them to become locked together, and when they finally slip, it can result in an earthquake.

In addition to tectonic activity, human activities can also induce earthquakes. Examples include mining operations, reservoir-induced seismicity (which arises from the filling of large reservoirs behind dams), and the injection or extraction of fluids from the Earth's crust. However, these anthropogenic factors are secondary causes; the majority of earthquakes result from natural tectonic processes.
