Albedo varies significantly among different surfaces based on their color, texture, and moisture content.

Derived from the Latin term meaning "whiteness," albedo is a measure of a surface's reflectivity. It is quantified as a percentage, where $0\%$ denotes a perfectly black surface that absorbs all incoming light, and $100\%$ signifies a perfectly white surface that reflects all incoming light. The albedo of various surfaces on Earth differs due to their distinct characteristics.

The color of a surface plays a crucial role in determining its albedo. Lighter-colored surfaces, such as snow and ice, exhibit high albedos because they reflect a significant portion of the sunlight that strikes them. For example, fresh snow can have an albedo as high as $90\%$. Conversely, darker surfaces, such as forests and oceans, absorb more sunlight and consequently have lower albedos. The albedo of the ocean, for instance, is only about $6\%$.

Texture also impacts a surface's albedo. Rough surfaces tend to scatter light in multiple directions, which can lead to an increased albedo. In contrast, smooth surfaces reflect light in a more concentrated manner, often resulting in a lower albedo. For instance, a calm ocean surface usually has a lower albedo than a rough, choppy one.

Moisture content is another significant factor that influences albedo. Wet surfaces generally exhibit lower albedos compared to dry ones, as water tends to absorb more sunlight. This is why a wet road appears darker than its dry counterpart. However, when a surface is covered with a layer of water, it can become more reflective, resulting in an increased albedo.

In summary, albedo varies across different surfaces due to factors such as color, texture, and moisture content. Understanding these variations is essential for studying Earth's climate system, as changes in surface albedo can significantly affect global temperatures and weather patterns.
