Coral bleaching poses a substantial threat to marine biodiversity by damaging the habitats and food sources essential for many marine species.

Coral reefs are often dubbed the "rainforests of the sea" due to their exceptional biodiversity. They serve as crucial habitats, breeding grounds, and food sources for a wide variety of marine life, including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and numerous other organisms. When coral bleaching occurs, these essential functions are compromised, resulting in a notable decline in marine biodiversity.

The primary driver of coral bleaching is the increase in sea temperatures, a direct consequence of global warming. When water temperatures rise beyond a certain threshold, corals expel the symbiotic algae known as zooxanthellae that reside within their tissues. This process leads to the corals turning completely white, hence the term "bleaching." These algae are vital, providing up to $90\%$ of the energy that corals require to thrive. Without this energy source, corals begin to starve and ultimately face mortality.

The loss of coral reefs triggers a domino effect throughout the marine ecosystem. Fish species that rely on coral for nourishment and shelter are forced to relocate or face extinction, leading to significant declines in their populations. This decline, in turn, impacts larger predators that depend on these fish for sustenance, creating a ripple effect throughout the food web. Furthermore, many species that are endemic to coral reef ecosystems face the risk of extinction if their habitats are destroyed.

Moreover, coral bleaching has repercussions for human communities that depend on healthy reefs for their livelihoods. A considerable number of people rely on the fish and other marine organisms inhabiting coral reefs as their primary source of protein. Additionally, thriving coral reefs attract tourists, serving as a vital source of income for local economies.

In summary, coral bleaching represents a significant threat to marine biodiversity. It disrupts the fragile balance of coral reef ecosystems, leading to declines in species populations and the potential extinction of organisms unique to these habitats. Furthermore, it has profound socio-economic consequences for human communities that depend on the health of coral reefs for their survival.
