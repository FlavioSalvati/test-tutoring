Maintaining coastal biodiversity through management presents challenges such as habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and overfishing.

One of the primary challenges in maintaining coastal biodiversity is habitat destruction. Coastal areas are often densely populated, leading to the destruction of habitats through urbanisation, agriculture, and industrial activities. This not only reduces the available space for wildlife but also disrupts ecosystems, leading to a loss of biodiversity. For example, the construction of sea walls and other coastal defences can destroy habitats for birds and marine life.

Pollution is another significant challenge. Industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and plastic waste can all have devastating effects on coastal ecosystems. These pollutants can harm or kill wildlife, disrupt food chains, and lead to a decrease in biodiversity. Oil spills, in particular, can have long-term effects on marine and bird populations.

Climate change poses a significant threat to coastal biodiversity. Rising sea levels can lead to the loss of coastal habitats, while increasing temperatures can disrupt the life cycles of many species. Ocean acidification, a result of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, can harm shellfish and other marine organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for their shells and skeletons.

Overfishing is another major issue. Overfishing can lead to a decrease in fish populations, disrupting the balance of marine ecosystems and leading to a loss of biodiversity. This is particularly problematic in areas where fishing is a major industry and regulations are not strictly enforced.

Invasive species also pose a threat to coastal biodiversity. These species can outcompete native species for resources, leading to a decrease in biodiversity. This is often exacerbated by human activities, such as the release of non-native species through shipping.

Overall, maintaining coastal biodiversity through management is a complex task that requires addressing a range of environmental and human-induced challenges.
