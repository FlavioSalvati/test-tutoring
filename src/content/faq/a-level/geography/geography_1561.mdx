Family reunification plays a crucial role in urban-urban migration, serving as a powerful pull factor that encourages individuals to relocate.

Urban-urban migration refers to the movement of people from one urban area to another, often motivated by the desire to be closer to family members who have previously migrated. The presence of family in a specific urban location can provide a vital support network, making the transition smoother and more appealing. This is especially true for individuals who are leaving behind familiar environments and social connections.

The impact of family reunification on urban-urban migration is evident in the internal migration patterns observed within countries. For instance, in the UK, there is a notable amount of internal migration between cities, frequently driven by the wish to join family members who have already established themselves in certain areas. This trend is particularly prevalent among immigrant communities, where the initial wave of migrants often facilitates the arrival of subsequent family members.

Additionally, family reunification can influence the choice of destination during urban migration. Cities that have a high concentration of a specific ethnic or cultural group tend to attract further migration, as newcomers can benefit from the existing networks and support systems provided by their family and community. This phenomenon can lead to the formation of ethnic enclaves within cities, thereby enriching the multicultural landscape of urban areas.

However, it is essential to recognize that while family reunification serves as a significant pull factor, it is often intertwined with other influences such as employment opportunities, educational prospects, and lifestyle preferences. Consequently, although family reunification greatly shapes patterns of urban-urban migration, it represents only one component of a complex array of factors.
