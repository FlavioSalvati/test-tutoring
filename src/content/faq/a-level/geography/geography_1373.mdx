Overpopulation can significantly strain a region's carrying capacity, resulting in resource depletion, environmental degradation, and potential social unrest.

Carrying capacity is defined as the maximum number of individuals that an environment can sustainably support without degrading its natural resource base. Overpopulation occurs when the population surpasses this carrying capacity, leading to a variety of negative consequences.

Firstly, overpopulation can result in resource depletion. As the population increases, the demand for essential resources—such as food, water, and energy—also rises. This heightened demand can lead to the over-extraction and unsustainable use of these resources, causing them to diminish. For instance, overpopulation can lead to overfishing, which depletes fish stocks and disrupts marine ecosystems. Similarly, an increased demand for water can result in the over-extraction of groundwater, ultimately causing water scarcity.

Secondly, overpopulation contributes to environmental degradation. The growing demand for resources often leads to unsustainable practices, such as deforestation, overgrazing, and pollution. These activities can severely degrade the environment, diminishing its capacity to support life. For example, deforestation can lead to soil erosion and a loss of biodiversity, while pollution can contaminate water sources and degrade air quality.

Lastly, overpopulation can incite social unrest. As resources become scarce, competition for these necessities can heighten, leading to conflicts. This is particularly concerning in regions where resources are already limited or unevenly distributed. Additionally, overpopulation can place immense pressure on public services—such as healthcare and education—resulting in a decreased quality of life.

In conclusion, overpopulation has far-reaching impacts on a region's carrying capacity. It can lead to resource depletion, environmental degradation, and social unrest. Therefore, managing population growth is essential for maintaining the carrying capacity of a region and promoting sustainable development.
