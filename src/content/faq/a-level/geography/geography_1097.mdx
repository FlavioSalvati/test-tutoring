Human activity significantly accelerates weathering processes through various practices such as deforestation, mining, construction, and pollution.

The impact of human activities on natural weathering is profound, with deforestation being one of the most notable contributors. When trees are removed, the soil becomes directly exposed to environmental elements, which increases the rate of physical weathering as it becomes more vulnerable to wind and rain erosion. Furthermore, the absence of vegetation can enhance the rate of chemical weathering. This occurs because plants and trees absorb carbon dioxide, a critical factor in chemical weathering, from the atmosphere. When these plants are removed, carbon dioxide levels can rise, thereby accelerating the weathering process.

Mining and construction activities also play a significant role in hastening weathering. These processes often involve the removal or disruption of the Earth's surface, exposing fresh rock and soil to natural elements. Such exposure can increase both physical and chemical weathering rates. For instance, when pyrite, a common mineral found in rocks, is exposed to air and water during mining, it can lead to the formation of sulfuric acid, a phenomenon known as acid mine drainage. This acid further contributes to the weathering of surrounding rocks.

Pollution, especially air pollution, is another human-induced factor that affects weathering. Certain pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can react with atmospheric moisture to form acids. This acid rain can then fall to the Earth's surface, where it chemically weathers rocks. The effects of acid rain can be especially damaging to buildings, monuments, and natural rock formations.

In summary, human activities have a significant and often accelerating effect on natural weathering processes. This acceleration can lead to various environmental consequences, including soil erosion and the degradation of both man-made structures and natural landscapes.
