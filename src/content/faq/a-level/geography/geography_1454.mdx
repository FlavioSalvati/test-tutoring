**Step Migration: An Overview**

Step migration is the process by which individuals or groups move towards their final destination through a series of smaller, incremental relocations. This pattern is prevalent in human migration and is often influenced by various economic, social, and environmental factors.

In step migration, rather than making a direct move from their point of origin to their ultimate destination, migrants typically undertake a sequence of smaller moves. This phenomenon is frequently observed in rural-to-urban migration, where individuals or families might first relocate to a nearby town or city before gradually transitioning to larger metropolitan areas.

The underlying principle of step migration is that migrants are generally attracted to locations that promise enhanced opportunities for employment, education, or an improved standard of living. However, the decision to migrate is shaped by multiple factors, including the distance to the intended destination, the costs associated with moving, and the perceived risks and benefits of the migration process. Consequently, many individuals opt to migrate in stages, inching closer to their final destination as they adapt to new surroundings and gather necessary resources.

For instance, consider a farmer from a rural region who initially relocates to a nearby town in search of better job prospects. After gaining experience and saving sufficient funds, this individual might then move to a larger city, ultimately progressing to a major urban center. Each of these relocations represents a step in the migration journey, with each step bringing the migrant closer to their desired destination.

Social networks and familial connections also play a significant role in step migration. Migrants often choose to move to areas where they have relatives or friends, who can offer support and assistance during their transition. Over time, these social networks can expand, facilitating further moves to more distant locations.

In conclusion, step migration is a multifaceted process characterized by a series of smaller, incremental relocations. It is driven by various factors, including economic opportunities, social networks, and the perceived risks and rewards associated with migration.
