The supply of sediment plays a crucial role in shaping coastal landforms, influencing their formation, size, and overall characteristics.

Sediment supply is essential for the development of various coastal features, serving as the primary material that contributes to their formation and evolution. The quantity and type of sediment available directly impact the size, shape, and even the existence of specific landforms.

Coastal landforms, such as beaches, dunes, and spits, are primarily created through the deposition of sediment. For example, a beach is formed when waves deposit sediment along the shoreline. The dimensions of the beach are contingent upon the volume of sediment supplied; a higher sediment supply results in a wider and longer beach, while a lower sediment supply leads to a narrower and shorter beach. Similarly, dunes and spits are shaped by wind and wave action, respectively, which transport and deposit sediment. The size and shape of these landforms are likewise determined by the availability of sediment.

The characteristics of the sediment itself also significantly influence the development of coastal landforms. Different types of sediment possess varying properties, such as size, weight, and composition, which affect their transport and deposition. For instance, larger and heavier sediments, like pebbles and cobbles, are less likely to be carried over long distances by waves and wind compared to smaller and lighter sediments, such as sand and silt. Consequently, regions abundant in larger sediments may develop distinct coastal landforms compared to areas with a predominance of smaller sediments.

Moreover, sediment supply can affect the rate of coastal erosion, which is another critical process in shaping coastal landforms. Areas with a high supply of sediment can act as buffers against wave action, thereby protecting the coastline from erosion. Conversely, regions with a low sediment supply are more susceptible to erosion, potentially leading to the formation of cliffs and other erosional features.

In summary, sediment supply is a fundamental factor influencing the development of coastal landforms. It affects their formation, size, shape, and even the rate of erosion, highlighting its importance in coastal geomorphology.
