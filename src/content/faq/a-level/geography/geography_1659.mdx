International migration plays a crucial role in shaping global labor markets by influencing wage levels, employment rates, and overall economic growth.

The impact of international migration on labor markets is profound, primarily due to the redistribution of labor across countries. When individuals migrate, they change the supply of labor in both their home (source) country and the host (destination) country. In the source country, the departure of workers can create labor shortages, which may lead to increased wages and stimulate investment in labor-saving technologies. Conversely, in the destination country, an influx of migrants often results in a higher supply of labor, which can drive down wages, especially if the new arrivals are willing to accept lower compensation than the existing workforce.

Additionally, international migration affects the skill composition of labor markets. Highly skilled migrants can fill crucial gaps in the labor market, thereby contributing to economic growth and innovation in the destination country. Conversely, the emigration of highly skilled individuals—a phenomenon often referred to as "brain drain"—can deprive the source country of essential human capital, potentially impeding its economic development. However, the remittances that migrants send back home can help alleviate some of these negative effects by providing a vital source of income and foreign exchange.

International migration also impacts employment rates. In destination countries, migrants often help mitigate labor shortages in critical sectors such as healthcare and agriculture, which can contribute to lower unemployment rates. However, if the labor market cannot accommodate the incoming workers, it may result in increased job competition and potentially higher unemployment rates. In source countries, while the emigration of workers can lead to lower unemployment, it may also create labor shortages in specific sectors.

Finally, international migration can influence demographic trends, which subsequently affect labor markets. For example, migration can help counterbalance the aging population in many developed countries, ensuring a consistent supply of workers to support economic growth. Conversely, it can exacerbate demographic imbalances in source countries, particularly if it involves the emigration of young, working-age individuals.
