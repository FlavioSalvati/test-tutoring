The global distribution of atmospheric hazards is significantly influenced by several factors, including geographical location, climate, topography, and human activities.

Geographical location is a key determinant in the prevalence of atmospheric hazards. For example, tropical cyclones are most frequently observed in regions located between $5^\circ$ and $20^\circ$ north and south of the equator, where the warm sea surface temperatures provide the necessary energy for their formation. Similarly, tornadoes are predominantly found in the central United States, where the interaction between warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from Canada creates ideal conditions for their development.

Climate is another critical factor impacting the distribution of atmospheric hazards. Regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, are particularly susceptible to wildfires. In contrast, areas with a tropical climate often experience heavy rainfall and flooding, particularly during the monsoon season. Furthermore, climate change is reshaping the landscape of atmospheric hazards, leading to an increase in extreme weather events such as heatwaves and intense rainfall in many regions around the globe.

Topography, which refers to the physical features of a landscape, also plays a significant role in determining the distribution of atmospheric hazards. For instance, mountainous areas are more vulnerable to avalanches and landslides, while low-lying coastal regions face risks from storm surges and tsunamis. The configuration and orientation of coastlines can further influence the effects of tropical cyclones, with concave coastlines amplifying the severity of storm surges.

Finally, human activities have a considerable impact on the distribution of atmospheric hazards. Urbanization can heighten the risk of flooding by reducing the amount of permeable land available for water absorption. Deforestation can increase the likelihood of landslides by eliminating the vegetation that stabilizes slopes. Conversely, proactive measures such as the construction of sea walls and levees can help mitigate the impact of atmospheric hazards in certain areas.
