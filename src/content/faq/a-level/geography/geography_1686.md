Climate change has a profound impact on international migration, primarily by worsening environmental conditions, which can result in displacement and forced migration.

As a global issue, climate change presents numerous challenges, one of which is its effect on migration patterns. It intensifies environmental problems such as droughts, floods, and storms, rendering certain regions uninhabitable. This situation often forces individuals to relocate, a phenomenon commonly referred to as 'climate migration' or 'environmental migration.'

For example, the rise in sea levels caused by global warming can lead to the flooding of low-lying islands and coastal areas, displacing their inhabitants. Similarly, the increasing frequency and intensity of droughts may result in the desertification of agricultural lands, making them unsuitable for farming. Consequently, this can drive rural-urban migration, where farmers seek alternative livelihoods in cities. In extreme scenarios, when environmental conditions become intolerable, individuals may be compelled to migrate to other countries.

Furthermore, climate change can indirectly affect international migration by exacerbating socio-economic inequalities. Vulnerable and marginalized communities are often the most affected by the impacts of climate change, as they typically lack the resources necessary to adapt. This can lead to heightened poverty and social instability, prompting migration as individuals seek better economic opportunities and a sense of security.

Additionally, climate change can incite conflicts over resources, particularly in areas where such resources are limited. For instance, water scarcity resulting from climate change can lead to tensions between communities or nations, ultimately forcing individuals to migrate.

In summary, climate change significantly influences international migration by causing displacement and forced migration through the deterioration of environmental conditions. It also has indirect effects by intensifying socio-economic disparities and inciting resource-related conflicts.
