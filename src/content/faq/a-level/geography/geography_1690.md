The main drivers of increased international migration include economic opportunities, political instability, and environmental factors.

Economic opportunities are a significant catalyst for international migration. Individuals frequently relocate from less developed countries to more developed ones in search of better employment prospects and improved living conditions. This phenomenon is commonly known as economic migration. For example, many individuals from Eastern Europe migrate to Western Europe seeking enhanced job opportunities. Similarly, people from developing regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America often move to North America, Europe, and the Gulf countries in pursuit of better economic prospects.

Political instability and conflict are also major contributors to international migration. Many individuals flee their home countries due to war, persecution, or political turmoil, seeking safety and security elsewhere. This form of migration is typically referred to as forced migration or refugee movement. For instance, the ongoing conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and South Sudan have resulted in substantial international migration.

Environmental factors further exacerbate the trend of international migration. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and droughts can compel individuals to leave their homes and relocate to other countries. This type of migration is often termed environmental migration or climate migration. For instance, the increasing frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Pacific Islands have prompted heightened migration from these islands to other nations.

Additionally, globalization has significantly influenced the rise in international migration. Advances in technology and transportation have simplified cross-border movement, leading to a surge in individuals migrating for education, family reunification, and various personal reasons.

In summary, the primary causes of increased international migration are economic opportunities, political instability, environmental factors, and globalization. Each of these elements can independently or collectively influence individuals' decisions to migrate.
