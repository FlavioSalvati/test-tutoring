Erosional coastal landforms are distinguished by their unique features, which include cliffs, wave-cut platforms, caves, arches, stacks, and stumps.

These landforms are primarily sculpted by the powerful forces of the sea, coupled with the processes of weathering and erosion. Together, these processes create a diverse array of striking geological features. One of the most prevalent erosional landforms is the cliff. Cliffs are characterized by their steep, vertical rock faces, which are formed through the relentless action of waves at the base of the land. The continuous battering of waves against the cliff's base leads to undercutting, which ultimately results in the collapse of the upper section and the gradual retreat of the coastline.

Another significant feature is the wave-cut platform. These platforms are flat or gently sloping rocky surfaces that extend from the base of a cliff into the sea. They are formed as a result of cliff retreat due to erosion, leaving behind a platform that was once at the cliff's base. Over time, this platform becomes smooth as it is shaped by the ongoing action of waves and tides.

Caves, arches, stacks, and stumps represent a sequence of features that develop through the erosion of headlands. Caves form when waves exploit natural weaknesses in the rock, such as joints or faults, gradually eroding the rock to create a hollow space. If a cave is eroded all the way through a headland, it results in the formation of an arch. Eventually, as the roof of the arch collapses under its own weight and the continued forces of erosion, it leaves behind a stackâ€”a pillar of rock that stands isolated in the sea. Further erosion and weathering can eventually reduce this stack to a stump, which may only be visible during low tide.

These features serve as clear evidence of the dynamic nature of coastlines, which are continuously molded and reshaped by natural forces. Understanding these landforms and the processes that create them is essential for effective management and protection of our coastal environments.
