Tropical regions are distinguished by their consistently high temperatures, elevated humidity levels, and substantial rainfall throughout the entire year.

Located between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, tropical regions experience average temperatures that typically exceed $18^\circ$ Celsius year-round, with minimal variation between seasons. This phenomenon is attributed to the sun's rays striking the Earth's surface at nearly perpendicular angles in these areas, resulting in intense solar radiation.

Humidity is another key feature of tropical climates. The high temperatures facilitate rapid evaporation, leading to elevated moisture levels in the atmosphere. This high humidity often exacerbates the perceived intensity of the heat and can contribute to the formation of thunderstorms.

Rainfall in tropical regions is generally abundant and occurs consistently throughout the year. The intense heat causes air to rise and cool, leading to condensation and the formation of clouds, which results in frequent and heavy precipitation. Annual rainfall in these areas often exceeds $1500 \, \text{mm}$, with some regions receiving over $2500 \, \text{mm}$. Rainfall events are typically intense but short-lived, frequently occurring in the late afternoon or evening.

Tropical regions also experience distinct wet and dry seasons, in contrast to the four traditional seasons found in temperate climates. The wet season, often referred to as the monsoon season, is characterized by heavy, daily rainfall, while the dry season experiences significantly reduced precipitation levels. These seasonal patterns are largely influenced by the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a region where the trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge, causing air to rise and form rain clouds.

In summary, tropical regions are marked by high temperatures, elevated humidity, and significant rainfall throughout the year. These climatic conditions profoundly influence the diverse flora and fauna of these areas, as well as human activities and settlements.
