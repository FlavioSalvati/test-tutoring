Soils in humid tropical ecosystems are typically characterized by their considerable depth, excellent drainage, and extensive weathering, which results in low nutrient content.

More specifically, these soils—commonly known as Oxisols or Ultisols—exhibit a significant degree of weathering due to the abundant rainfall and high temperatures typical of humid tropical environments. These conditions facilitate the leaching of essential nutrients from the soil through a process known as eluviation. Consequently, the soil profile features a heavily leached A horizon (topsoil) and a B horizon (subsoil) that is rich in iron and aluminum oxides, imparting a reddish or yellowish hue to the soil.

Despite the heightened biological activity and rapid decomposition of organic matter in these ecosystems, the soil often remains low in essential nutrients. This occurs because nutrients are quickly absorbed by plants or washed away by intense rainfall. Furthermore, the nutrients that persist are frequently bound tightly to soil particles, rendering them unavailable to plants. To cope with this nutrient scarcity, many tropical plants have developed specific adaptations, such as buttress roots and mycorrhizal associations, to extract these hard-to-reach nutrients.

Additionally, soils in humid tropical ecosystems are generally well-drained, thanks to their coarse texture and deep profiles. This drainage is advantageous, as it helps prevent waterlogging—an issue that can arise due to the region's substantial rainfall. However, this drainage also accelerates the leaching process, contributing to nutrient depletion.

Regarding pH levels, these soils can vary significantly, ranging from highly acidic to slightly alkaline, depending on the parent material and the extent of leaching. However, they tend to be predominantly acidic due to the leaching of base cations and the accumulation of iron and aluminum oxides.

In summary, the soils found in humid tropical ecosystems are shaped by their environmental conditions, influenced by high temperatures, abundant rainfall, and vibrant biological activity that define these regions.
