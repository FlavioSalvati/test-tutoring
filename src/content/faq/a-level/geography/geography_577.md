Temperature variations have a substantial impact on the discharges of drainage basins by affecting both evaporation rates and the forms of precipitation.

Temperature is a critical factor in the hydrological cycle, influencing the discharge of a drainage basin in several ways. One of the primary mechanisms by which temperature affects discharge is through its influence on evaporation rates. As temperatures rise, the rate of evaporation from water bodies and land surfaces within the drainage basin increases. This heightened evaporation reduces the volume of water available for runoff, which consequently diminishes the overall discharge of the basin.

On the other hand, cooler temperatures lead to lower evaporation rates, allowing more water to remain within the system. This can potentially increase discharge, although this effect is also influenced by other factors such as rainfall amounts and soil permeability within the basin.

Additionally, temperature plays a key role in determining the type of precipitation that occursâ€”whether it falls as rain, sleet, or snow. In colder conditions, precipitation is more likely to manifest as snow. While snowfall temporarily reduces immediate discharge by storing water in the form of snow, this water is eventually released when temperatures rise, causing the snow to melt. This melting can lead to a delayed increase in discharge during warmer months, a phenomenon frequently observed in colder climates with seasonal snowfall.

Conversely, in warmer conditions, precipitation typically occurs as rain, which can rapidly increase discharge, particularly during intense rainfall events. Such sudden influxes of water can overwhelm drainage basins, leading to flash flooding if the basin is unable to manage the volume.

In conclusion, temperature variations significantly influence the discharge of drainage basins by altering evaporation rates and the type of precipitation. Understanding these dynamics is essential for effectively predicting and managing water resources, especially in light of climate change, which is anticipated to bring about more frequent and severe temperature fluctuations.
